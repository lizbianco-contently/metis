Mr. President, last week the Government's misguided and \ncollusive antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation recessed for \na much-needed break. It only could be improved by making the recess \npermanent.\n  I urge my colleagues to make use of the trial's recess to learn about \nthis case, and this industry. Nothing less is at stake here than the \nfreedom to innovate, the key to America's economic success. We ignore \nthis prosecution at our peril, because the United States Government is \ntrying to kill the goose that lays golden eggs in the home states of \nevery one of my esteemed colleagues. It is not simply a Washington-\nstate company that needs shoring up; it is the industry leader that has \nfueled our recent unprecedented economic miracle, created hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs to fill those being lost in other sectors of the \neconomy, established America as the global leader in high technology \nand redefined almost every aspect of our lives--and yet is under siege \nby a hopelessly time-locked Department of Justice, whose theory of \nantitrust was shaped in the 60s, when big business was bad, big \ngovernment good, and facts never got in the way of a nice regulatory \nscheme.\n  Microsoft is not the only target of this Administration. Intel too is \nunder attack by a gaggle of anti-free market attorneys at the Federal \nTrade Commission. The FTC says Intel uses its market power to stifle \ncompetition in the lucrative chip market. Given recent reports that in \nJanuary, more computers were sold with chips made by one of Intel's \nlargest competitors, AMD, than with Intel chips, the FTC's case seems \nfar behind the times. But Robert Pitofsky and his cohorts press on \nregardless of real and dynamic markets.\n  Holman Jenkins summed up the absurdity of the Administration's \nactions eloquently in an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street \nJournal yesterday:\n\n       If Joel Klein, Robert Pitofsky and all their little \n     acolytes could catch just one mugger, they would have done \n     something of more value for the country. For that matter, \n     we'd owe the mugger a debt of gratitude for distracting these \n     errant knights from their destructive mission.\n\n  Of course, I know the pressures of time and schedules on my \ncolleagues, so, of all the millions of words that have been written \nabout the Microsoft trial since its beginning last October, I want them \nto note just one story, written February 18 on C-Net news.com about \nMicrosoft's recent roller coaster ride on Wall Street. The lead \nparagraph won't take much more than 10 seconds of my colleagues' \nvaluable time, but it tells everything anyone needs to know about this \ncase:\n  ``Microsoft shares fell as much as 3.8% today,'' the C-net story \nbegan, ``on investor concern about threats to the company's dominance \nfrom the Linux operating system and the landmark antitrust trial.''\n  George Orwell couldn't have put it better: With competitors baying at \nits heels, Microsoft has been forced to divert enormous resources to \ndefend\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nitself against the government's contention that it has no competitors.\n  Actually, George Orwell himself would have rejected the travesty of \nwhat is basically a private suit brought by the government on behalf of \ncompeting multi-billion-dollar companies against their chief \ncompetitor--especially when the government is heavily vested \npolitically in those companies' success.\n  Whether Orwell would have believed it or not, my colleagues need to \nbelieve it, because it's happening, and their constituents don't like \nit. A poll taken by Citizens for a Sound Economy in January found that \n81% of Americans--not just Washingtonians, but 81% of all Americans--\nsay that Microsoft is good for consumers. A Hart/Teeter poll also from \nJanuary found that 73% of Americans echo that belief and fully two-\nthirds say the federal government should stay out of the dispute and \nlet the marketplace and consumers decide the fate of competitors in the \npersonal computer industry. A majority know enough about what's already \nhappening in the industry to understand that the whole expensive circus \nis moot anyway: 51% of Americans think that the federal government \nshould just drop the case in the wake of AOL-Netscape merger.\n\n  Our constituents are paying attention to this issue because they are \nconsumers and are perfectly aware of how much Microsoft has improved \ntheir lives. They also see family, friends and neighbors working for \ncompanies that depend on Microsoft for their existence. There are tens \nof thousands of companies, large and small, that partner with \nMicrosoft, and they are located in every state in the Nation. I'm sure \nmy colleagues know something about them, but I'm not convinced that \nthey are aware of their huge numbers. That's why I asked Microsoft for \na state-by-state breakdown of their ``partners,'' companies that work \ndirectly with or through Microsoft or its products. Microsoft provided \nme with the data, which I want to share with my colleagues.\n  Here, I say to the Presiding Officer the Senator from Kansas with \n1,171 resale partners and 63 technology partners: Microsoft's partners \nfall into many categories: software retail stores; small Original \nEquipment Manufacturers that build and sell PC systems with Microsoft \nsoftware preinstalled; Corporate Account Resellers who resell Microsoft \nsoftware to large corporations; providers who sell packaged Microsoft \nsoftware with value-added consulting services; PC manufacturers; and \nMicrosoft Certified Solution Providers.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to this map that shows the number \nof these partners in each of their own states. First, the national \nnumbers: Microsoft has 7,279 technology partners and 112,819 resale \npartners.\n  These figures represent companies, not employees. Senator Murray and \nI are already well aware of Washington's 2,637 resale partners and 254 \ntechnology partners. Our state's economy is absolutely booming--and \nit's due not only to the presence of Microsoft itself, but to the \nthousands of other companies that Microsoft supports. Companies like \nTechnology Express of Bothell and Techpower Solutions Incorporated of \nRedmond.\n  But I wonder if my other colleagues have stopped to consider what \nJustice's assault on Microsoft might do to their own state's economies \nand jobs--and how their constituents might feel about that impact. \nLet's look at Utah as an example. Utah is home to 64 technology \npartners and 1,153 resale partners of Microsoft--home to real people \nworking in real jobs for real companies. Companies like PC Innovation \nIncorporated in Salt Lake City and Vitrex Corporation of Ogden. Despite \nthese facts, the senior Senator from Utah, the distinguished Chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, has chosen to take the side of the \nJustice Department and to support the Administration's efforts to \nsquelch the freedom of companies in his own state to innovate.\n  My colleagues should talk with consumers about their views of \ntechnology, because as my fellow Senators begin to understand how the \ntechnology business works, they will discover consumers not only have \nnot been harmed by Microsoft, but have benefited: Innovation is \nbooming, choices are growing, and prices are falling for all software.\n  Microsoft is leading an industry that the old school Department of \nJustice just doesn't understand. There are none of the traditional \nbarriers to entry in the high tech industry that have historically \nmotivated antitrust enforcement. This market moves at the speed of \nideas--and a good idea can cause a company to lose 90 percent of market \nshare overnight--precisely what happened to once-dominant products such \nas WordStar and Word Perfect; precisely what could happen to Microsoft.\n  This Justice Department, led by Joel Klein, is brazen about its \ndesire to intervene in markets, even when it knows little about the \nmarkets it meddles with. ``Surgical intervention'' is the spin that \nKlein and his department has coined to describe its interventionist \napproach.\n  To recap the recent history of this misguided lawsuit, the original \ncharge--that Microsoft illegally tied Internet browsing to its \noperating system--was rejected before the trial even began by a 3-\nmember Court of Appeals ruling that recognized that putting Internet \nExplorer technologies into Windows '95 was a beneficial integration, \nnot a monopolistic tie-in. The Court even admonished Klein and cohorts \nnot to try tinkering with software design and warned them to be wary of \nintruding into marketplace innovation and product design. A mere week \nbefore the Court of Appeals ruling came out, the Department of Justice \nfiled its current lawsuit against Windows 98--a product even more \nintegrated than Windows 95.\n  For this trial, Klein and company simply changed tactics. Instead of \narguing the case on its legal merits, the Justice Department has \nengaged in an all-out public relations battle. The new PR strategy has \nbeen orchestrated under Joel Klein's watch and has been the primary \nstrategy in the courtroom as well. The government's lead lawyer, Mr. \nBoies has a few aggressive e-mail messages that showed Microsoft to be \nexactly the fiercely competitive entity that has engendered its \nimpressive market performance, but nothing more sinister. Mr. Boies \nuses these same pieces of e-mail over and over again in highly \ntheatrical ways to try and embarrass and intimidate Microsoft's \nwitnesses. At breaks in the trial every day, the Government turns the \ncourthouse steps into ground zero for its spin game knowing full well \nits legal strategy had failed before it ever left the gate.\n  Despite their shaky legal case, the press has recently reported that \nJustice Department officials and the Attorneys General from 19 states \nsuing Microsoft are already discussing post trial ``remedies.'' Before \nany decision has been made in the case, Antitrust Division officials \nare contemplating punishments. Before they have proven any consumer \nharm, they are devising consumer remedies. Before they have made \nclosing arguments, they have coined a cute catch phrase for their \nplanned breakup of the company. They call the tiny remnants of the \nfuture broken Microsoft they already have the hubris to predict ``Baby \nBills.''\n  Whatever happened to letting justice take its course? Are we to \nassume that the outcome of the trial is a foregone conclusion? Why are \nwe wasting taxpayer money on attorneys fees when all that is really \ngoing on is a show trial?\n  On the other hand, Microsoft has put on a very strong record in this \ncase in areas relevant to the law and the claims brought by the \ngovernment: trying law, foreclosure of product through exclusionary \ncontracts and the fundamental element of consumer harm.\n  The facts so far in the record show Microsoft to be on firm legal \nground in all these areas. The Appeals Court verified there was no \nillegal tying. James Barksdale, Netscape's CEO, admitted that Microsoft \ndid not foreclose his company from the market. And the government's \nfinal witness, economist Franklin Fisher, testified that, on balance, \nMicrosoft has not harmed consumers.\n  As Attorney General for Washington State, I argued 14 cases before \nthe United States Supreme Court. My focus as Attorney General was \nconsumer protection. I want to assure my colleagues today that, had \nthis case\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nbeen presented to me as an Attorney General, I wouldn't have given it a \nsecond glance because there is no evidence whatsoever that Microsoft \nhas harmed consumers.\n  But Joel Klein doesn't care about protecting consumers. He cares \nabout protecting companies that cannot compete on their own. In a \nrecent speech, he stated that it was the job of antitrust to \n``reallocate resources between the producer and the consumer.''\n  Really? To reallocate resources? That's what antitrust is for?\n  Well, I agree with Mr. Klein's assessment on one count: this trial \nwas designed precisely to reallocate resources--from Microsoft to \nMicrosoft's competitors. And why would the Department want to do that? \nPerhaps because the resources the Administration really wants to \nreallocate are California's electoral votes into Al Gore's column come \nthe year 2000. Just this past Tuesday the San Francisco Chronicle said \nthat Mr. Gore ``unabashedly acknowledged that he has lavished attention \non California, which carries a rich cache of votes--and campaign \ndonors. According to his staff, the Vice President has visited the \nState 53 times since taking office five years ago.'' In a separate \nstory, the Chronicle quotes the Vice President as saying, ``California \nis the biggest, most important State. . . . It deserves the most \nattention, and I'm going to make sure it gets it.''\n  So, needing California in 2000, lusting for a return to the \nregulatory excess needed to feed the insatiable maw of big government, \nand wanting to throw trial lawyers some fresh meat, but lacking \nanything closely resembling a credible legal case, what have Klein and \nCo. done? They've demonized the most innovative, extraordinary world-\nchanging engine for progress that this world may ever have seen. As my \ncolleagues think about the implications of our failure to protest this \ndemonization, let's just take a closer look at the ``demon'' itself and \nsee what innovations the forces of government regulatory mediocrity are \nabout to foreclose.\n  Microsoft's economic contributions already are common knowledge, and \nI've just provided the State-by-State breakdown, but here's a \nrefresher: In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, Microsoft's net \nrevenues were $14.48 billion--56 percent of which came from \ninternational trade. In my home State of Washington, by the end of 1998 \nMicrosoft employed almost 16,000 workers. Nationwide the figure was \nalmost 20,000--and that's without factoring in the number of jobs \nrepresented by the 120,000 plus companies on the Partners' map I've \njust shown my colleagues. Microsoft generates jobs worldwide as well, \nwith subsidiaries in nearly 60 countries, from Austria to Vietnam, \nCosta Rica to the Czech and Slovak Republics, Saudi Arabia to South \nAfrica.\n  National productivity and workplace efficiency? The value provided is \nvery nearly beyond our ability to calculate. Ironically, Windows, the \nproduct portrayed by Klein and cohorts as anti-consumer, was purposely \ndesigned by Microsoft to support and encourage the greatest number of \ninnovations possible by independent software programmers, who need a \nuniform, broad-based platform on which to write code that will be \neconomically viable in smaller niche markets. The result has been an \nenormous proliferation of software designed to fill every imaginable \nconsumer need.\n  How about other, less obvious innovations this company is responsible \nfor? Let's start with products that just make life better for ordinary \npeople, like WebTV, which lets people use their television sets to \nconnect to the Internet. That's innovation for the better. And there's \nalso Windows' accessibility features--magnifiers, high-contrast \nschemes, special keys and sound enhancements among many--that make \ncomputers easy to use for many people with disabilities--opening doors \nthat previously were locked tight. Education? Microsoft donates \nmillions of dollars in cash and software to schools and libraries every \nyear.\n\n  Microsoft was recently voted the 3rd most admired company in \nFortune's annual poll. That's some demon the Justice Department has \ntargeted. It had better hurry and shut Microsoft down completely or the \nnext thing you know Microsoft will help lower the cost of computing \neven more or spawn even greater technological and cultural innovations \nthat will make our lives easier and better, and then where would we be?\n  Mr. President, irony aside, there is no aspect of this case that does \nnot offend me.\n  As a lawyer, I have nothing but contempt for the flaccid PR case \nhoisted feebly in Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's court by the \ngovenment's inquisitors.\n  As a former Attorney General who left a solid legacy of consumer \nprotection, I am appalled at the Orwellian double-speak government \nlawyers spew forth as they pretend to act on behalf of consumers while \nsimultaneously seeking to dictate what they may consume.\n  As a free-market advocate of decades-long standing, I am chagrined at \nthe ``Damn-the-consequences-full-speed-backward!'' attitude of those \nwho would regulate just for regulation and bureaucracy's sake.\n  As a Senator, I am nonplused at the Administration's gall in asking \nfor a 16 percent increase to beef up its attack-dog department so that \nit may continue mauling the greatest engine for revenue generation \nwe've seen in many a year.\n  As a Washingtonian, I am incensed at the blatant attempt of Al Gore's \nwannabe administration to court my state's electoral votes even as his \ncurrent Administration's Justice Department orchestrates the \ndestruction of Washington's superb economic engine in favor of Silicon \nValley's greater financial and electoral prize.\n  Yes, this case offends me in every sense of the word, as it should \noffend every one of my colleagues. I call on each of them today to \nrecognize what is at risk here, to rise above partisan posturing, to \nrecognize the outrageous nature of the Justice Department's power grab, \nand to join me in stopping it.\n  Because that is precisely what I intend to do: I will seek to stop \nthe Justice Department's grab for more funding through the \nAppropriations Committee when there are basic law enforcement needs \ngoing unfunded. I intend to conduct Congressional oversight authority \nof the Department's out-of-control antitrust division in every \ncommittee in which it is appropriate, and I will seek out every other \nlegitimate vehicle to provide Congressional control of this out-of-\ncontrol, time-warped throwback to the 60s.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me today in demanding accountability \nfrom a Justice Department that asserts consumer harm in the presence of \nconsumer bounty; that has sought to destroy competition in the name of \ncompetition; and that now seeks to increase its own battle force with \ntaxpayer dollars for a undertaking that taxpayers do not want \nundertaken.\n  This is a Justice Department out of control, and not only with \nrespect to Microsoft. They are also going after Visa and MasterCard. \nTheir Equally hidebound colleagues at the FTC are suing chip \nmanufacturer, Intel, and investigating router manufacturer, Cisco. Most \nof absurd of all the Department of Justice of the United States of \nAmerica has accused the country's leading manufacturer of false teeth \n(Dentsply) of illegally maintaining a monopoly. No wonder Justice is \nasking for more money and more lawyers; it needs to find more teeth to \nfeed its rapidly burgeoning lawsuit appetite.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Justice seeks to fix what is not \nbroken, to intervene where innovation has been the unchallenged king, \nand to shunt off to a dead-end track the principal engine of America's \ntechnological leadership in the world.\n  The Department of Justice, and not Microsoft, must be stopped.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to be \noffered by my colleagues from Washington and Massachusetts, Senators \nMurray and Kennedy, to S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership \nAct of 1999. The amendment represents a true investment in education, \nas well as in the future of our Nation and my State of Hawaii.\n  Built on a bipartisan agreement passed last year, the amendment seeks \nto reduce class size in early grades through the hiring of additional \nwell-qualified teachers. This would mean more individualized attention \nfor students from their teachers, increased learning in the basics that \nwill immeasurably help them in future grades, and a better chance at \nsuccess from an early age.\n  I also support other amendments to be offered to S. 280. One will be \noffered by my colleague, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, regarding an equally vital school modernization initiative. \nI have spoken in support of this initiative in the past. This plan \nwould finance the building and renovation of public schools through tax \ncredits in lieu of interest on bonds. Hawaii would receive tax credits \nto support $50 million in school modernization.\n  The other amendment that will be offered by Senator Boxer to help \ncommunities fund afterschool programs for kindergarten, elementary, and \nsecondary school students will be one that I will support. This will \nhelp keep students off the streets after school, for too many youths in \nmy State are left with nothing to do but turn to drugs, alcohol, gangs \nand other destructive behaviors. And this happens also in other \nStates. These amendments have my full support.\n\n  Now I would like to focus my remarks on the class size amendment. I \ncommend my colleagues for supporting the first installment of the 7-\nyear class size reduction proposal last year. We passed $1.2 billion in \n1998 to hire 30,000 teachers. Under this spending, Hawaii will receive \nmore than $5.6 million. We must pass the Murray-Kennedy amendment to \nfinish the job and assure that the teachers hired under last year's \ndownpayment will continue to be funded.\n  This amendment would provide $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 to hire \n38,000 teachers, which would give Hawaii nearly $7 million for 178 \nteachers. So this is something that Hawaii really looks forward to.\n  Students in my State need these well-qualified, well-trained \nteachers. I hear from students, parents, and teachers alike that \nclasses are too large. The average size of a class in Hawaii is in the \nmid-twenties. However, research shows that the optimum number of \nstudents in a class, particularly lower grades, is in the mid- to \nupper-teens.\n  Among other problems, larger classes create discipline problems, \nespecially in communities with large numbers of at-risk children. If we \nwant to give our students the best possible chance to learn, they need \nsmaller classes and teachers who are able to give them enough personal \nattention.\n  In addition to helping students, this amendment would also help \nHawaii's teachers. As a former teacher, I have taught both small and \nlarge classes. I have taught in different kinds of systems. I know when \nstudents are grasping ideas. And we know when they are not. One of the \nmost rewarding things a teacher can experience is to see the faces of \nstudents light up when they realize they have learned something new. \nWhen there are too many students in a class and only one teacher to \nsupervise them, the result is a difficult and poor learning \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in voting for this class size amendment. It makes sense to \nfocus our efforts this way on students during their early grades, \nbecause these represent some of the most vital years in a child's \neducational development. We must give our children a rock-solid \nfoundation in the basics so they may continue to build a strong base of \nknowledge throughout their educational history. We know that well-\neducated children will mean a great citizenry for the future of our \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Murray and Kennedy, for giving me \nthis opportunity and this chance to speak on their amendment at this \nmost important time in the history of our country.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to state very simply but strongly \nand unequivocally that I support S. 280, the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act, and I support it very strongly. There is a very simple \ntruth. That is, we need to trust our parents, trust our teachers, trust \nour local school boards. We should do everything in our power to \nunshackle our children from binding Federal Government-mandated rules \nthat might make sense in Manhattan, NY, but not in Manhattan, MT.\n  Two weeks ago I had the honor of addressing the Montana State \nlegislature, and when I spoke I told them that the time has come to \nbring the promise of world-class education to every Montanan. I daresay \nthat virtually everyone in this body has made the same statement, \nbecause he or she believes it very deeply, when speaking to his or her \nown legislatures back in their own States or to any group whatsoever \nthat is interested in education. I believe very deeply we must do that.\n  I also believe we need to ingrain that ethic into the hearts and \nminds of those who care about education all across our country. Indeed, \nit is similar to the environment. We are the stewards of our children's \nlearning, and our future as a nation very deeply depends on our \nwillingness to invest in them and our teachers and our schools all \nacross our country.\n  We have a moral responsibility to leave this Nation's children \nprepared to meet the challenges ahead. That challenge takes a unique \nform when we talk about meeting the standards of rural States. Nearly \n40 percent of the children who go to school in America every day go to \na rural school in a small town, yet somehow we as a nation invest only \n22 percent of our total education funding in these students. Rural \nstudents are being shortchanged by a ratio of 2 to 1. I will work hard \nthis year to see that every student in America, whether in urban \nAmerica or in rural America, is provided for fairly and equally.\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\n  But money alone is not enough. The Federal Government must be a \npartner in education with parents, teachers, and local schools, not an \nobstacle. Ed-Flex is the right step to take for our children. All Ed-\nFlex does is say to States, if you come up with a better way to do your \njob, we will get out of your way and let you do it. Right now, a well-\nmeaning but confusing and distant Federal bureaucracy too often stands \nin their way. Let me give some examples.\n  Say Federal funds allowed a small Montana school, or even a large New \nYork City school, to purchase computers for students with disabilities. \nThose computers probably will not get used all day long, and it makes \nsense that these computers be utilized to help other students when \ndisabled students do not need them. But Federal rules prevent other \nstudents from using those computers. Does that make sense? No. So, \nunder Ed-Flex, States can get a waiver and use these computers to \neducate all our children.\n  Another example: If a school has over 50 percent of its students who \nare under the poverty line, they can mix all of their Federal funds \ntogether, pool them with State funds, and create programs that help \nevery student in that school. But what about schools in the next \nbracket, with between one-third and one-half of their students under \nthe poverty line? In those schools, money for disadvantaged children \nmust be spent directly on those children, even if that same money can \nbe used in ways that will better educate the disadvantaged children and \nevery other student in that school.\n  The other day I talked to my very good friend, Nancy Keenan. Who is \nNancy Keenan? She is the superintendent of public instruction for my \nState. There is no better friend to Montana schoolchildren than Nancy \nKeenan. She tells me that right now these schools beat their heads up \nagainst Federal rules, trying to untangle the redtape and convince \nfolks over 2,000 miles away, back in Washington, DC, that their local \nplans make sense. It is very, very depressing. If this bill passes, \nMontana--all States--could get waivers so the schools could deal \ndirectly with the Nancys of the country, and their parents and \nteachers, to find a solution that works better for every child.\n  It is time to restore trust back to the people. Right now, 12 States \nhave been granted the right by Congress to experiment with education \nflexibility. You will not hear one Senator from those States stand up \nwith even one instance where education flexibility has not worked. In \nfact, every State agrees that it allowed local folks to form \npartnerships, to create plans that work to better educate their \nchildren. That is all we want. We want our parents, our teachers, and \nlocal school boards, all working together, to give our children the \nvery best. The Federal Government must be a better partner. We ought to \ndo everything in our power to help our children. It is that simple.\n  I believe the bill before us, Ed-Flex, is the right way to take care \nof it and I applaud Senators Wyden and Frist for their efforts. I very \nmuch hope this passes quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, for his work on education and his understanding that \nthis is a key issue we need to address from the Federal level. Too \noften today we hear from people who say, ``No, this is a local issue, \nthis is just a State issue.'' Of course it is; it is absolutely a local \nissue; it is absolutely a State issue. But we have to do our part, too, \nwhether it is passing the Ed-Flex bill so we can reduce some of the \nbureaucratic regulations or whether it is providing additional \nresources for those districts to shrink class size or working with \nteacher-training and technology. These are things we have to address, \nand I thank my colleague from Montana for his work on this.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an amendment I will be \noffering shortly on the Ed-Flex bill, which is going to be on the floor \nprobably in the next several minutes. The amendment I offer is one that \nmany of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about and to \nsupport, because it is an issue that parents and teachers and community \nleaders and business leaders truly understand when it comes to the \nissue of education. That is the fact that too many of our classrooms \nare overcrowded; too many of our teachers are trying to teach to \nclasses with 30 or 35 students. They are not giving students the \nindividual attention they need in order for them to learn the skills \nthat we need them to learn, whether it is reading or writing or math or \nscience.\n  The Murray-Kennedy amendment which I will be offering will simply \nauthorize a 6-year effort to help our school districts hire 100,000 \nnew, well-trained teachers in grades 1 through 3. School districts will \nbe able to use up to 15 percent of those funds for professional \ndevelopment activities so they can improve the quality of their \nteaching pool--something that all schools tell us they need. And, after \nmeeting the target ratio of 1-to-18 in grades 1 through 3, school \ndistricts will be able to use the funds for professional development \nactivities. This is an amendment, again, that parents and teachers and \ncommunity leaders support. We have heard from law enforcement, we have \nheard from businesses, that we need to help address this from the \nnational level.\n\n  When parents send their children to school next fall--next fall, 6 \nmonths from now--they are going to do what they do every fall when \ntheir child comes home from school on the first day. They are going to \nsit them down and they are going to ask them: Who is your teacher and \nhow many children are in your class? They ask those questions because \nthey know the number of students in the child's classroom will make a \ndifference in their child's ability to learn that year and they know \nwho their teacher is. If it is the best qualified teacher, their child \nwill have a successful year.\n  Next year, next fall when they ask that question, those schools that \nthose children attend will have a new tool for helping students to \nlearn. That is because of the budget bill we passed last year. Because \nof our actions, approximately 30,000 new, well-prepared teachers will \ngo into classrooms across this country and we will be able to say we \nhave made progress.\n  Last year, as all of you will remember, I came to the Senate Chamber \nmany times to fight to pass my bill, S. 2209, which was the Class Size \nReduction and Teacher Quality Act of 1998.\n  You will also recall that I finally got my language into the \nappropriations negotiations and then worked closely with the \nadministration and with leaders here on Capitol Hill to get it passed, \nand it did pass, after a bipartisan discussion and in a bipartisan way. \nLast fall, last October, Republicans and Democrats alike touted their \nsuccess at providing local school communities with much-needed help to \nimprove learning for every child by reducing class size in grades 1 \nthrough 3.\n  The American people are watching this week as we talk about \neducation. They fully expect this Congress to continue to support \neducation efforts that really work, such as reducing class size and \nhiring quality teachers. They want to know whether what we did last \nOctober was just for a political moment or whether we really are \ncommitted to reducing class size so our children across this country \nwill get the kind of education they need. We started the job last fall \nand now we need to finish it. We have to provide the schools the \nremainder of the funding necessary to hire 100,000 new and better \nprepared teachers over the next 6 years.\n  Our first and best opportunity for a bipartisan solution is this \ndebate on S. 280, which is the Ed-Flex bill that we are going to be \ndiscussing shortly. This is a perfect opportunity for early positive \nsuccess, and people are watching to see if we are going to work \ntogether on this critical issue this year. This week Americans are \ntelling Congress they want to see passage of the Murray-Kennedy \namendment to reduce class size and improve teacher quality.\n  Mr. President, my class size reduction proposal honors the bipartisan \nagreement we achieved last year. It requires no new forms and no \nredtape. It focuses on hiring new teachers, but it also makes \ninvestments in teacher quality from the outset. It allows districts \nthat meet their goals of getting to 18 or fewer students in classes in \ngrades 1 through 3, to be able to use that money to improve class size \nin\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nother grades, or to take steps to improve the quality of their teaching \npool.\n\n  Class size reduction isn't some new national idea. Local students, \nparents, teachers, State and local policymakers have asked for this \nkind of national investment in class size reduction for years. My \nproposal emphasizes local flexibility in making improvements.\n  Mr. President, let me talk for a minute about the Ed-Flex bill. Both \nlast year and this year I have been very supportive of the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act. That is because I think to change thinking \namong local and State policymakers is a good thing. It frees them from \nsome of the restrictions that may keep them and our public schools from \nbecoming the best that they can be. But a change in thinking alone is \nnot enough. Local schools need action. They need investment. They need \nresources in order to show measurable improvement for all children.\n  With class size reduction funds, we will have new, well-trained \nteachers so every child, every child in this country, grades 1 through \n3, can get the attention they need and that they must have in order to \nimprove the quality of their learning.\n  Once local educators have a plan for improving student achievement, \nwe must make key investments at the national level to help them get the \njob done. This means funding class size reduction, teacher quality \nimprovement, and school construction. It also means passing Ed-Flex, \nwhich we all want to do. Today is our best chance to pass both Ed-Flex \nand class size reduction and send a strong message to local educators \nthat we have heard their concerns and we are responding. Congress does \nneed to pass Ed-Flex, but, more importantly, it must pass the Murray-\nKennedy amendment to reduce class size and improve teacher quality.\n  Mr. President, we have to continue to improve the effort that we \nbegan last year, right here, in a bipartisan effort to help local \nschools, local teachers, and local communities get the results they \nneed. Schools across this Nation are fully engaged in this debate right \nnow over quality in learning and in identifying what works to improve \nlearning for students. Local education leaders know that class size \nreduction is effective. They know as they reduce class size they can \nalso improve the quality of their local teaching pool by improving \nprofessional development, training certification and recruitment.\n  Local communities are using the Federal class size and teacher \nquality effort as a way to beef up their own investment in the future \nof young people. Governors and State legislators across this country \nare proposing class size investments this year based on our successful \nefforts of last year. They are watching to see whether or not we really \nmean that we are committed to class size reduction or it was just a \npolitical move from last year.\n  In Washington State, my home State, Governor Gary Locke and key State \nlegislators are debating these investments right now in Olympia and \nwatching what we are doing so there is an important reason right now to \npass the class size amendment today. Local school districts, school \nboards across this country--and I was a former school board member so I \nknow what they do in February and March; they put their budgets \ntogether for the following years--are looking to us to see if we are \ngoing to continue this investment so that they can begin to put their \nbudgets together and hire the staffs they need to make a commitment to \nnow, so when those first hires are made in July, they know that this \njust wasn't a one-time bill, but this bipartisan Senate and Congress, \nthis administration meant what they said last fall when they said class \nsize reduction is a national priority.\n\n  We cannot wait to pass this amendment. We need to do it now so that \nthose school boards and those local communities know that we say what \nwe mean and we follow up on it right here in Washington, DC.\n  I will be offering this amendment later. I hope to be talking again \nabout it today. This is clearly an issue for which parents and \ncommunities are looking to us, to trust the Federal Government. Will \nthey follow up on their word? Will they make an investment that \nactually makes a difference? As we go through this debate, I will show \nyou, all of my colleagues, and the country, studies that show that \nclass size reduction makes a difference in student learning. We have a \nresponsibility as the Federal Government. We have to live up to our \ncommitment and not just make promises about education but truly make \ninvestments that work.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time this morning. I look forward to \ntheir support in a bipartisan way for the class size amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Reid, Senator Bryan and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin and Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 35.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted''.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am proposing the National Dropout \nPrevention Act as an amendment to this Ed-Flex legislation. As I \nindicated, the cosponsors of this amendment are Senators Reid, Levin \nand Bryan.\n  In my view, the amendment would create a much-needed program to \ntarget those schools in our country that have the highest dropout rates \nin the Nation. There is at present very little help from the Federal \nlevel going to some of these most troubled high schools, and the \namendment is a valuable necessary addition to this legislation to begin \nmoving ahead in solving this problem.\n  Improving our schools, as we are trying to do through the Ed-Flex \nbill and through many other initiatives in Congress, is not going to \nmake a whole lot of difference if half or a third--some substantial \nportion--of our students have already left before they graduate and \nthey are no longer in those schools to receive the benefits of that \nassistance. Efforts to provide better teachers, more flexibility, \ncomputers in the classroom, higher standards--all of those efforts--\nwill be diluted if we continue to ignore the dropout crisis we have in \nthis country.\n  We do have what I refer to as a dropout drain. This chart makes the \npoint very graphically showing that--the bucket represents our school \nsystem--we have students coming out of the school system in very large \nnumbers and not gaining the benefit of the education we are trying to \nprovide.\n  At too many schools, dropout rates reach 30 percent and even 50 \npercent, according to a 1998 Education Week report. Most States do not \npublish cumulative data, but Florida recently found that its 4-year \ndropout rate approached 50 percent when they added the students who \ndropped out in the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year. They \ngot close to 50 percent in the State of Florida.\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\n  There are roughly 3,000 students who drop out on average each day in \nthis country, according to the Department of Education statistics. \nAbout 500,000 students drop out of high school each year.\n  Let me indicate at this point, Mr. President, that the reason I am \noffering this legislation on the Ed-Flex bill early in this Congress is \nthat if we go ahead and try to do this as part of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we will be talking about trying to do \nsomething 18 months down the road, because it is expected that the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act will likely not become law until \nsometime late next year.\n  If that is the case, then we are talking not about 500,000 students \nper year, we are talking about a very large number of students who \nwill, in fact, have left our schools with us sitting here trying to \nfigure out what the right timing is to begin dealing with the problem.\n  These new dropouts will join about 4 million other young adults who \nare presently without high school degrees. There has been a lot of talk \nby the President and by many of us about ending social promotion, and \nwe all favor ending social promotion. But if we pursue that, and pursue \nit with vigor, we may create an even greater risk for students dropping \nout of our school system.\n  Though dropout rates have not risen yet, higher standards mean more \nstudents become discouraged and fall through the cracks, unless there \nis some provision made to assist those students in meeting those higher \nstandards. While some progress has been made for African American \nstudents, the real concentrated problem we have is in the Hispanic \nstudent population. Hispanic students remain much more likely to drop \nout.\n  Let me call people's attention to this chart called ``Status Dropout \nRates for Persons Ages 16 to 24 by Race Ethnicity for the Period \nOctober 1972 through October 1995.'' What you can see here very clearly \nis that the rate of dropouts in the Hispanic community is up in the \nrange of 30 to 35 percent. The rate for black non-Hispanic students and \nwhite non-Hispanic students is substantially lower, down in the area of \n10 to 15 percent.\n  So we have a very serious problem and one that we have not been able \nto address, and it most directly affects the Hispanic students in our \ncountry and in our State.\n  One reason I became interested in this, Mr. President, which should \nbe obvious--I am sure it is obvious to my colleagues--is that a very \nlarge percentage of our population in New Mexico is Hispanic and \nparticularly in the school system. A great many of the young people in \nour State are Hispanic, and the problem affects us in a very real way.\n  The annual dropout rate is almost 5 percent each year for all States. \nAnd States, such as Nevada, where Senator Reid, who is my cosponsor on \nthis bill, and Senator Bryan hail from, and Georgia and New Mexico, \nhave a much more severe dropout rate.\n  Let me just say another word, before I go on to this chart here, \nabout the issue of Hispanic students. The dropout rate for Hispanics \nhas hovered near 30 percent for many years. That is more than three \ntimes the rate for white students, more than two times the rate for \nAfrican Americans. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing \npopulation in our Nation, and many are being left behind in their \neducational opportunities while others are moving ahead. While the \nHispanic students in our country make up 14 percent of all students \nnow, they will comprise 22 percent by the year 2020. In large part due \nto differences in dropout rates, Hispanic workers earn only about 61 \npercent of what comparable non-Hispanic workers are earning. So you can \nsee the problem is severe.\n  Referring again to this chart, unfortunately for Nevada, it is the \nState with the highest dropout rate. This is the dropout rate, on an \nannual basis, according to the Department of Education statistics. \nTwenty-nine States have provided annual dropout data. The other States \nhave not provided that information. And, of course, they are not on \nthis chart. But unfortunately, close behind Nevada and right behind \nGeorgia is my own State of New Mexico, and the dropout rate there is \n8.5 percent according to these statistics.\n  The National Goals Report--I serve on the National Education Goals \nPanel, Mr. President. And one of the discouraging things about serving \non that panel has been that over the last several years--back in 1989, \nPresident Bush and the Governors met over in Charlottesville, VA, to \nset out national goals. And they had a very good vision of what they \nthought we ought to be trying to do as a Nation.\n  The second goal is that at least 90 percent of our students should \ngraduate from high school before they leave school. Unfortunately, the \nreality is that we have not made progress on that. The National Goals \nReport, the latest National Goals Report, found that roughly 40 States \nhave not made any progress in increasing school completion rates during \nthe 10 years that we have had since that national education goal was \nagreed to.\n  Dropout rates affect more than just the students who leave school. \nLet me show another chart here which will make that point. While \ndropouts face a bleak future in terms of good jobs, communities that \nthey live in are affected by higher crime, higher welfare rates, as \nwell as very limited economic opportunity. Unemployment rates of high \nschool dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. The \nprobability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high \nschool dropouts than for students who finished high school. The median \npersonal income of high school graduates during the prime earning \nyears, 25 through 54, is nearly twice that of high school dropouts. So \nwe have a very serious problem here.\n  At the present time, there is no Federal program dedicated toward \neradicating the problem. This $150 million that we contemplate in this \nlegislation, this amendment, would allow us to help 2,000 schools with \nthe highest dropout rates throughout the country. With funds that they \ncould receive from the State, these schools could restructure \nthemselves in ways that have proven to lower dropout rates.\n  We do know some of the ways schools can lower dropout rates. We need \nto get that information out better, and we need to give schools the \nresources to act on that information. This is necessary because most \nElementary and Secondary Education Act programs, including title I, \nwhich of course is the largest program we authorize through the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, do not reach significant \nnumbers of high school students.\n  In our most troubled communities, this creates a very real dropoff in \nsupport services when students move from an elementary or middle school \nwith a strong title I program. They get the assistance at the \nelementary level, and even at the middle school level, but when they \nget to high school, the assistance is not there.\n  Not even GEAR UP, which is a newly created tutoring program to help \nmiddle school students and provides real support to help schools make \nfundamental changes to the way they are organized and run, that program \nitself is not available to solve this problem.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time that we have had a chance \nto act on this legislation. I offered this legislation last year to the \nbill which Senator Coverdell had sponsored on education issues. It was \nadopted here in the Senate. We had 74 Senators who supported the exact \nlegislation, identical legislation last year. It has been endorsed, \nthis amendment, by the Council of Great City Schools, by the Hispanic \nEducation Coalition, and by the Education Trust.\n\n  Local schools need to decide how best to address the problem in their \ncommunity. And we are not trying to dictate what any local school does \nto solve this problem. The legislation gives districts the power to \nchoose from a broad array of proven, effective approaches to the \ndropout issue.\n  As in the Obey-Porter program, States would receive funds on a \nformula basis identical to title I, and districts would compete for \ngrants of not less than $50,000 from the State.\n  The dropout problem can be addressed through school-based reforms. \nWhile many excuses are made for the dropout problems, in fact school-\nrelated factors are cited most often by the students themselves, the \nstudents who do drop out of school. When they are\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nsurveyed and asked why they left school, in 77 percent of the cases, \nthey cite school-related factors as the reason. These are students who \nare failing--who are failing--who do not like school--they do not get \nalong with their teachers or their peers and basically have found that \nthere is nothing there in the school to keep them there.\n  When you look at the top school-related reasons getting behind that \nother statistic, the top school-related reasons, the first or the most \noften cited top school-related reason is that they were failing or they \ncould not get along with their teachers, and that is a reason for the \nstudents dropping out. They do not like school. They could not get \nalong with students, felt they did not belong. They were suspended or \nexpelled in 25 percent of the cases; and they did not feel safe in 10 \npercent of the cases.\n  These are school-related concerns which the schools themselves can \nbegin to address, Mr. President. This is not something where we can say \nit is up to the parents. ``If the kids don't want to go to school, it's \nthe parents' problem, it's not the school's problem.'' That has been \nthe approach we have taken for decades in this country to this issue, \nand it has not gotten us where we need to be.\n  Let me also talk about the size of schools. Small schools, academy \nprograms, challenging material, alternative high schools, all of these \nhave proven effective ways of addressing the needs of at-risk students \nin large, alienating, boring high schools.\n  Mr. President, it is clear when you begin looking at this problem--\nand I see it in my State--the problem is most severe in our large high \nschools, in our large middle schools where students feel anonymous, \nwhere there is very little interaction between the student and the \nteacher. And that problem is severe.\n  In particular, this program that we have proposed here will allow us \nto make large schools smaller without building new school buildings. \nSchool size does matter. Yet we are still forcing our young people to \ngo to very, very large schools. And in some places they have taken the \nvery innovative step of breaking large schools into smaller schools \nwhere you have schools within schools. And that is part of the \nsolution, I believe.\n  In New Mexico and throughout the Nation, fewer than one out of three \nhigh school students goes to a school that has 900 or fewer \nstudents. That is the ideal size for a high school, according to \nstudies that have been done nationally.\n\n  Part of the funding we are trying to obtain through this legislation \nwould be made available to schools to restructure into smaller learning \ncommunities. More and more research is showing that large middle and \nhigh schools are alienating and anonymous places for children to learn. \nThis contributes to their disinterest in school, their lack of contact \nwith caring adults. This bill would help large schools revamp \nthemselves into smaller academies, schools within schools.\n  There is a reason why our private schools are doing well. One of \nthose reasons is that most of them are very small. Clearly, we need to \nlearn from that in the public school system. Schools with high dropout \nrates receive little, if any, Federal assistance in turning themselves \naround.\n  The vast majority of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nprograms are targeted to our elementary schools. We need to restore the \n``S,'' which stands for secondary schools, in the ESEA legislation. \nESEA stands for Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Unfortunately, \nwe usually forget about the ``secondary'' education aspect of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Addressing the dropout crisis in my State has become a real priority \nfor me. We have made some progress in the last 2 years but we still \nhave one of the highest dropout rates in the Nation, with over 7,500 \nstudents dropping out in the years 1995 and 1996.\n  In the most recent State-level report, New Mexico's annual dropout \nrate had fallen to under 8 percent, contrary to the statistic I had on \nthe chart, but the rate is nearly 10 percent for Hispanic students and \nover 8 percent a year for Native American students.\n  There are innovative programs that will help us deal with this \nproblem. In my State, we have a truancy prevention initiative in \nClovis, NM. We have a Value Youth Program in Cobre High School in Grant \nCounty, NM. In Santa Fe we have a dropout prevention task force. We \nhave a dropout czar who has been appointed in the Albuquerque schools.\n  Clearly, there is much more that can be done. This legislation will \nprovide some of the resources to do that. I believe very strongly that \nthis is something we should do now.\n  Before my cosponsor speaks on this issue, let me reiterate why we \nneed to do this now. We should not be sitting around Congress biding \nour time and assuming that this is not a problem that deserves \nemergency attention. This is a problem that deserves emergency \nattention. It is in our best interests on a bipartisan basis to pass \nthis legislation now, early in the session. I believe we can do that. I \nvery much urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could engage in a conversation with the \nSenator from New Mexico, it is stunning to think that 3,000 children \ndrop out of high school every day. Is that difficult to comprehend?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Visiting high schools, as I know the Senator has done a \nlot, you run into students on the verge of dropping out. You sit down \nwith students who have dropped out and are back in school and talk to \nthem about the reasons.\n  There is a problem here that we have left unaddressed too long, in my \nopinion.\n  Mr. REID. We talk about this being an emergency. Think of the fact \nthat 82 percent of the men and women in our prisons around this country \nare high school dropouts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. If we had no other statistic than that, it would seem this \nis an emergency.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is exactly right. Clearly, if we can resolve this \nproblem, reduce this problem, we will have an impact on the number of \nour young people who wind up in criminal activity. I think it is a \npriority for that reason as well.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend from New Mexico, this is a good \nbill. The amendments that are going to be offered at the appropriate \ntime dealing with class size and the number of new teachers--the \nSenator agrees with me that that is important?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. But I believe there is nothing more important than keeping \nour children in school. All these other things I support, and I am \nbehind them all the way. In fact, would the Senator agree with me that \nperhaps it is more important to keep our kids in school?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond by saying I think \nyou can do an awful lot to improve the quality of education. If the \nstudents aren't there in the classroom to benefit from that, all of \nthat effort goes for naught.\n  I do think we need to address this problem as we try to upgrade the \nquality of education. Clearly, this problem has gone unaddressed for \nway too long.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico I went \nto a high school that had a few hundred kids in it. I moved from a very \nsmall rural town in Nevada to what I thought was a very, very big high \nschool. The size of that school today is insignificant compared to the \nsize of the high schools in the metropolitan Reno-Las Vegas area. There \nare numerous Las Vegas high schools that have over 3,000 students.\n\n  The Senator displayed a chart indicating the reasons kids drop out of \nschool--failing, couldn't get along with teachers, didn't like school. \nCan you imagine how lost a person would feel coming from Searchlight, \nNV, which had 1 teacher teaching all 8 grades, to a school with over \n3,000 kids? I think it would be easy not to like school, wouldn't the \nSenator think?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree entirely with the point.\n  I visited some of these very large schools in my State. The truth is, \nwhen they ring the bell to change classes, you almost have to get out \nof the way, because you are going to get knocked to the floor if you \nstay right out in the\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\nmiddle of the hallway; there is such a rush of activity.\n  I do think there is a real problem in the size of our schools. \nWhenever you get a school that is so large that nobody really pays \nattention to whether or not a student comes to school in the morning, \nthen the school is too large, in my opinion.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, he was always very \nfaithful in attending when I had the responsibility of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee and we did a retreat. And he will remember a woman by \nthe name of Deborah Meier came to speak to the group of Senators \nassembled. As the Senator may recall, she had been an elementary school \nprincipal in New York in this very, very large public school. She came \nto the realization one day as principal of the school that she was \nbasically wasting her time. The scores of the children were very bad; \nthere was nothing she could seem to do that was right in helping these \nkids achieve.\n  So she went to the school board and said she would like to try a \nradical experiment: We have this elementary school; let's break it up \ninto four separate schools. We will have four separate principals, four \nseparate sets of teachers. It will be like four schools in one \nbuilding. They will each have their separate identity, with separate \nnames.\n  She has written a book entitled ``The Power of Their Ideas.'' In this \nbook she talks about this and how immediately the grades soared, the \nscores on their national tests soared.\n  Does the Senator remember that presentation?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In fact, I had the good fortune to go to that school in \nNew York and see some of that success. It is a great success story and \nit shows the value of a small school where you have teachers and \nadministrators and students and parents, all taking ownership in the \neducation process. That is what she was able to create.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator from New \nMexico for his substantive contribution to what goes on here in the \nSenate. There are very, very few Senators in the history of this body \nwho add so much substance as the Senator from New Mexico. He is a \nperson who, by education alone, should contribute--Harvard \nundergraduate, Stanford Law School. But it is more than just the \neducation. He has put his education and his experience to the benefit \nof the people of the State of New Mexico and this country.\n  There is no better example of that than this legislation which I am \nhonored to be able to cosponsor with the Senator. Again I repeat, of \nthe people in prison today, if there were 100 people in prison in our \ncountry today, 82 of those prisoners would never have graduated from \nhigh school.\n  Let's say there were 1,000 prisoners in America today; 820 of those \nwould never have graduated from high school. If there were 10,000 \nprisoners, 8,200 would never have graduated from high school--and on \nand on, until we get to the point where we have approximately 1 million \npeople in prison today, and 820,000 of those have never completed high \nschool.\n  Mr. President, every day, 3,000 children drop out of high school. \nEvery day. It would seem to me that there should be no greater concern \nin this body than making sure that that does not happen.\n  Now, I don't expect magic to occur tomorrow after this legislation \npasses, and that we are going to have all 3,000 children stay in \nschool, but let's say that we could make some progress so that only--I \nsay that with some trepidation--only 2,500 dropped out every day. That \nwould mean 500 children every day would be children who could arrive at \na better life. They would be able to achieve what they should be able \nto achieve.\n  The concerns that we have with this dropout rate is magnified every \nday when you read in the paper about people doing things wrong. Most of \nthem are high school dropouts. And 500,000 students dropped out of \nschool before graduating from high school every year. I am sorry to say \nthat dropout rates are the highest in the southern and western regions \nof the country.\n  I am very embarrassed to say that in the State of Nevada, 1 out of \nevery 10 children drop out of high school. I wish we did not lead the \ncountry, but we do. We have to do something to change dropout rates all \nover the country. Of course, Nevada, as I have said, leads the Nation, \nbut no one else should feel very high and mighty about the fact that \nonly 8 or 9 out of 100 drop out in other States. It is too many. We \nhave to make sure that there is progress made in lowering the national \ndropout rate.\n  Why do children drop out of school? The reasons are diverse. We \ntalked about some of them with Senator Bingaman earlier. We must invest \nin diverse, innovative solutions to help kids stay in school. What we \nare talking about here, Mr. President, is not some vast Government \nprogram. In fact, the same legislation that we are talking about today, \nSenator Bingaman and I offered last year in the form of an amendment, \nand it passed. We got 74 votes in the Senate, but it was killed in the \nHouse. I hope we get more than 74 votes this time. I can't imagine how \nanyone could vote against this legislation.\n  We are asking that there be $30 million a year for the next 5 years--\na drop in the bucket out of the $1.5 trillion we spend basically every \nyear--establishing within the Department of Education a division, a \nbureau, the sole responsibility of which would be to work to keep kids \nin school. They would do that by looking around the country at programs \nthat are successful. There are some that work pretty well. We would \ntell school districts to apply for a grant, a challenge grant, and we \nwould give them the money to implement that program.\n  This would not mean the Federal Government is micromanaging what goes \non in school districts. The school districts would manage every program \nthe Federal Government would assist them with. There are some really \nfine programs around the country. In fact, on a web site, every month, \nthere is a model program dealing with dropouts. Every month, they put \non the web site a program that they think should focus attention on \nkeeping kids in school. The model programs in March were called the \nTruancy Intervention Project and Kids in Need of Dreams. The pseudonym \nis TIP and KIND. These programs have dealt with kids of all levels. We \ncan't just go to a high school and say that is where we are going to \nstart keeping kids in school. We have to work from the time they start \nkindergarten. It is a program that kids don't just drop out of school \nin the 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th grades. Their inclinations and feelings \nabout school develop much earlier than that. That is why I talked with \nthe Senator from New Mexico about the great program in New York where \nthey broke up a very big elementary school and suddenly found that the \nkids weren't slower than other kids, that they weren't less inclined to \nlearn than others; they just needed a setting for learning. That is why \nwe need to have this bill passed, so that schools around the country \nthat are having problems with dropout rates can at least meet part of \ntheir needs.\n\n  The program I talked about--the model program in the month of March--\nis a program whose objective was to provide an early positive \nintervention with children reported as truants, because truancy usually \ncharacterizes other symptomatic behavior. TIP volunteers work to \ndetermine and satisfy their clients' needs so that the clients may \nreturn to school. The program works to meet the daily necessities of \nclothing, water, heat, transportation and long-term needs. They even go \ninto drug, psychiatric, tutoring and child care. It is a program used \nin Fulton County, GA. Its funding came from an Atlanta law firm and \nother private donations--the law firm of Alston and Byrd. As I say, \nthis is the model program of March on this web site.\n  In Las Vegas, at Horizon High School in the Clark County school \ndistrict, there is a program there dealing with teen mothers and \nfathers and pregnant teens. This is a program that is part of the \nalternative education project that facilitates high school graduation \nof teen parents and pregnant teens by providing quality day-care \nservices. There may be some who say, Why should the school district get \ninvolved in such a program? Well, as the Senator from New Mexico \nmentioned, we are going to cut back on social promotions, but we don't \nwant to dump out in the streets all of these kids who\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nare not going to be socially promoted. We need programs to get them \ninto the next level honestly. We can do that with summer alternative \nprograms, afterschool programs, tutoring programs. When a child, for \nwhatever reason, becomes a parent, he or she should not automatically \nhave to drop out of school. That is why the program in Las Vegas is \nsomething that I think deserves national attention.\n  These classes are set up to keep these kids in school--kids having \nkids--and are structured to provide these children with skills in \nlistening, speaking, independent thinking, and even personal hygiene. \nThere are programs in the Western States--and I am certain the Senator \nfrom New Mexico can appreciate that. We have programs where we focus on \nIndian children. There is a program in the Washoe County school \ndistrict that focuses on keeping Indian students in school. There is a \ntremendously high dropout rate with Indian children. The program that \nis being tested really to work with these children is one that I think \nwill work very well; it is called Phone Work. It is a voice mail \napproach to assist parents and teachers in the monitoring of the \nstudents' homework assignments. Parents are able to leave recorded \nmessages for the teacher, providing a two-way communication between \nhome and school. The teacher's responsibilities include recording daily \nassignments by a certain time of day, verifying each student's class \nassignments, written in the Phone Work assignment book, and that each \nstudent takes home books and materials that are needed. Student \nresponsibilities include recorded homework assignments, taking books \nand materials home, and having parents check completed assignments and \nassign a designated time and place for a student to study. These are \ndetails that some may think are not important, but if you are trying to \nkeep children in school--and there are some difficulties because the \nparents work, but this system allows, through the telephone--a program \ncalled Phone Work--that the teacher and the parent keep in touch and \nwork to keep this child in school.\n  One of the programs that I have worked on and have been impressed \nwith is a program called OLA in Carson City. Surprising to most people \nis the fact that Nevada has a large number of Hispanic students, \nHispanic people, but more students than adults. We have in the State of \nNevada, in the Clark County school district, in the Greater Las Vegas \narea, the eighth largest school district in the United States, and over \n25 percent of the students in the Clark County school district are \nHispanic.\n  Other places in Nevada also have large Hispanic populations. In \nCarson City, NV, our capital, we have a program, as I have indicated, \ncalled the OLA Carson City Program, designed to keep Hispanic children \ninterested in school. It has done a remarkable job. It has been in \nexistence for 4 or 5 years. They produce a television program where \nthey interview people who work in government, who work in the private \nsector. I have been doing interviews in their program at their station \nfor some 4 years. They are excited young people. They not only do \ntelevision, they are not only involved in the TV station, but they are \ninvolved in other things. This has helped these kids--I have heard them \nsay so--develop self-confidence. They are proud of the fact that they \ncan speak two languages. When I go there, one of the students will \ninterpret for me. They have become more confident since connecting with \nthe community. They have a recognition of the opportunities that are \navailable to them. Their personal goals have risen steadily. They have \nwon awards and honors in the community for their efforts. They have \nbecome actively involved in communicating their importance to their \npeers and to younger Hispanic youth. They started a tutoring program. \nThere is a youth leadership club, advanced group, enthusiasm, \nvolunteers for all kinds of programs in the community. They work in the \njuvenile justice system. The Governor selected them to work in the \nGoals 2000.\n  This is a wonderful program, Mr. President, one that should be \navailable to the rest of the country. That is what this amendment \nprovides. It makes these programs available to the rest of the country. \nI think that is all we can ask for--that school districts have the \nability. If they want to make an application saying they have a dropout \nproblem, what programs are available? What programs would meet their \nneeds? Have experts give them different alternatives, and they can \nchoose from those. If their grant is in effect, then it is up to them \nto implement the program; the Federal Government stays out of their \nlives.\n  We have a significant problem in southern Nevada especially. That is \nrapid growth. We have the most rapidly growing city and the most \nrapidly growing State in the country. We have to keep up with the \ngrowth in the schools. We have to build a school and a half a month to \nkeep up with the growth in the Clark County school district. We hold \nthe record of dedicating 18 schools in 1 year. The growth is \nphenomenal. Our long-time superintendent of schools is a very \ncourageous, very good superintendent by the name of Brian Cramm. He has \nbecome more of a construction superintendent than a school \nsuperintendent. Think of that--a school and a half a month. The goal \nhas been met. In 1 year, 18 schools were dedicated in the Clark County \nschools. But in an effort to accommodate all of these students, we have \nhuge schools. As Senator Bingaman and I have spoken about, we really \nneed to focus on ways of having smaller schools.\n  I frankly don't think, unless the Federal Government recognizes this \nhigh school dropout problem is the problem that it really is, that we \nare going to get help. One of the things we have tried to do, separate \nand apart from this amendment but which will complement this amendment, \nis to get school construction money. School districts all over the \ncountry are having bond issues fail. We are very lucky and fortunate. \nWe are blessed in southern Nevada because the people in Clark County \nare continuing these bond issues. Over $2 billion in bond issues have \npassed in four separate elections during the last 10 years--over $2 \nbillion. Around the rest of the State of Nevada, though, they haven't \nbeen so fortunate. Schools are not being built because they cannot get \nthe bond issues passed. We have some counties which simply do not have \nthe financial wherewithal to build new schools. They are in counties \nwhere there is a lot of Federal land. There is no mining. There is \nminimal ranching going on. They simply can't afford to build new \nschools, and kids are being educated in facilities that really, in the \neyes of some, should be condemned.\n\n  The bill for school construction would help rapidly growing school \ndistricts such as Clark County and Lincoln County, which need help \nbecause of the lack of economic growth in those counties. That is \nsomething that could complement this and hopefully would have school \ndistricts focus on not how big they can build a school but how many \nschools they can build to accommodate the children.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that this issue dealing with 3,000 children \ndropping out of school every day is something the Senate will focus on. \nIt is, as I have indicated, the No. 1 problem as far as I am concerned \nwith our schools today--children dropping out of school. I recognize \nthe reason for children dropping out of school is varied. There are a \nlot of reasons they drop out of school. But whatever the reason, it is \na situation that we must focus on. We must do something to keep \nchildren in school.\n  Mr. President, let's talk about the future for high school dropouts. \nWe know that unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than \ntwice those of boys or girls who graduate from high school. The \nprobability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high \nschool dropouts than for those who have finished high school. The \nmedian personal income of high school graduates during the prime \nlearning years--25 to 54--is nearly twice that of high school dropouts.\n  I have to mention again that 82 percent of the people in our \npenitentiaries or prisons or jails around the country are high school \ndropouts. The children of high school dropouts, it has been \nstatistically proven, have a much higher probability of dropping out of \nschool than children whose parents did not drop out of high school.\n  Let's look, as Senator Bingaman did, at Hispanics and what is \nhappening around the country with Hispanic children. I talk about the \nOLA Carson City Program, which is a miracle program. It is working \nwonders in Carson City.\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nBut we have too many Hispanic children all over the country dropping \nout. We have too many Hispanic children dropping out of schools in \nNevada. We talk about a dropout rate of over 30 percent, which is some \n200 to 300 percent higher than other children and something we should \nbecome concerned about.\n  Why are so many Hispanic children dropping out of school? The bulk of \nHispanic students who come to Nevada and the western part of the United \nStates are from Mexico. Mexico does not have a tradition of public \neducation. In addition to that, there are language problems that we all \nrealize. We also have the phenomenon that Hispanics are noted for \nhaving a really good work ethic. They believe in working hard. They are \nnot afraid to work. That is a bad combination, because with the \nshortage in the labor market there are people who entice young men and \nwomen who are Hispanic to go to work. That gives them another excuse \nnot to be in high school, because they are making fairly decent money. \nThe fact of matter is, they are still doing those entry-level jobs when \nthey are 55 or 65 years old.\n  We have a problem that we have to identify. The Hispanic students \nhave a dropout rate of 30 percent compared to an overall rate of 11 \npercent. And the 30 percent is lower than it is in a lot of places. \nUnemployment rates for Hispanics is high. That is because, for those \nwho have not finished high school, it is really hard to get a job. \nForty-nine percent of all persons living in Hispanic households receive \nsome type of means-tested assistance.\n  We can make all of these figures disappear with a high school \neducation. We need to do that.\n  As we all know, with this new census that is going to be completed in \na year and a half or so, it is going to show a tremendous rise in the \nnumber of people of Hispanic origin making up the population of the \nUnited States. By the year 2030, Hispanics will make up 20 percent of \nthe population of the United States. Even about 10 years from now, by \nthe year 2010, the Hispanic origin population is projected to become \nthe second largest ethnic group in the United States. Soon, as you \nknow, it will be the No. 1 ethnic group. We need to address the dropout \nproblem in this country for everyone, but especially for the Hispanics. \nHispanic leaders all over America understand this and are working hard. \nBut I think we need to focus on what we can do in the Department of \nEducation to assist them.\n\n  I have spoken to the Hispanic leaders in the State of Nevada and this \nis clearly the No. 1 problem--keeping their youth in school, having \nthem finish high school. That is how the national Hispanic leaders feel \nalso.\n  If we do not address the dropout problem in this country now, we will \nbe faced in the future with a weak and uneducated workforce. We don't \nneed that. We can't stand that. We will have increased unemployment \nrates, increased prison incarceration rates, and an increase of people \non welfare and other Federal assistance programs. By keeping our kids \nin school, we are attacking much larger social and economic problems.\n  It may be a surprise to many, but there is no national plan to lower \nthe dropout rates--there is none--and no targeted program to help \nschools most in need of restructuring to lower dropout rates and raise \nachievement. We would all think this should have been done a long time \nago, but it has not been. I think it is time to keep our children in \nschool. It should become a national priority.\n  Again, unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice \nthose of high school graduates. The probability of falling into poverty \nis three times higher for high school dropouts than for those who have \nfinished high school. The median personal income of high school \ngraduates is twice that of high school dropouts. The median income of \ncollege graduates is three times that of high school dropouts. For the \nfourth time: 82 percent of our people in prisons have not graduated \nfrom high school. Need we go further?\n  So I hope this bill will receive overwhelming support and that we can \nget this bill passed in the House of Representatives. This is something \nthat is important. This amendment is as important as the underlying \nlegislation--I believe more so. I, again, express my appreciation to \nthe people of the State of New Mexico for sending to the Senate someone \nwith the abilities, the skill of Senator Bingaman. This amendment is an \nimportant amendment. It has been an honor for me to work with him on \nthis. I repeat, I hope the Senate overwhelmingly passes this much-\nneeded amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank both Senators for raising this issue. There is \nno question but one of the most severe problems we have--probably the \nmost severe problem we have--is the large number of dropouts in the \nschools. Certainly they have delineated their feelings on that very \naccurately.\n  But I also point out, however, we are dealing this year with the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization. These programs, \nand I am sure there will be others which will be offered on this bill, \nare all worthy of a very substantial examination. In fact, we have \nalready started holding hearings on reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Those hearings are going well. We will be \nholding many more. Two-thirds of all the money we spend in education at \nthe Federal level is on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nThat is where the money is. Thus, that is where these amendments are \nappropriate.\n  I want to assure both Senators that it is my intention to give top \npriority to such programs as those for dropouts. This Nation, however, \nhas a very serious problem with respect to education. The Senator from \nNew Mexico and I sit on the Goals 2000 Panel. We have been there, \nfrustrated, because over the period of time we have been on it we have \nnot had any measurable change in the statistics in this country about \nthe state of our education.\n  The President has appropriately also pointed out the difficulties of \nsocial promotion. We are looking into that, obviously. There are \nprograms that are required for that, but it is not easy to do it \nprogram by program. That is just not the way it should be handled. It \nshould be handled in a coordinated effort, which we are doing, with \nhearings, to fully understand why, for instance, there are dropouts, \nwhy kids are dropping out, before we suddenly come up with a program \nthat is going to attempt to alleviate the problem.\n\n  So I want Members on both sides to please refrain from offering \namendments that should be appropriately considered in the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act's reauthorization, because only with \ncoordinated hearings and sitting down and working together can we come \nup with a coordinated plan to handle all of these very serious issues \nwhich we have. I am hopeful the Senators would withdraw this amendment \nat this time. They have my assurances that we will be discussing fully \nthe matter of school dropouts when we get into the hearing process.\n  We are already into the hearing process. They are all tied together. \nWe did pass, this past year, at least one or two efforts: The Reading \nand Excellence Act, which gets into the questions of why people drop \nout; and we have others that we passed last year that we are studying \nin terms of professional training and all that. There will be other \namendments, I am sure, that we have heard about, that will also be \nright in line addressing the problem.\n  There is one, I understand, on principals, principal training, and \nthere will be a number of other amendments which they will offer. But I \nwant to say I am not willing to accept amendments which will do what \nmay be a good idea because of our purpose right now. Every 5 years we \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We should \nconcentrate on this right now. We have to have a coordinated effort on \nit.\n  First, we must delineate specifically what the students should have \nwhen they leave the school. We know they should read. We have the \nsocial promotion situation that if they don't read, we just push them \non through. The statistics are startling in that regard. Over half of \nthe young people who have graduated from high school have graduated \nfunctionally illiterate. The primary cause of that is social promotion. \nWhat we do to try to alleviate that through ESEA is something we have \nto look into.\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\n  Why do students drop out? We need to look into that very thoroughly. \nObviously, a great deal of that usually occurs in the middle school \narea where young people come through and they don't see any relevance \nof education to their lives. We have to look into how to alleviate the \nmiddle school problem.\n  One of the problems there is the lack of training of principals. That \nis another area we should be looking at in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. But right now I want to be very clear: I do not think we \nshould be using this bill to do that. This bill is one which will just \nhelp the States now to be able to deal with some of these problems with \nmore flexibility in the way they can handle their school systems in the \nallocation of funds. They need that flexibility now to handle these \nproblems. We should concentrate on the reauthorization and not try to \ndo it piecemeal on this bill, which is left over from last year. We got \n10 good bills out. We didn't get this one out. The committee handled \nthe bill. I don't think these were offered as amendments at that time. \nCertainly I had the same attitude then as I do now.\n  With that, I urge Senators seriously to consider not offering these \nat this point and wait for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nto do that.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada \nsought recognition first.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Vermont, the manager \nof this bill, we need flexibility now and I acknowledge that. But we \nalso need something to address these children who are dropping out of \nschool now, 3,000 children a day. I can tell my friends in the \nmajority, they may table this amendment today or tomorrow--whenever \nthey decide they want to do it--but they better get used to voting on \nit. Because every time a bill comes up, whether it is missile defense--\nit doesn't matter what it is--I am going to offer this amendment.\n  Mr. President, 3,000 children are dropping out of school every day \nand we have to do something about it. It received 74 votes last year. \nLet people who voted for this bill last year come and vote against it \nthis year and get it lost in the hole on the other side of the \nCongress.\n  This bill needs to pass. We have children dropping out of school \nevery day, 3,000 of them, 500,000 a year. Eight-two percent of the \npeople we have in prison are high school dropouts. Do you think that is \nsomething we should address, or wait for a 5-year education bill?\n  This is something that people, if they are going to vote against it, \nthey are going to vote against it more than once, because I am going to \nkeep offering this. I do not think there is anything more important we \ncan do than vote on keeping our children in school.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I share the concerns about the dropout \nrate in this country with the Senator from Nevada. I am very familiar \nwith the dropout rate in the State of Ohio and what we tried to do to \ndeal with the problem.\n  I contend that the passage of Ed-Flex will allow many States today to \nbetter utilize the money coming into their State to do a better job in \nthose early years with youngsters so that they will be successful and \nthey will stay in school.\n  For example, in the State of Ohio, we have used the Ed-Flex waiver on \nthe Eisenhower Professional Grant Program to allow teachers to learn \nhow to do a better job of teaching and helping children to learn. We \nhave also allowed some of that money to be used in areas where kids are \nhaving the biggest problem, for example, in reading. We have seen that \nby using Ed-Flex, we have been able to do a much better job helping \nyoungsters to learn, the same way with the waivers that we received in \nOhio under Ed-Flex under title I, to be able to use those dollars in a \nmore efficient way so that we can really make an impact in the lives of \nthe children where the teachers feel that it will do the most good.\n  Again, we have seen the statistics from 1996 and 1998. Where we have \nhad Ed-Flex, the kids are doing better, because they have had a waiver \non the Eisenhower Professional Grant Program under title I.\n  There is no silver bullet in terms of the issue of dropout rates. \nWhen I became Governor of Ohio, I went to the head of the Department of \nCorrections and said to him, What can we do to keep down the prison \npopulation in the State of Ohio? His answer was, Head Start; we have to \nget involved with these youngsters earlier. So we went to town on the \nissue of Head Start, and today my State is the only State where every \neligible child whose parents want them to be in preschool or Head Start \nis in the program. That is the responsibility, I believe, of the \nGovernor of the State and the people involved in the State in \neducation. They need to make these early childhood programs.\n  For example, you will be hearing from me later on in this session in \nterms of the use of TANF money. We have a very good program in our \nState called Early Start, where we are going to families as soon as \nthat baby is born and intervening and trying to make sure that during \nthose first 3 years of a child's life, they develop those learning \ncapacities that they need to be successful in school. Too often these \ndropout programs are dealing with the end of the line, and that is what \nwe, as a government, ought to be doing, making a commitment to \nintervene early on. That is where you can really make a difference in \nterms of having a program that deals with birth to 3, zero to 3, \nintervening earlier in the lives of our children to make that \ndifference.\n  In addition, I think people should understand that there are lots of \ndropout programs in this country. I have been chairman of a group \ncalled Jobs for American Graduates for a couple of years. As a matter \nof fact, Senator Robb from Virginia at one time was head of Jobs for \nAmerican Graduates, and Senator Jeffords is very familiar with the Jobs \nfor American Graduates Program. It is a program that has been in \nexistence for 19 years and has served over 250,000 young people.\n  What we do is, we identify kids in the 12th grade who are in need of \nhelp. We get them into a job club. We intervene, and 90 percent of them \nstay in school. Then we follow them a year afterwards to find out what \nhas happened to them, and they are either in secondary posteducation or \nthey are in the service or they have a job. This program is in \nexistence in about 28 States and territories in the United States.\n  I say to Senator Reid of Nevada, we tried to get the program into the \nLas Vegas school system and they turned us down. Governor Miller tried \nto also do the same thing, and they turned us down. I suggest to \nSenator Reid that he ought to talk with the people in the Las Vegas \nschool system and ask them why they are not part of the Jobs for \nAmerican Graduates Program, the most successful dropout program in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator directing a question toward me?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would be glad to have the Senator answer that, sure.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator would have to ask Senator Miller--a Freudian \nslip there--Governor Miller that question. There are a lot of good \nprograms in the country. That is the whole point of this amendment, \nthat we have to have these amendments, these different programs \navailable to everybody in the country. Then the school districts can \npick and choose those. You may think that program is the best program \nin the country. Others may disagree. But the fact of the matter is, \nthis amendment that I am offering does nothing to take away from the \nability of school districts to manage their schools any way they see \nfit. It does give the resources to the school districts all over the \ncountry that they now do not have. I think it certainly seems that we \nshould have a national strategy for dropouts, which we now do not have.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I point out that today our Jobs for \nAmerican Graduates Program is utilizing--listen to the Federal programs \nthat we are already utilizing. We are utilizing the Joint Training \nPartnership Act. We are using School to Work Opportunities Act. We are \nusing the Wagner-Peyser Act. We are using the Carl Perkins Vocational \nEducation Act funds. We are using the title IV Safe and Drug Free \nSchools funds. We are using the Criminal Justice Crime Prevention \nfunds. We are using welfare reform funds.\n  The point I am making is that, No. 1, the dropout issue is a national \nproblem, but it is primarily the responsibility of State and local \ngovernments. It\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nis up to the Governors and to the local people, local education people \nto respond to the problem. For example, in the JAG program, when I came \nin as Governor, we were spending about $4 million. Today we are \nspending $22 million in the State of Ohio, because we understand how \nimportant it is to try to identify these youngsters who are going to \ndrop out of school and keep them in school. That is just a phase of it.\n  When you talk about dropout, you have to look at the entire specter \nof the cause of the dropout program.\n  I will go back to what Senator Jeffords has just said. It starts out \nwith Early Start. It starts with Head Start. It starts out with \ntechnology in the schools.\n  An interesting story. I went to our prisons and visited those where \nthey are ready to come out into society. I went in and I asked a \nquestion, How many of you graduated from high school? Not one hand went \nup. They were there working with these computers. I asked them what \nthey were doing, and they pointed out to me that they were getting \nready to get their GED. I remember after leaving there--it was about 7 \nor 8 years ago--I said to myself, we have computers in our prisons to \nhelp people get their GED and prepare them to go out, and we didn't \nhave computers in our schools in Ohio. So we undertook a program to \nwire every classroom for voice, video and data. We brought computers \ninto every classroom. It is amazing what is happening in elementary \nschool. What you have to recognize is the reason why a lot of these \nyoungsters drop out of school is they are not doing well. They have not \nhad Head Start. When they get to school, they do not have the tools \nthat are necessary to get the job done.\n  For example, in our State now, we have reduced the class size for \nfirst, second, and third grade to no more than 15 because we know those \nyears are so important. So to stand here and say we need a program for \ndropouts, it seems to me that if we really want to get at the dropout \nproblem in this country, this Congress should sit down and look at all \nthese programs that we have and figure out how we can do a better job \nwith the money we have to really make a difference. And we also ought \nto understand it is not our primary responsibility. It is the \nresponsibility of the Governors; it is the responsibility of those \nlocal school superintendents and those local school boards and the \npeople that are there to get this job done.\n  And for them to send money to Washington and then turn around and \nhave it go back, I do not think is the best way to get the job done. On \nthe other hand, the Federal Government should be trying to figure out \nhow they can be a better partner.\n  I suggest a nice little task force that we could undertake in this \nSenate could sit down and look at these various programs, how do they \nfit together, how can we better maximize those dollars, and maybe look \nat some programs that we already have and say, if we put a little bit \nmore money into this--for example, if we allow the States to use more \nof their TANF money to deal with this big problem, if they do not have \neducation--they will not go on welfare.\n  There are a lot of things that we can do, I think, if we just sat \ndown and looked at what we were doing. And one of the things that we \ncan do, Mr. President, I think, is to pass Ed-Flex because Ed-Flex will \ngive us a little better opportunity to take the Federal money that is \ncoming in and really make a difference in the lives of kids.\n  And one of the things that I heard when I sat in your chair, Mr. \nPresident, during the debate earlier on was about accountability. In \nthose school districts that are getting waivers for Eisenhower \nProfessional Grants, getting waivers for title I, what have we found \nout? We are finding out if the programs are working. The ones that have \nnot asked for waivers, we do not know what they are doing in terms of \nmaking a difference in the lives of children.\n  I say to Senator Jeffords, I think one of the great benefits of the \nEd-Flex program is that when you make application you agree, first of \nall, to waive a lot of State statutes and also rules and regulations, \nbut you also agree that you are going to meet certain standards; and \nyou are held accountable toward those standards.\n  So I am saying to you that the schools in this country, in our 12 \nStates that have taken advantage of Ed-Flex, at least we know whether \nor not some of this Federal money is really making a difference in the \nlives of children. And the more our schools can go to get waivers, I \nthink the more accountability we are going to have. And it is one \naspect I do not think has been talked about enough here on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First, I thank the Senator from Ohio, who has had great \nexperience in this area with respect to being Governor of that State. \nAnd watching what they have done makes me happy to know that we have a \nSenator with us now who has that experience in the immediate past. I \nlook forward to looking to him for guidance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the School \nDropout Prevention and State Responsibilities Act which is aimed at \nlowering the student dropout rate in our nation's schools. We cannot \nhave high expectations that our young people will be prepared for the \nchallenges that lay ahead if they have not attained at least a high \nschool diploma. The fact is that over half a million high school \nstudents drop out each year, joining almost 4 million young Americans \nwho lack a high school diploma and are not in the process of getting \none.\n  Mr. President, it is a bipartisan National Education Goal to increase \nhigh school completion rates to 90 percent and eliminate gaps in the \nrates of graduation among different groups, according to the goals \nestablished by the Governors and the President in 1989. However, there \nhas been no progress in lowering national dropout rates. As a matter of \nfact, there is currently no targeted national funding to help schools \nmost in need of restructuring to lower their dropout rates.\n  To help schools in their efforts to reduce dropout rates, this \namendment would authorize $150 million annually over five years to \ncreate a coordinated national dropout prevention program. Under this \nproposal, States would receive funding according to the Title I \nformula, and would then award competitive grants to schools or local \neducation districts with the highest dropout rates. The goal is to \nenable such schools to implement proven and widely replicated models of \ncomprehensive dropout prevention reforms such as, for example, the \nLansing School District in Michigan, which has established a mentoring \nprogram with community leaders and the ``New Beginnings'' program for \nstudents who have been expelled to keep them in school; and the Detroit \nPublic Schools' successful 9th grade restructuring program which is \nadvancing up to the higher school grades.\n  In addition, this amendment will create a national system of data \ncollection and sharing, so that we have a complete understanding of the \nextent of the dropout problem. If local school districts are to curb \nmiddle and highschool dropout rates, they must have uniform data and \nstatistics. This amendment, which creates a national clearinghouse and \na dropout ``czar'' within the Department of Education, will give middle \nand high schools the tools they need to keep our youngsters in school.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is identical to the legislation that \npassed 74-26 by the Senate during debate last year on the education IRA \nproposal, and was, regrettably, dropped in conference. This is a very \nimportant proposal to help keep young Americans in school and it is my \nhope that my colleagues in the Senate will again adopt this amendment.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 36 To Amendment No. 35\n\n    (Purpose: To honor the Federal commitment to fund part B of the \n              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 36 to \n     amendment No. 35.\n\n       On page 20, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . FUNDING FOR IDEA.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     provisions of this part, other than\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n     this section, shall have no effect, except that funds \n     appropriated pursuant to the authority of this part shall be \n     used to carry out part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.).''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry for not being successful in \ngetting the Senator from New Mexico to withdraw the amendment. I \nunderstand the feelings. But to me, the best way right now that we can \nhelp immediately without having to wait through the whole process is to \nbe dedicated to ensuring that we fully fund the money that is used for \nspecial ed.\n  If we can use all of these funds that we want to be used otherwise \njust to do that, we would free up the States and local governments to \nbe able to handle some of these problems. So I want to make it very \nclear that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act is so important that we cannot prematurely adopt \namendments which would put us in the position of having to undo things \nwhich this body does. It should be done in a very coordinated way that \nwill allow us to thoroughly understand the impact of what we do.\n  I also bring to the Senate's attention the front page of the \nWashington Post this Monday. The Post carried a story regarding the \nmonths of delay which learning-disabled students in Prince Georges \nCounty are experiencing in obtaining educational services. This is \nimportant to know, that we should take action now in this area.\n  Antonio Martin, a 15-year-old resident of Prince Georges County, has \nbeen sitting home for a year waiting for placement in a school that can \nmeet his needs. Today's Post carries a story regarding a Supreme Court \ndecision requiring that schools pay for full-time nursing care in some \nsituations, which will undoubtedly increase costs for any school which \nfinds itself in this situation.\n  But this is not just a Washington problem. This is a problem in every \nschool in every State in the country. When I visit with school board \nmembers or principals in Vermont, funding IDEA, special education, is \nthe first, second, and third thing they want our help on.\n  The amendments that my Democratic colleagues are proposing are all \nwell-intentioned, but they are not responding to what I am hearing from \nVermont educators and educators around this whole country.\n  Vermont's legislators are telling me the same thing. I visited the \nVermont educational communities during the recent recess, and time and \nagain they asked that the Federal Government uphold its commitment to \nfund IDEA. They did so without regard to party. Democrat and Republican \nlegislators agreed that funding IDEA is easily the most important thing \nwe can do by far.\n  Last month, when our committee held hearings on education budget \npriorities, a representative, Al Perry, a Democrat from my good State \nof Vermont, was very persuasive on this point. In 1975, the year I came \nto Congress, we promised that we would provide funding that would be 40 \npercent of the national average per pupil expenditure for each school-\nage child with a disability. We have not delivered on that promise.\n  In fiscal year 1998, we provided 10.8 percent of the excess costs of \neducating children with special needs. If we follow through on this \npromise, we will free up critical local funds. Once we do, local \ncommunities, and not the Federal Government, will be in the position to \ndecide how to spend their local dollars--for teachers, for textbooks, \nfor technology, or for some other locally determined educational \npolicy.\n  Senator Wellstone, yesterday, talked about listening to community \nneeds. Anyone who has done so has probably heard the same thing that I \nhave. The President certainly has--from school boards across the \ncountry and from the Governors. Yet the President has ignored their \nplea. In his budget request for fiscal year 2000, the 25th anniversary \nof IDEA, there is no increase in funding. In his public statements on \neducation, he has ignored IDEA entirely. At a time when no educational \nissue seems to escape the administration's purview, special education \nseems stuck in the White House purgatory.\n\n  A year ago I urged President Clinton to join Congress and keep the \npromise that we all made in 1975. He declined. Again, in December 1998, \nI implored the President to join us in meeting our commitment to \nchildren with disabilities. He ignored it.\n  Instead, the President has made many new promises in his budget for \nfiscal year 2000. But what good are all these new promises if past \npromises are empty in the area of greatest need? Year after year we \nhave seen budget requests from the administration that represent no \nreal funding increase for special education. This constitutes a pattern \nof neglect and a lack of concern that cannot be defended. Children \nsuffer, families suffer, and school districts suffer.\n  In each of the last 3 years, Republican Congresses have increased \nFederal funding for special education by over 85 percent. We are fully \ncommitted to reaching that promise made 24 years ago.\n  I show you a chart. What we have done has been fine, but look at what \nis left to do. In the orange there is what we should be paying but we \nare not paying. That is shown on that chart. If the President thinks \nCongress will take care of business and increase funding for special \neducation, he is right. We will, through this amendment and other \namendments. If he thinks because we will, he can put his funding \npriorities elsewhere, he is wrong.\n  School districts are demanding financial relief. Children's needs \nmust be met. Parents expect accountability. There is no better way to \ntouch a school, help a child, or support a family than to place more \ndollars into special education.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. If we put money into \nIDEA, school districts will be in a position to address class size or \nwhatever they determine to be local priorities. They can ensure that \nchildren like Antonio Martin won't sit in education limbo for months on \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to support this amendment. Now \nthat we have the time to get to the crux of education policy, I welcome \nthis opportunity. The manager of the bill has now advanced this issue \nin terms of the debate and discussion, and I hope we will move beyond \nthe question of whether we are just going to deal with Ed-Flex, because \nthe manager himself has offered this particular amendment.\n  Mr. President, I joined with those back in 1975 to make a commitment \nin terms of trying to address the problems of supporting those children \nin our schools that have special needs. Four million disabled children \ndid not receive the help that they need to be successful in schools. \nFew disabled preschoolers receive services. One million disabled \nchildren were excluded from public schools. Children in this country, \nprior to the 1975 Act, were basically shunted aside in institutions and \ndid not participate in the education system of this country.\n  In 1975 we passed legislation to provide help and assistance. We set \nin the 1975 Act the level of a 40-percent goal for funding to help and \nassist the local communities. I daresay I had thought we might have the \nopportunity in the wake of the Garrett decision yesterday to have an \nopportunity to debate and discuss how we were going to be able to help \nand assist a number of local communities now that will have to provide \nadditional help and assistance to the special needs children. That \nought to be a matter of priority. That ought to be a matter of debate. \nIt ought to be a matter of allocating resources to help and assist \nlocal communities.\n  In many instances, we are finding across America that the needs of \nspecial needs children are being placed against the needs of educating \nthe broader constituency, so we are pitting children against children. \nWhat we ought to try and do is deal with both of these particular \nissues. I am for allocations of resources that move us closer and \ncloser to the level of some 40 percent, which was set as a goal for us \nin the 1975 Act.\n  Let us not lose the fact that under the constitution of every State \nthere is a commitment to educate children in their States. Sometimes \nthey forget this, but they have a solemn responsibility. I don't know a \nsingle State\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\nthat doesn't have that particular requirement. This is going to be \nsomething that we will have to work out with the various States and we \nwill have to work this out with the local communities, but if the \nSenator from Vermont and the Senator from New Hampshire and others want \nto say they want to find additional resources in meeting the needs of \nspecial children, put me on that particular piece of legislation, too, \nbecause I am all for it. I am all for it--not at the expense of these \nother children. No serious educator would put it at the expense of \nother children.\n  If we have better trained teachers in smaller classrooms, we will \nidentify more easily those children that have special needs. If we have \nsmaller class size, we will know which child needs the special \nattention. If we have better trained teachers, the better trained \nteachers will understand which of the children should be involved in \nspecial need programs and which should not. With achievement in reading \nprograms and literacy programs, we may very well help children at the \nearly ages not be qualified in terms of special needs, because they \nwill be advanced and their academic achievement may very well be \nenhanced.\n  If we do the kind of things that the Senator from Ohio just pointed \nout, more and more targeted resources in terms of the children in terms \nof Head Start will be enormously important. We reauthorized Head Start \nlast year. We expanded the Early Start children up to 12.5 percent in \nthat Head Start program, but we are still not doing enough. The Senator \nfrom Ohio points out that it is an admirable effort. In the State of \nOhio they have gone ahead, evidently, and provided the difference \nbetween what is provided by the Federal Government and funds provided \nby the State in order to make sure that every child who is eligible in \nOhio is going to qualify for Head Start. We are only reaching about 40 \npercent of the children across the country. By that early type of \nintervention, we will find out what can be done in terms of special \nneeds children.\n  The bottom line is every educator knows if you have a smaller class \nsize, better trained teachers involved in afterschool programs--all of \nthese help and assist both to make the total numbers of children that \nmight need the kind of special needs less; and, second, to identify \nthose that truly need that help and assistance.\n  So there may be those that want to try and pit the special needs \nchildren against other children, but I hope that would not be what the \nU.S. Senate is about. Parents understand this; schoolteachers \nunderstand it. What we are basically understanding is that is the \nproper way to go.\n  We can understand a legitimate effort to try and address the question \nof the school dropouts, which is a very important and significant \nnational need, a modest amendment that had been considered by the \nSenate, passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support last year. This \nisn't something new. The amendment of the Senators from New Mexico and \nNevada, quite frankly, have more legitimacy to be considered on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate than the Ed-Flex bill, because we have already \nconsidered and passed it. Even so, it is fine if we put that on. It \ncertainly will help strengthen the Ed-Flex bill.\n  However, now we have the parliamentary games to try, instead of \npermitting a thoughtful legitimate amendment that has been considered \nto be debated and finally voted on, to effectively try to emasculate \nthat amendment with the second degree. I want to give assurances to \nthose on that side that we understand; we have been here a certain \nperiod of time as well. We are glad to spend as much time as our \nfriends and colleagues want in debating education. The longer the \nbetter. But we are going to make sure that we are going to have a vote \nup and down on their amendment. This bill will not pass without a vote \nup and down. We can do it either nicely or whatever way they want to do \nit. We have that opportunity. We have that right to do it.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that Connie Garner, Mark Taylor, \nand David Goldberg, legislative fellows in my office, be granted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I support this amendment. I am an original \ncosponsor of this amendment offered by Senator Jeffords. I think it \ngoes to the essence of what is very much the debate which we are about \nto embark on here in the Senate and as a country--at least at the \nFederal level--relative to where we are going in applying the resources \nof the Federal Government when it comes to education.\n  Now, the President has come forward almost on a weekly basis with a \nnew initiative. In fact, I doubt there is a week that has gone by, or \neven hardly a day that went by for a while--while we were in the \nimpeachment trial, there was never a day that went by--without a new \ninitiative on some subject. Now we are in a period where it is weekly.\n  Many of those initiatives have been new ideas in the area of \neducation, which would essentially centralize decisionmaking here in \nWashington; new programmatic ideas that would require Washington's \nimprimatur of approval before they can go forward, before a State can \nuse them; new ways in which to move into the District of Columbia the \ncontrol over our local schools and how local schools are either hiring \nteachers, building additional schools, doing their afterschool activity \nor exercising their initiatives in the area of dropouts.\n  That is a philosophy of government, and I recognize that--the \nphilosophy that all good ideas in education come from Washington, the \nphilosophy that when you manage the schools at the local level, they \nshould have significant influence from Washington in the decisions and \nin the process as to how they are run. That is not a philosophy I am \nattracted to, but it is clearly the philosophy of the other party and \nof this Presidency.\n  Our position, as reflected in this amendment, is significantly \ndifferent. Our position is that, first, before we start any other \nmajor, new programs in education in the Federal Government, new \nprograms that put new costs and burdens on the local communities, we as \na Federal Government have an obligation to live up to what we said we \nwere going to do in the first place.\n  One of the things we said we were going to do back in 1975 was to \ntake care of special ed kids and pay 40 percent of the costs of special \neducation at the local community level. That is one theory we have on \nour side. Let's do what we said we would do first, let's pay for what \nwe said we would pay for first, before we add a bunch of new programs \nthat may or may not be good ideas, but in any event which we don't have \nthe resources for, unless you take them from programs that already \nexist at the Federal level.\n  The second philosophy we have is that the local folks--teachers, \nparents, principals, school boards--know a heck of a lot more about \neducation than we know here in Washington. I can name a couple of kids \nin my local school district because I know them, but I can't name all \nof them. I will bet you the principal at Rye Elementary School can name \nthem and that he knows something about every child, knows some of the \nproblems that child may have. Certainly, the teachers know that. They \nknow what they need in order to address that child's concerns. Maybe \nJohnny Jones has a reading problem and they know he may have to get \nextra reading. If Mary Smith has a problem with attention, they know \nthey have to get a specialist in for that. Maybe it is just as simple \nas they may need a computer in order to allow that child to get a \nlittle extra help that is self-initiated, or a little confidence in \nthemselves. They know what their children need in order to educate them \nbetter. I don't. I can tell you that nobody down at the Department of \nEducation knows, and nobody in this Senate knows better than the \nparents, teachers, and the principals what those children need in order \nto make them better students.\n  I will tell you something else. As Republicans, we don't believe that \nfolks here in Washington have more concern for those kids than their \nparents, teachers, and principals. That seems to be a philosophy we are \nhearing a lot--that in some way, somehow, because we have been granted \nthe office of the Senate, or because we are serving in\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\nthe administration of a President, we suddenly have some knowledge or \ncapability that gives us a better awareness and a more sincere desire \nto help a child than the parent of that child has, the teacher of that \nchild has, the principal in that school has, or the school board has. \nThat, to me, is a lot of hokum. But it is the philosophy, regrettably, \nthat pervades the proposals that have come from this administration.\n  So these are the fundamental differences we have, and they are joined \nin this debate over this amendment: One, that we as a government have \nan obligation to fund what we already have on the books; two, that \nbetter decisions are made at the local community level, not here in \nWashington; three, that we have no special portfolio or no special \nawareness, no higher level of concern for a child's education, than \nthat child's teacher has, or that child's principal has, or that \nchild's parent has.\n  So this amendment says simply that, back in 1975, the Federal \nGovernment said it would pick up 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation in this country. Well, as of 3 years ago, the Federal \nGovernment was only paying 6 percent of the costs of the special \neducation in this country, and what did that do? What did that failure \nof the Federal Government to pay that additional 34 percent do to local \nschools?\n  Essentially, what it did was it skewed the ability of the local \nschool systems to deliver the educational efforts that they desired to \ndeliver, because the local school districts were having to go out and \nuse their tax base, whether was a property tax or a State broad-based \ntax; they were having to use their tax base to pay for the Federal \nshare of special education. So they were basically taking dollars that \nthey should have had available to them from their property taxes--in \nNew Hampshire, for example--and instead of spending then on a new \nclassroom, or a new teacher, or a new computer system, or new books, \nthey were having to take those dollars and pay for the Federal share of \nthe obligations to educate special ed children.\n  Now, I happen to be a very strong supporter of special ed. I chaired \na center for special needs children; I was president for many years. I \nam still on the board. I think 94-142 is one of the best laws this \ncountry has ever passed. One of the insidious aftereffects of the \nFederal Government's obligations to pay under 94-142--to pay its 40 \npercent--is that I saw time after time, in school district after school \ndistrict, a cost to my State--and I know it happens in other States \nbecause I have heard about it from other Senators--that the special \nneeds child was confronted with other parents in the school system who \nfelt that because so much money was being spent on the special needs \nchild, and because so much of the local tax base was being used to help \nthe special needs child, their children weren't getting an adequate \neducation and their children were being unfairly treated.\n\n  But it wasn't the special needs child's fault. That child was just \ngetting the education they had a right to. It wasn't the fault of the \nparent of the special needs child, who usually got most of the abuse at \nthe school meetings. They were just asking for what they had a right to \nhave. They were being put in this terrible position of being confronted \nby other parents who were legitimately angry about the misallocation of \nresources, as they saw it. Why? Not because of anything the special \nneeds child did, or the parents of the special needs child, but because \nthe Federal Government refused to pay its obligation of picking up the \n40 percent of the cost of that child.\n  So 3 years ago, under Republican leadership in this Senate, under the \nleadership of Senator Trent Lott, with a lot of effort by such people \nas Senator Jeffords from Vermont, myself, and Senator Collins from \nMaine, we made a commitment to do something about this, to pay our fair \nshare of special needs. In fact, S. 1 in the last Congress said we were \ngoing to put ourselves, as a Congress, on a ramp that would allow us to \npay special needs children the 40 percent. It would take us 10 years, \nbut we would get there. Then we backed that up with appropriations. \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania, 3 years in a row, has dramatically \nincreased the funding for special needs, for IDEA--$740 million in the \nfirst year, $690 billion in the second year, and $509 billion last \nyear. I think those are the numbers. It essentially has meant almost a \ndoubling of the commitment to the special needs child by this Congress.\n  Do you know something? The administration didn't support any of it. \nThis administration, which is so committed to education, has not sent a \nbudget up to this Congress in the last 3 years that has called for any \nsignificant increase in special ed. They are playing a shell game on \neducation. What they are doing, in fact, is they are borrowing money \nthat should be going to special ed in order to fund all these new \ninitiatives, so that members of this administration can go across the \ncountry and say, ``I am for this new program,'' or, ``I am for that new \none,'' ``We are going to put a billion dollars into that and $500 \nmillion into that.'' Where do they get that money? They take it from \nthe special needs child. How much did they ask for in new funding for \nspecial education in this budget? We presently spend $4.3 billion. On \nspecial education, how much did they ask for as an increase? $3.3 \nmillion. That is what the administration asked for--$3.3 million out of \na $4.3 billion budget, which only accounts for, by the way, out of that \n$4.3 billion, 11 percent of the cost of special education. We are \nsupposed to be paying 40 percent.\n\n  So, under this Republican Congress, we have taken it from 6 percent \nto 11 percent. That is good news. The bad news is, we still have a long \nway to go. The bad news is that still in every school district across \nthis country, local school leaders, principals, PTAs, school boards, \nare having to take money they would have otherwise used maybe to add a \nteacher, maybe to build a building--where have we heard that before?--\nmaybe to do an afterschool program, maybe to put a computer in, to put \nan arts program in, a language program in. Instead of taking the money \nthey would have used for those programs, they are having to take that \nmoney and having to use it to fund the gap that remains in the Federal \nobligation to pay for special education.\n  Just yesterday, the Supreme Court in the Cedar Rapids case made it \nvery clear that that gap isn't going to get smaller, it is going to \naccelerate dramatically, because the Supreme Court decided that, as a \nmatter of education, the person had a right to health care while in the \nschool system. Many of these children need extraordinary health care. \nKids we dealt with in the center I was involved in required immense \nhealth care. So that is going to increase the cost of special education \neven further.\n  What is going to happen for every dollar increase that comes about as \na result of the need and as a result of this new Supreme Court \ndecision? The local school district is going to fall further behind. It \nis going to have to take more taxes than it would have used to buy \nbooks and to add teachers and to build new buildings, more of those \ntaxes, and have to move them and reallocate them to special education. \nSo it is going to become worse. The situation is going to become worse. \nWhy? Because this administration refuses to fund special education or \neven make an attempt to address it in any aggressive way. Instead, it \ncomes forward with program after program after program, borrowing from \nspecial education funds to do that, and, as a result, leaves the \nspecial education child out on the street while it puts out its press \nreleases.\n  We are going to debate this, as the Senator from Massachusetts said. \nI look forward to that debate. If the Senator wants to filibuster the \nEd-Flex bill, which has been supported in the last Congress, supported \nin this Congress, supported by the President, and is supported by \nmembers of both parties, a bipartisan bill, if he wants to filibuster \nthe Ed-Flex bill, that is his choice. But the fact is that what he is \nreally filibustering is special needs children. What he is \nfilibustering is the ability of local communities to manage their \ndollars more effectively so that we take care of special needs children \nand the other children who are in our school system. It is ironic and I \nthink inappropriate to filibuster. But it sounds as if that is what we \nare going to get. Ed-Flex, a program defended and supported in the last \nCongress by the majority of the Congress, a program supported by the \nPresident, a\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nprogram supported by the Secretary of State, is now going to be \nfilibustered because people do not want to fund special education--a \nvery interesting approach to government.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to this debate, I look forward to a lot \nof it, because I do think that the American people need to learn just \nhow irresponsible this administration has been on the funding of \nspecial education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, perhaps the good Senator didn't hear me. \nWe are prepared to accept the amendment. So if there is no other \nspeaker on it, we are prepared to vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator accept this amendment on any other \ninitiatives, which are appropriate, which are going to have funding for \nthe purpose of education?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have this bill up now. The Senator has offered the \namendment. In behalf of this side, we are prepared to accept it right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the amendment offered by Senator Jeffords. The amendment would \nrequire the federal government to make good on its commitment to fund \nspecial education before it made any additional promises it might not \nkeep.\n  When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nin 1975, the federal government made a commitment to the states and to \nthe local school districts to help states meet the cost of special \neducation. The federal government promised to pay each state 40 percent \nof the national average per capita cost of providing elementary and \nsecondary education for each student receiving special education. For \nthe school year 1996-1997, the national average expenditure was $5,913 \nper student. The federal payment to the states, however, was only $636 \nper student or slightly more than ten percent of the total cost and \nabout one fourth of the $2,365 promised.\n  We must meet our commitment to special education and end this \nunfunded mandate. Maine is promised $80 million by the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. Yet, in 1998, it received less than $20 \nmillion toward the $200 million federal law requires the state to spend \non special education. In short, special education is an unfunded \nfederal mandate of $60 million that must be met by the citizens of \nMaine through already burdensome state income and local property taxes. \nThis accounts for millions of dollars annually that can not be used for \nschool construction, for teacher salaries, for new computers, or for \nany other state effort to improve the performance of our elementary and \nsecondary school students.\n  We need to increase federal spending on education, but we do not need \nnew federal categorical programs with more federal regulations and \ndollars wasted on administrative costs. Rather, we need to meet our \ncommitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. As the \nGovernor of Maine told President Clinton last week, ``If you want to do \nsomething for schools in Maine, then fund special education and we can \nhire our own teachers and build our own schools.'' This is true for \nevery state. The best thing this Congress can do for education is to \nfully fund our share of special education and at the same time return \ncontrol of the schools to the states and local communities by passing \nthe Education Flexibility Act.\n  These two actions will empower our states and communities to meet the \nchallenge of improving schools. Instead of presuming that we in \nWashington know what is best for every school across the country, let \nus acknowledge that each of our individual states and towns knows what \nis needed on a state-by-state and community-by-community basis. I urge \nmy colleagues to give our states and local communities the financial \nsupport they have been promised and the freedom to educate our students \nas they see fit. We can do this by adopting this amendment to fully \nfund the federal share of special education and then passing the Local \nControl of Education Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened to our friend and colleague \nfrom New Hampshire speak about the education budget and about the \nexpenditures in the areas of education. I just want to review here, in \nthis time, for a few moments, exactly what has been the record of our \nRepublican friends in the House and Senate, and the administration, \nover the period since 1994 when the Republicans took over the \nleadership in the Congress.\n  After 1994, on March 16, 1995, one of the first acts of the new \nRepublican House of Representatives was to ask for a $1.7 billion \nrescission on all education programs below what was enacted in the \nappropriations the year before. That is an extensive rescission, no \nmatter how you cut it. This is in all the education programs of 1994. \nThey asked to cut back $1.7 billion. The final rescission bill that \npassed on July 27, 1995, was $600 million below 1995. So, as we are \nlooking over, now, and listening to who is interested in education, I \nhope our colleagues will at least give some attention, when they are \nreviewing the record, as to who has been interested and who has been \ncommitted, judging by the allocation of resources. Resources themselves \ndo not solve the problems of education, but they are a pretty good \nindication of a nation's priorities.\n  What we had as the first order of business in 1995 in the House \nrescission bill was to move ahead with a major cut of $1.7 billion for \nthe appropriations the year before. Now, in the first full funding \ncycle, the 1996 House Appropriations, in August of 1995, cut $3.9 \nbillion below 1996. Then the continuing resolution ended up at $3.1 \nbillion below 1996. This was at a time when we had the memorable \nshutdown of the Government. The President said, That is too much, you \nwill be cutting the heart out of many of these education programs. That \nwas one of the principal reasons he went toe-to-toe with the Congress, \nbecause of those dramatic cuts in the area of education. Finally, there \nwas a continuing resolution after the Senate adopted a Specter-Harkin \namendment to restore $2.7 billion. We saw a bottom line $400 million \nbelow fiscal year 1996.\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\n  In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below the President's. This \nis rather extraordinary to me, that Members on the other side can stand \nup and talk and criticize the President on appropriations when you have \nthis kind of record to defend--$3.1 billion below the President's. My \ngood friend from New Hampshire ought to be talking to the Republican \nappropriators. Mr. President, $3.1 billion below what the President \nasked for, that was the Senate bill. The final agreement, after \nextensive negotiation thankfully moved the appropriation up, was to \n$3.5 billion above what the President asked for; as a result of the \nadministration's position, a $6 billion swing in education funding.\n  Then, in 1998, both the House and Senate bills were $200 million \nbelow the President's. Again, after tough negotiation the final \nagreement was $3.4 billion above, over 1997.\n  Mr. President, these are fairly significant figures. All of us are \nconcerned about education policy. I know my friend and colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, has long stood for making sure that we, as a \ncountry, and as a matter of principle, focus on and provide greater \nsupport for education as a national priority, so I appreciate his \ncommitment, his position in these decisions. But we have to look at the \nbottom line. Coming into 1999, fiscal year 1999, they are still cutting \nbelow the President's investment. The House bill, in June of 1998, \nwhich was for the fiscal year 1999, was $2 billion below the \nPresident's; the final agreement was $3.6 billion over 1998.\n  This is the record. Year after year after year those appropriations \ncommittees, which are effectively controlled by the Republican \nleadership, have consistently underfunded education. So it does not \ncome, I don't think, with good grace, to suggest that somehow we have \nan administration or President who is not strongly committed--whether \nit has been to the special needs children or all the children in this \ncountry. We all are mindful that even with these kinds of \nappropriations we only are spending probably 4 cents out of every \ndollar, maybe 5 cents out of every dollar, in education. You get 2 more \ncents for the food program, so the total considered to be the moneys \nthat are spent locally, about 6 cents, is the Federal funding. But 2 \ncents of that has to do with nutrition. We are talking about 4 cents.\n  This is a major item, obviously, the title I program, but there is \nalso some in excess of $4 billion in special needs. The Head Start \nprograms and others are certainly enormously important, and they can \ncertainly use additional resources.\n\n  Federal education funding rose from $23 billion in 1996 to $33.5 \nbillion in 1999, an increase of $10.5 billion, or 46 percent. That is a \npretty good indication of at least this President's priorities in the \neducation area. So, we hope when we come back here at 2:15 we will move \nahead and accept this. We are, I believe, on this side, strongly \ncommitted to trying to find every scarce dollar resource to fund these \neducation programs.\n  As I mentioned, with the Supreme Court holding of yesterday, we do \nhave, I think, additional kinds of responsibilities. It was that aspect \nof the statement of the Senator from New Hampshire with which I agree. \nWith that holding, there will be additional kinds of demands on local \ncommunities. I do think we ought to try to find additional resources on \nthat particular measure, and we will certainly work with all in this \nbody to see what can be done to gain those resources and support.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has made \nan excellent point. I do not argue with him. I, in fact, would have \nsupported those appropriations and have supported the appropriations \nthat have been recommended for education totally.\n  I think the point Senator Gregg was making was that this \nadministration does not place high enough priority on IDEA. I think the \nrecord bears this out. While the administration's proposed new programs \nincrease funding elsewhere, it has shortchanged IDEA. The funding we \nare charged with under our promises and under the law as it reads--to \nfund 40 percent of the cost of special education--those costs are going \nup and are really making it difficult for our local communities to \ncarry out other programs that have been recommended to help them. So I \njust wanted to make sure everyone recognizes that.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will put in the Record the actual \nfunding levels, in terms of the IDEA. In 1995, it was $3.2 billion; in \n1996, it was $3.2 billion; in 1997, it was $4 billion. They are numbers \nthat have to be rounded out--$4.35 billion. In 1998, it is $4.5 \nbillion. And in 1999, it is $5 billion; the current is $5.54 billion, \nand the President's request was for $5.106 billion. The total increase \nfrom 1995 to the present is, therefore, an increase from $3.2 to $5.54 \nbillion. That is a significant increase. I say to our colleagues, much \nof that was attributed to our Republican friends who made it a \npriority. Quite frankly, we joined in that effort; I think the record \nwould reflect that.\n\n  I will say, though, that we were able to see that kind of increase \nwhile we were also able to see an increase in the other programs as \nwell. It wasn't an either/or position. That is what I hope will result \nthis afternoon, after we have had a good discussion and debate.\n  We are strongly committed on this side to finding additional \nresources for the funding of that program. We will work with our \ncommittee chair to see how this last Supreme Court decision is going to \nimpact local communities. I think that is enormously important. We are \ncommitting ourselves at this time, the day after that decision, to work \nclosely, because we do think that there are going to be some very \nimportant additional burdens on local communities with that decision \nabout the scope of the ADA, including educational and health support. I \nthink there is going to be a call for additional help and assistance. \nWe will certainly work with the chair to try and deal with that.\n  I have had the chance to talk with a leader on our side, Senator \nHarkin, who has been such a leader on so many of these issues affecting \nthe disabled. He is in strong support of trying to find ways to help \nand assist local communities as well. I am sure we will be addressing \nthis probably later in the day.\n  I wanted at this time to make sure that our membership understood \nwith that decision we are going to look forward to working in a \ncooperative way with the chair of the committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, just very briefly, I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his desire to join us in trying to push for more \nfunds for special education. I hope we can be successful with our joint \nefforts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, will the \nSenator join me in indicating to the Senate the excellent results of \nthe Senate Finance Committee this morning on legislation which the \nSenator from Vermont and I have worked on closely with Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan. There was a very positive bipartisan result, as I \nunderstand, 16 to 2, and although it is not directly related to \neducation, it is directly related to the issue of employment of the \ndisabled. Perhaps the good Senator would want to indicate to the \nmembership the success of the Finance Committee in reporting that out.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing that to \nmy attention. I enjoyed working with the Senator. We introduced it \njointly together, and your support, although you are not on the Finance \nCommittee, has been most helpful in ensuring its success. We had a good \nhearing. There are a couple amendments which may come about, which I \nthink can be taken care of without any serious diminution of the impact \nof the bill.\n  I say on behalf of all the Senators on the committee and those that \nhave signed on, we now have 62 cosponsors to that bill. This is an \nincredible step forward for people with disabilities who desire to \nwork. I do not think there are\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nvery many who don't desire to work. They have been placed in this \nincredibly terrible position of, if you go to work, you lose your \nhealth care and you lose your SDI benefits or other benefits that you \nhave to help you live. You just cannot do it except under very unusual \ncircumstances.\n\n  Thus, we have finally opened the door, after many years. The Senator \nworked on all these issues, too, starting with the bill that we have \nbeen talking about, special education, back in 1976, when we passed \nwhat is called IDEA. That opened the first big door, and that is to get \nan education. Without an education, you do not have any hope of being \nable to be employed.\n  Since then, we have marched up through with ADA. I remember one of \nthe amendments I had, which probably created the most stir, was when I \nwas with John Brademas on his committee. I said, John, do you realize \nthat the Federal Government is exempt from 504, which removes barriers \nfor people with handicaps? He said, No. He said, Well, let us fix it. \nSo over in the House, you have the day when you put all these \nunimportant amendments through and nobody looks at them. We had a \nlittle committee amendment on that which affected all the Federal \nbuildings. I remember it well because when I got back to the office a \ncouple days later, somebody had finally read the bill. It was filled \nwith the head of the Post Office and everybody else asking me if I knew \nwhat I had done. I said, well, I didn't know how important it was until \nnow, but that got the Federal Government by.\n  Then we worked together on assisted technology as well. That bill we \nreauthorized last year, which is incredibly important at this time, to \nassist all those people with disabilities to have a better opportunity \nof getting employed because they have the assistance of technology to \ndo that.\n  It is a great day. I am confident that we certainly will prevail on \nthe Senate floor. I think that the two Senators who have some problems \nwe can take care of, but I thank you for your tremendous support over \nall the years we have been working together.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I think this is \nperhaps in some respects the most notable thing that we will achieve \ntoday. As important as this is, with the reporting out of that \nparticular bill, which is really, as the Senator has pointed out, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, we effectively attempted to eliminate \ndiscrimination against those that had disability. It was enormously \nimportant, and we made extraordinary success. But to really breathe \nlife into that legislation, you have to make sure that not only is the \nindividual not going to be discriminated against in getting the job, \nbut that they are also not going to have these barriers placed in front \nof them in holding the job which were there in terms of their \nelimination of their health care support and any other kinds of support \nservices. That was the purpose of this legislation that was reported \nout with very strong bipartisan support.\n  We look forward, hopefully, to being able to act on that at an early \ntime.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am sure the Senator shares this with me, too. There \nwere some staff members--Pat Morrissey on my staff had been working on \nthis for 20 years or more, I guess. I know on the Senator's staff, \nmembers have had similar input. I think we ought to remember who it \nreally is sometimes that moves this legislation along.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will include my good staffer. Connie has been working \nsome 20 years, as well, on these. I agree with the Senator that they \nhave just provided invaluable service. And for all those that work \nhere, I hope they do recognize and get the sense of satisfaction, \nprofessional satisfaction, from really making the important difference \nin people's lives.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nTennessee for his hard work and the good work he has done on the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. This has been a task of \nassembling the right components that were acceptable to a broad range \nof interests and reflecting the capacity of States and local \ncommunities to make good decisions. I think the Senator has done an \noutstanding job. I am pleased to have the privilege of being a \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  Under this legislation, the State of Missouri, my own State, as well \nas every other State in the Nation, will no longer have to come to \nWashington on a piecemeal, case-by-case basis to ask for relief from a \nmyriad of Federal education statutes and regulations. Instead, Missouri \nwill have the authority to waive regulations that hinder our schools \nfrom providing an excellent education for our students.\n  Now, I know that the occupant of the Chair is a former Governor and \nhad a lot of involvement with individuals in the education effort which \nis focused at the State level. I remember those days well from my time \nas Governor. It is most satisfying to try to do something to advance \nthe performance of students. We understand that when students perform \nwell and have great skills, it elevates the potential they enjoy for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  It was always a tremendous matter of concern to me--and I am sure to \nthe occupant of the Chair--how Federal administrative burdens impeded \nthe efforts of States rather than accelerated their capacity to help \nstudents perform. I think most Governors and former Governors we talked \nto would agree that Federal mandates and requirements associated with \nFederal programs can hinder a State's flexibility and, as a result, \nthey cut into the dollars that could be spent on students. They end up \nbeing spent on bureaucracy--not just bureaucracy here in Washington, \nbut a corresponding bureaucracy to deal with the Washington bureaucracy \nthat has to be established and maintained in the States.\n  In response to the question of whether we should impose Federal \neducation standards from Washington, Governor Whitman of New Jersey \nsaid, and I think she said it well,\n\n       What you see now is a huge waste of money on bureaucracy. \n     The more government strings that are on these dollars, the \n     more difficult it becomes to deliver education. If the money \n     that the Federal Government now puts out is too finite and it \n     says you can only spend it for this or for that, that money \n     won't go toward helping students learn, and that's what we \n     want.\n\n  I agree with the entirety of the statement--``helping students learn, \nand that's what we want''--and the last line should be the motivation \nfor every one of us not only in the Senate but across America. I simply \ncouldn't agree with Governor Whitman more.\n  States and local schools need more flexibility in how to spend \neducation dollars, to spend them in ways that will help students learn. \nThey are in the best position to make decisions about the education of \nstudents. I have to believe that being on site adds value to one's \ncapacity to make an accurate diagnosis or assessment of what is needed.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak regarding the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act of 1999, which will provide States and \nlocal schools with the kind of flexibility they need to improve \neducation and to elevate student performance.\n  One of our Nation's highest priorities is to ensure that our children \nreceive the kind of challenging and rigorous education that will \nprepare them for success. By building a strong educational foundation \nthat focuses on the concept of high academic excellence, we will \nprepare students to make important career decisions and to become \nlifelong learners. The habit of education should extend beyond school. \nAs a result, their lives will be enriched.\n  We in Congress should develop and support Federal policies that will \npromote the best education practices in\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\nour States and local schools. We have learned from reports and studies \nthat successful schools and successful school systems are characterized \nby parental involvement in the education of their children. They are \ncharacterized by parental involvement and local control, and they \nemphasize basic academics and make resources available to the \nclassroom. These are the ingredients needed to elevate educational \nperformance.\n  It is with this in mind that we should stop and ask ourselves whether \nthe current Federal education laws contain the elements that further \nour goal of giving our kids a world-class education. The unfortunate \nanswer to that question is, our current laws don't do that; the answer \nis no. A number of our Federal education programs contain a plethora of \nregulations and restrictions that hinder States and local schools, \nhinder their ability to tailor and design what is needed in the local \ncircumstance to advance the opportunity for students to learn. Whenever \nthey hinder and obstruct that opportunity to tailor and design the \nright system, they waste the education dollars.\n  Frequently, education dollars that Washington directs in terms of how \nto spend them are wasted because the how-to doesn't meet the need of \nthe students and the school district.\n  While the Federal Government has played an important but limited role \nin providing funding for education, it has also played a conflicting \nrole by attaching so many conditions and strings to Federal dollars \nthat it costs States and local schools a lot of time and resources to \ncomply with all the rules and regulations.\n  We have heard much about the paperwork burdens created by the Federal \neducation rules and regulations. The Federal Department of Education \nrequires States and school districts to complete over 48.6 million \nhours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This is a \nstatistic that is mind boggling. That translates into the equivalent of \n25,000 employees working full time just to do the paperwork for States \nto get their own money back to educate the students, which the State \ncares enough about to work hard to make sure that they are trying to \nelevate the students' performance.\n  We heard that in Florida it takes 374 employees to administer $8 \nbillion in State funds, while it takes 297 State employees to oversee \n$1 billion in Federal funds--6 times as many per dollar. So that to do \nthe paperwork and create the paper trail and all the paper involvement, \nto be a recipient of Federal funds, it takes six times as many \nemployees as it does to follow a dollar of State funding in Florida.\n  We know it takes a school nearly 20 weeks, 216 steps, to complete a \ndiscretionary grant process within the Department of Education. The \nDepartment has boasted that it has streamlined the process, because it \nused to take 26 weeks and 487 steps from start to finish; now it is \nonly 216 steps in the bureaucratic jungle. With this bureaucratic maze, \nit is no wonder we lose about 35 cents out of every Federal education \ndollar before it reaches the classroom.\n  If I were to give my children a dollar and, before I got it from my \nhand to their hand, I took 35 cents out of the dollar, they would know \nthe difference. We tell ourselves that we are doing great things for \neducation, but before the dollar reaches the student, 35 cents is taken \nout of the dollar. They know the difference. The difference is felt. \nAnd then sometimes we are telling them it has to be spent in a way that \ndoesn't elevate student performance.\n  Current Federal laws, of course, can also be inflexible, requiring \nthe Federal education dollar to be spent only for a narrow purpose, to \nthe exclusion of all others. This type of inflexibility hurts schools \nthat have needs other than the ones prescribed by the Federal \nGovernment. A recent example was the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively \nfor classroom size reduction for the early elementary grades. What a \nnoble aspiration. But it wasn't what a number of schools needed. \nGovernor Gray Davis of California recently described how the \ninflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to \ndirect Federal funds to areas where they are most needed. Governor \nDavis said:\n\n       We need to have the flexibility to apply those resources \n     where we think they could best be used.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       For example, I was just with Secretary Riley, our U.S. \n     Secretary of Education, for 2 days last week in California. \n     And Secretary Riley was telling me about the $1.2 billion \n     that was appropriated to reduce class size to 18 in the first \n     3 grades. Now, in California, we are already down to 20 \n     students per class size in K through four. So that money, \n     which is supposed to be earmarked to the area where we have \n     pretty much achieved the goal, would best serve our needs by \n     reducing class size in math and English at the tenth grade \n     level, because we have just started to use a high school \n     graduation exam.\n\n  Here is a State wanting to elevate the performance of students, with \na massive Federal program directed at an area where they have already \naddressed the problem, but it is ineligible to be used in an area where \nthey need help. We should really understand this. That is why we are \nproposing in this Ed-Flex program a massive new capacity on the part of \nStates to use money where it is needed, to use money to help get the \ndollar all the way to the student, and not take 35 cents out of the \ndollar when it is on its way from the folks in Washington to the \nclassroom where the student studies.\n  Another example is found in title I, which authorizes aid for the \neducation of disadvantaged children. Some of the rigid standards in \nthis program can result in a school losing its ability to provide \nintensive services to students on a schoolwide basis because it fails \nby 1 percentage point to have the requisite number of children below a \ncertain income level. Such policies fly in the face of one ingredient \nfor educational success, one vital ingredient: local control.\n\n  Fortunately, there is a current Federal policy that has helped \nprovide more flexibility and relieve States of regulatory burdens that \nare associated with otherwise inflexible education dollars. Under the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, the Department \nof Education has delegated its authority to 12 participating States to \ngrant individual school districts waivers from certain Federal \nrequirements that hinder States and schools in their efforts to improve \ntheir education programs. Under Ed-Flex--this proposal, not just for \nthe 12 States, but for all 50 States--school districts do not have to \nmarch up to Washington each time they want to ask for a waiver. \nInstead, they can get the waiver from their own State.\n  The Ed-Flex program, as it is called, has reduced paperwork burdens. \nThat sounds good, to reduce paperwork, but when you take the expensive \npaperwork out of the equation, more of the resource reaches the \nclassroom. Sure, it is good to reduce paperwork, but it is even better \nto deliver the resource to the site of learning, where students learn.\n  For example, in response to a perceived need, Texas schools have been \nable to direct some of their Federal funds from the title II Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program, which is targeted primarily for \nscience and mathematics, to reading, English language, arts, and social \nstudies. If you need help in English and the arts and social studies, \nwhy not be able to focus the attention there?\n  In Howard County, MD, Ed-Flex authority has allowed schools to \nprovide additional instruction time in reading and math to better meet \nthe needs of their students. Well, you mean a program that serves the \nneeds of the students instead of serving the plan of the bureaucracy? \nWhat a good program.\n  These are all States that have been allowed, in the 12-State pilot \nprogram, to have this kind of flexibility--it is interesting that they \nare moving resources to help students. Oregon used its waiver authority \nto simplify its planning and application process so that its school \ndistricts can develop a single plan that consolidates the application \nfor Federal funds. Well, that is great. Instead of spending more money \non paperwork, we are making resources available to the classrooms where \nstudents study and achieve.\n  In Vermont, they have reported that the greatest advantage of having \nEd-Flex is the ability of schools and districts to gain waivers without \nhaving to go directly to the Department of Education. The fact that the \nState can grant waivers with a minimum of redtape encourages schools \nand districts to ask for waivers they might not otherwise have asked \nfor. You see, the intimidation factor of Federal regulation\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nis one that is hard to assess. But here is the State of Vermont \nbasically saying they were lacking creativity in their schools and \npeople didn't bother to try to ask for the waiver. They went ahead and \ndid what Washington said, in spite of the fact that it may not have \nbeen best for students, because they had been intimidated. The process \nwas too complex. The desire to get a waiver may never have been really \nstrong enough to get them past the Federal bureaucracy. But the schools \nare now doing things, trying things, delivering help to students, \nmeeting needs at the site of learning, rather than meeting the appetite \nof the bureaucracy.\n  Other Ed-Flex States have used the waiver authority to include all \nschool improvement resources in a single 34-page plan rather than 8 \nseparate plans totaling 200 pages. Can you imagine that? If you can \nmove the paperwork down in the direction of sort of manual operations \nfrom 200 pages to 34 pages, you will cut out that kind of paperwork and \nyou are cutting out a wasted resource, and when you stop wasting, you \ncan start delivering.\n  I am sure this next item is of special interest to the occupant of \nthe Chair, who served as the chief executive of Ohio. Reports indicate \nthat Ohio used its Ed-Flex authority to significantly reduce paperwork \nin the schools. The education agency of the State also reduced its \npaperwork. This is great news to hear. Ohio is the State that reported \nat one time that 52 percent of all the paperwork--I think that is \nright; the Chair might correct me--required of their school districts \nwas related to participation in Federal programs while the Federal \ndollars were about 5 percent of the State's total education budget. \nThat means we are costing people a lot in terms of paperwork to get a \nvery small amount of the resource. It is time we freed the system from \nthe burden of paperwork so it can get moving forward to the task of \nhelping students.\n\n  States are finding that flexibility and regulatory relief they have \ngotten under the Ed-Flex program has caused increased student \nperformance. Texas has found that its schools with Ed-Flex waivers made \ngains that match--and in many instances exceed--those as a whole in the \nState. And frequently those schools with the waivers were ones that \nwere especially challenged.\n  Because of the success of the Ed-Flexibility Partnership \nDemonstration Program, we need to expand this concept to every State in \nAmerica. In my home State of Missouri, we don't currently have broad \nauthority, the kind of authority we need to waive the Federal \nregulations that keep our schools from improving education programs. In \nthe past few years, my State, as well as local districts in Missouri, \nhave had to come to Washington on a number of occasions and ask for \nwaivers of certain Federal education statutes so they could administer \ntheir programs in such a way that they can better serve their students. \nIt doesn't make any sense for a State or a school district to keep \ncoming to Washington time after time to beg for permission to help \ntheir students. It seems like we could agree that we would allow States \nto help their students.\n  That is why I support the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of \n1999, because it gives the States the authority on their own to grant \nto schools waivers of Federal statutes and regulations for many Federal \neducation programs. States will also be expected to grant waivers of \ntheir own regulations which schools believe are barriers to improving \neducation programs. This is a design--a conspicuous and conscious \ndesign--to deliver resources to classrooms where students learn and \nimprove their performance.\n  Around the Nation, Governors of both political parties have called \nfor quick passage of this legislation as it will allow educators to \ndesign and to deliver federally funded education dollars in ways that \nmeet the needs of students. As a former Governor, I know how important \nit is for a State and its local school districts to have decisionmaking \nauthority over educational matters. The closer the decisionmaking is to \nthe local level, I feel, the better.\n  States and local schools are in a better position to know what \nprograms work in their community and elicit the necessary enthusiasm \nand response from their families which are being served.\n  I also know that States want to show that their education reforms \nwill actually improve quality of education. When I was Governor of \nMissouri, I also served as chairman of the Education Commission of the \nStates--all 50 States, legislators, governors, school board officials--\nthe Education Commission of the States. During that time I emphasized a \npoint. And it was this: We must insist that our reform programs create \na current of educational improvement. We must show that reforms \nactually help our children learn more.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Ed-Flex boosts educational achievement \nby allowing States to direct resources where they will get to the \nclassroom and help students learn.\n  So today I want to voice my strong support for the Educational \nFlexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Under this legislation, Missouri \nschools and schools across America no longer have to come to Washington \nto seek education waivers one at a time. But they will have more \nflexibility to administer federally funded education programs in ways \nthat boost student achievement, and ultimately have as a result more \ncapable students.\n  States and local schools want more flexibility because they have the \nbest ideas of what will work in their communities. And they want the \nability to take that good news to the students of their schools. \nImportant education groups in my State such as the Missouri State \nTeachers Association and the Missouri School Board Association have \nsaid that flexibility and local control are important goals in Federal \neducation policy.\n  The Ed-Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 helps to accomplish these \ngoals. This bill, Ed-Flex, will ultimately help to improve educational \nopportunities for the children in my State and all over the country by \nreducing the Federal redtape involved currently with trying to comply \nwith Federal rules and regulations related to educational programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2257-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2257-S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for \ngiving us this time, and my colleague, Senator Kerry, for his \nleadership on this issue. I also appreciate Senator Kerry's willingness \nto set aside some of the partisanship that divides us on this issue. \nThere are too many good ideas that Republicans and Democrats share in \ncommon for us not to make significant progress on the issue that is on \nthe minds of most parents, perhaps, more than any other--the education \nof their children.\n  While Senator Kerry and I will not be introducing our amendment today \nto this legislation, I think it is important that we take this \nopportunity to raise the issue of principal training and development.\n  After speaking with educators, parents, principals, and teachers in \nboth Oregon and in Massachusetts, it became clear to Senator Kerry and \nI that our principals are too often not prepared to address the needs \nof our children. As Senator Kerry has said many times, we can't expect \nour schools to be well managed without good managers. It is time to \nprovide our States and school districts with the resources to train our \nprincipals as managers.\n  Our proposal would provide States the needed resources for the \ndevelopment and training of excellent principals, and the retraining of \ncurrent principals to improve the way they manage our schools. This \ncompetitive principals' challenges grant will allow States to develop \nprograms that focus on providing principals with effective \ninstructional skills and increased understanding of the effective use \nof educational technology and the ability to implement State content \nperformance standards.\n  Throughout the debate on the Ed-Flex bill, we have heard a lot about \nthe need for greater accountability. Our proposal does not expect the \nStates to be accountable. Our proposal requires accountability. State \neducational agencies must specify how the Federal funds will be used \nfor principal training programs, how the use of these funds will lead \nto improved student achievement and provide, through annual evaluation, \nevidence of such improvement having occurred.\n  Importantly, this proposal does not dictate to the States how to \nimplement these programs. Rather, it gives States the opportunity, the \nresources, and the support to create programs that meet the needs of \nevery school district, rural and urban.\n  Mr. President, as we continue to debate education reform in the \nSenate, I believe that we must include a component that reforms the way \nin which our\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\nschools are managed. We have some excellent principals in our school \ndistricts in Oregon, in Massachusetts, and all over the country. We now \nhave an opportunity to recruit excellent principals. They are the CEOs \nof our schools. We should ensure that every principal has the resources \nand training to be a successful manager.\n  Senator Kerry and I believe that our principals' challenges grant \nproposal is a strong step toward improving the quality of education in \nour public schools, and we look forward to working with our colleagues \nduring the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, for allowing us time \nto speak on this issue and for his leadership on the Ed-Flex \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator \nJohn Kerry and Senator Gordon Smith, in the amendment to establish the \nExcellent Principals Challenge Grant program, which seeks to address \nthe critical professional development needs of elementary and secondary \nschool principals. Last month, during a meeting with the Michigan \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals (MASSP), a major concern \nexpressed by them was the lack of professional development programs for \nschool principals. What the school principals of my State said was, \njust as with the teachers and students around them, they too must keep \ngrowing in order to continue to be effective leaders; and as \nindividuals most responsible for implementing vision, direction, and \nfocus for their schools, principals must be fortified with the best \nknowledge and skills required to effectively manage positive change, \nincluding being cognizant of the best ways in which to integrate \ntechnology into their schools so that it enhances learning in the \nclassroom.\n  These are the views of the dedicated school principals of my State, \nincluding Jim Ballard, MASSP Executive Director, Sandy Feuerstein of \nAdams Elementary School in Livonia, Barbara Gadnes of Brighton \nElementary School in Brighton, Jerry Dodd of Edsel Ford High School of \nDearborn and Bob Cross of Troy Athens High School in Troy, Michigan.\n  This amendment would facilitate the professional development needs \nexpressed by the principals of my State and principals nationwide. It \nwould establish a competitive grant program to the States, to fund \nlocal school districts for implementation of professional development \nprograms for K-12 school principals. Authorized funding would be $250 \nmillion for each of the years FY 2000-FY 2004. State and local school \ndistricts would be expected to contribute 25 percent of the total cost, \nwith the exception of the poorest school districts that would be exempt \nfrom the match. In addition, a commission would be created to study \nexisting principal development programs and report on the best \npractices to train principals nationwide. Activities would include \ndeveloping management and business skills, knowledge of effective \ninstructional skills and practices, and learning about educational \ntechnology, which has been a special focus of mine in Michigan where \nI've brought together colleges and universities and other entities in a \npartnership to move towards making Michigan's standards for teacher \ntraining in the use of technology the nation's best.\n  The expectations for our school principals are high. They are trusted \nto coordinate, assist and inspire teachers and students, while also \nmonitoring their own personal growth. We must invest in our principals, \nwho dedicate so much to investing in our children. This principal \npreparation program will allow principals to reach their full potential \nand at the same time, create public schools that are more organized, \nwell-managed and modern. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are currently gridlocked over the most \nimportant issue in the country today. I don't think anybody in this \nChamber would question that what the U.S. Senate and the Congress \nchooses to do with respect to education is going to have more to do \nwith determining the long-term transformation that can take place \nsocially and politically in the long run in this country.\n  We hear countless references within almost every political speech \ntoday to the impact of globalization, the impact of technology, the \nchanges that have taken place in the marketplace and, indeed, the \nextraordinary numbers of challenges that people face in the workplace \ntoday. It is almost axiomatic to say that if you are going to earn a \ndecent living in the United States, or anywhere in the world today, you \nhave to be able to manage information; you have to be able to develop \nyour thinking skills.\n  We live in an information age. Most of the good service jobs and even \ngood light manufacturing jobs, technology-oriented jobs, and certainly \nthe kinds of jobs to which most people aspire at the upper levels of \nincome are absolutely dependent on the maximization of that skill \nlevel.\n  The truth is, however, that in the United States of America today \nabout two-thirds of our high school graduates are handed a diploma \nalthough they can read only at a basic reading level. A basic reading \nlevel, according to our testing standards, is not a proficient reading \nlevel; it is just that--it is basic.\n  One-third of the graduates of our high schools are at below basic \nreading level. It is extraordinary that 30 percent of all the students \nin our country who go to college begin college taking remedial courses \nto fix what they didn't do properly in high school--remedial writing, \nremedial math, remedial reading. And colleges are literally required to \nexpend--some might argue, waste--a considerable portion of the \ncollegiate experience bringing people up to the level that they should \nhave been when a principal handed them a diploma--or the chairman of \nthe school board, or whatever dignitary is there--handed them a \ndiploma, and said, ``Congratulations. You are ready to go out into the \nworld and earn conceivably a low-level income, or perhaps even minimum \nwage.''\n  I don't think most of my colleagues would argue with the notion that \nthe public school system of this country is in distress. That is why we \nhave such a tension on the floor and in our politics between vouchers \nand some of the priorities of those who approach reform differently. \nMost of the debate last year on the floor of the U.S. Senate was \nfocused on either the voucher solution--which is in the end not a \nsolution at all to the problem of fixing public schools--or it focused \non construction money and technology money but barely enough on the \nissue of accountability: How do we guarantee that reforms are put into \nthe schools that are really going to make a difference in how students \nlearn and in how we will know that they are in fact learning?\n  So Republicans and Democrats talked past each other, each intent on \ntheir own sort of ideological goals, with the end result that the \nCongress did precious little to fix the schools, and another grade, if \nyou will--the kids who went from the 11th to 12th, the kids who \ngraduated from high school, the kids who went from middle school to \nhigh school, or elementary school to middle school--all were sort of \npushed on in the same state of inadequacy that has characterized the \nschool systems for too long.\n  I know my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle want good \nschools. I have also become convinced that one of the things which most \nrestrains them from joining in some of the Democrat initiatives is the \nconviction they have that without accountability, without adequate \nchange in the fundamental structure, without adequate capacity to \nreally push the envelope of reform, they would be spending good money \nthat would be chasing bad. I have to say in all candor I don't disagree \nwith that--that in many school systems, if all we do is throw money at \nthe problem, we are not going to be achieving what we want.\n  There is, however, something that has been happening in the United \nStates for the last 10 years or more which we ought to take note of and \nrespect. That is that the Governors of the States have been engaged in \nmajor reform efforts on their own. I think we in Congress ought to take \nmore note of the legitimacy of the connection of the Governors and \nlocal governments to the same people who vote for us. They\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nare held accountable in the same way. The races for Governor across \nthis country are, more often than not now, fought out over the issues \nof whether or not the incumbent or, in an open race, which candidate is \ngoing to provide the best educational opportunities to the kids of that \nparticular State. Indeed, they are accountable in the same way that we \nare accountable for what we do.\n  I believe we in the U.S. Congress ought to be perhaps a little more \nsensitive to and respectful of that process of political accountability \nand perhaps be a little bit more willing to try to trust the Governors \nto embrace a certain broad set of reforms that we could in fact target \nor articulate through the legislative process without becoming sort of \nmanagement specific, without becoming so intrusive that we tend to have \ntaken the discretion away from them, or in fact asserted ourselves in \nways that begin to become ideologically divisive rather than \nconstructive in how we are trying to find reform.\n\n  There are many areas where we could do this. I think Senator Smith \nand I have been trying together to frame a bipartisan approach to how \nwe might in fact unleash a remarkable level of creative energy within \nthe school systems of our country. I thank Senator Smith for his \nwillingness to reach out across the aisle and to also try to be \nthoughtful about what we could do that would most impact the schools of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of different experiments happening \nin different schools in America. Private schools have engaged in \ncertain reforms. So, generally speaking, an awful lot of private \nschools have had an easier road to go down for a lot of reasons that \nare inherent in the nature of private schools. The nature of their \nstudent population, the ways in which they are able to manage, the sort \nof streamlined accountability that exists within a private school--\nthere are a whole series of reasons. But there are things we can learn \nfrom private schools. There are things we can learn from parochial \nschools.\n  I often hear people say, ``Gee, go to any parochial school and look \nat the level of discipline you have,'' or, ``Go to a parochial school \nand you will find people teaching for less than you see them teaching \nin public schools, and they teach as effectively or perhaps more \neffectively in some cases.''\n  The question is legitimately asked: How is it that in a parochial \nschool you have this broad mix and diversity of student population \nsometimes found in the inner-city and you are able to do better than \nyou are in a public school?\n  There are some reasons for that, incidentally. There is a certain \nkind of creaming that takes place, inadvertently perhaps sometimes, \neven consciously, or just by virtue of economics, by virtue of even the \nsmall fee that people are required to pay, or the simple fact that to \nget to a parochial school, you need a parent involved in your life who \nis both sensitive enough and caring enough to get you there, to take \nyou there, to make the decision to pull you out of the other school.\n  For too many kids who are stuck in our school system, their parents, \nregrettably, are not that involved. They don't have those kinds of \nchoices in front of them. They aren't aware of them. They do not know \nhow to effect them. There are a whole lot of reasons you wind up with \ndisparities between the schools. But the truth is that there are \npractices within a parochial school which could serve as a model for \nwhat we might try to adopt or try to implement in public schools.\n  There are obviously charter schools. Charter schools are the reaction \nto what is happening in the public school system. Charter schools have \ngrown because people are increasingly despairing of whether or not they \nwill be able to achieve the changes they want in their public school. \nSo charter schools come along, and all of a sudden people say, ``Oh, \nboy, we can escape from the albatross of bureaucracy. We can get out \nfrom under the sort of school board politics. We can finally put our \nkids in a classroom that doesn't have 28 or 33 kids. We are going to \nget the magic 12 to 18 or something.'' So people say, ``I am going to \ngo for this opportunity,'' and so all of a sudden the charter school \nincreases in popularity. It is a reaction to the failure of the public \nschool system.\n\n  But here is the most important thing of all. All across this country, \nin community after community after community, there are great public \nschools. There are public schools that work brilliantly. They are not \nfailing; they are on the rise. And what they say to us is that if we \npay enough attention to this and work hard enough at trying to fix the \nthings that are broken, you can make a public school great.\n  No one in this country should doubt that. Because most of the \ngeneration that went ahead of us, and the generation before that--\ngenerations that are being extolled in book after book now: Tom \nBrokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'' or other books that are out--all \nof those generations, the vast majority of them, came out of public \nschools, public schools that faced a different set of problems than the \npublic schools of today, and those public schools were able to respond.\n  The bottom line is, and I will repeat this again and again and again, \nthere are not enough private schools, there will never be enough \ncharter schools fast enough, and there are not enough vouchers to save \nan entire generation of young people when 90 percent of the kids in \nAmerica go to school in public schools. So the real challenge to the \nU.S. Senate is not to get locked up in a debate about vouchers and not \nto get locked up in a debate about some targeted narrow area of reform. \nThe real challenge to the U.S. Senate is, can we come together around a \nbroad set of reforms that will empower the States and local communities \nto be able to embrace the best practices of any of the schools that \nwork, a public school that can look to any other school and draw on \nthose practices and put them into place? And the bottom line truth is \nwe are not going to do that without a major increase in resources.\n  I was delighted to see that the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, recently embraced the notion that we should put somewhere in \nthe vicinity of $40 billion into education over the next 5 years, and \nput it back in the States, liberating the States to be able to embrace \nreal reform. I believe that is a minimum figure, but it is a figure \nthat Senator Smith and I and others have talked about over the last \nyear or so. That is the raw, essential ingredient necessary to \nguarantee the kind of broad-based massive reform effort that will help \nto guarantee the kind of education structure that we want.\n  No one should doubt if you want a tax cut in America in the long run, \ninvest in children today. If you want to stop the extraordinary \nincreases in spending in the criminal justice system or for chronic \nunemployment or for drug abuse or for other problems that come out of \nour juvenile justice system, or a host of other areas, the best thing \nwe could do is guarantee that kids are not running around the streets \nin the afternoon or going home to empty homes and apartments after \nschool and getting into trouble, or not doing their homework. I don't \nknow what happened to the fundamental notion of raising children: \nchildren need structure, and structure in the earliest stages can be \nprovided in schools or in community centers when parents are working \nuntil late hours of the evening and are less available to take care of \ntheir kids than they were in the past.\n  Within that context of reform, there are a number of things that \ncould be done. They range from attracting stronger teachers by loan \nrepayment programs or by incentives to draw the higher tiers of SAT \nscores into teaching for a period of time. There are a number of ways \nin which we could provide incentives to college graduates who come out \nof school with $50,000-plus of loans and who need desperately to earn a \ndecent base income to raise a family and to get ahead. We could help \nsupplement that capacity of school districts, particularly in low-tax-\nbase areas where they do not have the ability to do this on their own; \nwe could help them get the best teachers, which is what we want. We \ncould also help school districts deal with the problem of technology. \nWe could also help provide the capacity for ongoing professional \neducation or mentoring. We could help schools keep their doors open \ninto the evenings. We could help turn schools into real centers of \ncommunity learning for parent and child--alike, into the evening hours.\n\n  But one of the most important things we could do--Senator Smith and I \nwere\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\ngoing to offer an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill on this--one of the \nmost important things we could do is help deal with the problem of \nprincipals. In every blue-ribbon school that I have ever gone into, I \nhave found that the first ingredient that hits you about why that \nschool earned the blue-ribbon award, or why it is a singularly strong \nschool within the public school system, is you will find a principal \nwith extraordinary capacity. I could cite schools in Massachusetts--the \nSaltonstall School up in the North Shore, or the Jacob Hiatt School in \nWorcester, or the Timilty Middle School in Roxbury. In all of the \nschools where I found great learning going on and great enthusiasm, I \nfound, without exception, it was a direct result of an extraordinary \nprincipal who was helping to drive the energy of that school.\n  I think every one of us knows the great impact that a principal makes \non a school--principals who are real leaders; principals who can build \nthe vital relationships between teachers, parents, students and the \ncommunity; principals who are trained and talented enough, when it \ncomes to leadership and when it comes to management, to understand all \nthe nuances of modern education and all the ways they can implement \ngood practices within their school. Without a principal doing that, it \nis not going to happen.\n  Here is the reality. As we talk about providing more flexibility in \npublic education, which is what Ed-Flex does, and as we talk about \nturning over more control on the local level, we are really talking \nabout providing greater responsibility to the 65,000 or so principals \nin our public schools.\n  I would like to just point to this chart. This is how we approach the \nissue of training principals in America today. The fact is that less \nthan half of the school districts in the United States have formal or \non-the-job training or mentoring programs for new principals. That \ncomes at a time when we have a greater need for new principals than we \nhad, just as we have a need for new teachers.\n  In the next 10 years, we need to hire 2 million new teachers. Mr. \nPresident, 60 percent of those new teachers have to be hired in the \nnext 5 years. If we don't have an effective principal who is managing a \nschool effectively and searching for those best teachers, we are not \ngoing to fulfill this extraordinary opportunity with the hiring that we \nought to have, and we are not going to wind up implementing the reforms \nin the way we ought.\n  Let me just quote the executive director of the National Association \nof Secondary School Principals. He said:\n\n       Schools are going without principals, retired principals \n     are being called back to full-time work, and districts have \n     to go to great lengths to recruit qualified candidates.\n\n  I believe that this is the unheralded crisis of our education system, \nthe quality of our principals and their capacity to be able to lead and \neffect reform. It is remarkable that we currently provide so little \nassistance to the people we trust to do the most important job of \neducation reform. I do not believe we can leave it to chance, that \nevery single principal has received the training or the skills needed \nto be the kind of dynamic leader that education reform requires.\n  As the National Association of Secondary School Principals said in \ntheir letter supporting this amendment:\n\n       As the individuals most responsible for implementing \n     vision, direction, and focus for their schools, these leaders \n     must be fortified with the best sources of knowledge and \n     skills required to effectively manage positive change.\n\n  If we want flexibility to have the kind of impact that I think \neverybody in the Senate wants, then we have to guarantee as best we can \nthat we help the local communities be able to provide qualified \nprincipals in each school who can apply that freedom we are giving them \nto the work of raising student achievement. That is why Gordon Smith \nand I want to introduce a title of our legislation, the Excellent \nPrincipals Challenge Act, as an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill, as a way \nof investing in the school leadership that we need.\n  The amendment that we contemplate would provide grants to the States \nto provide funds to our local school districts for ongoing education \nand training for our principals, to empower them to learn all the best \nmanagement and business skills the private sector has to offer, and to \ngain a knowledge of the most effective teaching practices in the \ncountry. So even if the principals themselves have not been teachers, \nas many of them have not been within decades, they can work with the \nteachers on their staff to help kids learn and to really give our \nprincipals the knowledge they need about education technology so they \ncan put to use the new modern instruments of teaching that are now \ncoming to the classroom.\n  We also need them to be able to seek out and build the collaboratives \nand the partnerships with business and with the high-tech community to \ngraduate students who are genuinely ready for the information age.\n  Our amendment would also commission a report on the best practices of \nthe best principals in the country, create a sharing of best practices \nso that we really start documenting what works best, not in theory, but \nthe reality of what happens in our classrooms, so that Governors and \nschool board leaders and principals in the years to come can bring good \nideas to scale in every principal's office in this country.\n  These are really some of the most important investments that we can \nmake, if we are going to trust that the reforms we want so desperately \nare going to be implemented in our schools. There are many people of \ntalent who we should encourage to become principals of schools; people \nwho have left the public sector, people who have left the military at a \nyoung age, but who have great leadership skills and leadership \ndevelopment. There are many other examples across this country--CEOs \nwho have retired at an early age because they have been very successful \nwith their companies. They have great management skills, great \nleadership skills. We should be reaching out to these people all across \nthis country to ask them to come in and be part of the job of helping \nto save our schools.\n  At an investment that we offer of simply $100 million a year, \nincluding a 25-percent matching grant required from States and local \nschool districts, exempting our poor districts, we believe this \ninvestment will leverage the local energies so badly needed in order to \ninvigorate new school leadership and make reform work across the \ncountry.\n  I come from an Ed-Flex State. Based on what we have learned in \nMassachusetts, it is clear that we should increase the flexibility we \ngive to our schools. I have also been willing to recognize, and I have \nlearned that it is not just the flexibility that brings us reform. In \nfact, if you give flexibility, but do not have strong leadership in \nplace, or you do not have the kind of capacity to put best practices in \nplace from other school systems in the country, then you will not have \nreform, and flexibility itself will be given a bad name. You cannot \nbring about these kinds of comprehensive efforts without terrific \nleadership, and that leadership should come from, must come from \nprincipals within each school. It is the first and most important \ncommitment.\n  As the National Association of Secondary School Principals wrote in \ntheir letter of support, this amendment addresses the critical \nprofessional development needs of principals as they seek to improve \nlearning for all students.\n  I hope when the time comes, whether it is on this bill or conceivably \nin the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, colleagues will join \ntogether in embracing not just the effort to provide a better avenue \nfor stronger principals to come into the school system, but will \nembrace a set of reforms that will truly liberate our schools so that \ngood thinking and common sense can take over from bureaucracy. I think \nwe need a major overhaul of the current structure, but I think if the \nU.S. Congress were willing to hold out to our schools the most \nsignificant incentive grant proposal we have ever provided, we would \nsee the most dramatic change at the fastest rate that we could ever \ncontemplate. Whether it is the hiring of new, stronger teachers, \nwhether it is the lowering of classroom size, whether it is providing \nthe capacity for classrooms that do not currently exist, whether it is \nraising the capacity of our principals, or even implementing the \nstandards we know we need to measure student performance or even\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nteacher performance, these things are the sine qua non of any kind of \nlegitimate education reform.\n  It is time for the U.S. Senate to embrace real reform, not another \nset of Band-Aids, not a simple little trinket here and a simple little \ntrinket there that satisfies one political party or another or one \nconstituency or another. A broad-based reform ought to be something \nthat we can all understand.\n  I hope we can cross the aisle and build the kind of coalition of \nbipartisanship that will make this the year of genuine education reform \nin the country. We have talked about it for too long. We have lost too \nmany kids to the lack of our capacity to build that coalition. Now is \nthe time to make it happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I think there is something that is going \nto happen at 5:00. I am going to talk for a while and wait and see if \nthe leaders can resolve the little stalemate we have going on on the \nfloor right now.\n  Title I is a very important program in Nebraska. It serves somewhere \nbetween 37,000 and 38,000 students, but costs us about $800 per student \nper year. We have about 80 schools that have schoolwide Title I \nprograms and about 350 that are in the targeted program.\n  One of the concerns I have in general with education is, we typically \nare fighting with peanuts. I do not mean to say that $8 billion is \npeanuts, but relative to the cost of some of our larger programs we \nrarely debate around here, Title I is still a relatively low-cost \nprogram.\n  By that I mean, one of my issues since I have come here to the U.S. \nSenate has been to try to alert both the people of Nebraska, as well as \nthe people in the Senate, that we have a tremendous problem with our \ngrowing mandatory programs: Social Security, Medicare, the long-term \nportion of Medicaid. I must say I am not very pleased with the progress \nof that debate this year. We are fighting ourselves with a significant \namount of constraint in discretionary spending. There is a big debate \ngoing on right now whether we ought to lift the budget caps that are \ncurrently imposed to $574 billion for this year for budget outlays. One \nof the reasons there is pressure on that is these mandatory programs \ncontinue to take a larger and larger share of the total budget.\n  For all the talk about Medicare in the last few years, you would have \nthought we cut it. During the 1997 balanced budget agreement, I know \nmany people were concerned that we were cutting Medicare. Medicare \ncontinues to go up about $20 billion per year over the next 10 years. \nWe have to decide, it seems to me, if we are going to maintain laws \nthat place a minimal amount of restriction on business, that keep kind \nof an entrepreneurial spirit alive and well in the United States of \nAmerica. I am in favor of cutting some of the regulations we have on \nbusiness today. We do not impose a great deal of restriction on what \npeople are required to do with their employees.\n  We have minimum wage laws, but, beyond that, we do not require health \ninsurance and we do not require pensions like many other nations do. If \nwe are going to do that, it seems to me we are going to have to \nreexamine the fundamental laws we have governing our so-called safety \nnet. That is going to lead us, it seems to me, both to change the \nstructure of our Social Security system as well as to change the \nstructure of our health care system.\n  Unfortunately, what happens is, we get terrified about the time an \nelection shows up, and we get concerned about whether or not changing \neligibility age or some other adjustments in the cost of these programs \nwill enable us to survive an election. As a consequence, we rarely take \nany action.\n  Indeed, I must say the President's budget, though it is attractive in \nmany ways, has a couple of significant flaws that make this problem \neven worse, in my view at least. The biggest flaw is that the President \nrequires us to take the surplus and exchange publicly held debt and \ntransfer it over to, in one place, the Medicare trust fund, the other, \nthe Social Security trust fund--nearly 65 percent I believe the total \nnumber is. What this is going to do is give people who are eligible \neither for an old-age benefit or health care benefit out in the future \na larger and larger claim than they have even now on our taxes.\n  I say that preliminarily, because I examined the Title I program \nconsiderably in my State and I see it is doing a great deal of good. It \nis not just being used for low-income people, although free and \nreduced-price lunch guidelines mean schools that have incomes of \n$31,000 for a family of four would qualify. Mr. President, $31,000 is \ntypically Mom and Dad--at least in my community--both out there working \nlike mad, trying to make ends meet. It is not what people would think \nof when they think of traditional ``poor'' folks. In this case, we have \nmore poverty on a percentage basis in rural Nebraska than we do in \nurban Nebraska, and, as a consequence, these Title I funds are \nenormously important. They are like a lifeline. There are 37,000 \nstudents being served by it. That is about 17,000 short of the total \nwho are eligible. We have another 17,000 schoolchildren out there who \nare eligible, by Federal guidelines, to be assisted.\n  As you examine what is being done by these schools, how they are \nusing these basic grants and the concentration grants, you can begin to \nget an idea not only of the problems that are being faced but the need \nthat is there and the good that gets done if we are able to provide \nthese Title I funds.\n  Under the Ed-Flex bill, which I like a lot, we are granting the \nStates some additional flexibility which will be enormously helpful in \nmy State, especially in the rural areas. I have been using this piece \nof legislation as an opportunity to work with the Department of \nEducation to get them to help Nebraska--in fact, get a waiver to help \nus develop our Title I plan, using the standards and assessment of the \nlocal districts. The State would approve those local plans, but it is \nnot quite a State plan.\n  We have been having difficulty getting that waiver, and I thank the \nDepartment of Education for helping us accomplish this goal. Secretary \nRiley has been enormously helpful in that regard. It gives us another \nwindow into the problems we are facing right now of children of lower-\nincome working families.\n  Understand that the world has changed considerably. I graduated from \nhigh school in 1961, just shortly before the ice started to recede back \nup into the North. In 1961, three-fourths of my graduating class went \nright into the workforce. There were good jobs available in 1961 that \nsupported a family at the Havelock shops for Burlington Northern, at \nGoodyear, at Western Electric, the new AT plant that just opened up \nin Omaha. They were good jobs. The rule was, you went out and got a \njob. That job supported your family. You did a little time in the \nservice. You came back from the service. The job was there, and you \nworked at it for the rest of your life.\n  Mr. President, a third of our high school graduates who are going \nstraight into the workforce today find a much different situation. I \nsupport free trade. I want our laws to provide us with free trade \nopportunities. But that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on these \nyoung people to compete in a global economy in a way that I was not \nrequired to do when I graduated in 1961.\n\n  I would like to keep the restrictions on business to a minimum so \nthat we can grow our economy and allow entrepreneurs and the energy of \nthe entrepreneur community to create new jobs and wealth in America. \nBut if we are going to have both of those things, it seems to me what \nwe have to do is be very diligent in the first place about being \nwilling to tackle these mandatory programs where a larger and larger \nshare of our budget is going, but we are also going to have to be \nwilling to invest in these young people and give this lifeline to the \nState and local educators who are trying to make Title I a program that \ndoes, in fact, give our young people the reading skills, the math \nskills, and the other skills they are going to need when they graduate \nfrom high school.\n  I am very much troubled about that one-third of the class who are now \ngoing right from high school into the workforce with the kind of skills \nthat they have, given what the marketplace is asking them to have in \norder to get the kind of job they are going to need to support their \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\n  Title I is one of the bills that has been mentioned repeatedly here \non the floor of the Senate, especially by people who are concerned \nabout the impact of this Ed-Flex bill--I believe Ed-Flex is going to \nenable us to make Title I an even better program than it is right now. \nNow Title I is one of those programs that has a name on it, a number on \nit--I know when I talk to educators, I sometimes have to get a \ntranslator to tell me what exactly they are talking about--but it also \nhas people behind it.\n  When you see the impact of Title I, at least in my communities, it is \na program that not only deserves to be supported, Mr. President, but, \nin my judgment, when we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, we need to find a way to put more money into Title I.\n  We made significant reform in 1994 requiring standards to be \ndeveloped, requiring assessments to be developed. We made it a much \nbetter program. But in my State there are 17,000 eligible kids whom we \ncannot serve simply because we don't have enough money to get the job \ndone.\n  There are few programs right now in education--in fact, there is none \nin education-- that I believe does more in my State to help our \nchildren acquire the skills they are going to need when they graduate \nand go into the workforce to earn the kind of living they will need to \nsupport a family and to achieve the American dream.\n  I see the distinguished chairman has walked back on the floor. I am \nprepared to yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator has until 5.\n  Mr. KERREY. I cannot possibly talk for another 20 minutes, so I yield \nthe floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to state where we are and \nwhat we hope to accomplish the rest of the day.\n  Unfortunately, we have broken down in the sense of being able to \nefficiently and effectively consider amendments on the Ed-Flex bill.\n  I remind everyone, the Ed-Flex bill is a very limited bill which is \nsupposed to assist States to manage their educational systems better by \nhaving a waiver capacity in title I particularly.\n  Just to give some examples of what we run into on that bill, at this \npoint the State of Vermont has found with Ed-Flex--we are one of the \nsix States that has Ed-Flex--to be at a great advantage in making \nmodifications without the necessity of a waiver, and those \nmodifications can be made within the State.\n  What this does is allow, in certain circumstances where we have \nspecific percentages set forth which must be reached or you cannot do \ncertain things--.5 percent is an important one with respect to poverty. \nThus, communities that have slightly less than .5--say in our case like \n.48--it is just impossible for you to do anything even with the next-\ndoor school which has .5. And there is no reason why those schools \nshould be treated differently. You have to have waiver authority for \nthat outside of the State.\n\n  So this bill just makes it so much better for Governors to be able to \nadminister and to be able to take advantage of Federal programs within \ntheir States. Thus, it really isn't creating for us any problem at all. \nThat is all we are talking about.\n  I want to keep reminding people that this bill is something which the \nGovernors, every single Governor wants, and I think everyone here in \nthe Senate should.\n  I understand Senator Murray would like some time. I would be happy to \nyield to her if I could regain the floor at 4:55. Would that be all \nright?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield the floor to the Senator at \n4:55.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor with the understanding I can regain \nthe floor at 4:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Presiding Officer and thank my colleague for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I was out here earlier today to talk about the issue \nof class size. And we are currently discussing the Ed-Flex bill which \nis a bill that simply means the Federal Government transfers its \npaperwork to the State governments in terms of flexibility in allowing \nthe school districts to have waivers for different requirements, which \nI do not oppose, and I think a number of our colleagues will support \nthat.\n  But what is really expected of us in today's world, where parents and \nstudents and teachers and business leaders and community leaders are \nasking us to deal with education, is to deal with issues that really \nmake a difference in the classroom and in learning.\n  I will be offering my amendment, as a 6-year effort, to help school \ndistricts hire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers in grades 1 through \n3. I talked a little bit about that this morning. I wanted to come to \nthe floor this afternoon because one of the questions surrounding \nreducing class size is whether it is really connected to learning.\n  When I offer my amendment, I will be talking about four different \nissues which I think are important reasons that we do this:\n  First, that it is a bipartisan effort. This is an effort that we \nbegan last October. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans. It \nwas supported in both Houses, and it was supported by the \nadministration. We all told our school districts across this country we \nwere going to help them reduce class size. They are now putting their \nbudgets together, and we need to show them that in a bipartisan way we \nare going to continue this partnership and reduce class size.\n  Second, I will be talking about research. I will be talking more \nabout that in just a minute. So I will come back to that.\n  The third reason to do this is that there is broad public support. I \nhear from law enforcement officers, I hear from business leaders, I \nhear from teachers, I hear from school board members, I hear from \nparents, in particular, and I hear from young people that reducing \nclass size is critical and that we need to be a part of the solution on \nthis.\n  Finally, I will next week talk about the fact that there is a \ncompelling policy reason to pass this amendment now. That is because \nschool districts across this country, school board members, are making \ntheir decisions about their budgets right now. They need to know \nwhether last October was just a fluke. Was last October just a \npolitical message because of the election or are we really committed to \nclass size reduction?\n  I will be talking about all of those arguments next week. But this \nafternoon I really want to focus on the research because I think it is \nvery important that we show why class size reduction really works.\n  Mr. President, I have behind me a chart which shows that K-12 \nenrollments are at record levels. That is why we need to deal with this \nissue. If you will look, we have gone from 45,000 in 1985 and will go \nall the way up to just under 55,000 in the year 2005. Our school \ndistricts are dealing with jammed class sizes, and they are going to \nget worse if we do not begin to deal with this issue.\n  All last year, when I talked about my amendment on class size \nreduction, I talked about research and what it shows. I referenced a \n1989 study that was done of the Tennessee STAR Program, which compared \nthe performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular-\nsized classes. They found that students in small classes significantly \noutperformed other students in math and reading; every year, at all \ngrade levels, across all geographic areas, students performed better in \nmath and reading.\n  Ask any businessman out there, ask anybody who is hiring a student, \nask any teacher, ask any professional, and they will tell you, we need \nto focus on math and reading in our young students. Reducing class size \nmakes a difference. We knew that from the 1989 study.\n\n  A followup study of that STAR Program in 1995 found that students in \nsmall classes in grades K through 3 continued to outperform their peers \nat least through grade 8. They followed these kids, if they started in \n1989, and they continued into 1995 outperforming their peers, with \nachievement advantages especially large for minority students.\n  Other State and local studies have since found that students in \nsmaller\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nclasses outperform their peers in reading and math, perform as well or \nbetter than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that gains are \nespecially significant among African American males.\n  Mr. President, many of our colleagues have come to the floor decrying \nthe state of education and talking about the performance of our \nstudents in math and in reading. Small class sizes make a difference; \nstudents perform better. A 1997 national study by Educational Testing \nService found that smaller class sizes raise average achievement for \nstudents in fourth- and eighth-grade math, especially for low-income \nstudents in ``high-cost'' regions.\n  Particularly of note in the 1997 ETS study was the finding that in \neighth grade the achievement effect comes about through the better \ndiscipline and learning environment that the smaller class size \nproduces. As policymakers try to make decisions that will affect \nstudents in the critical years of middle school, class size makes a \ndifference in terms of behavior and academic achievement. Class size in \nthose early grades transfers to better achievement in the middle \ngrades.\n  Mr. President, there is good news. These students who were followed \nin 1985 have continued to be followed, and many of them have now \ngraduated or are just graduating. And last week--just last week--on \nFebruary 25, I received letters from the head researchers who have been \nstudying the success of the STAR project. As of June of 1998, most of \nthe students from STAR have graduated. A pilot study showed that ``more \n[of these] students from small classes [in the early grades] had \nenrolled in college-bound courses (foreign languages, advanced math and \nscience), and had higher grade point averages than students who \nattended regular or regular-aide classrooms.\n  ``The findings also suggested that small-class students''--students \nwho have been in small class sizes in the early grades --``progress \nthrough school with fewer special education classes, fewer discipline \nproblems, lower school dropout rates, and lower retention rates than \ntheir peers who had attended regular-size and regular-size classrooms \nwith teacher aides.''\n  Mr. President, they are now showing us that not only did it make a \ndifference when they were in kindergarten, first, second, and third \ngrades because they were in a small class size, but it made a \ndifference when they graduated. It made a difference on whether or not \nthey went on to college. It made a difference with their grades. It \nmade a difference with their learning.\n  I have behind me a quote from a letter by Helen Pate-Bain and Jayne \nBoyd-Zaharias, who were part of the STAR research. They said, ``We can \nsay with full confidence that the findings of this landmark study fully \nsupport class size reduction.'' These are the researchers who have been \nfollowing these young kids who are now graduating. And they began in \nearly grades some years ago.\n  They said students from small classes--this is what their research \nshows--enrolled in more college-bound courses, such as foreign \nlanguages and advanced math and science. These were kids who came from \nsmall classes. They were confident when they graduated. They knew these \ntough subjects. And they felt qualified to go on and enroll in tougher \ncourses as they went on, because they had a smaller class size when \nthey were younger. They learned the skills they needed. They got the \nconfidence they needed. They had the one-on-one with an adult that \nallowed them to go on to these kinds of courses. Students from small \nclasses had a higher grade point average. They did better in school. \nLearning, small classes: Completely connected. They had fewer \ndiscipline problems.\n  You can ask why. I can tell you as a former teacher and a parent of \nkids in public schools and having been out there many, many times with \nyoung kids, when you pay attention to a child when they are having a \ndiscipline problem, and you deal with it directly, then you can move on \nand not continue to have a child with a discipline problem. If you are \nin a large class with 30 kids, you can't pay attention enough to those \nkids who have learning difficulties or who are just needing attention, \nand they tend to be discipline problems later. And this study backs \nthis up. Students from small classes have fewer discipline problems.\n  Finally, they had a lower dropout rate. These students from small \nclasses stayed in school. Students in smaller classes, especially \nminorities and low-income students, are more likely to take college \nadmission tests. The chart shows this. The graph on the left is large \nclasses; on the right is small classes. Looking at all students, if you \nwere in a small class, you are much more likely to take college \nadmission tests.\n  Students in smaller classes had significantly higher grades in \nEnglish, math and science. Again, how many times have we heard from our \ncolleagues on the floor that we need to make significant gains in \nlearning, particularly in English, math and science. Talk to any \nbusiness leader today. They will tell you they are looking to hire \nstudents who come out of our K-12 programs who have a good, solid \nbackground in English, math and science. Smaller classes meant higher \ngrades in every part of the study.\n  Dr. Krueger said:\n\n       These results suggest that reducing class size in the early \n     grades for at least one year--especially for minority or low-\n     income students--generates the most bang for the buck.\n\n  No surprise.\n  I will be offering an amendment to make our commitment to reduce \nclass size continue over the next 6 years. This is a commitment we made \nlast October. We need to continue to stand behind it.\n  We have teachers, we have school boards, we have communities, we have \nbusinesses, we have young students out there today who know what these \nstudies show--that it will make a difference if we reduce class size. \nWe need to do this now. We need to keep our commitment.\n  It is going to be bipartisan. If we don't get it done today, I will \nkeep doing it until we get it done, because it is the right thing to \ndo. We hear a lot of rhetoric on the floor about education. We hear \nthat we need to make a difference. My amendment will make a difference. \nAsk any parent, ask any teacher, ask any student.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding me the time, and I \nlook forward to the debate we will have next week on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my understanding is that under the \npresent situation we are in debate only until 5 o'clock, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no formal order to that effect, \nthough there is an understanding to that effect.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is no problem. I will go forward under either \ncircumstance and do the same thing.\n  I certainly commend the Senator from the State of Washington for \npresenting the results of the study. I understand that is the only \nstudy that has been done. Obviously, considerable effort was put into \ndoing that.\n  Again, I emphasize, as I have to all Members, that I want to keep \nthis bill, the Ed-Flex bill, clear of amendments in order that we can \nexpedite its passage. This will have good reception in the House. I \nwant to get this done so the Governors can, as soon as possible, have \nthe flexibility to be able to handle the problems created in the \npresent law--especially title I.\n  I am not going to accept any amendments that are related to the \nelementary and secondary education reauthorization. Otherwise, we will \nbe here all the rest of this year talking and blocking all other \nlegislation because we cannot get this little Ed-Flex bill out, which \nis small but is really important. I have alerted everyone that I will \nnot accept and will oppose any amendments which are related to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization on which we are \npresently holding hearings. We have already had several hearings and we \nwill have more hearings. To do it piecemeal, as Members are attempting \nto do, to do things in this piecemeal fashion before we have held the \nnecessary hearings is very counterproductive at this particular time.\n  Also, I remind Members, for those amendments which do set forth an \nauthorization for the expenditure of funds, I will second degree those\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\namendments and have that money go not to the intended purpose of the \namendment but, rather, to fully fund the IDEA; that is, money for \nspecial education. If there is a shortfall in funding, there is no \nquestion that the shortfall in funding is in IDEA.\n  Behind me, Senators can see a chart that demonstrates how incredibly \nstingy the Federal Government has been in meeting its obligations. I \nwas on the committee that wrote the original IDEA in 1976, and I \nremember when we made the pledge to make sure that the Federal \nGovernment was responsible for 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation. As Members probably realize by this time, yesterday a \nSupreme Court decision greatly expanded the potential for expenditure \nof funds by saying that under IDEA, we have the obligation now--the \nStates do; I think the Federal Government as well--to pay for health \ncare costs related to special education children. That is a great \nexpansion of the present situation.\n  This is not a mandate, as someone called it, of the Federal \nGovernment. This is a constitutional requirement. Any State that offers \nfree education must offer the free and appropriate education to special \neducation children. Thus, this is a constitutional requirement which we \nagreed to pay 40 percent.\n  Now, what our goal is--the Republican goal--we have increased the \nfunding by some 85 percent over the last 3 years. That was all done by \nRepublicans for the purpose of trying to get us closer to that 40 \npercent that we agreed to do back in 1976.\n  I want to make that clear as we try to move forward on this bill. I \nknow there are a number of amendments that have been put forward \ncontrary to my feeling that we should not be amending the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act until such time as we have held the \nappropriate hearings, and that we should only concentrate on the Ed-\nFlex bill to free the Governors of the kind of complications they have \nnow with respect to trying to get through the maze of regulations, in \norder to free up flexibility to help more of their communities with the \nlimited funds they have.\n  Hopefully, we will be offering an amendment in the not-too-distant \nfuture that will assist in moving toward improving the Ed-Flex bill, so \nthat we can bring it to an end and be able to pass it out in an \nexpeditious way to help the States be able to handle the problems from \nwhich they are suffering.\n  I am hopeful Members will understand. I hope my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will not try to take advantage of this opportunity to \nprematurely amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I hope \nthey will wait until the hearings are finished, and until such time as \nwe have an orderly process, to delineate what the new Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act should contain.\n  In a moment I will send an amendment to the desk in order to make \nprogress on the Ed Flex bill. This amendment is drafted to the text of \nS. 280 rather than the pending substitute. Members should be aware that \nwe will vote shortly after that--depending, of course, on debate--in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Not at this point. I am ready to offer the amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 38\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 38.\n  In the language proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 31, at the \nappropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of Education shall prescribe requirements on \n     how States will provide for public comments and notice.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas be allowed to speak and that the vote occur at 5:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to speak \non behalf of one of the issues that I think is the most important to \nour Nation. The great philosopher Edmund Burke once said, ``Education \nis the cheap defense of nations.'' So I think it is appropriate that we \nhave moved on to education after last week's discussions about military \nspending. I tend to maybe disagree with some of my colleagues over \nthere. I do think this is a very important issue to be discussing right \nnow in the context of all of the different things we can be doing on \nbehalf of our children, which I do think are our greatest resource.\n  Investing in our children is the best national investment we could \npossibly make at this stage of the game. Giving our children the tools \nto succeed is a valuable investment in the success of our workforce and \nthe resulting economy.\n  Schools are not just buildings where children and teachers spend \ntheir days. Our schools serve as the cornerstone of our neighborhoods, \nand they are the most basic building blocks that our children need to \ncompete in the future and in the coming 21st century. There is no doubt \nthat our time is very well spent in this debate here not only on the \nissue of Ed-Flex and being able to give States and school districts \nflexibility to be able to produce the best workforce possible, but it \nis also a great time for us to be speaking in the context of all issues \nrelated to education--certainly, increasing our teachers and making \nsure that we have the proper infrastructure.\n  We all have our particular areas in education of great importance, \nand certainly, we all represent different areas in the country that \nhave specific needs. But we must ensure that as we discuss any \nlegislation to repair our educational infrastructure, our school \nbuildings, and classrooms, that we remember the needs of rural areas as \nwell as urban areas.\n  We must also do our best to equip all classrooms with the proper \nwiring and equipment so all of our children can ride the information \nhighway, not just those in urban areas. When I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I worked on the telecommunications conference, and I \nrecognized how absolutely vital it was for us in rural America to have \nan interest ramp onto that information highway.\n\n  Let's not overlook the importance of parental involvement in our \neducational reform discussions here. When parents read with children \neach night and help them with their homework, they reinforce what their \nchildren have learned during the day. This is so totally appropriate, \nnot only that we are talking again about the flexibility we can provide \nStates and districts but of every aspect of education. And if we spend \nthe first 2 months of this session talking about education and \nreinvesting in our children, it is certainly worth it.\n  Teachers will certainly have greater success in the classroom if \nparents are doing their part as well. We have a great example in \nnorthwest Arkansas of a family night constructed by a school district \nto help bring together fellowship in that school area with parents, \nlocal businesses, superintendents, principals, administration, teachers \nand students to come together in fellowship and understand their school \ncommunity and how important that school community is to the overall \ncommunity.\n  My sister and many of my other relatives are teachers. They have \ntalked to me about the importance of getting\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nour children ready to learn. When you have a classroom of 5-, 6- and 7-\nyear-olds who come in and are hungry or scared or they are sick, they \ncan't possibly learn. School nutrition is absolutely vital to our \nchildren if they are going to be able to learn, to take on the tools \nthey are going to need to be competitive. It is absolutely essential. I \nhave met with teachers who have told me for years they could do their \njobs better if they also weren't subbing as psychologists, doctors, and \ndisciplinarians.\n  There is so much we can do. We can fill our time and our debate here \nwith investing in that great resource of our children. These teachers \nhave also told me one of the most important things we can continue to \ndo is, again, reinforce those nutrition programs in our school \ndistricts. I have done some of that debate in our recent hearing this \nweek in the Agriculture Committee, and I hope we will continue debating \nwhat an important role that plays in this discussion we have here.\n  As we discuss ways to empower teachers and improve teacher quality, \nlet's try to support our teachers with resources so they can deal with \nthe troubled children who are in our Nation's schools today. Whether \nchildren were born with the side effects of crack cocaine, or have \nwitnessed domestic violence at home, or are tempted by others to smoke, \nthese problems affect their performance in the classroom, and we must \nbe focusing on how to eliminate those temptations to our children. \nReducing class size is the first step toward helping our teachers deal \nwith these issues, both being able to get the students' attention, but \nmore importantly, to be the best teachers they can possibly be.\n  It is important that we move quickly to put 100,000 new teachers into \nthe classrooms because school districts are making hiring decisions \nright now for the fall. That is what makes that issue important and a \npart of this legislation that we are discussing right now.\n  In my own State of Arkansas, like many of the other States that are \nrepresented here, a majority of our teachers are beginning to retire. \nWe are losing a large number of our teachers over the next few years to \nretirement, and if we don't address the issue of teacher recruitment \nright now, we are going to be in serious trouble in many of our States.\n  We will not have the qualified teachers to be able to teach our \nchildren, to nurture them in what it is that they need to be \ncompetitive in the future.\n  I certainly appeal to my colleagues that all aspects of education \nmust be addressed, and must be addressed as quickly as we can, because \nwe certainly at this point must recognize that this greatest resource \nof ours, our children, and our future in this Nation are in jeopardy if \nwe are not doing all we can in this debate to provide the best \neducation possible for our children.\n  Let's reverse the unfortunate road and trend of fewer young adults \npursuing a career in education. Let us work towards giving teachers the \nincentive not only in pay but in stronger classrooms, smaller sizes, \nand a better capability of reward in what it is that they are there to \ndo, and that is to teach our children.\n  I thank my colleague for bringing this issue up. I am very supportive \nand have been an original cosponsor of Ed-Flexibility. But, more \nimportantly, I think it is extremely appropriate for us to be \ndiscussing these issues of education. I hope we will continue this \ndiscussion and continue to improve this bill with so many of the \nopportunities that we have before us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield \nfor a question?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the Senator for her statement and for \nher excellent summation of some of the challenges that are facing the \nchildren of her State, and also across this country.\n  The Senator has spoken to the members of our Health and Education \nCommittee about some of the challenges that exist in the rural areas of \nher State, particularly in terms of ensuring that those children have \naccess to the types of technologies which are commonplace in so many of \nour schools--not commonplace enough, but at least are important tools \nfor learning--and to make sure that they have teachers who are going to \nknow how to use those technologies in ways that might be taught in \nthose schools.\n  I know this has been one of the special areas she has been interested \nin based upon her own visits to a number of the different communities \nacross Arkansas. I want to indicate to her that we look forward to \nworking closely with her on that issue as well as other issues. It is a \nmatter of very significant importance. We welcome the chance, as we \nhave talked with her about her concerns about education, to make sure \nthat these items are given priority.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate my colleague's concern. I would like to \nexpress to him--and I think it is probably the sentiment of many of the \nSenators from rural States--having visited with some of my \ncommunications workers on the technical aspects of what we need to do \nin order to bring our schools and the infrastructure up to the level \nwhere they are actually going to be able to house these wonderful \npieces of technology and computers, that we have to bring those \nbuildings up to standard if we don't want to create fire hazards by \noverwiring classrooms to try to accommodate equipment that we are not \nprepared for in the buildings. We really have to focus on that kind of \ninvestment and infrastructure in our classrooms. I have certainly seen \nit, traveling rural America--the problems that we see out there. I am \ndedicated to making sure that all of our children of this Nation \nreceive that help.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Generally speaking, we understand from the various \nGeneral Accounting Office reports that there is about $125 billion \nworth of needs for our schools, K through 12, to bring the buildings \nand facilities up to safety standards and to meet other kinds of codes. \nIn many different communities, whether it is urban or, as the Senator \npointed out, rural, there are not sufficient resources to help. Those \ncommunities can help somewhat. The State can help somewhat. But they \nare looking for a partner. At least I find that is true in my own \nState. We are going to have an opportunity to address that particular \nneed, to try to figure out how we can best partner with the State and \nlocal communities and work with those in the rural areas as well as the \nurban areas.\n\n  I want to give assurance to the good Senator that we want to work \nvery closely with her as we try to work through this process. I believe \nwe can take some important steps in this Congress in that area. We look \nforward to her insight and her assistance in doing so.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate my colleague, although he probably grew up \nas a city boy, understanding the needs of us in rural America. It is \nvery important to us. We really appreciate it.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I accept that definition. I have not been described in \nthat way, but I am glad to be described in that way.\n  I thank the good Senator.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \npostponed until 5:20 and that Senator Burns be able to proceed for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont and my good \nfriend from Massachusetts. It won't take me long to make a couple of \npoints before we go into the vote, because I think everybody wants to \nwrap up and get out of here for Thursday evening.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor and support this Ed-Flexibility Act. I want \nto make a couple of points. I want to thank our good friend from \nTennessee, who a couple of years ago really elevated the awareness on \nthe importance of this issue. The report that he prepared stands to be \nread by everybody.\n  I don't know if everyone visits schools when they go home. But for \nthe week that I was home a couple of weeks ago, I had two or three \nchances to go into some high school assemblies and to talk with some \nteachers. The problem they are incurring is that they teach for a half-\nday and then they spend the rest of that day on paperwork compliance.\n  I think this is a very first step where teachers and parents and \nprincipals can\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nmake some very vital decisions on the education they want to give our \nchildren. All 50 States have the ability to grant individual school \ndistricts waivers from selected Federal education requirements, like \ntitle I--there is no lack of support in this body for title I of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act--and even the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational Act and the Applied Technology Education Act.\n  When we talk about distance learning, nobody has been involved in \ndistance learning longer than I have on the Commerce Committee, and I \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts. We work very hard on \ndemonstration units of distance learning. We even did it here on the \ninner cities and worked very, very hard on two-way interaction between \nteachers.\n  We have over in eastern Montana, where we have a lot of dirt between \nlight bulbs, schools as far as 200 miles apart with teachers sharing \nsciences and languages in a class. She teaches there and also interacts \nlive with students in three other classrooms. The total graduating \nclass of all those schools put together will be fewer than 50.\n  Distance education, making those decisions of using the new technical \ntools that we have developed, has been one great thing to watch. It \nblossomed. Now we are teaching teachers in our land grant universities \nhow to use those tools.\n  Unfortunately, right now many of our Federal education programs are \noverloaded with rules and regulations. States and local schools waste \nprecious time and also resources in order to stay in compliance. It is \nobvious that these State and local districts need relief from the \nadministrative burdens that many federally designated education \nprograms put on States, schools, and education administrators.\n  We hear a lot about numbers of children in classrooms. I want to tell \nyou, in our State the numbers are sort of going down. The goal of this \nlegislation and our goal should be, at the Federal level, to help \nStates and local school districts to provide the best possible first-\nclass education for our children that they can. They can't do it if \nthey are burdened with rules and regulations and always reading the \nbook on compliance. This is one big step toward taking care of that.\n\n  I compliment my friend from Vermont on his work in education and his \ndedication to it, because we will probably not take up any other piece \nof legislation that will have as much impact on local neighborhoods, on \nour taxing districts, and also the attitude of educators at the local \nlevel.\n  This is one giant step in the forward direction. It won't fix all of \nthe problems. It won't fix them all, because we can't fix them all. But \nI think it places the trust back in the people that the Federal \nGovernment, yes, does play a role. We want to play a role. But we want \nto play a constructive role in helping meet the needs of the local \ncommunities and put the decision back with teachers, parents, and, of \ncourse, administrators at the local level.\n  I thank my friend from Vermont for yielding the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table the amendment.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now 6:10 p.m. on a Thursday \nevening, and we have had this Ed-Flex legislation before the Senate \nsince yesterday. The Ed-Flex proposal would permit States and local \ncommunities to have greater flexibility with accountability for scarce \nresources that are provided by the Federal Government--in this case, \nthe Title I program, which is about $8 billion that focuses on the \nneediest children in this country. There was an effort to give greater \nflexibility to the local communities, consistent with the purpose of \nthe legislation, to try to have a more positive impact in the \nachievement of the children in this country.\n  This legislation was thought to have been a part of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. We were going to have an opportunity to \nconsider those measures together, but it was a decision of the majority \nof the committee to vote that out as an early piece of legislation. I \nvoted in favor of that process and procedure. And then there was the \nindication by the Majority Leader that this measure would be before the \nSenate at an early time in this session.\n  We had legislation last week to address the very important, critical \nand legitimate needs of our service men and women, to try to give them \na fair increase in their pay--particularly those individuals who are \nserving in harm's way in many different parts of the world, but \ngenerally for the armed services of this country, in order to make up \nfor the failure to do so at other times. We had a good debate on that, \nand it was voted on. We had 26 different amendments that were advanced \nduring that period of time, some of which were accepted and some of \nwhich we voted on. But we came to a conclusion on that particular \nmeasure.\n  So we started the debate on Ed-Flex. I don't think most of those \nAmerican families who are watching now would really understand exactly \nwhat Ed-Flex is really all about. Nonetheless, it might very well \nprovide some benefit to some young people in this country, and we were \ngoing to move ahead with it. I think most parents would understand if \ntheir children were in a classroom where there were fewer children in \nthe class and a well-qualified teacher was interacting with that child \nand the 17 or 18 other children in that particular classroom, rather \nthan the 30, 32, or 33 children in many classrooms across this country. \nI think parents would understand the advantages of moving toward \nsmaller classes.\n  I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would favor that \naction, and we have an excellent proposal to do that, which was \naccepted by Republicans and Democrats in the final hours of the session \nlast year prior to the election. And now we have many of those \ncommunities that are asking, ``Well, should we just hire a teacher if \nwe are only going to have a teacher for 1 year? Let us know, Congress \nof the United States. You didn't do the whole job last year in \nauthorizing it for the complete 6 years. Let us know whether you are \ngoing to make the judgment\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nand decision, as recommended by the President, that we ought to have \nthe full 6 years.'' The President of the United States, in his budget, \nhas allocated resources to be able to do that. The communities want to \nknow.\n  Senator Murray has an excellent amendment to deal with that issue. I \ndon't know about my other colleagues, but I know that in my own State \nof Massachusetts, communities want to have an answer to that particular \nquestion. And we are prepared to move ahead with that debate. We are \nprepared to have a full discussion on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We \nwere prepared to do that yesterday. We are prepared to do it tonight. \nWe are prepared to do it tomorrow or Monday, or at any time. It is of \ncritical importance, and it is the kind of business that we should be \ndealing with in terms of education.\n  Families can understand smaller class size. Families can understand, \nas well, the importance of the development of afterschool programs. I \nreferred, earlier in the debate, to the excellent review that has been \nmade by independent reviewers on the value of the Title I programs, and \nthere were a number of recommendations in there. They noted that we \nhave made some important progress in the past few years in targeting \nthe Title I programs more precisely, as we did in the last \nreauthorization legislation. But we also know of the importance of the \nafterschool programs.\n  I will mention this report, the evaluation of promising results, \ncontinuing challenges, of the national assessment. This is about Title \nI from the Department of Education, 1999, and was just released. One of \nthe findings shows that in a recent study of elementary schools in \nMaryland, the most successful schools were seeing consistent academic \ngains as a result of extended-day programs. Afterschool programs are \nextended-day programs. And there are others, such as programs that \nextend into the weekend and summer programs that continue the education \nduring the summer months.\n  There are a number of different ways that local communities have been \nimplementing afterschool programs. Last year, we had some $40 million \nin appropriations for afterschool programs, and there were $500 million \nworth of applications for those programs coming from local communities. \nThe President has raised his appropriation up to $600 million to reach \nout to one million children in the country and provide afterschool \nprograms. We have an excellent amendment by our friend and colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, and also one from Senator Dodd in that \nparticular area--one would be based upon the schools, and the other \nwould be based upon nonprofits. They are somewhat different approaches, \nbut I think they both have very substantial merit.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, we have the opportunity to vote and \ndebate on a measure that will make a real difference in terms of \nfamilies' lives for extended-day programs. That will make a difference. \nIt will improve quality education and student achievement.\n  We were prepared to move ahead with that particular debate. But that, \nevidently, will not be the case. We had a good opportunity and a good \nrecord to explore and to engage those that would differ with us. We \nhave the amendment that our colleagues are familiar with that was \nadvanced by Senator Bingaman, Reid and others, that brought special \nfocus and attention on the problems of school dropouts. Sure, we have a \nlot of dropout programs. But this program was very innovative in terms \nof the evaluation of that, and was successful in implementing a program \nthat can make a difference.\n  I commend those Senators for the work they have done on it. In the \npast, that amendment was accepted overwhelmingly by this body. That \ncould make a difference to children that are in school now, today and \ntomorrow. We were prepared to debate that program, but we have been \nunable to bring that to resolution.\n  As the good Senator, Senator Bingaman, pointed out, some 500,000 \nchildren drop out of school before graduating from high school each \nyear. There are important reasons for that. There have been successful \nprograms to try to correct that. But this was a worthwhile effort to \nbring the authorization of funding for that particular program.\n  My colleague and friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, had a \nmodest program to provide additional help, assistance and training to \nprincipals to help them deal with some of the more complex issues that \nthey face. And that is a very, very worthwhile amendment.\n  Our good friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and others had a \nprogram to have a report card on various schools so that parents would \nhave better information about how the schools were doing.\n  There were others, but not many others. I haven't gotten the complete \nlist at this time, but there are a few others.\n  But on each and every one of those, Senator Daschle was prepared to \nrecommend to all of us that we move ahead with short time limitations. \nAs far as I was concerned, we would have been able, at least from our \nside, to have concluded the consideration this measure by Tuesday of \nnext week. We were glad to try to accommodate the interests of the \nmajority in working out the time limits of these particular measures, \nand even the order of them. We assume that there may be amendments to \nbe offered by the other side, including the very important amendment \nthat was brought to our attention with regards to IDEA and children \nwith special needs. That amendment would provide additional help and \nassistance to local communities, through IDEA, to offset some of the \nserious financial burdens of educating of children with special needs.\n  We have an important responsibility to children with special needs, \nand the States have an obligation under their own constitutions to \neducate every child.\n  We did make the commitment back in 1975 that we would establish a \ngoal of 40 percent federal funding, and we have failed to do so.\n  I believe very strongly that we should support those programs, \nparticularly in light of yesterday's Supreme Court decision that will \npermit children with special needs to continue their education. It will \nbe supported by the local communities as well. That will add some \ncertainty for those children, so they will be able to continue their \neducation.\n  That is the most important and significant aspect of the program. But \nthere will be some additional financial responsibilities. This is an \narea of national concern, because all of us understand that our \nparticipation in the education process is limited and targeted to \nspecial priorities. We have made disadvantaged children and the \nneediest children in our country a priority. Certainly those with \nspecial needs ought to be a national priority as well. We ought to be \nwilling to help children, regardless of what community they live in, \nand regardless of what their needs may be.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the items that we are talking about. \nI think most families in our country could make up their mind pretty \neasily about the kind of priorities that we should be considering. I \nthink the overwhelming majority of Americans would feel support for the \nprograms I have begun to outline.\n\n  Let me point out that they are very modest and important programs, \nwith demonstrated effectiveness. Certainly we are able to do so and \nsupport those programs. Many of them, as I mentioned earlier, have \nalready been targeted for support by the President in his budget--\nfinancial support has been there.\n  Mr. President, we find ourselves in the situation on Thursday evening \nwhere effectively by the rules of the Senate are not going to be \ndebating these issues tomorrow, we will not be debating these issues on \nMonday, and at 5 o'clock the Senate will vote whether or not we are \ngoing to exclude all possibility of considering those amendments on \nthis particular measure. We will not spend the time tomorrow, which we \ncertainly could, in debating and considering these issues. We will not \ndo it on Monday. And we will delay the eventual outcome of \nconsideration of these measures to a future day.\n  We heard earlier today, around noontime, that those that are \nsupporting the measure of Senator Bingaman were actually filibustering \nthe legislation. This is after a day and a half of considering the \namendments to the Ed-Flex\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nlegislation. We had indicated at that time that we were prepared to \naccept--at least Senator Bingaman was--the amendment and move ahead.\n  It reminds me of where we were at the end of the last session where \nwe were effectively denied any opportunity to bring up the patients' \nbill of rights, which American families were so strongly in support of. \nWe were denied the opportunity for fair consideration and debate on it. \nWe were denied the opportunity to consider an increase in the minimum \nwage for working families in spite of the extraordinary progress that \nwe have had--economic prosperity which so many have participated in, \nbut not those at the lowest end of the economic ladder. We were \nprepared to refute the case that a modest increase in the minimum wage \nis going to mean lost jobs or is going to add to the inflation in this \ncountry, ridiculous claims by those that were trying to stop any \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  We will have an opportunity to consider a minimum wage increase. I \nmust say that the responses that Speaker Hastert has given on the \nconsideration of the minimum wage has given us some reason to hope that \nwe will have an opportunity to debate and to act on increasing the \nminimum wage. But we were denied that chance in the last Congress, as \nwe were denied the opportunity to act on a patients' bill of rights.\n  Some of us have come to the conclusion that the only way we can get a \nvote is if we offer an amendment that the majority agrees with. That \nseems to be the rule. We are denied the opportunity on this side to \nbring these matters up and have a full debate. I quite frankly don't \nunderstand why this should be so. The American people want action in \nthe field of education. I believe they want partnership--a Federal \npartnership with the State and with the local communities. They \nunderstand the primacy of the local control on education, and they \nunderstand the importance of State help and assistance to many \ndifferent communities. And they value the limited but important \ntargeting that is given by some of the Federal programs.\n  But they want to have the participation of all of us in a partnership \nto try to help families. They have heard the various philosophical and \nideological debates. They want action. They want well-qualified \nteachers in every classroom. They want classrooms where children can \nlearn. They want to make sure they are going to have the kinds of \ntechnology in those classrooms which will permit children going to \npublic school to compete with any young person going to school in any \npart of the country. They want their teachers' skills upgraded so they \ncan integrate those skills into the curriculum with additional \ntraining.\n  They want afterschool programs, because they know that it makes a \ndifference to give a child the opportunity to get some extra help in \nthe course of the afternoon--maybe getting their homework done instead \nof watching television or engaging in other kinds of unhealthy \nbehavior--so when the parents return home, the child can spend some \nquality time with those parents and the parents don't have to say, \n``You have been watching television all afternoon. Get upstairs and get \nyour homework done.'' These are issues about which families care very \ndeeply.\n  Sure, we have a full agenda on many matters--on Social Security, but \nSocial Security reform is not ready for debate; on issues dealing with \nMedicare, but Medicare is not ready for Senate consideration either. \nSure, we have important responsibilities in trying to get a Patients' \nBill of Rights, but we are attempting to work that out through the \ncommittee process and hopefully will have an opportunity to address \nthat in the next several weeks. Yes, we have important responsibilities \nin protecting the privacy of individuals regarding to medical records, \nbut that legislation is not ready to be considered.\n  I really challenge the leadership on the other side to indicate to \nthe Members what is on the possible agenda here that is more important \nfor our attention, effort and debate than the issue of the education of \nthe young people of this country. There is nothing. That is why this \ncourse of action, of effectively denying the debate and for the Senate \nto work its will in these very important areas, is so unacceptable--\nunacceptable.\n  We want to make sure that those families understand. You might be \nable, although I don't think they will be able, to have cloture, in \neffect denying Members the opportunity to consider those particular \namendments on Monday. But you are not going to make this battle go \naway, because those amendments are going to be offered on other pieces \nof legislation--they make too much of a difference to families. They \nare not going to go away. It is the early part of this session. We are \nnot in the final hours when you are able to jimmy the rules in order to \ndeny the opportunity for people to bring these matters up. You cannot \ndo that now. We are going to insist that we have this debate and \ndiscussion, and have the Senate work its will.\n  I thank our colleagues today who have been willing to participate in \nthis effort and have spent close to 3 hours or so in quorum calls \nduring the course of the day when we could have been debating these \nissues. I hope we will not hear anymore from the other side about \nfilibustering by amendment, because there are too many who have waited \ntoo long to try to at least get a result here in the U.S. Senate on \nsome of these issues.\n  I know, finally, that it is painful, evidently, for some of our \ncolleagues to vote on some of these matters. We heard a lot of that \nthis afternoon, ``We don't want to vote on it. It is painful to vote on \nthem.'' That is, unfortunately, what this business is about. It is \nabout choices and priorities, to a great extent. We have every \nintention of pursuing these issues. We are not going to be denied. I \nbelieve we will not have cloture on Monday. It will be up to them, \nthen, whether we are to deal with these issues in the timely and \nreasonable way which we are prepared to do. But if that is not the \ncase, I just want to make certain everyone in here knows--I know this \nfrom speaking to our colleagues who have worked so hard in so many of \nthese different areas--that we are going to be quite prepared to \nadvance these frequently, on each and every opportunity that will \npresent itself.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will not resist the opportunity to \nmake a few comments about what we have been doing here today. Both \nsides are very much interested in improving education. I don't think \nthe enthusiasm of one side is outweighed by that of the other side, or \nvice versa. But the question of how to do it at this particular moment \nis the question with which we are faced.\n  This side believes very strongly that we need to ensure when we vote \nfor new programs, when we vote billions of dollars for the existing \nprograms, we ought to know whether or not they are working. Our system \nis set up in a very logical way. Every 5 years we take a look at \nprograms, and we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, which is up this year. It is the most important piece of education \nlegislation we have. It is not something which should be ignored, \nsaying, ``We don't need any hearings. We don't need to worry about \nanything. We know the answers already.''\n  Let's examine where the ``already'' is, and what has happened. We had \nnotice in 1983 that we had a terrible educational crisis in this \ncountry. The Nation at Risk report came out during the Reagan \nadministration. The Governors got together in 1988, and they formulated \nthe goals that we ought to be meeting. Here it is in 1999--and I sit on \nthe Goals Panel--and there is no evidence that we have made any \nimprovement in anything that is measurable.\n  So why would we go racing out to fund programs about which we have \nhad no hearings at this time? That is neither an appropriate nor a \nlogical way to proceed. What do we know? We know a couple of things. \nFirst of all, we know from the experiences we have had with the \nexperimental programs in six, and then twelve, States that more \nflexibility in existing program regulations will enable States to more \nefficiently and effectively use that money. All of the Governors say, \n``Please, help us and release us from the growing volume of burdensome \nregulation.'' That\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nis all we are trying to do. It is something we can do quickly, now, and \nget action immediately.\n  Second, where is the greatest need for resources right now in this \ncountry? It is at the local level. The programs that are being \ndiscussed are dealing with matters which are primarily being addressed \nat the local level. But where Federal support is needed most is where \nwe promised it would be provided back in 1975-76 when we passed the \nbill to open up vistas for children with disabilities so they had an \nopportunity for the kind of education which was appropriate for them. \nWe guaranteed--quote-unquote, I suppose, from a Federal perspective--\nthat we would provide 40 percent of that funding. Yesterday's Supreme \nCourt case has greatly, incredibly worsened that situation by requiring \nthat not only do we have to provide an appropriate education at the \nState level, but also that somebody has to provide the health care to \nensure that when that child is in school, he or she receives the best \nhealth care to enhance their education.\n  Where is that burden going to be? Right now it has just been placed \nright at the local level, where it remains if we do not do something \nabout that as soon as possible. What we have been saying today, and \nwhat we have been dedicated to as Republicans for the last 3 years, is \nthat we must ensure that those communities that are trying to provide \neducational opportunity for children with disabilities have money \nenough, as promised to them by the Federal Government, to enable them \nto meet those needs.\n  It would take $11 billion to raise that level now to what we promised \nback in 1976. What we are saying is, before we go off into untried \nprograms which have not even had hearings, we ought to provide that \nmoney immediately or make it available for the process of \nappropriations immediately. So, we will take the money that is in these \nprograms that are untried--the authorizations--and say: Give it to \nwhere it is really needed, to the local governments and the States so \nthey can provide an education for the young people, all of the young \npeople, which they cannot do by themselves because the demands are so \nhigh and because we have failed to provide to them the $11 billion they \nare entitled to under our promise.\n  So I implore, my good friends on the other side, we are not trying to \nin any way hold anything up. What we are trying to do is to get a \nstraightforward bill passed which will immediately help the States to \nmaximize their resources. That's what we want to do. Instead, rather \nthan being able to take this small step forward, we are having to go \nthrough this whole process of being asked to adopt all these programs \nabout which we have no evidence whether or not they will work.\n  The Department of Education now is spending, I think, $15 billion \nunder Federal programs supporting elementary and secondary education, \nand we do not know if they are working. As far as we can tell, little \nor nothing is working. So we have to get in there and make a careful \nexamination of these programs. That is what we should be doing--and \nwhat we are doing--through the reauthorization process. We have already \nhad hearings to find out what is working, what is not working, and why \nis it not working. We will have further hearings to explore these \nissues. I cannot even tell now, from reading reports, from research, or \nanything, what impact this money is having. Before we start new \nprograms with large sums of money, we ought to at least know whether \nthe ones we are supporting now are working. We simply cannot go \ncharging off to try to grab scarce resources to fund programs that are \nnot effective.\n  We in no way are trying to hold things back. We want to give help \nimmediately to the States in order to loosen up existing resources to \nhelp the local communities improve their schools.\n  I really get a little bit excited when the claim is made that we are \ntrying to stop things from happening, when our whole purpose here is to \ntry to make available to all 50 States the opportunity to improve their \nability to deliver quality education. Then, we must have the hearings \nwe need so we can go forward responsibly in reviewing Federal efforts \nin elementary and secondary education in their totality and do what our \njob is supposed to be.\n  Some examples: The program which has been mentioned with respect to \nafterschool activities is one which I authored in 1994 and which was \nenacted as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization bill that year. That program--21st Century Schools--\nalready exists. The President has embraced it as his own. He now thinks \nit is a great initiative, after previously refusing to put any money in \nit at all. I am happy that that program is now funded and is likely to \nreceive further funding increases. I am also aware that the President \nwould like to see changes in the program, but this is not the time to \ntry to suddenly put them in place. We need to go through the regular \nauthorization process. I am anxious to do just that, but I want to do \nit right.\n  We are just trying to proceed in an orderly fashion. I hope that we \nhave an opportunity, even tomorrow, to move this bill forward. We can \npass it tomorrow. Then, let us put all our effort into hearings on \nelementary and secondary education so that when we do things, we know \nwhat we are going to do, and hopefully we will find some things that \nwill work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate has now been debating the pending education flexibility bill for \napproximately a day and a half. There has been some good debate. A \nnumber of Senators have been able to speak on behalf of this very \nimportant bipartisan legislation that is supported by the President and \nsupported by the bipartisan National Governors' Association. I am \npleased that we have it up early in this session, and I am pleased that \nwe made some progress.\n  But while progress has been made on this vital piece of legislation, \nI am beginning to sense now that there is a feeling of gridlock on the \npart of our Democratic colleagues, if they are not successful in \noffering nongermane amendments or if they are not able to offer them in \nthe way they would like to. I hope this is not true.\n  I know there is a genuine effort on both sides of the aisle to work \nthrough a way we can get to completion of this legislation in a \nreasonable time next week, so that we can move on to the next bill that \nwill be considered, including the emergency appropriations supplemental \nbill which was, I believe, reported out of the Committee on \nAppropriations this afternoon.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to assure prompt passage of the \nbill, I now send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nRule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on amendment No. 31 to Calendar No. 12, S. 280, the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership bill:\n  Trent Lott, Jim Jeffords, John H. Chafee, Robert Smith, Thad Cochran, \nArlen Specter, Slade Gorton, Mitch McConnell, Richard Shelby, Bill \nFrist, Larry E. Craig, Jon Kyl, Paul Coverdell, Gordon Smith, Peter G. \nFitzgerald, and Judd Gregg.\n\n\n                            Call Of The Roll\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under rule XXII, this cloture vote will occur then on \nMonday, March 8. I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur at \n5 p.m. on Monday and that there be 1 hour prior to the vote to be \nequally divided between Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for debate only.\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, will the leader ask for 2 \nhours equally divided? Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is fine, Mr. President. I amend my request to \nthat effect, with the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, I hope progress can be made on the bill. There have \nbeen some proposals going back and forth, and we will continue to work \non those, hopefully later on tonight. Tomorrow morning, Friday, when we \nare in session, there will be a recorded vote, hopefully by 10:30 a.m., \nand we will then give the Members a report on what action, perhaps, has \nbeen agreed to beyond that.\n  I know Members from both sides of the aisle will be working on this. \nIf progress is not made, then we will go forward with cloture. If \nsomething can be worked out--and I think it can; I hope it will be--\nthen certainly we can take action to vitiate this cloture vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2271-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today Miss Ruby McGilvray Bryant of Jackson, \nMississippi, was recognized by the Mitsubishi USA Foundation and PBS \nTelevision's ``To the Contrary'' as one of America's four Unsung \nHeroines.\n  ``Miss Ruby,'' as she is lovingly called, has served her Mississippi \ncommunity for the better part of three decades. She has been \ninstrumental in creating a number of programs to help physically and \nmentally challenged children and adults.\n  It all started thirty years ago when Miss Ruby looked for a way to \ngive disabled children and adults a camp experience similar to the one \nother campers were enjoying. Working with the Mississippi State Park \nsystem, she created a one-week summer camp program full of activities \nincluding a beauty pageant where everyone wins--everyone gets his or \nher moment in the spotlight. With the help of Dream Catchers, a \nvolunteer organization serving the disabled, campers also get to \nexperience the thrill of horseback riding. Miss Ruby even went the \nextra mile by helping to raise the money needed to send a number of \nchildren and adults to this special camp. However, her efforts did not \nstop there. She also organized a number of other activities throughout \nthe year such as hayrides and banquets.\n  Miss Ruby also fostered the development of the ``the Mustard Seed,'' \na local residential home in Brandon, Mississippi, for disabled persons \nto live when their parents have passed away. The Mustard Seed teaches \n``life skills'' so the disabled can be what they want most, independent \nand productive individuals.\n  She was also the driving force behind ``Calvary Care,'' a program \nthat provides all-day activities for the physically and mentally \nchallenged in a safe and loving environment. Participants are taken on \nfield trips to such places as the zoo or the museum. They also have an \nopportunity to share fun and fellowship, to experience the small things \nin life that many of us take for granted. This program also helps \nparents and other loved ones gain some much-needed time for themselves. \n``Calvary Care'' attracts families from as far as 100 miles away \nbecause there is no similar program.\n  ``Lady Talk,'' another of Miss Ruby's successful programs, is aimed \nat women who have little or no contact with the outside world. Many of \nits participants are former residents of mental institutions who have \nbeen long forgotten or abandoned by family members. Miss Ruby takes \nthese women to a church facility for a day full of activities and \nsocial interaction. She makes sure that each woman is well fed and \nclothed and that each woman has someone to listen to their needs and \nproblems.\n  As the director of the Sunday school special education program at \nCalvary Baptist Church since 1969, Miss Bryant has ensured that \nmentally and physically challenged individuals learn the Bible's \nteachings and play an active role in the ministry. Here, the children \nrefer to her as ``Sweet Momma.''\n  Miss Ruby is an inspiration to us all. She teaches us that kindness, \nlove, and patience are strong virtues. That self sacrifice is its own \nreward. That all of us, regardless of our abilities, are God's children \nand deserve respect and dignity. Most importantly, Miss Ruby is a \nshining example of how one person truly can make a positive difference \nin the life of so many others.\n  Miss Ruby is a heroine for Mississippi and heroine for America--for \neverything she has accomplished on behalf of the disabled and \neverything she will continue to do.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Miss Ruby \nMcGilvray Bryant for her thirty years of dedicated service to the \nphysically and mentally challenged, and their families, and for being \nrecognized as an Unsung American Heroine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2271-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        APPRECIATION FOR THE SENATE SERVICE OF WILLIAM J.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to improve \ncrop insurance coverage, to make structural changes to the Federal Crop \nInsurance Corporation and the Risk Management Agency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                crop insurance for the 21st century act\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nMr. Kerrey of Nebraska, to introduce a bill that we call the Crop \nInsurance for the 21st Century Act. We believe this bill represents an \nimportant step in improving the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and in \ncreating greater access to the risk management tools that our farmers \nand ranchers simply must have.\n  Senator Kerrey and I, and many others who are privileged to represent \nthe agriculture community, have long discussed the need to address \nreforms to the Crop Insurance Program. However, the necessary demands \nfrom the agriculture community and the Congress to successfully reform \nthis program, in my personal opinion at least, did not reach a \ncrescendo until last fall when we approved something called the omnibus \nappropriations bill, and that contained approximately $6 billion in \ndisaster assistance for our farmers and ranchers.\n  I am sure, while Republicans and Democrats and individual \nagricultural groups were unable to agree on the necessary size and \nscope of the disaster package, one thing became abundantly clear to all \ninvolved--if we had a Crop Insurance Program that worked, without \nquestion, the situation would not have been so serious.\n  This has been a longstanding effort. I can remember well, back in \n1978, when I was a staff member in the House of Representatives to my \npredecessor, that was when the Crop Insurance Program was first \nestablished. It has been 20 years, and we still have an obligation to \nreform the program and make sure that it works for all regions, all \nfarmers, all commodities.\n  In response to the demands for the improved risk management tools, \nSenator Kerrey and I committed to pursuing major crop insurance reforms \nin this Congress. To aid us in this task, last November we contacted \nall of the major farm organizations and all of the commodity groups, \nall of the crop insurance companies, all of the agricultural lending \ngroups, and requested their guidance on these issues. We were \nlistening. We wanted to find out their advice in regard to what do we \nneed to pay attention to, what is the most serious issue that we need \nto address in the Crop Insurance Program. We received feedback from \nover 20 of these major organizations.\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n  These comments we received served as a guidepost in developing this \nlegislation. And, while the comments received were wide ranging, there \nwas near consensus in several areas.\n  These included as follows: First, the need for increased levels of \ncoverage at affordable prices to all producers. Second, we need \nexpanded availability of revenue-based insurance products. Third, \nprogram changes to address the needs of producers suffering multiple \ncrop failures. Fourth, structural changes to the Risk Management \nAgency--the acronym for that is RMA, and that is what I will call it \nfrom now on, but it is the Risk Management Agency--that will allow for \nincreased access to new and improved crop insurance policies.\n  Senator Kerry and I took these comments to heart, and the legislation \nwe are introducing today has been developed in large part by really \ntrying to work to incorporate these comments into legislative language.\n  Our bill inverts this existing subsidy structure. Currently, many \nproducers do not purchase the highest levels of coverage because the \ngreatest level of Government assistance simply occurs at the lowest \nlevels of coverage. This often makes the higher levels of coverage \nsimply unaffordable. It causes many producers to have insufficient \ncoverage, which eventually leads to calls for the ad hoc disaster bills \nthat are so expensive. We cannot continue to pass a disaster package \nevery year.\n  I tell the Presiding Officer, we were just discussing this in a \nprevious meeting, it costs the Federal Government about $1.5 billion on \naverage in regard to the disaster bills. They seem to occur on even \nnumbered years. I think the Presiding Officer knows what I am talking \nabout. We cannot afford that.\n  Therefore, under our legislation, the highest level of subsidy will \noccur at the 75/100 coverage levels. While the inversion of subsidies \nwill be the most important change for many producers, we have included \nseveral changes that we believe will benefit America's farmers and \nranchers. These include, first, the average production history--that is \ncalled APH in the crop insurance acronym world--APH adjustments for \nproducers that have no production history because they are beginning \nfarmers or they are farming new land or they are rotating crops.\n  Let me add, at this juncture, that is exceedingly important, because \nunder the farm bill that how exists, farmers have a lot more \nflexibility, and when they move to a new crop, obviously, they ought to \nbe able to simply insure that crop.\n  Second, mandating APH adjustments for producers suffering from crop \nlosses in multiple years. Third, requiring the RMA to work to undertake \na pilot project to develop new rating structures for undeserved areas \nof the country, and particularly the southern part of the United \nStates, with the intention it will eventually become a permanent change \nin the program.\n  Here is a suggestion or a part of the bill that will be of interest \nto Senator Thomas--removing the prohibition on coverages for livestock. \nI just indicated that we had a good visit this morning about this very \nsubject. The livestock sector is going through a very difficult time in \nour country today. We need to address this problem with regard to \ninsurance and how it would dovetail into the livestock industry and \ngive our stockmen and our ranchers some protection.\n  In addition, the legislation provides for major changes in the \nstructure of the RMA, the FCIC, that will allow for accelerated product \napproval and the development of improved crop insurance policies. Many \npeople understand the Risk Management Agency serves as a regulator over \nthe crop insurance industry. What many do not know is that this same \noutfit, the RMA, also serves as a developer for products that are then \nsold in direct competition with privately developed products. Thus, the \nRMA serves as a competitor with the industry it is supposed to \nregulate.\n\n  I am aware of no other private industry that faces these same \nhurdles. Senator Kerrey and I believe it is time to change this culture \nthat has often served as a roadblock to producer access to new and \nimproved products. Our legislation will, first, change the structure of \nthe FCIC board of directors to bring reinsurance and expertise in the \nagriculture economy to the board. Second, make the FCIC the overseer of \nthe RMA. Third, allow the RMA to continue to develop policies for \nspecialty crops and underserved areas.\n  Fourth, to create an Office of Private Sector Partnership to serve as \na liaison between private sector companies and the FCIC board of \ndirectors. Fifth, to leave the final approval or disapproval of all \npolicies in the hands of the board. And, finally, allow companies to \ncharge a minimal fee on each policy when one company decides to sell \nanother company's product. Hopefully, Mr. President, this will allow \nthe companies to recover the research and development costs and will \nencourage the creation of new policies.\n  While these steps will not be the answer to solving all of the \nproblems in the Crop Insurance Program, we believe they will be an \nimportant step. Each year our producers put the seed in the ground with \ngreat faith and optimism and believe that, with a little faith and a \nlittle luck and the good Lord willing and the creeks not rising, they \nwill produce a crop. But the task is not easy. Between the multiple \nrisks of drought and flood and fire and hail and blizzard and disease \nand insects and also a little market interference in regard to the \nFederal Government, it often seems the deck is stacked against them. If \nproducers do survive these risks, they are often still at the mercy of \nweakened exports, and Asian flu or the global contagion, as we call it, \ncaused by a global financial crisis and inadequate access to foreign \nmarkets.\n  I will be the first to admit that reforming this program cannot come \nwithout budgetary costs. At the same time, I can think of no other \nindustry that faces the number of multiple risks that must be addressed \non an annual basis by those in production agriculture.\n  Congress must not and cannot be forced to pass these ad hoc disaster \nbills every year. We must give our producers the risk management tools \nthat they need. I believe this legislation is an important first step, \nand I ask our colleagues to join Senator Kerrey and myself in this \ndifficult but absolutely vital task.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my good friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nRoberts the Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act.\n  This bill will make crop insurance more affordable, more flexible, \nand more responsive to the changing needs of farmers.\n  That has been our goal from the start, when we asked for help from \nfarmers in Nebraska, in Kansas, and from the many farm, commodity, \nbanking and crop insurance interests that work with producers. They \nresponded with a multitude of ideas, and those ideas form the basis for \nthis bill.\n  The basic structure of the crop insurance program was set out in \n1980, and much of that structure remains in place today.\n  Congress last reformed the crop insurance program in 1994, when we \ncreated new opportunities for private sector delivery of policies and \nrisk sharing. And our success has been great--more than 181 million \nacres are enrolled in the program today, up almost 100 million acres \nsince 1993.\n  But we are now seeing participation on the decline. That is cause for \nconcern.\n  And last year, we discovered more cause for concern. Farmers in the \nnorthern plains who had been reliable buyers of crop insurance found \nthat it was no longer offering much protection, after repeated years of \nweather-related disasters.\n  Other farmers across the country made the seemingly improbable \ndecision not to buy a 100 percent subsidized catastrophic policy \nbecause they found it worthless--so worthless they wouldn't spend even \n$50 for the administrative fee. And they then chose not to purchase a \nbuy-up policy, either.\n  And of greatest concern was the inevitable ad hoc disaster program, \nwhich Congress had theoretically eliminated in 1994. We spent an \nadditional $6 billion on disaster aid last year in part to make up for \nthese problems. And there are no substantive changes in the program to \nward off another disaster bill this year.\n  We will spend at least $18 billion this fiscal year to support \nagriculture. And the crisis is only deepening.\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n  Will this bill fix that crisis? No. Crop insurance does not and can \nnot provide income. If you're getting a check from your insurance \ncompany--for your car, or your house, or your farm--you've lost money.\n\n  But the program today no longer provides even enough support to keep \nmost farmers in business after a couple of loss years. How can it, when \nmost of them have a 35 percent deductible? For a farm operation with \n$500,000 worth of production, that means the farmer absorbs the first \n$175,000 of loss.\n  Let me give you an example of how the economics of crop insurance \nwork today. Doug Schmale of Lodgepole, NE, grows about 1,500 acres of \nwheat on his farm. He's a believer in crop insurance and buys it every \nyear. And now he buys CRC, because he understands that covering revenue \nis an improvement over just covering yields.\n  Doug says the reason he only buys 65 percent coverage is because, \n``That's where it makes the most sense, because that's where the \ngovernment puts the money. But it's still not adequate.''\n  Doug is insuring 26 bushels of wheat per acre, which he admits is \nnowhere close to what he can live on. And since 1987 he's only \ncollected on his insurance policy twice. And he pays about $8,000 a \nyear to buy it, every year.\n  What Doug wants is to buy a 75 percent CRC policy. But if he does \nthat today, his costs will more than double. He'll go from $4.72 an \nacre to $9.75. And that's not even an option when wheat is only worth \n$3.00.\n  Doug says that this bill will finally make coverage affordable for \nhim. He'll get enough coverage--at a price he can afford--to stay in \nbusiness if he has two bad years in a row.\n  There's been a lot of talk about ``safety nets'' over the past few \nyears. And we all know that we wouldn't insure our houses with a 35 \npercent deductible. But the economics of agriculture say to farmers, \n``Underinsure,'' especially now, when every dollar per acre makes an \nenormous difference.\n  Congress must help change that message. Our message to farmers must \nbe, ``We want you to insure your farm operation for enough coverage \nthat your policy has some value. We want you to be able to take into \naccount crop rotation, new crops and new land. If you have an \nunbelievable run of bad luck with the weather, we want crop insurance \nto help you stay in business.\n\n  ``And we will help you do it.''\n  Additionally, this bill recognizes that many farmers are trying new \ncrops and in fact other government policies have encouraged them to do \nso. The crop insurance program offers little option but to underinsure \nor go without coverage. This bill would required changes in the program \nto take that into account.\n  And just as importantly, this bill takes a big step toward \nrestructuring the agency that oversees the program. Unbelievably, the \nstatute now makes the board of directors responsible for reporting to \nthe government agency, instead of having the agency report to the \nBoard. We'll put the board of directors at the top of the hierarchy \nwhere they belong.\n  By making changes in the administration of the program, we'll come \ncloser to the flexible and responsive risk management program that \nfarmers expect. That may be the most important thing we accomplish.\n  Senator Roberts and I have worked together on crop insurance in the \npast, and we are happy to take the lead again. And I reiterate: this is \nnot the panacea to the financial crisis in rural America, but it is a \nworthwhile first step.\n  I look forward to a renewed spirit of bipartisanship on ag issues, \nand we are starting here today.\n  Mr. President, quite simply, this piece of legislation will make crop \ninsurance more affordable, more flexible and more responsive to the \nchanging needs of farmers. That has been our goal from the start, for \nfarmers in Nebraska, farmers in Kansas and farmers throughout the \ncountry.\n  The basic structure of the Crop Insurance Program was set in place in \n1980. Much of that structure remains in place today. The last time \nCongress changed the law was in 1994, and at that time we created new \nopportunities for private sector delivery of policies and risk sharing. \nIt is a model, in my judgment, Mr. President, that has worked.\n  The taxpayers take half the risk; the private sector takes half the \nrisk. They are the ones out selling the product and, as a consequence, \nthere is far less taxpayer exposure than there would be otherwise. \nSenator Roberts just alluded to it. In fact, I think he did more than \njust allude to it. He said it directly.\n  The ad hoc disaster program we believed we were ending in 1994, when \nwe passed the crop insurance bill, well, it came back last year with a \nvengeance for $6 billion. It is not a very efficient way of helping \nbusinesspeople, family-operated farms that suffer losses. It is a very \ninefficient way. Typically it costs us a great deal more money and \ntypically it does not benefit the people who need it the most.\n  What crop insurance gives the farmer is a management tool that they \ncan use to manage risk. It is not a replacement for other programs. It \nis not a replacement for income. It is a tool that they can use to \nmanage the considerable risk of manufacturing a product outside.\n  In 1994, after we created the program, we met with considerable \nsuccess. We had 181 million acres that were enrolled in the program--\nthat is up from 100 million acres enrolled in 1993--but we are seeing \nparticipation rates decline. Last year we discovered more cause for \nconcern when farmers in the northern plains who had been reliable \nbuyers of crop insurance found that it was no longer offering much \nprotection. They were unwilling to buy a 100-percent subsidized \ncatastrophic policy because they found it was worthless. It is only 50 \nbucks, but they are telling us that it is worthless.\n  Other concerns were expressed by farmers, to both Senator Roberts and \nI, and many other Members of Congress, about how to make this Crop \nInsurance Program work. We have tried, with this piece of legislation, \nto do that, by inverting the subsidies, by equalizing the subsidies for \nrevenue insurance, by allowing revenue insurance to be offered for \nprice as well as for yields, by changing the APH for multiyear losses, \nas well as making changes for farmers that are coming on line for the \nfirst time, by allowing livestock to be covered for the first time, a \npermissive piece, and, most importantly for me, by restructuring the \nRisk Management Agency itself, making the Risk Management Agency \ndirector responsive to the board and bringing on a new private sector \nentity to evaluate reinsurance and evaluate what, indeed, the market \nitself wanted to do.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk specifically about one \nindividual, a man by the name of Doug Schmale from Lodgepole, NE. He \ngrows about 1,500 acres of wheat on his farm. He likes crop insurance. \nHe buys it every year and has bought it since 1987. He has collected \nbut twice.\n  I talked to him about the details. Listen to his details. It is the \nsame thing we are hearing from farmers throughout the country. He buys \n65 percent coverage, he said, because ``that's where it makes the most \nsense, because that's where the Government puts the money. But it's not \nadequate.''\n  It doesn't provide him with the protection he needs. That means he \nwill be insuring about 26 bushels an acre, which he admits is nowhere \nclose to what he can produce, nowhere near the kind of losses he would \nexpect if he were to suffer a loss on that crop.\n  What he would like to do is buy a 75 percent crop recovery policy. If \nhe does that, the premiums are so high that, given the price of wheat, \nhe cannot afford to buy it.\n  Again, Mr. President, we are not talking about throwing a bunch of \nmoney out here. We are talking about allowing these subsidies to change \nso the private sector can sell the product easier. I must emphasize \nthis over and over, that what crop insurance represents for the \ntaxpayer is a terrific way to put a product out there to manage risk, \nbecause the private sector assumes half the loss. The private sector \nwill suffer a significant loss if there are losses. So they are not \ngoing to be out there underwriting policies for things that they \nconsider to be too risky, because they are on the line for half the \nloss.\n  This piece of legislation represents a substantial step forward. We \nhave pilot projects in there for beginning farmers.\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nWe have pilot projects in there, as well, for many of our southern \nfriends who are concerned that cotton, because it is a lower-cost \nproduct, has not been able to get good underwriting. We have tried to \naccommodate concerns for many other crops as well.\n  We believe that if we can get this legislation passed this year, it \nwill be a giant step forward from what we had in 1994 and will continue \nus in the direction of saying that we are not going to have ad hoc \ndisaster programs. We are going to allow the farmer himself to have a \nproduct that enables him to manage that risk and reduce the risk \nassociated with a rather risky endeavor of production agriculture.\n  I don't know if the Senator from Kansas has anymore enlightened, \nhumorous remarks to make. I wonder if the Senator from Kansas will \nagree that what we saw after we passed the law in 1994 was a \nsubstantial increase in the number of acres that are covered, and the \nprogram is working, but we have kind of hit a wall. We reformed it \nconsiderably. We are moving more toward the market, but we have hit a \nwall.\n  The market is basically saying, ``We have products that we can sell; \nour farmers will buy the products.'' But here are changes we need to \nmake in this law and if you make these changes, we think you will find \nmore acreage is underwritten, more satisfied customers and less need \nfor ad hoc disaster, as a consequence.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, if I may respond to my distinguished \nfriend, the whole goal of this is to provide the farmer and rancher \nwith the risk management tools to enable that decisionmaking to be made \nby the individual producer as opposed to those of us in Washington who \nrespond, as I indicated before, it seems like almost even numbered \nyears to the plight of those who are experiencing disasters. We think \nthis program or this reform will certainly represent a lot more \nconsistencies.\n\n  Yes, it will cost money, but if you add up the average $1.5 billion \nthat we have paid in disaster programs, not to mention the $6 billion \nemergency bill as of last year, of course that is reflective of the \nloss of export demand we have seen because of the economic problems all \nover the world. But I certainly agree with my colleague and my \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I have several unanimous consent requests, I tell my \ncolleague, if I may offer them at this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Craig, Burns, \nHagel, Daschle, Conrad,  and Baucus be added as original cosponsors on \nthe bill just introduced by Senator Kerrey and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that any \nSenator wishing to be added to this legislation as an original \ncosponsor be allowed to do so prior to the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that growing list of \ncosponsors. I hope this is a piece of legislation which we can persuade \nour friends on the Budget Committee to make room for. It will save us \nmoney in the long term. It will save us and prevent us from spending \nmultibillions of dollars a year on ad hoc disaster assistance in some \nkind of a supplemental appropriation. I hope very much that we are able \nto get some additional room.\n  I was disappointed we did not see it in the President's budget. He \nhas a lot of new spending priorities. I think if we put this a bit \nahead of some of the spending priorities, we ought to make room for it.\n  I promise my colleagues, if we do that, if we change the law in this \nway, you will find we will be saving money in the long term trying to \nmake certain that family-based agriculture, one of the most important \nparts of our economy, still producing this year at least $20 billion \nworth of surplus in trade--it is going to be down a it in 1999, but it \nis still an enormously important part of our economy--I assure my \ncolleagues if we get room in our budget to include the cost of this \nexpansion of crop insurance that it will save us money in the long \nterm.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friends and \ncolleagues Senators Roberts and Kerrey as a cosponsor of legislation \nbeing introduced today to reform the Federal agricultural crop \ninsurance program. I am proud to stand with these leaders in purposing \nsweeping legislation to bring back some normalcy to our Nation's farm \neconomy and expand the risk management tools available to our farm and \nranch families.\n  The bill addresses several concerns farmers from my state and I have \nabout the current crop insurance program. Specifically, I am pleased \nthat the legislation includes provisions to establish an APH history \nadjustment for beginning farmers and multi-year disasters. In addition, \nremoving the exclusion for livestock coverage is long overdue.\n  By cosponsoring this legislation today, I do not wish to imply that \nour search for meaningful crop insurance reform ideas has been \ncompleted. Just the contrary--I see this bill as a reasonable and \nappropriate first step toward our long-term goal of providing real risk \nmanagement tools to our farmers and ranchers.\n  While I am pleased that the bill includes provisions that allow the \nRisk Management Agency to develop policies for ``speciality'' or \n``minor'' crops and for crops in under-served areas, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to develop even stronger and more beneficial \nrisk management tools for these producers. Idaho's great agricultural \neconomy is based on minor and nontraditional crops. We lead the nation \nin the production of such crops as potatoes, winter peas, and trout. \nIdaho is second in the production of seed peas, lentils, sugar beets, \nbarley and mint. Furthermore, we are in the top five states in the \nproduction of hops, onions, plums, sweet cherries, alfalfa, and \nAmerican cheese.\n  The needs of these producers are just as important as those of more \ntraditional farm commodities. I want to assure my colleagues that I \nwill continue to work for the resolution of this and other matters as \nour effort to reform Federal crop insurance progresses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 530. A bill to amend the Act commonly known as the Expert Apple \nand Pear Act to limit the applicability of that act to apples; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  expert apple and pear act amendments\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \namending the 1933 Export Apple and Pear Act to provide for the \nexpansion of pear exports.\n  Currently, all apple and pear exporters must follow the guidelines \nset forth in the Act when negotiating overseas sales of these \ncommodities. According to the Act, only high grade apples and pears are \nto be sold in foreign markets. Should an exporter decide to broker a \ndeal with another country involving lower grade apple and pears, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture must provide a waiver to farmers \nallowing them to do so.\n  While growers have prospered under the 1933 Export Apple and Pear \nAct, more and more countries have requested to purchase lower grade \npears. The purpose of this legislation is to eliminate pears from the \nExport Apple and Pear Act allowing growers and exporters the ability to \nexpand the market for low grade pears without having to approach USDA \nin each instance for a waiver.\n  There is no doubt that the Pacific Northwest fruit industry is facing \na difficult year financially. I believe this bill provides one \nadditional mechanism necessary for an economically strapped industry to \naccess additional markets while still promoting a quality U.S. product.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a bill I \nhave introduced today that will provide Oregon pear producers the \nflexibility they need to meet the demands of their foreign customers.\n  With continued low commodity prices in nearly all sectors of American \nagriculture, and with financial uncertainty in many of our export \nmarkets, now is the time for the Congress to do\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nall it can to remove unnecessary hindrances to sales of farm products \nabroad. The legislation which I have introduced today with my \ncolleague, the senior senator from the state of Washington, would \ndelete references to pears in the Export Apple and Pear Act. Under the \nExport Apple and Pear Act, only pears meeting Federal high quality \nstandards are allowed to be exported. Although this standard served the \npurposes of the pear industry when the Export Apple and Pear Act was \noriginally enacted in 1933, it has increasingly become an obstacle to \nU.S. pear producers who desire to enter new markets through the export \nof lower grade pears. In recent years, pear producers have had to \nobtain special waivers from USDA in order to sell lower grade pears to \nthe emerging markets of Russia and Latin America. With American \nagriculture increasingly a part of a larger, global economy, U.S. pear \nproducers need the Congress to remove this antiquated regulatory hurdle \nto expanded pear exports.\n  Perhaps my colleagues noted that the companion bill to this \nlegislation, H.R. 609, was adopted unanimously by the House of \nRepresentatives earlier this week. The swift passage of this \nlegislation in the House is the result of the clear consensus of both \nthe pear industry and the Department of Agriculture that the inclusion \nof pears in the Export Apple and Pear Act is no longer necessary.\n  Mr. President, from Hood River, in the shadow of Mount Hood, to the \nRogue Valley, just north of California, the pear industry has long been \na key part of the success of Oregon agriculture. With the regulatory \nrelief provided by this bill, I believe that pear producers in Oregon \nand around the country will have the ability to continue to compete \neffectively overseas and prosper at home. I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Gorton and myself in support of early adoption of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 531. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Rosa Parks in recognition of her \ncontributions to the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\nlegislation to authorize the president to award a gold medal on behalf \n                     of the congress to rosa parks.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nSessions, Levin, Kennedy and Harkin to introduce an important piece of \nlegislation that will honor one of the most important figures in the \nAmerican civil rights movement, Rosa Parks.\n  Given her immense contributions to our Nation, we believe it is only \nfitting that she be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal.\n  For decades, Mr. President, African-Americans in this country, this \nbirth place of freedom, were treated as second class citizens, or less.\n  Even after the moral enormity of slavery had finally been ended, \nAfrican-Americans were subjected to discrimination, segregation and, if \nthey resisted, prosecution and even lynching.\n  Rosa Parks set in motion the events that brought to an end the \nshameful history of Jim Crow.\n  Rosa Parks refused to obey the segregation laws in her home city of \nMontgomery, AL, and go to the back of the bus.\n  When confronted, she refused give up her seat on that bus to a white \nman, even when threatened with jail.\n  She was arrested, and the reaction would change the face of this \nNation.\n  Over 40,000 people boycotted Montgomery buses for 381 days.\n  Faced with official condemnation and violence, these brave men and \nwomen maintained their unity until the bus segregation laws were \nfinally changed.\n  Their actions brought about the 1956 Supreme Court decision declaring \nthe Montgomery segregation law unconstitutional and spurred the civil \nrights movement to further action; action which produced the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, breaking down the barriers of legal discrimination \nagainst African-Americans and establishing equality before the law as a \nreality for all Americans.\n  Rosa Parks set these historic events in motion.\n  She was the first woman to join the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP \nand served as an active volunteer for the Montgomery Voters League.\n  Because of her strength, perseverance and quiet dignity, all \nAmericans have been freed from the moral stain of segregation.\n  And this mother of the civil rights movement continues to be active \nin the struggle for equality and the empowerment of the \ndisenfranchised.\n  Ms. Parks has received many awards in recognition of her efforts for \nracial harmony, including the NAACP's highest honor for civil rights \ncontributions, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest \ncivilian honor, and the first International Freedom Conductor Award \nfrom the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.\n  Throughout her life, Rosa Parks has been an example of the power of \nconviction and quiet dignity in pursuit of justice and empowerment. Mr. \nPresident, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting legislation to \nbestow upon her the Congressional Gold Medal she so well deserves.\n  Mr. President, I remember as a young student in grade school being \ntold the story of the woman who said she would not move to the back of \nthe bus. I did not know who that was by name. I just remember being so \nstruck and touched by that story. I did not realize someday I would \nhave the opportunity to meet that lady. She lives in my State of \nMichigan today. I have had a chance to get to know her a bit, but, more \nimportantly, to work with her organizations there which do fine work \nfor our communities and for our country.\n  So Mr. President, I am very proud to be here today to offer this \nCongressional Gold Medal proposal. I want to thank our cosponsors. We \nare very hopeful that others will join us so we can pass this proposal \nas soon as possible.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate the \ncourtesies of Senator Abraham and Senator Levin as we work through this \neffort to achieve this Gold Medal for Ms. Rosa Parks. I think it is a \nvery fitting and appropriate thing that we do so.\n  So I rise today to recognize Ms. Parks, a native Alabamian, who \nthrough her life and example has touched both the heart and the \nconscience of an entire Nation. She is a native of Tuskegee, and a \nformer resident of Montgomery, AL. Her dignity in the face of \ndiscrimination helped spark a movement to ensure that all citizens were \ntreated equally under the law.\n  Equal treatment under the law is a fundamental pillar upon which our \nRepublic rests. In fact, over the first 2 months of this year this \nSenate has discussed that very issue in some detail. As legislators, we \nshould work to strengthen the appreciation for this fundamental \ngoverning principle and recognize those who have made extraordinary \ncontributions toward ensuring that all American citizens have the same \nopportunities, regardless of their race, sex, creed, or national \norigin, to enjoy the freedoms this country has to offer.\n  Through her efforts, Ms. Parks has become a living embodiment of this \nprinciple. And it is entirely appropriate that this Congress takes the \nopportunity to acknowledge her contribution by authorizing the award of \na Congressional Gold Medal to her. Her courage, what we in Alabama \nmight call ``gumption'', at a critical juncture resulted in historic \nchange.\n  Certainly, there is much still to be done. True equality, the total \nelimination of discrimination, and a real sense of ease and acceptance \namong the races has not been fully reached. But it is fair to say that \nin the history of this effort, the most dramatic and productive chapter \nwas ignited by the lady we honor today.\n  Ms. Parks' story is well known, but it bears repeating. She was born \non February 4, 1913, in the small town of Tuskegee AL to Mr. James and \nLeona McCauley. As a young child, she moved to Montgomery with her \nmother, who was a local schoolteacher. Like many Southern cities, the \nMontgomery of Ms. Parks' youth was a segregated city with numerous laws \nmandating the unequal treatment of people based on the\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\ncolor of their skin. These laws were discriminatory in their intent, \nand divisive, unfair, and humiliating in their application, but for \nyears Ms. Parks had suffered with them until the fateful day of \nDecember 1, 1955, when her pride and her dignity would allow her to \nobey them no more. On this day Ms. Parks, a 42-year-old seamstress, \nboarded a city bus after a long, hard day at work. Like other public \naccommodations, this bus contained separate sections for white and \nblack passengers, with white passengers allocated the front rows, and \nblack passengers given the back. This bus was particularly crowded that \nevening. At one of the stops, a white passenger boarded, and the bus \ndriver, seeing Ms. Parks, requested that she give up her seat and move \nto the back of the bus, even though this meant that she would be forced \nto stand. Ms. Parks refused to give up her seat and was arrested for \ndisobeying that order.\n  For this act of civic defiance, Ms. Parks set off a chain of events \nthat have led some to refer to her as the ``Mother of the Civil Rights \nMovement.'' Her arrest led to the Montgomery bus boycott, and organized \nmovement led by a young minister, then unknown, named Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., who had been preaching at the historic Baptist church \nlocated on Montgomery's Dexter Avenue. The bus boycott lasted 382 days, \nand its impact directly led to the integration of the bus lines while \nthe attention generated helped lift Dr. King to national prominence. \nUltimately, the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to rule on the \nconstitutionality of the Montgomery law which Ms. Parks had defied and \nthe court struck it down.\n  This powerful image, that of a hard working American ordered to the \nback of the bus, simply because of her race, was a catalytic event. It \nwas the spark that caused a nation to stop accepting things as they had \nbeen and focused everyone on the fundamental issue--whether we could \ncontinue as a segregated society. As a result of the movement Ms. Parks \nhelped start, today's Montgomery is very different from the Montgomery \nof Ms. Parks' youth. Today, the citizens of Montgomery look with a \ngreat deal of historical pride upon the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. \nToday's Montgomery is home to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an \norganization devoted to the cause of civil rights and also the Civil \nRights Memorial, a striking monument of black granite and cascading \nwater which memorializes the individuals who gave their lives in the \npursuit of equal justice. Today's Montgomery is a city in which its \nhistory as the ``Capital of the Confederacy'' and its history as the \n``Birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement'' are both recognized, \nunderstood and reconciled. But Montgomery is not alone in this \ndevelopment. Many American cities owe the same debt of gratitude to Ms. \nParks that Montgomery does. In fact, Ms. Parks' contributions may \nextend beyond even the borders of our nation. In the book ``Bus Ride to \nJustice,'' Mr. Fred Gray, who gained fame while in his 20's as Ms. \nParks' attorney in the bus desegregation case and as the lead attorney \nin many of Alabama's and the Nation's most important civil rights \ncases, wrote these words, and I don't think they are an exaggeration:\n\n       Little did we know that we had set in motion a force that \n     would ripple throughout Alabama, the South, the nation, and \n     even the world. But from the vantage point of almost 40 years \n     later, there is a direct correlation between what we started \n     in Montgomery and what has subsequently happened in China, \n     eastern Europe, South Africa, and even more recently, in \n     Russia. While it is inaccurate to say that we all sat down \n     and deliberately planned a movement that would echo and \n     reverberate around the world, we did work around the clock, \n     planning strategy and creating an atmosphere that gave \n     strength, courage, faith and hope to people of all races, \n     creeds, colors and religions around the world. And it all \n     started on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, with Rosa Parks on \n     December 1, 1955.\n\n  For her courage and her conviction, and for her role in changing \nAlabama, the South, the nation and the world for the better, our Nation \nowes thanks to Ms. Parks. I hope that this body will extend its thanks \nand recognition to her by awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Rosa Parks is truly one of this Nation's \ngreatest heroes. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice have shaped \nour Nation's history and are remembered with respect and with reverence \nby us all.\n  Forty three years ago--December 1995--in Montgomery, Alabama the \nmodern civil rights movement began. Rosa Parks refused to give up her \nseat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this \ncourageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American \npeople but the entire world.\n  My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our \nown. Rosa Parks and her husband made the journey to Michigan in 1957. \nUnceasing threats on their lives and persistent harassment by phone \nprompted the move to Detroit where Rosa Park's brother resided.\n  Rosa Park's arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the \ncatalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day \nin 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle \nfor equality and justice. For instance, twelve years earlier, in 1943, \nRosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's \nbus related segregation laws, which required African Americans to pay \ntheir fares at the front of the bus then get off of the bus and re-\nboard from the bus at the rear. The driver of that bus was the same \ndriver with whom Rosa Parks would have her confrontation 12 years \nlater.\n  The rest is history--the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus.\n  We have come a long way towards achieving Dr. King's dream of justice \nand equality for all. But we still have much work to do. Let us \nrededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle on Civil Rights, and to \nhuman rights in Rosa Parks name.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief biography of the \nlife and times and movement which was sparked by Rosa Parks, the mother \nof the civil rights movement, and excerpted from USL Biographies, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Rosa Parks--American Social Activist\n\n       ``I felt just resigned to give what I could to protect \n     against the way I was being treated.''\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \n     on a bus to a white man who wanted it. By this simple act, \n     which today would seem unremarkable, she set in motion the \n     civil rights movement, which led to the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 and ultimately ensured that today all black Americans \n     must be given equal treatment with whites under the law.\n       Parks did not know that she was making history nor did she \n     intend to do so. She simply knew that she was tired after a \n     long day's work and did not want to move. Because of her \n     fatigue and because she was so determined, America was \n     changed forever. Segregation was on its way out.\n\n\n                   growing up in a segregated society\n\n       In the first half of this century, Montgomery, Alabama, was \n     totally segregated, like so many other cities in the South. \n     In this atmosphere Parks and her brother grew up. They had \n     been brought to Montgomery by their mother, Leona (Edwards) \n     McCauley, when she and their father separated in 1915. Their \n     father, James McCauley, went away north and they seldom saw \n     him, but they were made welcome by their mother's family and \n     passed their childhood among cousins, uncles, aunts, \n     grandparents, and great-grandparents.\n       Parks's mother was a schoolteacher, and Parks was taught by \n     her until the age of eleven, when she went to Montgomery \n     Industrial School for Girls. It was, of course, an all-black \n     school, as was Booker T. Washington High School, which she \n     attended briefly. Virtually everything in Montgomery was for \n     ``blacks only'' or ``whites only,'' and Parks became used to \n     obeying the segregation laws, though she found them \n     humiliating.\n       When Parks was twenty, she married Raymond Parks, a barber, \n     and moved out of her mother's home. Parks took in sewing and \n     worked at various jobs over the years. She also became an \n     active member of the National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People (NAACP), working as secretary of the \n     Montgomery chapter.\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n                            silent protests\n\n       In 1955 Parks was forty-two years old, and she had taken to \n     protesting segregation in her own quiet way--for instance, by \n     walking up the stairs of a building rather than riding in an \n     elevator marked ``blacks only.'' She was well respected in \n     the black community for her work with the Montgomery Voters \n     League as well as the NAACP. The Voters League was a group \n     that helped black citizens pass the various tests that had \n     been set up to make it difficult for them to register as \n     voters.\n       As well as avoiding black-only elevators, Parks often \n     avoided traveling by bus, preferring to walk home from work \n     when she was not too tired to do so. The buses were a \n     constant irritation to all black passengers. The front four \n     rows were reserved for whites (and remained empty even when \n     there were not enough white passengers to fill them). The \n     back section, which was always very crowded, was for black \n     passengers. In between were some rows that were really part \n     of the black section, but served as an overflow area for \n     white passengers. If the white section was full, black \n     passengers in the middle section had to vacate their \n     seats--a whole row had to be vacated, even if only one \n     white passenger required a seat.\n\n\n                        the arrest of rosa parks\n\n       This is what happened on the evening of December 1, 1955: \n     Parks took the bus because she was feeling particularly tired \n     after a long day in the department store where she worked as \n     a seamstress. She was sitting in the middle section, glad to \n     be off her feet at last, when a white man boarded the bus and \n     demanded that her row be cleared because the white section \n     was full. The others in the row obediently moved to the back \n     of the bus, but Parks just didn't feel like standing for the \n     rest of the journey, and she quietly refused to move.\n       At this, the white bus driver threatened to call the police \n     unless Parks gave up her seat, but she calmly replied ``Go \n     ahead and call them.'' By the time the police arrived, the \n     driver was very angry, and when asked whether he wanted Parks \n     to be arrested or let off with a warning, he insisted on \n     arrest. So this respectable middle-aged woman was taken to \n     the police station, where she was fingerprinted and jailed. \n     She was allowed to make one phone call. She called an NAACP \n     lawyer, who arranged for her to be released on bail.\n\n\n                            the bus boycott\n\n       Word of Parks' arrest spread quickly, and the Women's \n     Political Council decided to protest her treatment by \n     organizing a boycott of the buses. The boycott was set for \n     December 5, the day of Parks' trial, but Martin Luther King, \n     Jr., and other prominent members of Montgomery's black \n     community realized that here was a chance to take a firm \n     stand on segregation. As a result, the Montgomery Improvement \n     Association was formed to organize an boycott that would \n     continue until the bus segregation laws were changed. \n     Leaflets were distributed telling people not to ride the \n     buses, and other forms of transport were relied on.\n       The boycott lasted 382 days, causing the bus company to \n     lose a vast amount of money. Meanwhile, Parks was fined for \n     failing to obey a city ordinance, but on the advice of her \n     lawyers she refused to pay the fine so that they could \n     challenge the segregation law in court. The following year, \n     the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Montgomery segregation law \n     illegal, and the boycott was at last called off. Yet Parks \n     had started far more than a bus boycott. Other cities \n     followed Montgomery's example and were protesting their \n     segregation laws. The civil rights movement was underway.\n\n\n                  mother of the civil rights movement\n\n       Parks has been hailed as ``the mother of the civil rights \n     movement,'' but this was not an easy role for her. Threats \n     and constant phone calls she received during the boycott \n     caused her husband to have a nervous breakdown, and in 1957 \n     they moved to Detroit, where Parks' brother, Sylvester, \n     lived. There Parks continued her work as a seamstress, but \n     she had become a public figure and was often sought out to \n     give talks about civil rights.\n       Over the years, Parks has received several honorary \n     degrees, and in 1965 Congressman John Conyers of Detroit \n     appointed her to his staff. Parks' husband died in 1977 and \n     she retired in 1988, but she has continued to work for the \n     betterment of the black community. She is particularly eager \n     to help the young, and in 1987 she established the Rosa and \n     Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, a training \n     school for Detroit teenagers.\n       Each year sees more honors showered upon her. In 1990, some \n     three thousand people attended the Kennedy Center in \n     Washington, D.C., to celebrate the seventy-seventh birthday \n     of the indomitable campaigner and former seamstress, Rosa \n     Parks.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and I thank our colleagues from Michigan \nand Alabama.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 532. A bill to provide increased funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Programs, to \nresume the funding of the State grants program of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and to provide for the acquisition and development \nof conservation and recreation facilities and programs in urban areas, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n           public lands and recreation investment act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Public \nLands and Recreation Investment Act of 1999. This bill will provide \nfunding for two of our nation's most important conservation and \nrecreation programs--the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban \nParks and Recreation Recovery Act--that have been woefully underfunded \nin recent years.\n  Every year, the Federal government collects about $4 billion from oil \nand gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. These leases have \ndetrimental impacts on our environment, so it is fitting that in 1965 \nCongress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This fund is \nauthorized to use $900 million annually in Outer Continental Shelf \nlease payments to purchase park and recreation lands in or near our \nnational parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public \nlands. The fund also is supposed to provide grants to states, so that \nstate and local governments may purchase parklands and recreation \nfacilities.\n  Acquisition of these lands protects some of our nation's most crucial \nnatural resources, including key watersheds that provide drinking water \nto millions of Americans, and vital wildlife habitat for endangered \nspecies. Public lands also provide recreation opportunities for \nmillions of Americans, and open spaces in increasingly crowded urban \nareas. Over the years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nprotected lands in all 50 States, including such special places as \nYellowstone National Park, the Everglades, and the California Desert.\n  Unfortunately, the Land and Water Conservation Fund's tremendous \npromise has not yet been fulfilled. Last year Congress and the \nPresident provided only $328 million of the $900 million collected by \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition. The rest \nwent back into the Treasury, for deficit reduction or spending on other \nprograms. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has collected over $21 \nbillion since its creation in 1965, but only $9 billion has been spent. \nUnappropriated balances in the fund now total $13 billion, and they are \ngrowing every year.\n  In the meantime, a huge backlog has developed in the federal \nacquisition of environmentally sensitive land. The U.S. Department of \nInterior estimates that the cost of acquiring inholdings in national \nparks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands now \ntotals over $10 billion. In addition, the federal government receives \nabout $600 million in Land and Water Conservation Fund requests each \nyear.\n  The funding shortfall has been particularly difficult for State and \nlocal governments. For the last several years, Congress has provided no \nfunding for the stateside grants portion of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, or to The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, a \nseparate program that provides for rehabilitation of recreation \nfacilities and improved recreation programs in our nation's cities.\n  Last month President Clinton proposed the Lands Legacy Initiative, \nwhich would provide $1 billion from the Land and Water Conservation \nFund in fiscal year 2000. The President's initiative would expand our \nnation's public lands, provide grants to states for land acquisition, \npromote open space and ``smart growth,'' improve wildlife habitat, and \nprotect farmland from development. The Lands Legacy Initiative is a \ngood first step, but our commitment to public lands should not be a \none-year deal.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that other Senators have introduced bills \nthat would provide permanent funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act, as \nwell as a number of other programs. I support Senator Boxer's bill, the \nPermanent Protection for America's Resources Act, and I look forward to \nworking with her and with all Senators interested in public lands, \ncoastal restoration, and wildlife protection.\n  If Senator Boxer's bill does not move, however, the bill that I am \nintroducing today is a moderate alternative that I believe will enjoy \nbroad\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nbipartisan support. The bill is important for three reasons. First, it \nfocuses exclusively on guaranteed annual funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program. I \nwant to ensure that the Land and Water Conservation Fund remains a top \npriority for Congress regardless of other important environmental \nprograms that are funded. We cannot lose sight of how important the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund is to America's conservation and \nrecreation efforts.\n  Second, the bill makes no changes to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund that impede the federal government's ability to acquire land. Two \nbills currently pending in Congress would restrict federal land \npurchases to inholdings within existing parks only, and require prior \nCongressional authorization even for small acquisitions that have \ntraditionally been approved through the appropriations process. These \nbills also require that two-thirds of the federal funding be spent east \nof the 100th meridian.\n  Under these terms, projects such as the Headwaters acquisition, where \nthe federal government and State of California bought the largest \nancient redwood stand in private hands, would have been impossible. I \nbelieve strongly that the primary purpose of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--to enable the federal government to permanently \nprotect our nation's most special places--must be preserved and \nstrengthened, not eroded.\n  Finally, this bill revives the state grants portion of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, which has funded over 37,000 state parks \nprojects over the last three decades, as well as the Urban Parks and \nRecreation Recovery Program. These programs have worked well for \ndecades, and I would like to restore funding for them while preserving \nbroad latitude for states and local governments to determine their own \nconservation and recreation priorities. The bill does not establish \ncompetitive grants under the state program.\n  Specifically, the bill amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nAct to say that $900 million will be automatically appropriated each \nyear for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Urban Parks and \nRecreation Recovery Program. The bill also provides that 40 percent of \nthe funds provided under this act must be spent on stateside grants. \nThis will revive the moribund State grants program and ensure that \nstates get their fair share of parks and recreation dollars. States \nwill be required to ``pass through'' 50 percent of the grants they \nreceive directly to local governments.\n  In addition, the bill provides that 10 percent of the funds provided \nunder this act be allocated to the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery \nprogram. This will ensure that recreation facilities and open space \nremain top priorities where they are urgently needed--increasingly \ncrowded cities. The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will be \namended to allow funds to be spent for construction of recreation \nfacilities, and acquisition of park lands in urban areas.\n\n  The bill also requires the President to submit an annual priority \nlist to Congress for expenditure of funds provided to federal agencies \nunder this act. The bill specifically provides for Congressional \napproval of this priority list, so that Congress will retain authority \nto decide how Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars are spent on \nfederal lands.\n  The bill changes requirements for the Land and Water Conservation \nFund's stateside grants program, including a new requirement for States \nto develop, with public input, action agendas that identify their top \nconservation and recreation acquisition needs. Finally, the bill \nprovides that Indian tribes will be recognized collectively as one \nstate under the state grants program.\n  The Public Land and Recreation Investment Act will have a major and \nimmediate impact on conservation and recreation nationwide. In my home \nstate, increased funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund could \nallow for the purchase of 483,000 acres of inholdings in national parks \nand wilderness areas in the California Desert, dramatically improving \nrecreation opportunities in three of our nation's newest national \nparks. It could permanently protect sensitive watersheds at Lake Tahoe \nand help preserve the Lake's astounding water quality. And it could \nrestore wetlands in San Francisco Bay, which has lost over 80 percent \nof its wetlands in the last 100 years.\n  Nationally, funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will \nhelp to preserve special places like Cape Cod National Seashore and the \nKodiak National Wildlife Refuge, whose land acquisition needs have gone \nunmet in recent years.\n  Reviving the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act will help cities \nacross our nation improve parks and recreation opportunities for their \nresidents. In the past, the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act has \nfunded summer recreation, anti-drug counseling, and job training for \nteenagers in low income neighborhoods in Fresno. The City of Milwaukee \ninstituted a ``Park Watch'' program to help neighborhoods combat \nvandalism and crime in city parks. And in Tuscon, Arizona, the UPARR \nprogram funded a health and physical fitness program for children, \nsenior citizens, and disabled youth.\n  This bill is strongly supported by groups that seek to protect \nconservation and recreation resources for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I will submit for the Record at the end of my \nstatement, letters from the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and \nDefenders of Wildlife, who strongly support the Public Land and \nRecreation Investment Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that for too long, we have diverted \nmonies intended for conservation and recreation to other purposes. This \nbill will help to correct that imbalance, and ensure a lasting legacy \nfor our children and grandchildren. Whether they hike through a \npristine wilderness, climb on an urban jungle gym, or picnic in a \ngreenbelt outside their hometown, they will have the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act to \nthank. That is something I believe we can all be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Land and Recreation \n     Investment Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.) has been critical in acquiring land to \n     protect America's national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, \n     and public land in all 50 States from potential development \n     and in improving recreational opportunities for all \n     Americans;\n       (2) the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped to \n     preserve nearly 7,000,000 acres of America's most special \n     places, from the California Desert to the Everglades, in part \n     by providing grants that have helped States purchase over \n     2,000,000 acres of parkland and open space;\n       (3) although amounts in the Land and Water Conservation \n     Fund are meant to be used only for conservation and \n     recreation purposes, since 1980 Congress and the President \n     have diverted much of this vital funding for deficit \n     reduction and other budgetary purposes;\n       (4) because of chronic shortages in funding for the Land \n     and Water Conservation Fund, the backlog of Federal \n     acquisition needs now totals over $10,000,000,000; the \n     backlog includes key wetlands, watersheds, wilderness, and \n     wildlife habitat and important historic, cultural, and \n     recreational sites;\n       (5) the findings of the 1995 National Biological Service \n     study entitled ``Endangered Ecosystems of the United States: \n     A Preliminary Assessment of Loss and Degradation'' \n     demonstrate the need to escalate conservation measures that \n     protect the Nation's wildlands and wildlife habitats;\n       (6) lack of funding for the State grants portion of the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund has hampered State and local \n     efforts to protect parklands, coastlines, habitat areas, and \n     open space from development;\n       (7) recreation needs in America's cities have been \n     neglected, in part because the Urban Park and Recreation \n     Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.) has not been \n     funded since 1995;\n       (8) at the same time that Federal investment in \n     conservation and recreation has shrunk, demand for outdoor \n     recreation has skyrocketed: visits to our public lands have \n     increased dramatically in recent years, and the national \n     survey on recreation and the environment conducted by the \n     Forest Service indicates substantial growth in most outdoor \n     activities; and\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n       (9) increased investment in conservation and recreation is \n     essential to maintaining America's environmental quality and \n     high quality of life.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that funding is available without further Act \n     of appropriation to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \n     the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program;\n       (2) to protect the Nation's parklands, wildlife habitat, \n     and recreational resources;\n       (3) to revive the State grants portion of the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund; and\n       (4) to ensure that local governments and Indian tribes \n     receive a fair share of proceeds from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund.\n\n     SEC. 4. LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       (a) Appropriations.--Section 3 of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Sec. 3.

LWCF represents a \n     promise made by Congress to the American people to reinvest \n     revenue from the development of non-renewable resources into \n     acquisition and permanent protection of key land, water, and \n     open space resources for future generations.\n       Unfortunately, the LWCF promise is one that has remained \n     largely unfulfilled--funding has averaged only about 25% of \n     its annual authorized level. As a result, numerous \n     conservation opportunities are being lost. Our nation's \n     obligation to purchase lands within our National Wildlife \n     Refuges, Parks, Forests, and Bureau of Land Management units \n     has been neglected. Rivers, estuaries, and wetlands across \n     the country are at risk. Pristine wilderness, vital to clean \n     water and habitat protection, and the foundation of our \n     nation's natural heritage is being threatened or destroyed. \n     Parks and open space--the cornerstone for quality of life in \n     our urban areas--are falling victim to urban sprawl and \n     unchecked development.\n       As the Public Land and Recreation Improvement Act of 1999 \n     correctly asserts, the need to provide additional protection \n     to our nation's vanishing wildlands and habitats is greater \n     than ever. The National Biological Service warned in a 1995 \n     report that the nation's ecosystems are in decline and many \n     of our park and forest areas must be acquired quickly before \n     lands and wildlife are destroyed.\n       Your bill takes an important step forward in renewing the \n     commitment made to the American people more than 30 years ago \n     when the LWCF Act was originally passed to preserve--instead \n     of losing forever--these irreplaceable land and water \n     resources.\n       As you know, the President has also recently made a \n     commitment to seek full and permanent funding for LWCF and \n     other related programs to protect habitat, open space, and \n     important marine and coastal resources. Moreover, the \n     environmental community strongly supports the dedication of \n     funding both for marine and coastal resource protection and \n     critically underfunded state non-game wildlife conservation \n     programs. We are eager to work with you, the President, and \n     other leaders on these issues in Congress to ensure permanent \n     and mandatory funding that addresses all of these crucial \n     needs without creating any incentives for new offshore \n     drilling as some current proposals in Congress would do.\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\n       Again, we applaud your leadership in introducing this \n     important legislation and thank you for your commitment to \n     preserving our magnificent natural heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rodger Schlickeisen,\n       President, Defenders of Wildlife.\n     Carl Pope,\n       Executive Director, Sierra Club.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Wilderness Society,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 1999.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Wilderness Society would like \n     to commend your efforts in introducing the ``Public Lands and \n     Recreation Investment Act of 1999''. By focusing your bill on \n     LWCF and the Urban Park and Recreation and Recovering (UPAAR) \n     program, it will address needs of expanding population and \n     urban sprawl.\n       This bill crystallizes several important concepts. It \n     dramatically elevates the funding for LWCF and resuscitates \n     the state-size grant program. Additionally, it reactivates \n     UPAAR and adapts it to respond to contemporary urban needs by \n     allowing land acquisition. Furthermore, the inclusing of \n     language that allow tribes to participate equally with states \n     for matching grants for planning acquisition and \n     rehabilitation sets an important standard.\n       We support your thoughtful efforts on behalf America's \n     public lands and appreciate the leadership you have provided.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William H. Meadows,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 533. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize \nlocal governments and Governors to restrict receipt of out-of-State \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n     interstate transportation of municipal solid waste control act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have done on two previous \noccasions, to introduce legislation to stem the flow--actually flood--\nof trash into Virginia and other States that have been affected. I am \npleased to be joined, in doing so, by my senior colleague from \nVirginia, who will be joining us very shortly, Senator Warner.\n  We have witnessed a virtual explosion in legislation in Congress \nfocussed on rights. In recent months, Congress focused on the Patients' \nBill of Rights, the Soldiers' Bill of Rights and the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights. These are just a few recent examples.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with my colleague, Senator \nWarner, could be called a Bill of Responsibilities. It recognizes the \nresponsibilities of the various levels of government to manage the huge \nvolumes of trash we are generating.\n  The primary responsibility for taking care of trash lies with local \ngovernments. They are responsible for picking up the trash and they are \nresponsible for finding a place to put it down. Local governments are \nalso charged with the responsibility of making local land-use decisions \nand should be allowed to decide for themselves whether a community \nshould be subjected to a large landfill that takes garbage from out of \nState. Recognizing the responsibilities vested in local governments, \nthe legislation we are introducing today allows localities to ban \nunwanted out-of-State trash.\n  States have a responsibility for ensuring that the State's \nenvironment is protected and that its highways and waterways are safe. \nThis legislation recognizes that responsibility, allowing States to \noverride local government approval of out-of-State imports if local \ndecisions on trash affect the State as a whole. To help States fund \nthis responsibility, the bill allows States to assess up to a $3 per \nton fee on out-of-State trash. This fee is similar to the out-of-State \ntuition that States charge students to come to their States to take \nadvantage of host State's colleges and universities.\n  In addition, the legislation allows States to cap the amount of trash \nthat can accumulate in landfills that have local approval. By allowing \nStates to impose such a cap, this legislation strikes what we believe \nis the right balance between localities' desires to generate revenues \nby accepting waste and States's responsibilities to protect State \nresources, to provide a safe network of highways, and to ensure that \nState regulatory agencies are not overwhelmed by the influx of new \nwaste.\n  This legislation also addresses the responsibilities of States that \nhave refused to face the obligations of siting their own refuse. States \nthat export huge amounts of waste are imposing a burden on those States \nthat have created new capacity. The bill we are introducing sends a \nvery strong message to States that ship more than 6 million tons a year \nto other States, although no State yet meets that threshold. The bill \nallows importing States to ban the garbage coming from such \nsuperexporting States. If the importing State chooses not to exercise \nthis prohibition, the bill allows the State to impose large and \nescalating fees on those superexporting States that have not had the \npolitical will to site their own excess capacity.\n  While large regional landfills are becoming more common because of \nthe expense of building modern and environmentally sound facilities, \nthose landfills should accept waste on the basis of a region's \ncooperation rather than on the basis of a single State's abdication of \nits responsibilities.\n  Finally, this legislation recognizes the responsibility of the \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce. Because the Supreme Court has \ndetermined the garbage is commerce, like any other commodity, States \nand localities have been powerless to halt the disposal of out-of-State \nwaste within their borders. While some States have attempted to limit \nout-of-State trash on their own, unless Congress acts to grant States \nand localities the ability to ban or limit out-of-State trash, those \nState laws are likely to be struck down as unconstitutional.\n  This legislation overcomes that constitutional hurdle by granting \nStates and localities the right to restrict interstate trash disposal. \nIf we again fail to pass legislation that protects localities from \nbeing buried under out-of-State garbage, we are abdicating our own \nresponsibility to protect the quality of life of communities in each of \nour States.\n  The bills I have introduced in past Congresses focused on protecting \nlocalities from unwanted garbage. The bill Senator Warner and I \nintroduce today builds on that foundation. It reflects Virginia's most \nrecent experience with importing garbage and addresses both the \nproblems we have seen and the lessons we have learned. We now have \nenough history to examine the benefits and the possible burdens of host \ncommunity agreements, and how they can best be used to develop state-\nof-the-art landfills. We also understand better the hardships that \ntrash traffic can impose on communities that do not benefit from \nanother community's decision to host a large landfill. Finally, it \naddresses a problem that has festered for too long, the inability of \nStates to summon the political will to site their own capacity. I \nencourage the Senate to move quickly to consider this particular \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Robb, legislation to give our States and \nlocal governments authority to ensure that they can effectively manage \nthe disposal of municipal waste within their borders.\n  For several years, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, on \nwhich I serve, has considered many legislative proposals to convey \nauthorities to States and localities to begin to address this serious \nproblem. Unfortunately, no legislation has been enacted since this \nserious problem first surfaced in the early 1990s.\n  Mr. President, in past years, Senator Robb and I have introduced \nlegislation individually to allow localities to have the ability to \ndecide when and under what circumstances waste generated from out-of-\nstate sources came into their communities for disposal. Today, I am \npleased that we are renewing our commitment to solving this serious \nproblem by working together to introduce this legislation.\n  Today, large volumes of waste are traveling from Northeastern states \nto Mid-west and Mid-Atlantic states. Over the past few years, the \namount of waste traveling across state lines has greatly increased and \nprojections are that interstate waste shipments from certain states \nwill continue to grow.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n  Most States and localities are responsible in ensuring that adequate \ncapacity exists to accommodate municipal waste generated within each \ncommunity. I regret, however, that the evidence available today shows \nthat there are specific situations where State and local governments \nare neglecting responsible environmental stewardship.\n  The result of this neglect is that other States are bearing the \nburden of disposing of their waste. These State and local governments \ncurrently have no authority to refuse this waste or even to control the \namount of waste that is sent for disposal on a daily basis.\n  Our legislation recognizes that in the normal course of business is \nit necessary for some amount of waste to travel across State lines, \nparticularly in circumstances where there are large urban areas located \nat state borders. Our legislation will not close down State borders or \nprevent any waste shipments.\n  States will have, however, for the first time, the ability to \neffectively manage and plan for the disposal out-of-State waste along \nwith waste generated within their borders.\n  Specifically, our legislation will allow States who are today \nreceiving 1 million tons of waste or more to control the growth of \nthese waste shipments.\n  These States would be permitted to freeze at current levels the \namount of waste they are receiving or, if they decided, they could \ndetermine the amount of out-of-State waste they can safely handle. \nToday, they have no voice, but this legislation will give all citizens \nthe right to participate in these important waste disposal decisions.\n  For all States and localities, protections would be provided to \nensure that all interstate waste must be handled pursuant to a host \ncommunity agreement. These voluntary agreements between the local \ncommunity receiving the waste and the industry disposing of the waste \nhave allowed some local governments to determine waste disposal \nactivities within their borders.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ndevelop a fair and equitable resolution to this problem.\n  I encourage my colleagues to carefully review our legislation and I \nwelcome their comments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 535. A bill to amend section 49106(c)(6) of title 49, United \nStates Code, to remove a limitation on certain funding; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       metropolitan washington airports authority improvement act\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with Senator Robb, to give Reagan National and Dulles \nInternational Airports equitable treatment under Federal law that is \nenjoyed today by all of the major commercial airports.\n  When the Congress enacted legislation in 1986 to transfer ownership \nof Reagan National and Dulles Airports to a regional authority--and I \nmay say, Mr. President, I was a part of that airport commission. It was \nchaired by the former Governor of Virginia, Linwood Holton; Senator \nSarbanes joined me on that. From that, I drew up this very legislation \nthat did the transfer. We included in that legislation that I drafted a \nprovision to create a congressional board of review.\n  Immediately upon passage of the 1986 Transfer Act, local community \ngroups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the board \nof review. The Supreme Court upheld the lawsuit and concurred that the \nCongressional Board of Review as structured was unconstitutional \nbecause it gave Members of Congress veto authority over the airport \ndecisions. The Court ruled that the functions of the board of review \nwas a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.\n  During the 1991 House-Senate conference on the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, I offered an amendment, which was \nadopted, to attempt to revise the Board of Review to meet the \nconstitutional requirements.\n  Those provisions were also challenged and again were ruled \nunconstitutional.\n  In 1996, in another attempt to address the situation, the Congress \nenacted legislation to repeal the Board of Review since it no longer \nserved any function due to several federal court rulings. In its place, \nCongress increased the number of federal appointees to the MWAA Board \nof Directors from 1 to 3 members.\n  In addition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the \nappointees, the statute contains a punitive provision which denies all \nfederal Airport Improvement Program entitlement grants and passenger \nfacility charges to Dulles International and Reagan National if the \nappointees were not confirmed by October 1, 1997.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has not confirmed the three Federal \nappointees, Since October, 1997, Dulles International and Reagan \nNational, and its customers, have been waiting for the Senate to take \naction. Finally in 1998, the Senate Commerce Committee favorably \nreported the three pending nominations to the Senate for consideration, \nbut unfortunately no further action occurred because these nominees \nwere held hostage for other unrelated issues. Many speculate that these \nnominees have not been confirmed because of the ongoing delay in \nenacting a long-term FAA reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I am not here today to join in that speculation. I do \nwant, however, to call to the attention of my colleagues the severe \nfinancial, safety and consumer service constraints this inaction is \nhaving on both Dulles and Reagan National.\n  As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement \ngrants for construction at the two airports and from approving any \nPassenger Facility Charge (PFC) applications, these airports have been \ndenied access to over $200 million.\n  These are funds that every other airport in the country receives \nannually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and \nsafety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the \ncountry, federal funds have been withheld from Dulles and Reagan \nNational for over 18 months.\n  These critically needed funds have halted important construction \nprojects at both airports. Of the over $200 million that is due, \napproximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects \nand $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs.\n  I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional \nduties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal \npositions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link \nthe Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to \noperate airports.\n  Also, I must say that I can find no justification for the Senate's \ndelay in considering the qualifications of these nominees to serve on \nthe MWAA Board. To my knowledge, no one has raised concerns about the \nqualifications of the nominees. We are neglecting our duties.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation today--the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority Improvement Act--to repeal the punitive \nprohibition on releasing Federal funds to the airports until the \nFederal nominees have been confirmed.\n\n  Airports are increasingly competitive. Those that cannot keep up with \nthe growing demand see the services go to other airports. This is \nparticularly true with respect to international services, and low-fare \nservices, both of which are essential.\n  As a result of the Senate's inaction, I provide for my colleagues a \nlist of the several major projects that are virtually on hold since \nOctober, 1997. They are as follows:\n  At Dulles International there are four major projects necessary for \nthe airport to maintain the tremendous growth that is occurring there.\n  Main terminal gate concourse: It is necessary to replace the current \ntemporary buildings attached to the main terminal with a suitable \nfacility. This terminal addition will include passenger hold rooms and \nairline support space. The total cost of this project is $15.4 million, \nwith $11.2 million funded by PFCs.\n  Passenger access to main terminal: As the Authority continues to keep \npace with the increased demand for parking and access to the main \nterminal, PFCs\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nare necessary to build a connector between a new automobile parking \nfacility and the terminal. The total cost of this project is $45.5 \nmillion, with $29.4 million funded by PFCs.\n  Improved passenger access between concourse B and main terminal: With \nthe construction of a pedestrian tunnel complex between the main \nterminal and the B concourse, the Authority will be able to continue to \nmeet passenger demand for access to this facility. Once this project is \ncomplete, access to concourse B will be exclusively by moving sidewalk, \nand mobile lounge service to this facility will be unnecessary. The \ntotal cost of this project is $51.1 million, with $46.8 million funded \nby PFCs.\n  Increased baggage handling capacity: With increased passenger levels \ncome increase demands for handling baggage. PFC funding is necessary to \nconstruct a new baggage handling area for inbound and outbound \npassengers. The total cost of this project is $38.7 million, with $31.4 \nmillion funded by PFCs.\n  At Reagan National there are two major projects that are dependent on \nthe Authority's ability to implement passenger facility charges (PFCs).\n  Historic main terminal rehabilitation: Even though the new terminal \nat Reagan National was opened last year, the entire Capital Development \nProgram will not be complete until the historic main terminal is \nrehabilitated for airline use. This project includes the construction \nof nine air carrier gates, renovation of historic portions of the main \nterminal for continued passenger use and demolition of space that is no \nlonger functional. The total cost of this project is $94.2 million with \n$20.7 million to be paid for by AIP entitlement grants and $36.2 \nmillion to be funded with PFCs. Additional airfield work to accompany \nthis project will cost $12.2 million, with $5.2 million funded by PFCs.\n  Terminal connector expansion: In order to accommodate the increased \npassengers moving between Terminals B and C (the new terminal) and \nTerminal A, it is necessary to expand the ``Connector'' between the two \nbuildings. The total cost of the project is $4.8 million, with $4.3 \nmillion funded by PFCs.\n  Mr. President, my legislation is aimed at ensuring that necessary \nsafety and service improvements proceed at Reagan National and Dulles. \nLet's give them the ability to address consumer needs just like every \nother airport does on a daily basis.\n  Mr. President, here is the problem. This legislation does not remove \nthe Congress of the United States, and particularly the Senate, from \nthe advise-and-consent role, but it allows the money, which we need for \nthe modernization of these airports, to flow properly to the airports \nto continue the program of restructuring them physically to accommodate \nsomewhat larger traffic patterns, as well as do the necessary \nmodernization to achieve safety--most important, safety--and greater \nconvenience for the passengers using these two airports.\n  Those funds have been held up. It is over $200 million, as my \ncolleague from Virginia will join me in saying; $200 million are more \nor less held in escrow pending the confirmation by the Senate of the \nUnited States of three individuals to this board.\n  For reasons known to this body, that confirmation has been held up. \nThe confirmation may remain held up. But this legislation will let the \nmoneys flow to the airports for this needed construction for safety and \nconvenience, and then at a later date, hopefully, we can achieve the \nconfirmation of these three new members to the board. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my senior colleague, \nSenator Warner, in introducing legislation to put an end to the \nstrangulation of the Capital region's airports. As Senator Warner just \nindicated, more than $200 million in airport improvements are on hold, \nand have been on hold since October 1, 1997, as part of an effort to \nstrong-arm the region into accepting more flights at Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport.\n  I believe this tactic is outrageous. It is bad enough that the \nCongress is trying to micromanage local airports. As Governor of \nVirginia, I worked with my now colleague and senior partner, Senator \nWarner, and then-Secretary of Transportation Dole to pass this \nlegislation in 1986 designed to get the Federal Government out of the \nairport management business altogether.\n  The legislation that was enacted shifted control of the Washington \nairports away from the Federal Government and to a regional authority \nso they could effectively and efficiently manage their own airports, \njust like they do in every other State in the Union.\n  Even at that time, though, I was not particularly sanguine about the \nprospect that the Federal Government would not be able to resist the \ntemptation to meddle with our local airports for its own ends. So I was \nnot surprised at the efforts to add flights to National, and it is no \nsecret that, notwithstanding a strong personal friendship that I and my \nsenior colleague have with the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, we sharply disagree on this particular issue. But to block \nairport improvements and hurt this region's consumers in an attempt to \nforce a policy change is simply wrong.\n  The Senate has the power to delay airport improvements at National \nand Dulles, because it must approve nominees to the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority that manage both--both--Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport and Dulles International Airport.\n  Without the nominees, the airports cannot obtain grants under the \nAirport Improvement Program or use the passenger facility charges to \nfund projects.\n  These two programs are the lifeblood of airport funding. So Senate \ninaction on the nominees keeps Dulles and National from making \nimprovements that can truly make a difference to consumers.\n  Proponents of more flights at National argue they are helping \nconsumers. But blocking the nominees blocks major improvements that \nwould also help consumers.\n  These improvements include easier passenger access between the \nterminals and parking, better access among terminals, improved baggage \nhandling, and the renovation of aging facilities.\n  We should resolve the issue of the number of flights and the distance \nof flights at National with open debate and not through coercion.\n  The legislation Senator Warner and I are proposing today severs the \nlink between action on the nominees and action on airport improvements, \nand we urge our colleagues to support this effort.\n  Our proposal retains the Senate's role in approving the nominees. So \nif Members have concerns about airport management, those concerns can \nbe addressed. But it is simply wrong to hold airport improvements \nhostage. It is time to rescue Dulles and National. We shouldn't allow \nthe critical improvements at both airports to remain captive any \nlonger.\n  I am very pleased to join my senior colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague. This \nSenator, and I hope Senator Robb, is prepared to stand on this floor \nuntil this measure passes, no matter what it takes.\n  Mr. ROBB. I can assure my senior colleague, like a stone wall.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Washington \n     Airports Authority Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF LIMITATION.\n\n       Section 49106(c)(6) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking subparagraph (C); and\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (C).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 536. A bill entitled the ``Wendell H. Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act of 1999''; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n wendell h. ford national air transportation system improvement act of \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \nmy strong opposition and serious concerns about safety and service \nimpacts resulting from S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. \nThis legislation has been reported from the Commerce Committee and \nreauthorizes the activities of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  My remarks today will focus on the unwise provisions included in this \nbill which tear apart the Perimeter and High Density rules at Reagan \nNational Airport. These rules have been in effect--either in regulation \nor in statute--for nearly 30 years. Since 1986, these rules have been a \ncritical ingredient in providing for significant capital investments \nand a balance in service among this region's three airports--Dulles \nInternational, Reagan National, and Baltimore-Washington International.\n  First and foremost, I believe these existing rules have greatly \nbenefitted the traveling public--the consumer. The provisions in the \nCommittee bill will severely reduce the level of service that Reagan \nNational now provides and, as a result, consumer convenience in air \ntravel will suffer greatly.\n  The provisions in S. 82 differ dramatically from the provisions \nincluded in the legislation the Senate passed last year by a vote of 92 \nto 1. Of the four slot-controlled airports in the country--Reagan \nNational, O'Hare International in Chicago, and Kennedy and LaGuardia in \nNew York--only Reagan National received a significant increase in take-\noff and landing slots from last year's bill--24 per day to 48 per day.\n  This increase is unjustified and not supported by any evidence that \nit is needed. Today, Reagan National handles approximately 800 take-off \nand landing operations per day, Chicago's O'Hare handles approximately \n2,000 take-off and landing operations per day. Yet, in the Committee-\nreported bill Reagan National would receive another 48 slots while \nO'Hare would receive only another 30 slots per day. This is a \ndisproportionate increase especially when one compares the size and \ndaily operations of the airports. Again, at New York's Kennedy and \nLaGuardia, there are no changes in this year's bill from the provisions \nincluded in the bill passed by the Senate last year.\n  Mr. President, to gain a full understanding of the severe impact that \nthese changes will have on our regional airports, one must examine the \nrecent history of these three airports. Prior to 1986, Dulles and \nReagan National were federally-owned and managed by the FAA. The level \nof service provided at these airports was deplorable. At National, \nconsumers were routinely subject to traffic gridlock, insufficient \nparking, and routine flight cancellations and delays. Dulles was an \nisolated, underutilized airport.\n  For years, the debate raged within the FAA and the surrounding \ncommunities about the future of Reagan National. Should it be improved, \nexpanded or closed? This ongoing uncertainly produced an atmosphere \nwhere no investments were made in National and Dulles and service \ncontinued to deteriorate.\n  A national commission, now known as the Holton Commission, was \ncreated in 1984 and led by former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton and \nformer Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole to resolve these \nlong-standing controversies which plagued both airports. The result was \na recommendation to transfer Federal ownership of the airports so that \nsorely needed capital investments to improve safety and service could \nbe made.\n  I was pleased to have participated in the development of the 1986 \nlegislation to transfer operations of these airports to a regional \nauthority. It was a fair compromise of the many issues which had \nstalled any improvements at both airports over the years. The \nregulatory High Density Rule was placed in the statute so that neither \nthe FAA nor the Authority could change it unilaterally. The previous \npassenger cap was repealed, thereby ending growth controls, in exchange \nfor a freeze on slots. Lastly, the perimeter rule at 1,250 miles was \nestablished.\n\n  For those interested in securing capital investments at both \nairports, the transfer of these airports under a long-term lease \narrangement to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority gave MWAA \nthe power to sell bonds to finance the long-overdue work. The Authority \nhas sold millions of dollars in bonds which has financed the new \nterminal, rehabilitation of the existing terminal, a new control tower \nand parking facilities at Reagan National.\n  These improvements would not have been possible without the 1986 \nTransfer Act which included the High Density Rule, and the Perimeter \nRule. Limitations on operations at National had long been in effect \nthrough FAA regulations, but now were part of the balanced compromise \nin the Transfer Act.\n  For those who feared significant increases in flight activity at \nNational and who for years had prevented any significant investments in \nNational, they were now willing to support major rehabilitation work at \nNational to improve service. They were satisfied that these guarantees \nwould ensure that Reagan National would not become another ``Dulles or \nBWI''. Citizens had received legislative assurances that there would be \nno growth at Reagan National in terms of permitted scheduled flights \nbeyond on the 37-per-hour-limit.\n  These critical decisions in the 1986 Transfer Act were made to fix \nboth the aircraft activity level at Reagan National and to set its role \nas a short/medium haul airport. These compromises served to insulate \nthe airport from its long history of competing efforts to increase and \nto decrease its use.\n  Since the transfer, the Authority has worked to maintain the balance \nin service between Dulles and Reagan National. The limited growth \nprinciple for Reagan National has been executed by the Authority in all \nof its planning assumptions and the Master Plan. While we have all \nwitnessed the transformation of National into a quality airport today, \nthese improvements in terminals, the control tower and parking \nfacilities were all determined to meet the needs of this airport for \nthe foreseeable future based on the continuation of the High Density \nand Perimeter rules. These improvements, however, have purposely not \nincluded an increase in the number of gates for aircraft or airfield \ncapacity.\n  Prior to the 1986 Transfer Act, while National was mired in \ncontroversy and poor service, Dulles was identified as the region's \ngrowth airport. Under FAA rules and the Department of Transportation's \n1981 Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy, it was recognized that \nDulles had the capacity for growth and a suitable environment to \naccommodate this growth. Following enactment of the Transfer Act, \nplans, capital investments and bonding decisions made by the Authority \nall factored in the High Density and Perimeter rules.\n  Mr. President, I provide this history on the issues which stalled \nimprovements at the region's airports in the 1970s and 1980s because it \nis important to understanding how these airports have operated so \neffectively over the past thirteen years.\n  Everyone one of us should ask ourselves if the 1986 Transfer Act has \nmet our expectations. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. Long-\noverdue capital investments have been made in Reagan National and \nDulles. The surrounding communities have been given an important voice \nin the management of these airports. We have seen unprecedented \nstability in the growth of both airports. Most importantly, the \nconsumer has benefitted by enhanced service at Reagan National.\n  For these reasons, I strongly oppose the Committee bill to add 48 \nslots, or another 16,000 flights annually, at Reagan National. There is \nno justification for an increase of this size. It is not recommended by \nthe Administration, by the airline industry, by the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority or by the consumer.\n  Last year, I cautiously supported a modest increase in flights at \nReagan National because I believed it was a fair compromise of the many \ncompeting demands in the airline industry today. While many of my \nconstituents strongly opposed this limited increase in aircraft \nactivity at National, I came to the conclusion that this growth could \nbe accommodated without significantly disrupting consumer services or \nsafety.\n  Mr. President, I deeply regret that the Committee did not include in \nS.82 the provisions from last year's bill which was the result of an \nagreement\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nbetween the Chairman, the Majority Leader and those of us representing \nthis region. I am prepared today to stand behind our agreement and will \ncontinue to work with the Commerce Committee to ensure that they \nunderstand how detrimental this excessive increase in flights will be \nfor our hard-fought regional balance, air traffic safety and consumer \nservice.\n  At a time when the Committee is considering legislation to protect \nair travel consumer rights, why are we considering legislation that \nwill do nothing but severely disrupt consumer services at Reagan \nNational?\n  The capital improvements made at Reagan National since the 1986 \nTransfer Act have not expanded the 44 gates or expanded airfield \ncapacity. All of the improvements that have been made have been on the \nlandside of the airport. No improvements have been made to accommodate \nincrease aircraft capacity. Expanding flights at National to a level \nincluded in the Committee bill will simply ``turn back the clock'' at \nNational to the days of traffic gridlock, overcrowded terminal activity \nand flight delays--all to the detriment of the traveling public.\n  This ill-advised scheme is sure to return Reagan National to an \nairport plagued by delays and inconvenience. This proposal threatens to \noverwhelm the new facilities, just as the previous facilities were \noverwhelmed. However, now it would be worse. Now, we would be facing \nincreased aircraft delays. There would be delays and inconvenience both \non the ground and in the air.\n  Any discussion of operations at Reagan National cannot occur without \na recognition of the impact these increased flights will have on \naircraft noise. One of the principal reasons why many in the Washington \nregion were so wary of improvements at Reagan National, making it more \nattractive for additional flights and increased noise levels, appears \nto be coming true.\n  My colleagues will attempt to persuade you that these new flights, \nbased on noise measurement techniques, will not result in noticeable \nincreases in noise levels. The plain fact is that the increased flights \nincluded in the Committee bill will result in about 16,000 new flights \neach year at Reagan National. Do any of us believe that 16,000 new \nflights will not result in a ``noticeable'' increase in noise.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the recommendations of the \nCommerce Committee to add another 48 slots at Reagan National. This is \nan unjustified increase that has not been thoroughly examined by the \nFAA. I believe it has the very real possibility of jeopardizing the \nsignificant improvements made at Reagan National in the past 10 years \nand will return the airport to the days of poor service, delays and \novercrowding.\n  The current temporary extension of FAA activities and AIP funding \nexpires at the end of this month. I readily recognize that the Congress \nmust move forward with a full reauthorization proposal. Due to the \npress of time, it is regrettable that the Committee has decided to make \nsuch a significant change from last year's bill. This new approach does \nnot aid our efforts to enact a full FAA reauthorization bill for our \ncommunities.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing today the FAA legislation passed \nby the Senate last September by a vote of 92 to 1. It provides for a \nmodest increase in flights at Reagan National both inside and beyond \nthe 1,250-mile perimeter.\n  Mr. President, I also intend to exercise all of my rights and engage \nin an extensive debate on these important issues.\n  Mr. President, this bill is exactly the bill passed by the U.S. \nSenate last year with a vote of 91 Senators to 1 no vote.\n  Mr. President, this is the bill which said that there shall be 24 \nslots in the judgment of the Senate. It was to go to the House, which \nit did. The House and the Senate could not reconcile their differences. \nI worked very carefully with Senator McCain. I want to make it clear we \nhad an understanding that I would support this bill of 24 even though I \nfelt the slots were too many.\n  I had every reason to believe that in the negotiations with the \nHouse, the number of slots would come down below 24--usually the House \nand Senate split their differences--to, say 12, which although I still \nwould not like to see 12 additional slots, for safety and other \nreasons, 90 other Senators felt there should be additional slots.\n  So recognizing the preponderance of the Senate wanted additional \nslots, I was willing to accept. Senator McCain did not break his deal \nwith me because the House would not accept any. So now he will soon be \nback here on the floor, presumably with another bill for 48 slots. I \nthink that is too high. My bill hopefully will be put on as an \namendment, as a substitute, in the course of that deliberation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TOURISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) through an effective public-private partnership, \n     Federal, State, and local governments and the travel and \n     tourism industry can successfully market the United States as \n     the premiere international tourist destination in the world;\n       (2) in 1997, the travel and tourism industry made a \n     substantial contribution to the health of the Nation's \n     economy, as follows:\n       (A) The industry is one of the Nation's largest employers, \n     directly employing 7,000,000 Americans, throughout every \n     region of the country, heavily concentrated among small \n     businesses, and indirectly employing an additional 9,200,000 \n     Americans, for a total of 16,200,000 jobs.\n       (B) The industry ranks as the first, second, or third \n     largest employer in 32 States and the District of Columbia, \n     generating a total tourism-related annual payroll of \n     $127,900,000,000.\n       (C) The industry has become the Nation's third-largest \n     retail sales industry, generating a total of $489,000,000,000 \n     in total expenditures.\n       (D) The industry generated $71,700,000,000 in tax revenues \n     for Federal, State, and local governments;\n       (3) the more than $98,000,000,000 spent by foreign visitors \n     in the United States in 1997 generated a trade services \n     surplus of more than $26,000,000,000;\n       (4) the private sector, States, and cities currently spend \n     more than $1,000,000,000 annually to promote particular \n     destinations within the United States to international \n     visitors;\n       (5) because other nations are spending hundreds of millions \n     of dollars annually to promote the visits of international \n     tourists to their countries, the United States will miss a \n     major marketing opportunity if it fails to aggressively \n     compete for an increased share of international tourism \n     expenditures as they continue to increase over the next \n     decade;\n       (6) a well-funded, well-coordinated international marketing \n     effort--combined with additional public and private sector \n     efforts--would help small and large businesses, as well as \n     State and local governments, share in the anticipated \n     phenomenal growth of the international travel and tourism \n     market in the 21st century;\n       (7) by making permanent the successful visa waiver pilot \n     program, Congress can facilitate the increased flow of \n     international visitors to the United States;\n       (8) Congress can increase the opportunities for attracting \n     international visitors and enhancing their stay in the United \n     States by--\n       (A) improving international signage at airports, seaports, \n     land border crossings, highways, and bus, train, and other \n     public transit stations in the United States;\n       (B) increasing the availability of multilingual tourist \n     information; and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourists coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives and an international \n     marketing program to enable the United States travel and\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\n     tourism industry and every level of government to benefit \n     from a successful effort to make the United States the \n     premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information; and\n       (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, private-\n     sector operated, telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n     operators, to provide assistance to international tourists \n     coping with an emergency.\n       (3) Membership.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n     following members:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of State.\n       (C) The Secretary of Transportation.\n       (D) The Chair of the Board of Directors of the United \n     States National Tourism Organization.\n       (E) Such other representatives of other Federal agencies \n     and private-sector entities as may be determined to be \n     appropriate to the mission of the Task Force by the Chairman.\n       (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman \n     of the Task Force. The Task Force shall meet at least twice \n     each year. Each member of the Task Force shall furnish \n     necessary assistance to the Task Force.\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Task Force shall \n     submit to the President and to Congress a report on the \n     results of the review, including proposed amendments to \n     existing laws or regulations as may be appropriate to \n     implement such recommendations.\n       (d) Travel and Tourism Industry Satellite System of \n     Accounting.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce shall complete, \n     as soon as may be practicable, a satellite system of \n     accounting for the travel and tourism industry.\n       (2) Funding.--To the extent any costs or expenditures are \n     incurred under this subsection, they shall be covered to the \n     extent funds are available to the Department of Commerce for \n     such purpose.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) Authorization.--Subject to paragraph (2), there are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary \n     for the purpose of funding international promotional \n     activities by the United States National Tourism Organization \n     to help brand, position, and promote the United States as the \n     premiere travel and tourism destination in the world.\n       (2) Restrictions on use of funds.--None of the funds \n     appropriated under paragraph (1) may be used for purposes \n     other than marketing, research, outreach, or any other \n     activity designed to promote the United States as the \n     premiere travel and tourism destination in the world, except \n     that the general and administrative expenses of operating the \n     United States National Tourism Organization shall be borne by \n     the private sector through such means as the Board of \n     Directors of the Organization shall determine.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than March 30 of each \n     year in which funds are made available under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate a detailed report \n     setting forth--\n       (A) the manner in which appropriated funds were expended;\n       (B) changes in the United States market share of \n     international tourism in general and as measured against \n     specific countries and regions;\n       (C) an analysis of the impact of international tourism on \n     the United States economy, including, as specifically as \n     practicable, an analysis of the impact of expenditures made \n     pursuant to this section;\n       (D) an analysis of the impact of international tourism on \n     the United States trade balance and, as specifically as \n     practicable, an analysis of the impact on the trade balance \n     of expenditures made pursuant to this section; and\n       (E) an analysis of other relevant economic impacts as a \n     result of expenditures made pursuant to this section.\n\n     SEC. 523.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust \nthe exemption amounts used to calculate the individual alternative \nminimum tax for inflation since 1993; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Indexation of Alternative Minimum Tax Exemptions\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to address \nwhat has become an increasingly heavy burden for middle-income \ntaxpayers: the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. My bill would \nretroactively index to inflation the exemptions used to calculate an \nindividual taxpayer's AMT liability. The indexation would begin in \n1993--the last time these exemptions were raised. The AMT is \nconspicuous for its lack of indexation. Under the regular income tax, \nthe tax rate structure, the standard deductions, the personal \nexemptions, and certain other structural components are indexed so that \ntaxpayers are not pushed into higher income tax brackets just because \ntheir income has kept pace with the cost of living.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that in 1997, 605,000 taxpayers \nwere subject to the AMT. According to these same estimates, which take \ninto account the changes in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, taxpayers \nsubject to the AMT could total 12 million by 2007. This is an increase \nof more than 1,800 percent in the number of taxpayers paying this \nparticular tax. According to the Joint Tax Committee, this dramatic \nexpansion of the AMT's reach can largely be attributed to the lack of \nindexation of the AMT exemptions.\n  The AMT was created in 1969 after a Treasury Department study \nrevealed that 155 individuals who had annual incomes in excess of \n$200,000 had avoided paying taxes because of loopholes in the tax code. \nWe can all agree that upper-income individuals should pay their fair \nshare of taxes. The AMT was created effectively to be a tax on the use \nof incentives and preferences to reduce an individual's income tax \nliability. However, since its implementation, the AMT has inadvertently \ncreated larger tax burdens for the middle-class, who were never meant \nto be subject to the AMT.\n  Of the more than two million taxpayers who this year will be subject \nto the AMT, about half will have incomes between $30,000 and $100,000. \nSome are single working parents; and some are people who make as little \nas $527 a week, according to a recent article by David Cay Johnston in \nthe January 10, 1999 New York Times. Mr. President, I will submit this \narticle for the Record. Overall, the number of people affected by this \ntax is expected to grow 26 percent a year for the next decade.\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 accelerated the growth of the AMT. \nUnder this law, even more middle-income families may be subject to the \nAMT because they cannot take the full value of their child and \neducation tax credits without reaching the AMT limits for deductions.\n  Even if Congress were to exempt the child and education tax credits \nfrom the AMT calculation, it would only slow the spread of the AMT \nslightly if the tax is not indexed for inflation, according to a study \nby two Treasury Department economists, Robert Rebelein and Jerry \nTempalski. I will also submit their study for the Record.\n  I believe that indexing the AMT exemptions is the best way to \nrestrain the unintended reach of the AMT. The AMT exemptions have only \nbeen raised once, in 1993, by 12.5 percent, from $40,000 to $45,000. \nSince 1986, when the tax code was last overhauled, the cost of living \nhas risen 43 percent. Indexing would bring the AMT into line with the \nrest of our tax structure. It would also avoid adding any complexity to \nthe already burdensome task of taxpaying Americans.\n  Let me give you a real life example of how the AMT has crept up on \nmiddle-income taxpayers. The New York Times article provided a stark \npicture of the AMT. David and Margaret Klaassen of Marquette, Kansas, \nare a couple with 13 children. Mr. Klaassen works at home as a lawyer. \nIn 1997, Mr. Klaassen earned $89,751 and paid $5,989 in Federal income \ntax. The IRS sent the Klaassens a notice in December 1998 demanding an \nadditional payment of $3,761 under the AMT, including a penalty. The \nKlaassens' tax bill was higher because the AMT, a tax mechanism aimed \nat wealthy individuals who would otherwise pay no taxes, applied to \nthem.\n  The Klaassens are subject to the AMT because medical expenses for \ntheir 13 children, which include costs of battling their son's \nleukemia, resulted in exemptions and deductions totaling more than \n$45,000. Certainly the Congress did not intend for the AMT to create an \nextra burden for families like the Klaassens.\n  Mr. President, there is agreement from both the Administration and \nCongress that the AMT is a growing problem for the middle class and \nthat something must be done. In this new era of budget surpluses, the \ntime has come for us to act to restore some measure of fairness and \nsimplicity to our income tax code. This is why I advocate indexing the \nAMT, an approach that is supported by both the Tax Foundation and \nCitizens for Tax Justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill to index the AMT \nexemptions for inflation as well as additional material be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL AMT EXEMPTION \n                   AMOUNTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 55(d) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to exemption amount) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Inflation adjustment.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of any taxable year \n     beginning after 1998, each of the dollar amounts contained in \n     paragraphs (1) and (3) shall be increased by an amount equal \n     to--\n       ``(i) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year.\n       ``(B) Rounding.--If any increase determined under \n     subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $50, such increase \n     shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 10, 1999]\n\n                  Funny, They Don't Look Like Fat Cats\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Three decades ago, Congress, embarrassed by the disclosure \n     that 155 wealthy Americans had paid no Federal income taxes, \n     enacted legislation aimed at preventing the very rich from \n     shielding their wealth in tax shelters.\n       Today, that legislation, creating the alternative minimum \n     tax, is instead snaring a rapidly growing number of middle-\n     class taxpayers, forcing them to pay additional tax or to \n     lose some of their tax breaks.\n       Of the more than two million taxpayers who will be subject \n     this year to the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., about \n     half have incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. Some are single \n     parents with jobs; some are people making as little as $527 a \n     week. Over all, the number of people affected by the tax is \n     expected to grow 26 percent a year for the next decade.\n       But many of the wealthy will not be among them. Even with \n     the A.M.T., the number of taxpayers making more than $200,000 \n     who pay no taxes has risen to more than 2,000 each year.\n       How a 1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing \n     burden on moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in \n     Washington can be a hall of mirrors.\n       While some Republican Congressmen favor eliminating the \n     tax, other lawmakers say such a move would be an expensive \n     tax break for the wealthy--or at least would be perceived \n     that way, and thus would be politically unpalatable. And any \n     overhaul of the system would need to compensate for the $6.6 \n     billion that individuals now pay under the A.M.T. This year, \n     such payments will account for almost 1 percent of all \n     individual income tax revenue.\n       ``This is a classic case of both Congress and the \n     Administration agreeing that the tax doesn't make much sense, \n     but not being able to agree on doing anything about it,'' \n     said C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban \n     Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.\n       Mr. Steuerle was a Treasury Department tax official in \n     1986, when an overhaul of the tax code set the stage for \n     drawing the middle class into the A.M.T.\n       In eliminating most tax shelters for the wealthy, Congress \n     decided to treat exemptions for children and deductions for \n     medical expenses just like special credits for investors in \n     oil wells, if they cut too deeply into a household's taxable \n     income.\n       Congress decided that once these ``tax preferences'' \n     exceeded certain amounts--$40,000 for a married couple, for \n     example--people would be moved out of the regular income tax \n     and into the alternative minimum tax. At the time, the \n     threshold was high enough to affect virtually no one but the \n     rich. But it has since been raised only once--by 12.5 \n     percent, to $45,000 for a married couple--while the cost of \n     living has risen 43 percent. And so the limits have sneaked \n     up on growing numbers of taxpayers of more modest means.\n       ``Everyone knew back then that it had problems that had to \n     be fixed,'' Mr. Steuerle recalled. ``They just said, `next \n     year.' ''\n       But ``next year'' has never come--and it is unlikely to \n     arrive in 1999, either. While tax policy experts have known \n     for years that the middle class would be drawn into the \n     A.M.T., few taxpayers have been clamoring for change.\n       Among those few, however, are David and Margaret Klaassen \n     of Marquette, Kan. Mr. Klaassen, a lawyer who lives in and \n     works out of a farmhouse, made $89,751.07 in 1997 and paid \n     $5,989 in Federal income taxes. Four weeks ago, the Internal \n     Revenue Service sent the Klaassens a notice demanding $3,761 \n     more under the alternative minimum tax, including a penalty \n     because the I.R.S. said the Klaassens knew they owed the \n     A.M.T.\n       Mr. Klaassen acknowledges that he knew the I.R.S. would \n     assert that he was subject to the A.M.T., but he says the law \n     was not meant to apply to his family. ``I've never invested \n     in a tax shelter,'' he said. ``I don't even have municipal \n     bonds.''\n       The Klaassens do, however, have 13 children and their \n     attendant medical expenses--including the costs of caring for \n     their second son, Aaron, 17, who has battled leukemia for \n     years. It was those exemptions and deductions that subjected \n     them to the A.M.T.\n       ``What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save \n     your child's life?'' Mr. Klaassen asked.\n       The tax affects taxpayers in three ways. Some, like the \n     Klaassens, pay the tax at either a 26 percent or a 28 percent \n     rate because they have more than $45,000 in exemptions and \n     deductions. Others do not pay the A.M.T. itself, but they \n     cannot take the full tax breaks they would have received \n     under the regular income tax system without running up \n     against limits set by the A.M.T. The A.M.T. can also convert \n     tax-exempt income from certain bonds and from exercising \n     incentive stock options into taxable income.\n       It may be useful to think of the alternative minimum tax as \n     a parallel universe to the regular income tax system, similar \n     in some ways but more complex and with its own \n     classifications of deductions, its own rates and its own \n     paperwork. The idea was that taxpayers who had escaped the \n     regular tax universe by piling on credits and deductions \n     would enter this new universe to pay their fair share. \n     (Likewise, there is a corporate A.M.T. that parallels the \n     corporate income tax.)\n       At first, the burden of the A.M.T. fell mainly on the \n     shoulders of business owners and investors, said Robert S. \n     McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a \n     nonprofit group in Washington that says the tax system favors \n     the rich. Based on I.R.S. data, Mr. McIntyre said he found \n     that 37 percent of A.M.T. revenue in 1990 was a result of \n     business owners using losses from previous years to reduce \n     their regular income taxes; an additional 18 percent was \n     because of big deductions for state and local taxes.\n       But that has begun to shift, largely as a result of the \n     1986 changes, which eliminated most tax shelters and lowered \n     tax rates.\n       When President Reagan and Congress were overhauling the tax \n     code, they could not make the projected revene under the new\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\n     rules equal those under the old system. Huge, and growing, \n     budget deficits made it politically essential for the \n     official estimates to show that after tax reform, the same \n     amount of money would flow to Washington.\n       One solution, said Mr. Steuerle, the former Treasury \n     official, was to count personal and dependent exemptions and \n     some medical expenses as preferences to be reduced or ignored \n     under the A.M.T. just as special credits for petroleum \n     investments and other tax shelters are.\n       Mortgage interest and charitable gifts were not counted as \n     preferences, according to tax policy experts who worked on \n     the legislation, because they generated more money than was \n     needed.\n       But the A.M.T. has not stayed ``revenue neutral,'' in \n     Washington parlance.\n       The regular income tax was indexed for inflation in 1984, \n     so that taxpayers would not get pushed into higher tax \n     brackets simply because their income kept pace with the cost \n     of living.\n       The A.M.T. limits, however, have not been indexed. The \n     total allowable exemptions before the tax kicks in have been \n     fixed since 1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing \n     jointly. For unmarried people, the total amount is now \n     $33,750, and for married people filing separately, it is \n     $22,500.\n       If the limit has been indexed since 1986, when the A.M.T. \n     was overhauled, it would be about $57,000 for married couples \n     filing jointly--and most middle-income households would still \n     be exempt.\n       Mr. Steuerle said he warned at the time that including \n     ``normal, routine deductions and exemptions that everyone \n     takes'' in the list of preferences would eventually turn the \n     A.M.T. into a tax on the middle class.\n       That appears to be exactly what has happened.\n       For example, a married person who makes just $527 a week \n     and files her tax return separately can be subject to the \n     tax, said David S. Hulse, an assistant professor of \n     accounting at the University of Kentucky.\n       And the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which allows a $500-a-\n     child tax credit as well as education credits, may make even \n     more middle-class families subject to the A.M.T. by reducing \n     the value of those credits.\n       Two Treasury Department economists recently calculated that \n     largely because of the new credits, the number of households \n     making $30,000 to $50,000 who must pay the alternative \n     minimum tax will more than triple in the coming decade. The \n     economists, Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski, also \n     calculated that for households making $15,000 to $30,000 \n     annually, A.M.T. payments will grow 25-fold, to $1.2 billion, \n     by 2008.\n       Last year, many more people would have been subject to the \n     A.M.T. if Congress had not made a last-minute fix pushed by \n     Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, \n     that--for 1998 only--exempted the new child and education \n     credits. The move came after I.R.S. officials told Congress \n     that the credits added enormous complexity to calculating tax \n     liability. Figuring out how much the A.M.T. would reduce the \n     credits was beyond the capacity of most taxpayers and even \n     many paid tax preparers, the I.R.S. officials said.\n       Even if Congress makes a permanent fix to the problems \n     created by the child and education credits, it will put only \n     a minor drag on the spread of the A.M.T. as long as the tax \n     is not indexed for inflation. The two Treasury economists \n     calculated that revenue from the tax would climb to $25 \n     billion in 2008 without a fix, or to $21.9 billion with one.\n       In 1999, if there is no exemption for the credits, a single \n     parent who does not itemize deductions but who makes $50,000 \n     and takes a credit for the costs of caring for two children \n     while he works, will be subject to the A.M.T. estimated \n     Jeffrey Pretsfelder, an editor at RIA Group, a publisher of \n     tax information for professionals.\n       If the tax laws are not changed, 8.8 million taxpayers will \n     have to pay the A.M.T. a decade from now, the Congressional \n     Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last month. Add in the \n     taxpayers who will not receive the full value of their \n     deductions because they run up against the limits set by the \n     A.M.T., and the total grows to 11.6 million taxpayers--92 \n     percent of whom have incomes of less than $200,000, the two \n     Treasury economists estimated.\n       While many lawmakers and Treasury officials have criticized \n     the impact of the tax on middle-class taxpayers, there are \n     few signs of change, as Republicans and the Administration \n     talk past each other.\n       Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as the \n     chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is the chief \n     tax writer, said the A.M.T. should be eliminated in the next \n     budget.\n       ``Unfortunately, the A.M.T. tax can penalize large \n     families, which is part of the reason why Republicans for \n     years have tried to eliminate it or at least reduce it,'' Mr. \n     Archer said. ``Unfortunately, President Clinton blocked our \n     efforts each time.''\n       Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said \n     the Administration was ``very concerned that the A.M.T. has a \n     growing impact on middle-class families, including by \n     diluting the child credit, education credits and other \n     crucial tax benefits, and we hope to address this issue in \n     the President's budget.\n       ``Subject to budget constraints, we look forward to working \n     with Congress on this important issue,'' he continued.\n       That revenue concerns have thwarted exempting the middle \n     class runs counter to the reason Congress initially imposed \n     the tax.\n       ``You need an A.M.T. because people who make a lot of money \n     should pay some income taxes,'' said Mr. McIntyre, of \n     Citizens for Tax Justice. ``If you believe, like Mr. Archer \n     and a lot of Republicans do, that the more you make the less \n     in taxes you should pay, then of course you are against the \n     A.M.T. But somehow I don't think most people see it that \n     way.''\n       The Klaassens, meanwhile, are challenging the A.M.T. in \n     Federal Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the \n     10th Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments in March on their \n     claim that the tax infringes their religious freedom. The \n     Klaassens, who are Presbyterians, say they believe children \n     ``are a blessing from God, and so we do not practice birth \n     control,'' Mr. Klaassen said.\n       When Mr. Klaassen wrote to an I.R.S. official complaining \n     that a $1,085 bill for the A.M.T. for 1994 resulted from the \n     size of his family, he got back a curt letter saying that his \n     ``analysis of the alternative minimum tax's effect on large \n     families was interesting but inappropriate'' and advising him \n     that it was medical deductions, not family size, that \n     subjected him to the A.M.T.\n       Under the regular tax system, medical expenses above 7.5 \n     percent of adjusted gross income--the last line on the front \n     page of Form 1040--are deductible. Under the A.M.T., the \n     threshold is raised to 10 percent.\n       Still doubting the I.R.S.'s math, Mr. Klaassen decided to \n     test what would have happened had he filed the same tax \n     return, changing only the number of children he claimed as \n     dependents. He found that if he had seven or fewer children, \n     the A.M.T. would not have applied in 1994.\n       But the eighth child set off the A.M.T., at a cost of $223. \n     Having nine children raised the bill to $717. And 10 \n     children, the number he had in 1994, increased that sum to \n     $1,085--the amount the I.R.S. said was due.\n       ``We love this country and we believe in paying taxes,'' \n     Mr. Klaassen said. ``But we cannot believe that Congress ever \n     intended to apply this tax to our family solely because of \n     how many children we choose to have. And I have shown that we \n     are subject to the A.M.T solely because we have chosen not to \n     limit the size of our family.''\n       The I.R.S., in papers opposing the Klaassens, noted that \n     tax deductions are not a right but a matter of ``legislative \n     grace.''\n       Mr. Klaassen turned to the Federal courts after losing in \n     Tax Court. The opinion by Tax Court Judge Robert N. Armen, \n     Jr. was summed up this way by Tax Notes, a magazine that \n     critiques tax policy: ``Congress intended the alternative \n     minimum tax to affect large families when it made personal \n     exemptions a preference item.''\n       Several tax experts said that Mr. Klaassen had little \n     chance of success in the courts because the statute treating \n     children as tax preferences was clear. They also said that \n     nothing in the A.M.T. laws was specifically aimed at his \n     religious beliefs.\n       Meanwhile, for people who make $200,000 or more, the A.M.T. \n     will be less of a burden this year because of the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act of 1997, which included a provision lowering the \n     maximum tax rate on capital gains for both the regular tax \n     and the A.M.T. to 20 percent.\n       Mr. Rebelein and Mr. Tempalski, the Treasury Department \n     economists, calculated recently that people making more than \n     $200,000 would pay a total of 4 percent less in A.M.T. for \n     1998 because of the 1997 law. By 2008, their savings will be \n     9 percent, largely as a result of lower capital gains rates \n     and changed accounting rules for business owners.\n       ``This law was passed to catch people who use tax shelters \n     to avoid their obligations,'' Mr. Klaassen said. ``But \n     instead of catching them it hits people like me. This is just \n     nuts.''\n\n\n                three ways to deal with a taxing problem\n\n       President Clinton, his tax policy advisers and the \n     Republicans who control the tax writing committees in \n     Congress all agree that the alternative minimum tax is a \n     growing problem for the middle class. But there is no \n     agreement on what to do. Here are some options that have been \n     discussed:\n       Raise the exemption--Representative Bill Archer, the Texas \n     Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee, two years ago proposed raising the $45,000 A.M.T. \n     exemption for a married couple by $1,000. But that would \n     leave many middle-class families subject to the tax, because \n     it would not fully account for inflation. To do that would \n     require an exemption of about $57,000, followed by automatic \n     inflation adjustments. That is the most widely favored \n     approach, drawing support from people like J.D. Foster, \n     executive director of the Tax Foundation, a group supported \n     by corporations, and Robert S. McIntyre, executive director \n     of Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed in part by \n     unions and contends that the tax system favors the rich.\n       Exempt child and education credits--For 1998 only, Congress \n     exempted the child tax credit and the education tax credits \n     from the A.M.T. But millions of taxpayers will lose these \n     credits, or get only part of them, unless Congress makes a \n     fix each year or permanently exempts them.\n       Eliminate it--Mr. Archer and other Republicans want to get \n     rid of the A.M.T. but have not proposed how to make up for \n     the lost revenue, which in a decade is expected to grow to \n     $25 billion annually. Recently, however, Mr. Archer has said \n     that in a period of\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n     Federal budget surpluses, it may be time to scrap the budget \n     rules that require paying for tax cuts with reduced spending \n     or tax increases elsewhere.\n\n                    [From Tax Notes, Aug. 10, 1998]\n\n                Effect of TRA '97 on the Individual AMT\n\n                (By Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski)\n\n       Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski are financial \n     economists in the Office of Tax Analysis at the Treasury \n     Department.\n       The authors believe that even without enactment of TRA '97, \n     the estimated number of individual AMT taxpayers would have \n     increased from 0.9 million in 1997 to 8.5 million in 2008 (a \n     23 percent annual growth rate). Primarily because of the new \n     child and education credits, TRA '97 increases the number of \n     AMT taxpayers in 2008 to 11.6 million, or 11 percent of all \n     individual taxpayers. They project that TRA '97 increases the \n     estimated amount of tax paid because of the individual AMT \n     from $20.8 billion in 2008 to $25 billion.\n       The authors are grateful to Bob Carroll, Jim Cilke, Lowell \n     Dworin, Joel Platt, and Karl Scholz for their comments. The \n     views expressed in this report are those of the authors and \n     do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Treasury \n     Department.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       Even before the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA '97) was \n     enacted in August 1997, the individual alternative minimum \n     tax (AMT) had begun to receive considerable attention.\\1\\ The \n     reason for this attention was the increasing awareness that \n     both the number of tax-payers \\2\\ affected by the AMT and the \n     AMT taxes they pay would increase significantly over the next \n     10 years. Without TRA '97 the number of taxpayers affected by \n     the AMT would have grown from 0.9 million in 1997 to 8.5 \n     million in 2008 (an annual growth rate of 23 percent); tax \n     liability from the AMT would have grown from $5.0 billion in \n     1997 to $20.8 billion in 2008 (an annual growth rate of 14 \n     percent).\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Since passage of TRA '97, the individual AMT has received \n     even more attention.\\4\\ The primary reason is that TRA '97 \n     includes provisions that have a major effect on the \n     individual AMT. Although some of these provisions reduce the \n     effect of the AMT on taxpayers, the overall effect of TRA '97 \n     is to increase significantly both the number of AMT taxpayers \n     and the taxes they pay because of the AMT.\n       TRA '97 reduces overall tax liability by $27.0 billion in \n     2008 for individual taxpayers. The benefits of TRA '97 would \n     be even greater if not the AMT. TRA '97 increases AMT \n     liability by $4.2 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, taxpayers \n     whose AMT liability is affected by TRA '97 see their overall \n     tax liability fall by $4.5 billion in 2008.\n       The first section of this report discusses how the \n     individual AMT works and why the effect of the AMT increases \n     so sharply over the next 10 years. The second section begins \n     by examining the overall effects of TRA '97 on the AMT and \n     follows with a detailed, provision-by-provision examination \n     of the effects of TRA '97 on the AMT.\n\n\n                       i. alternative minimum tax\n\n       The individual AMT is like a parallel income tax to the \n     regular individual tax. The AMT is structured similarly to \n     the regular tax, but the AMT uses a generally broader tax \n     base, lower tax rates, higher exemption, and fewer \n     allowable tax credits.\n       The AMT was generally intended to apply only to the \n     relatively few high-income taxpayers who Congress believed \n     overused certain tax deductions, exclusions, or credits and \n     consequently were not paying their fair share of taxes. The \n     AMT, however, increasingly affects many taxpayers not \n     traditionally viewed as taking aggressive tax positions or \n     abusing the system. In addition, the AMT can also \n     significantly complicate filing a tax return for millions of \n     taxpayers, particularly those with personal tax credits, who \n     often are supposed to make tedious calculations only to \n     determine they have no AMT liability.\n       The primary reason for the increase in the number of AMT \n     taxpayers is that, unlike regular income tax parameters, AMT \n     parameters (primarily the AMT exemption) are not indexed for \n     inflation.\\5\\ As nominal income rises each year, partially as \n     a result of inflation, more taxpayers become subject to the \n     AMT. In addition, the lack of AMT indexing exposes other \n     anomalies that also may not have been intended.\\6\\ For \n     example, the AMT does not allow deductions for personal \n     exemptions or state and local taxes paid. As a result, \n     taxpayers with large families are more likely to be affected \n     by the AMT than taxpayers with small families, and taxpayers \n     living in high-tax states are more likely to be affected by \n     the AMT than taxpayers living in low-tax states.\n     A. Structure of the AMT\n       A taxpayer's AMT liability is the difference between a \n     taxpayer's regular income tax liability (before any \n     interaction with the AMT) and the taxpayer's tentative AMT \n     (TAMT). TAMT is calculated using AMT income (AMTI), the AMT \n     exemption, AMT tax rates, and allowable AMT credits.\\7\\\n       AMT is the sum of taxable income under the regular tax (as \n     calculated on Form 1040) plus the many AMT preferences.\\8\\ \n     AMT preferences are items excluded from taxable income under \n     the regular tax but included in AMTI. There were 28 AMT \n     preferences in 1995, with 4 items accounting for 86 percent \n     (in dollar terms) of total AMT preferences: state and local \n     tax deductions accounted for 46 percent, miscellaneous \n     deductions above the 2-percent floor for 19 percent, \n     personal exemptions for 13 percent, and post-1986 \n     depreciation for 8 percent. With the possible exception of \n     the last item, these are not tax-shelter type preferences.\n       The AMT exemption is $45,000 for joint returns ($33,750 for \n     singles and heads-of-household (HH)); the exemption is not \n     adjusted for inflation nor is it based on the number of \n     dependents. The exemption is phased out at the rate of $0.25 \n     per $1 of AMTI above $150,000 for joint returns ($112,500 for \n     singles and HH). The AMT tax rate is 26 percent on the first \n     $175,000 of AMTI above the AMT exemption and 28 percent on \n     AMTI more than $175,000 above the exemption.\\9\\\n       The AMT affects taxpayers primarily in two ways.\\10\\ First, \n     a taxpayer can be directly subject to the AMT by having AMT \n     liability as calculated on the AMT form (Form 6251). The \n     difference between a taxpayer's regular tax liability (before \n     other taxes and credits, except the foreign tax credit) and \n     his TAMT is the taxpayer's AMT liability from Form 6251.\n       Second, a taxpayer can be indirectly subject to the AMT by \n     having the amount of usable tax credits reduced by the AMT. \n     The AMT can limit the ability of a taxpayer to use tax \n     credits, because the AMT disallows the use of most credits in \n     calculating TAMT. Put differently, most tax credits cannot be \n     used in calculating a taxpayer's regular tax liability if \n     they would push the taxpayer's regular tax liability below \n     his TAMT. The effect of credits ``lost'' because of this AMT \n     restriction is reflected on the credit forms themselves, \n     rather than on Form 6251.\\11\\ For example, if a taxpayer has \n     regular tax liability (before tax credits) of $1,000, $200 in \n     education credits, and $600 in TAMT, the taxpayer has a total \n     tax liability of $800 ($1,000 less $200), with no AMT \n     liability. If, instead, the taxpayer had a TAMT of $1,050, \n     the taxpayer would have a total tax liability of $1,050. This \n     taxpayer's AMT liability would be $250, $50 that would be \n     reported on the Form 6251 ($1,050 less $1,000) and $200 \n     ($1,000 less $800) that would be reported on the education \n     credit form as reduced allowable credits.\n\n\n                    ii. taxpayer relief act of 1997\n\n       TRA '97 contains six provisions that can significantly \n     affect the individual AMT: \\12\\ Child credit; HOPE education \n     credit; lifetime Learning credit; conformation of AMT \n     depreciation lives with regular tax lives; kiddie tax \n     simplification; and capital gains rate cut.\n       Three of these provisions generally increase the effect of \n     the AMT on taxpayers--the child credit, the HOPE education \n     credit, and the Lifetime Learning education credit. Two \n     provisions generally reduce the effect of the AMT on \n     taxpayers--conform AMT depreciation lives to regular tax \n     depreciation lives, and raise the minimum AMT exemption for \n     kiddie-tax tax payers and uncouple their AMT exemption from \n     their parents' AMT exemption.\\13\\ The capital gains rate cut \n     reduces AMT liability for some taxpayers but increases AMT \n     liability for others.\n     A. Overall effect\n       Relative to pre-TRA '97 law, TRA '97 increases the number \n     of taxpayers on the AMT by between 37 and 58 percent each \n     year from 1998 to 2008. (See Table 1.) This percentage is \n     generally lower at the end of the period when the number of \n     AMT taxpayers under pre-TRA '97 law is already relatively \n     high; TRA '97 increases the number of AMT taxpayers by 58 \n     percent (0.7 million) in 1999, but only by 37 percent (3.2 \n     million) in 2008.\n       Although TRA '97 increases the overall number of AMT \n     taxpayers, it does eliminate the effect of the AMT on some \n     taxpayers. TRA '97 removes about 15 percent of the taxpayers \n     with AMT liability under pre-TRA '97 law from the AMT (0.2 \n     million in 1999, 0.3 million in 2002, and 0.9 million in \n     2008). The majority of taxpayers removed from the AMT by TRA \n     '97 have AGIs of less than $15,000.\n       Under pre-TRA '97 law the number of AMT taxpayers, as a \n     percentage of total taxpayers, grows from 1 percent in 1997, \n     to 2 percent in 2002, and to 8 percent in 2008, Under post-\n     TRA '97 law this percentage grows to 3 percent in 2002 and to \n     11 percent in 2008.\\14\\\n       TRA '97 significantly increases the percentage of AMT \n     taxpayers with AGIs between $15,000 and $100,000 of AGI (in \n     1999 dollars). (See Tables 2 and 3.) In 1999 taxpayers in \n     this income range account for 32 percent of all AMT \n     taxpayers under pre-TRA '97 law and 57 percent under post-\n     TRA '97 law; in 2008 the pre-TRA '97 percentage is 45 \n     percent and the post-TRA '97 percentage is 65 percent. The \n     percentage of taxpayers in this income range who are \n     subject to the AMT in 2008 is 5 percent under pre-TRA '97 \n     law, but 10 percent under post-TRA '97 law. Taxpayers in \n     this income range are the primary beneficiaries of the \n     child and education credits, so it is not surprising that \n     they feel the pinch of the AMT most.\n       For taxpayers in the other income groups, TRA '97 sometimes \n     reduces the effect of the AMT. Taxpayers with less than \n     $15,000 in real AGI are the primary beneficiaries of the \n     kiddie-tax provision and account for a significant amount of \n     the benefits from the depreciation provision. Most taxpayers \n     with real AGIs above $100,000 are ineligible for the new \n     credits, and many benefit from the depreciation provision.\n       From 1998 to 2008, TRA '97 increases AMT liability by \n     between 5 percent and 20 percent each year relative to pre-\n     TRA '97 law. (See\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\n     Table 4.) AMT liability increases by $0.5 billion in 1998, by \n     $0.5 billion in 2002, and by $4.2 billion in 2008. The effect \n     of TRA '97 on AMT liability is smallest in 2000 and 2001, \n     when relatively few child and education credits are lost \n     because of the AMT and when the effect of the depreciation \n     provision is relatively large. In 2008, the effect of the TRA \n     '97 law on AMT liability is largest because the amount of TRA \n     '97 credits lost is relatively large.\n       TRA '97 significantly changes the distribution of AMT \n     liability between lost credits (i.e., tax credits unusable \n     because of the AMT) and liability from the AMT form. (See \n     Table 4.) Under pre-TRA '97 law roughly three times as many \n     taxpayers have AMT liability from the AMT form than have lost \n     credits. Under post-TRA '97 law the number of taxpayers with \n     lost credits is actually greater (by roughly 20 percent) than \n     the number with AMT liability from the AMT form.\\15\\\n     B. Effects of individual TRA '97 provisions\n       1. Child and education credits. The TRA '97 provisions \n     having the greatest effect on the AMT are the child credit \n     and the two education credits. All three credits can reduce a \n     taxpayer's regular tax liability, but, like most tax credits, \n     their use can be limited (or even eliminated) by a taxpayer's \n     TAMT.\\16\\\n       The number of taxpayers who benefit from the child credit \n     and education credits decreases in almost every year over the \n     1998-to-2008 period. (See Table 5.) There are two primary \n     reasons for these annual decreases. First, the income-\n     eligibility thresholds for the child credit are not \n     indexed for inflation. As a taxpayer's income increases \n     each year, the amount of the child credit a taxpayer near \n     the thresholds can take is reduced. For example, a joint \n     taxpayer with one child who had $100,000 in modified AGI \n     in 1999 would be eligible for the full $500 child credit. \n     If that taxpayer's income increased each year by the \n     inflation rate, the taxpayer's modified AGI would be about \n     $122,000 in 2008 and the taxpayer would be ineligible for \n     the child credit. Second, because the individual AMT \n     parameters are not indexed for inflation, each year the \n     AMT completely eliminates the credits for an increasing \n     number of taxpayers. The number of taxpayers who \n     completely lose the credits because of the AMT is 0.3 \n     million in 1999, 0.5 million in 2002, and 2.3 million in \n     2008.\n       The following sections discuss the effect of the child \n     credit first, the two education credits second, and the \n     combined effect of the three credits third.\n       a. Child credit. Effective January 1, 1998 the child credit \n     allows a $500 tax credit for each dependent child under age \n     17 at year-end.\\17\\ The credit is reduced by $50 for each \n     $1,000 of modified AGI for joint returns with modified AGI \n     above $110,000 ($75,000 for singles and HH).\n       The number of taxpayers whose child credit is reduced or \n     eliminated by the AMT grows at a 25-percent annual rate, from \n     0.6 million in 1998 to 6.0 million in 2008 (See Table 3.) The \n     number of taxpayers added to the AMT because of the child \n     credit grows from 0.3 million in 1998 to 0.9 million in 2002 \n     and to 2.5 million in 2008; the amount of child credits lost \n     because of the AMT grows from $0.3 billion in 1998 to $0.9 \n     billion in 2002, and to $3.5 billion in 2008.\n       b. Education credits.\\18\\ Effective January 1, 1998, the \n     $1,500 HOPE tax credit is available for college tuition and \n     certain fees incurred. For each student, the HOPE credit \n     covers the first $1,000 and 50 percent of the next $1,000 in \n     education expenses incurred in the first two years of \n     college. The credit is phased-out ratably for joint taxpayers \n     with modified AGI between $80,000 and $100,000 ($40,000 and \n     $50,000 for singles).\\19\\\n       Beginning July 1, 1998, a taxpayer can elect to take a \n     lifetime learning (LL) credit rather than a HOPE credit for a \n     qualifying student. Through December 31, 2002, the LL credit \n     equals 20 percent of the first $5,000 in education expenses \n     ($1,000 maximum credit). After December 31, 2002, the \n     credit equals 20 percent of the first $10,000 in expenses \n     ($2,000 maximum credit). The credit is phased-out ratably \n     for joint taxpayers with modified AGI between $80,000 and \n     $100,000 ($40,000 and $50,000 for singles).\\20\\\n       Because fewer taxpayers benefit from the education credits \n     than the child credit, the effect of the AMT on the education \n     credits is less than the effect on the child credit. (See \n     Table 5.) The number of taxpayers who have their education \n     credits reduced or eliminated because of the AMT grows from \n     0.4 million in 1998 to 2.5 million in 2008, a 20-percent \n     annual growth rate. The number of taxpayers added to the AMT \n     because of the education credits grows from 0.3 million in \n     1998 to 0.6 million in 2002 and to 1.3 million in 2008. The \n     amount of education credits lost because of the AMT grows \n     from $0.3 billion in 1998 to $0.6 billion in 2002 and to $2.1 \n     billion in 2008.\n       c. Child and education credits combined. Because double-\n     counting is removed, the effect of the AMT on the child \n     credit and education credits combined is less than the sum of \n     the individual effects. The number of taxpayers with TRA '97 \n     credits reduced or eliminated by the AMT grows from 0.8 \n     million in 1998 to 6.7 million in 2008, a 23-percent annual \n     rate. The number of taxpayers added to the AMT because of \n     these credits grows from 0.6 million in 1998 to 1.3 million \n     in 2002 and to 3.8 million in 2008, and the amount of these \n     credits lost because of the AMT grows from $0.5 billion in \n     1998 to $1.2 billion in 2002 and to $5.1 billion in 2008.\n       The increase in the percentage of taxpayers whose child and \n     education credits are reduced or eliminated by the AMT is \n     striking. In 1998 34.1 million taxpayers would be eligible \n     for the credits in the absence of the AMT; of these \n     taxpayers, 3 percent have their credits reduced or eliminated \n     by the AMT. In 2002 and 2008 the number of taxpayers eligible \n     for the credits in the absence of the AMT is almost the same \n     as in 1998, but the percentage whose credits are reduced or \n     eliminated by the AMT is 6 percent in 2002 and 20 percent in \n     2008.\n       2. Other TRA '97 provisions. The effects of the three other \n     TRA '97 provisions on the AMT are much smaller than the \n     effects of the three credit provisions.\n       a. Depreciation. The provision to conform AMT depreciation \n     lives to regular tax lives primarily affects corporate AMT \n     taxpayers. The provision affects some individual AMT \n     taxpayers (0.4 million in 2008), however, and the average \n     benefit from the provision per individual-tax taxpayer is \n     substantial, $2,300 in 2008. The total benefit to individual \n     tax taxpayers grows from $0.2 billion in 1999 to $0.7 billion \n     in 2002 and to $0.8 billion in 2008.\n       b. Kiddie tax. The provision to raise the minimum AMT \n     exemption for kiddie-tax taxpayers from $1,000 to $5,000 and \n     uncouple a dependent's AMT exemption from his parents' (or \n     sibling's) AMT exemption is a simplification provision \n     designed to benefit a significant number of taxpayers at \n     relatively little cost to the government. The number of \n     taxpayers who benefit from the proposal (0.5 million in \n     2008) is about the same as the number of individual \n     taxpayers who benefit from the depreciation provision, but \n     the cost to the government is much lower--less than $100 \n     per taxpayer. The total benefit of the kiddie tax \n     provision to taxpayers is $5 million in 1998 and grows to \n     $20 million in 2008.\n       c. Capital gains. The capital gains provision limits the \n     AMT tax rate on capital gains to 20 percent (the limit is 10 \n     percent for taxpayers in the 15-percent regular tax \n     bracket).\\21\\ The provision can lower the AMT liability for \n     taxpayers whose AMT tax rate on capital gains falls by more \n     than their regular tax rate on capital gains (i.e., those \n     whose TAMT falls by more than their regular tax liability). \n     Consider, for example, a taxpayer who faced a pre-TRA '97 \n     regular tax capital gains rate of 28 percent and a pre-TRA \n     '97 AMT rate of 32.5 percent (combined effect of 26-percent \n     statutory AMT rate and phase-out of AMT exemption). TRA '97 \n     decreases this taxpayer's regular-tax rate on capital gains \n     by 8 percentage points and her AMT rate on capital gains by \n     12.5 percentage points. This taxpayer's regular-tax liability \n     is reduced by less than her TAMT, so the capital gains \n     provision reduces the effect of the AMT on this taxpayer. On \n     the other hand, consider a taxpayer who faced a pre-TRA '97 \n     regular tax capital gains rate of 28 percent and a pre-TRA \n     AMT rate of 26 percent. TRA '97 decreases this taxpayer's \n     regular-tax rate on capital gains by 8 percentage points and \n     her AMT rate on capital gains by 6 percentage points. This \n     taxpayer's regular-tax liability is reduced by more than her \n     TAMT, so the capital gains provision increases the effect of \n     the AMT on this taxpayer. In no case, however, can the \n     capital gains rate cut increase AMT liability so as to \n     completely offset the reduced regular tax liability.\n       On net, the capital gains provision increases the number of \n     AMT taxpayers by 0.3 million in each year of the 1998-2008 \n     period. The number of taxpayers added to the AMT because of \n     the capital gains provision is about 0.4 million in each \n     year, and the number of taxpayers removed from the AMT is \n     about 0.1 million each year.\\22\\\n       The provision essentially does not change AMT liability \n     over the period. Taxpayers with increased AMT liability incur \n     between $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion in increased AMT \n     liability in each year of the period; this increased \n     liability is almost exactly offset each year by decreased AMT \n     liability for other tax-payers.\n\n\n                            iii. conclusion\n\n       Before TRA '97 was enacted, many tax experts were aware \n     that the individual AMT had serious long-run problems that \n     needed fixing. The number of taxpayers who would face the \n     potentially daunting task of filling out the AMT form and \n     paying AMT taxes would increase to such a high level within \n     the next several years that significant pressure to reform \n     the AMT would arise. Despite its generally beneficial effect \n     on taxpayers, TRA '97 exacerbated the AMT problem \n     considerably and probably increased the pressure for AMT \n     reform.\n     \\1\\ See, e.g., Robert P. Harvey and Jerry Tempalski, ``The \n     Individual AMT: Why It Matters,'' National Tax Journal; Vol. \n     L, No. 3; September 1997, p. 453; Martin A. Sullivan, ``The \n     Individual AMT: Nowhere to Go But Up,'' Highlights & \n     Documents, October 24, 1996, p. 773.\n     \\2\\ For estimates presented in this report, a couple filing a \n     joint return counts as one taxpayer.\n     \\3\\ All post-1995 numbers in this report are estimates made \n     using the Treasury Department's Individual Tax Model and the \n     Clinton Administration's economic forecast from the FY99 \n     Budget.\n     \\4\\ Lee A. Sheppard, ``Tax Accounting for `No-Necked \n     Monsters','' Tax Notes, Aug. 3, 1998, p. 524. See, e.g., \n     Albert B. Crenshaw, ``Now You See It, Now You Don't: Tax Law \n     to Make Benefits Disappear.'' The Washington Post, September \n     17, 1997, p. C9, C11; Albert B. Crenshaw, ``More People Feel \n     the Pinch of the Alternative Minimum Tax,'' The Washington \n     Post, September 21, 1997, p. H1, H4;'' AMT, Cash Machine,'' \n     The Wall Street Journal, October 8, 1997, p. A22.\n     \\5\\ Since 1985, regular income tax parameters have been \n     indexed for inflation.\n     \\6\\ These other anomalies may not have been viewed as \n     significant when most taxpayers subject to the\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\n     AMT had tax-shelter type preferences; the anomalies are more \n     troublesome when even taxpayers with no preferences of that \n     type are subject to the AMT.\n     \\7\\ For a detailed discussion of how the AMT works, see \n     Harvey and Tempalski (1997).\n     \\8\\ Personal exemptions are treated here as an AMT \n     preference.\n     \\9\\ For taxpayers in the phase-out range of the AMT \n     exemption, the 26 percent AMT tax rate effectively becomes a \n     32.5 percent rate and the 28 percent rate becomes a 35 \n     percent rate.\n     \\10\\ For a small number of taxpayers, the AMT can affect \n     taxpayers in a third way. Because the AMT treats the standard \n     deduction as a preference item, some taxpayers with itemized \n     deductions less than the standard deduction can lower their \n     overall tax liability if they itemize deductions rather than \n     take the standard deduction. This tax-minimizing behavior \n     could occur if most itemized deductions are not AMT \n     preferences (e.g., charitable contributions). For these \n     taxpayers, itemizing increases regular tax liability but \n     lowers AMT liability even more, thus decreasing total tax \n     liability.\n     \\11\\ A few of these ``lost'' credits, particularly general \n     business credits, can be carried back or carried forward, so \n     they may not be permanently lost.\n     \\12\\ Except for some taxpayers who voluntarily increase their \n     capital gains realizations because of the capital gains rate \n     cut, nearly all taxpayers affected by the six provisions have \n     their overall tax liability reduced by the provisions.\n     \\13\\ The kiddie-tax provision can increase the effect of the \n     AMT for a very small number of taxpayers, less than 3,000 in \n     2008. The additional AMT liability for these taxpayers totals \n     less than $1 million in 2008.\n     \\14\\ TRA `97 affects the percentage of taxpayers on the AMT \n     in two ways. First, it increases the number of AMT taxpayers \n     by 3.2 million in 2008. Second, it decreases the total number \n     of taxpayers by 3.9 million in 2008, primarily because of the \n     child and education credits.\n     \\15\\ This point is important in examining IRS data. IRS data \n     does not indicate the amount of tax credits lost because of \n     the AMT. IRS data only reports AMT liability from Form 6251. \n     Only researchers with access to a microsimulation computer \n     model using actual tax return data can determine the amount \n     of lost credits.\n     \\16\\ For taxpayers with three or more children, the child \n     credit is not directly limited by TAMT. The credit is, \n     however, reduced by any final AMT liability reported on the \n     AMT form.\n     \\17\\ The child credit is $400 in 1998.\n     \\18\\ Because the two education credits are substitutes for \n     each other for many taxpayers, they are discussed together in \n     this section.\n     \\19\\ The credit amount and the income limits for the credit \n     are indexed for inflation occurring after 2000.\n     \\20\\ The income limits for the credit are indexed for \n     inflation occurring after 2000.\n     \\21\\ Under pre-TRA `97 law, capital gains under the AMT were \n     taxed at the same rate as other AMTI.\n     \\22\\ The numbers discussed here include the effects of \n     increased capital gains realizations resulting from the lower \n     capital gains tax rate. The effect of the increased \n     realizations on the AMT is very small.\n\n                                                                                TABLE 1.--NUMBER OF AMT TAXPAYERS\n                                                                                [By calendar years, in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                                                        Compound\n                                                                                                                                                                                         annual\n                                                                 1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      growth\n                                                                                                                                                                                          rate\n                                                                                                                                                                                       (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumber of AMT taxpayers:\n    Post-TRA '97:\n        Number with only AMT liability from Form 6251........       0.6       0.5       0.6       0.7       0.8       1.0       1.3       1.6       1.9       2.4       3.1       4.0         19\n        Number with only ``lost'' credits....................       0.1       0.8       1.0       1.2       1.4       1.6       2.1       2.5       3.1       3.7       4.1       4.7         42\n        Number with both.....................................       0.2       0.3       0.4       0.5       0.6       0.7       0.9       1.1       1.4       1.8       2.4       2.9         28\n                                                              ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Total \\1\\..........................................       0.9       1.6       2.0       2.4       2.8       3.3       4.3       5.2       6.4       8.0       9.5      11.6         26\n                                                              ==================================================================================================================================\n    Pre-TRA '97:\n        Number with only AMT liability from Form 6251........       0.6       0.7       0.9       1.1       1.4       1.7       2.1       2.7       3.2       4.3       5.2       6.6         24\n        Number with only ``lost'' credits....................       0.1       0.2       0.2       0.2       0.2       0.3       0.3       0.4       0.5       0.5       0.6       0.8         21\n        Number with both.....................................       0.2       0.2       0.2       0.2       0.3       0.3       0.4       0.5       0.5       0.7       0.9       1.1         17\n                                                              ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Total \\1\\..........................................       0.9       1.1       1.3       1.5       1.9       2.2       2.8       3.5       4.2       5.5       6.7       8.5         23\n                                                              ==================================================================================================================================\n    Change caused by TRA '97:\n        Number with only AMT liability from Form 6251........

A bill to provide for violent and repeat juvenile offender \naccountability, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   protect children from violence act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress a serious national problem--the increasingly violent nature of \njuvenile crime. It seems that nearly every day we hear encouraging news \nabout the progress we are making in the fight against crime. There is \nno doubt that this is good news. But reports about reductions in the \ncrime rate obscure two unfortunate realities: First, although the rate \nof crime has dropped over the past few yeas, the level of crime remains \nfar too high. Second, whatever progress has been made in the reduction \nof overall crime rates, we are still confronted with a serious problem \nwith violent juvenile crime.\n  Statistics about crime rates are useful, but what really matters is \nthe level of violent crime. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \nwent down over twenty points. If we were focus on that fact alone, it \nwould appear that the stock market was down, when in fact the Dow is \nnear its all time record high. The same is true of crime, especially \njuvenile crime. Although the most recent data show some drops in the \ncrime rate, the overall level of crime, especially juvenile crime is \nunacceptably high. There are about as many violent crimes committed \ntoday as in 1987. The number of violent juvenile crimes is at roughly \nthe 1992 level and at 150% of the 1987 level. I do not think anyone \nthought they were safe or secure enough in 1987 or in 1992.\n  Statistics about crime rates also mask the increasingly violent \nnature of juvenile crimes. Seventeen percent of all forcible rapes, \nfifty percent of all arsons and thirty-seven percent of all burglaries \nare committed by juveniles. The juvenile justice system is no longer \nbeing asked to deal with juveniles who have committed a youthful \nindiscretion. The system is being asked to deal with juveniles who \nbecome hardened criminals before they turn eighteen.\n  Finally, the recent dip in crime rates is cold comfort for victims of \nviolent crimes. My constituents in Missouri continually identify \nviolent juvenile crime as a paramount concern, and you only have to \nread the newspaper to understand why. When parents read in the \nnewspaper about a 16-year old who raped four young girls in St. Charles \nCounty, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile \ncrime. When parents in Hazelwood read about a 13-year old convicted of \nmurder for fracturing his victim's skull with the butt of a sawed-off \nshotgun, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile \ncrime. And when people in Poplar Bluff read about a 16-year old, \nencouraged by his 20-year old accomplice, who held a pizza delivery man \nat the point of a shotgun to steal $32, they understand the importance \nof targeting violent juvenile crime.\n  Mr. President, that is precisely what the bill I am introducing today \ndoes--it targets violent juvenile crime. This bill, the Protect \nChildren from Violent Act, will update our current juvenile justice \nlaws to reflect the new vicious nature of today's teen criminals. It \ntreats the most violent juvenile offenders as adults and punishes those \nadults who would exploit or endanger our children.\n  The Act has several components. First and foremost, it would require \nfederal prosecutors and States, in order to qualify for $750 million in \nnew incentive grants, to try as adults those juveniles fourteen and \nolder who commit serious violent offenses, such as rape or murder. \nThere is nothing juvenile about these crimes, and the perpetrators must \nbe treated and tried as adults.\n  Some of the laws on the books inadvertently pervert the direction of \nthe law enforcement system, offering more protections to the \nperpetrators, than to the public. This must cease. Strengthening our \njuvenile justice laws is the first line of defense in protecting the \npublic and providing greater protection for innocent children than for \nviolent criminals.\n  In order to do this, we also must ensure that our law enforcement \nofficials, courts and schools have clear lines of communication and \naccess to the records of violent juvenile offenders. This bill \naccomplishes this goal by requiring the fingerprinting and \nphotographing of juveniles found guilty of crimes that would be \nfelonies if committed by an adult. The bill also would ensure that \nthose records are made available to federal and state law enforcement \nofficials and school officials, so thy will know who they are dealing \nwith when they confront a dangerous juvenile offender.\n  Typically, state statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge \nthose records when the juvenile reaches age 18. Today's young criminal \npredators understand that when they reach their eighteenth birthday, \nthey can begin their second career as adult criminals with an \nunblemished record. The time has come to discard the anachronistic idea \nthat crimes committed by juveniles must be kept confidential, no matter \nhow heinous the crime.\n  Our law enforcement agencies, courts, and school officials need \nimproved access to juvenile records so that they have the tools to deal \nwith the exponential increase in the severity and frequency of juvenile \ncrimes.\n  The current state of juvenile record keeping is simply unacceptable. \nAs part of the message that juvenile crime is something less than real \ncrime, many jurisdictions have kept inadequate juvenile records or kept \nrecords sealed and inaccessible. What is more, whatever juvenile \nrecords they did keep were expunged when the juvenile turned eighteen. \nA judge sentencing a fresh-faced nineteen-year-old would sentence him \nlike a first-time offender, blissfully ignorant of his prior record of \nsimilar incidents. These problems are made worse by the absence of any \nsystem to provide for the nationwide sharing of juvenile records. This \nis not a problem that any one State can solve alone. Even if a State \ntreats juvenile criminal records like any other criminal record, it is \nstill vulnerable to violent juveniles who move into the State. The \nproblem we face is that although juveniles frequently cross state \nlines, their records do not follow them.\n  For too long, law enforcement officers have operated in the dark. Our \npolice departments need to have access to the prior juvenile criminal \nrecords of individuals to assist them in criminal investigations and \napprehension.\n  According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is past president of \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, law enforcement \nofficials are in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records. \nThe police chief has said, ``Current juvenile records (both arrest and \nadjudication) are inconsistent across the States, and are usually \nunavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful \noffenders.''\n  Chief Walchak also notes that ``If we [in law enforcement] don't know \nwho\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nthe youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.''\n  Chief Walchak is not the only one saying this. Law enforcement \nofficers in my home State have told me that when they arrest juveniles \nthey have no idea who they are dealing with because the records are \nkept confidential.\n  School officials, as well as courts and law enforcement officials, \nneed access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in providing \nfor the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies.\n  The decline in school safety across the country can be attributed to \na significant degree to laws that put the protection of dangerous \nstudents ahead of protecting the innocent--those who go to school to \nlearn, not to maim or murder.\n  While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, Missouri, a teacher \ntold me how one of her students came to school wearing an electronic \nmonitoring ankle bracelet. Can you imagine being that teacher and \nhaving to turn around--back to the class--to write on the chalk board \nnot knowing whether that student was a rapist, or even a murderer?\n\n  The proposed bill solves these problems by providing a nationwide \nsystem of record sharing. What is more, the bill provides block grants \nto the States for the purpose of establishing improved juvenile record \nkeeping. To qualify for these block grants, States must keep records \nfor juveniles that are equivalent to those they keep for adult \ncriminals. The States must then make those records available to the \nFBI, law enforcement officers, school officials and sentencing courts. \nThese provisions allow those who have to deal with these violent \njuveniles to do so based on full information. That is the only basis on \nwhich those decision should be made.\n  In addition to requiring that federal and state prosecutors try \nviolent juvenile offenders as adults and increasing record keeping and \nsharing capabilities, this bill enhances the federal criminal penalties \nfor those adults who seek to lure juveniles into criminal activity or \ndrug use.\n  For example, any adult who distributes drugs to a minor, traffics in \ndrugs in or near a school, or uses minors to distribute drugs would \nface a minimum three year jail sentence (as compared to the 1 year \nminimum under current law).\n  This bill also doubles the maximum jail time and fines for adults who \nuse minors in crimes of violence. The second time the adult hides \nbehind the juvenile status of a child by using him to commit a crime, \nthe adult faces a tripling of the maximum sentence and fine.\n  The fact that our current system treats juvenile crime lightly has \nnot been lost on young people. Not has it been lost on hardened adult \ncriminals. If the system is going to let young people off with a slap \non the wrist and then give them a clean slate when they turn eighteen, \nwhy should any adult criminal risk serious jail time by committing a \ncrime themselves. Why not, instead, just use a juvenile and have the \nyouth commit the crime for them. This use of juveniles is deplorable. \nBut, sadly, our current treatment of juveniles gives adults an \nincentive to exploit children in this way. If a store sold candy for $5 \nto adults, but for $1 to children, there would be a lot of adults \nsending a kid in to buy them a candy bar. So too, with the criminal \njustice system. Our light treatment of juveniles has led adults to \ncorrupt children in order to escape the penalties imposed by the adult \nsystem. It is no wonder that a 20-year old in Poplar Bluff has her 16-\nyear old accomplice take the lead in the armed robbery. We cannot \ncontinue to encourage this intolerable behavior. Those who would \ncorrupt our children should received our stiffest and swiftest \nsanction. To this end, my bill imposes enhanced penalties on adults who \nuse juveniles to commit violent offenses, and also will encourage the \nStates to adopt similar provisions.\n  Furthermore, the Protect Children from Violence Act elevates to a \nfederal crime the recruiting of minors to participate in gang activity. \nUnder this legislation, those gangsters who lure our children into \ngangs will face a federal prosecutor and a federal penitentiary.\n  A 1993 survey reported an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 gang \nmembers in the United States. Those figures are disturbing enough. But \na second study, conducted just two years later, found that the number \nof gangs had increased more than four-fold, with 23,388 gangs claiming \nover 650,000 members. We need legislation to stem this rising tide.\n  Let me quickly recap the highlights of this legislation. In order to \nqualify for incentive grants, States would be required to try juveniles \nas adults if they commit certain violent crimes such as rape and \nmurder. States also would have to fingerprint and keep records on \njuveniles who commit crimes that would be felonies if committed by \nadults, and States mut allow public access to juvenile criminal records \nof repeat juvenile offenders. These same provisions would apply to \nfederal law enforcement officials. To protect our children from adults \nwho prey on the, this bill doubles and triples the jail time for those \nconvicted of using a juvenile to commit a violent crime or to \ndistribute drugs. Anyone caught dealing drugs to minors or near a \nschool will face three times the penalty under current law.\n  This bill is a reasonable and prudent response to the threat that \nviolent youth, and the adults that lead them into a life of crime, pose \nto our children. the monies authorized will be used to deter and \nincarcerate violent juvenile criminals, not just to provide for more \nmidnight basketball and prevention programs--the situation, and our \nfuture, demands more than that. We need to take into account the needs \nof the innocent children--not sacrifice their protection in the name of \nprivacy for violent juvenile perpetrators.\n  For too long now we have treated juvenile crime as something less \nthan real crime. Even the language we use--referring to adult crimes, \nbut to acts of juvenile delinquency--suggests that juvenile crime is \nnot real crime. But we are not talking about throwing spit-balls or \njuvenile horseplay. We are talking about murder and assault and rape. \nAnd I assure you that for the victims of these crimes, the crimes are \nall too real--no less so because the perpetrator was under eighteen. \nThe time has come to take juvenile crime seriously and protect our \nchildren from violence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 539. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe maximum taxable income for the 15 percent rate bracket, to replace \nthe Consumer Price Index with the national average wage index for \npurposes of cost-of-living adjustments, to lessen the impact of the \nnoncorporate alternative minimum tax, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I have introduced a proposal for \na tax cut which I think answers a number of questions that people have \nbeen putting forward. I hear both sides of the aisle talking about a \ntax cut and the willingness to have a tax cut. Some are saying we need \nit to be targeted; some say we need to do it with the marriage penalty; \nothers say we need a broad-based tax relief to take place.\n  The proposal I am putting in today would expand the 15-percent tax \ncategory over a period of 10 years and raise that to the level of the \nmaximum amount at which we tax Social Security. What it does is, we \nbroaden that 15-percent tax bracket. We make it such that it will take \ncare of most of the marriage penalty. It will be economically \nsimulating in that it will be a great relief for a number of people \nthat grow into that 15-percent category, then, as we expand it. And it \nwill be middle-income targeted because it will be that category of \npeople making in the 15-percent rate and growing it up to $72,000 over \na period of 10 years.\n  I think this answers a lot of questions on what we have been putting \nforward. We set aside every dime of Social Security money for Social \nSecurity, period. We do that. All those funds flowing into Social \nSecurity will remain and stay with Social Security. Not a dime of that \nis touched.\n  With the other resources that we have coming in that are building the \nsurplus, let's do this sort of tax cut that moves to the middle-income \ncategory and addresses the marriage penalty problem. That is \neconomically stimulating and is one that I think can be fair and \nhelpful to our growth.\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n  This is the final point I will make, as I intend to be brief about \nthis. We are at a period of being able to talk about solving Social \nSecurity and paying down debt and providing tax cuts and dealing with \neducation problems because we have a strong growing economy. We have a \ngrowing economy that is producing these sorts of revenues. We have to \nmaintain that, and the lead thing that we can do to maintain that is to \nprovide for economically stimulating tax cuts like what I am proposing \nhere, and broaden that 15-percent tax rate, target it for people there, \nand have an economically stimulating benefit from that occurring. I \nthink that is the way that we need to go to be able to maintain what we \nhave in place now in this healthy economy and to be able to deal with \nthese sorts of issues, to stimulate education reform, and to have the \nfunds for education, as well.\n  Mr. President, that is the proposal I have introduced today. I urge \nmy colleagues to look at it, and I would appreciate their support for \nthis bill as we press forward on this broad-based debate on what we are \ngoing to do about this budget and how we continue the strong economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bryan, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat housing assistance provided under the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 be treated for purposes \nof the low-income housing credit in the same manner as comparable \nassistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    low income housing tax credit equitable access for indian tribes\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will correct an unintended oversight in the federal \nadministration of Native American housing programs, allowing Indian \ntribes to once again access Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for \nhousing development in some of this nation's most under-served \ncommunities. Joining me as original cosponsors of this bill are \nSenators Inhofe, Conrad, Kerry, Daschle, Inouye, Wellstone, Sarbanes, \nKerrey, Kennedy, Dorgan, Reid, Baucus, Bryan and Boxer.\n  In the 104th Congress, the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf Determination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law, separating Indian \nhousing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and \ntheir tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of \nNAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to \nuse those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits \ndistributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately, unlike \nHOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as \nfederal funds and cannot be used for accessing LIHTCs.\n  The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access \na program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended \nconsequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and \nsetting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines \nNAHASDA funds, restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting \nNAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical \ncorrection, there would be no change to the LIHTC programs--tribes \nwould compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the state level, \njust as they did prior to NAHASDA.\n  This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix \nto a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development \nacross the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has \nenthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable \ntreatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven \nsuccess of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower \nincome communities.\n  I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and \nincrease the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every \nstate, and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of \nmaintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this \nlegislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake certain changes related to payments for graduate medical education \nunder the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague \nfrom Alaska, Senator Murkowski, in introducing the Graduate Medical \nEducation Technical Amendments Act of 1999, which is intended to \naddress some of the problems that small family practice residency \nprograms in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of \nprovisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended \nto control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending.\n  Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total \nnumber of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 \nMedicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate \nmedical education program was to slow down our nation's overall \nproduction of physicians, while still protecting the training of \nphysicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and \nnational health care demands. While the BBA's provisions will indeed \ncurb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so \nindiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to \nincrease the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural \nareas.\n  Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New \nEngland, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of \nsmall family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the \npractice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these \nresidency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural \nand underserved areas of the state. The new caps on residency slots \nincluded in the BBA penalize these programs in a number of ways.\n  For instance, the current cap is based on the number of interns and \nresidents who were ``in the hospital'' in FY 1996. Having a cap that is \ninstitution-specific rather than program-specific has caused several \nproblems. For example, the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency \nProgram had two residents out on leave in 1996--one on sick leave for \nchemotherapy treatments and one on maternity leave. Therefore, the \nprogram's cap was reduced by two, because it was based on the number of \nactual residents in the hospital in 1996 as opposed to the number of \nresidents in the program.\n  Moreover, residents in this program have spent one to two months \ntraining in obstetrics at Dartmouth's Mary Hitchcock's Medical Center \nin Lebanon, New Hampshire. Because the cap is based on a hospital's \ncost report, these residents are counted toward Dartmouth Medical \nSchool's cap instead of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency \nProgram's. Last\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nyear, the Maine program was informed that Dartmouth would be cutting \nback the amount of time their residents are there. But the Maine-\nDartmouth Family Practice Residency Program has no way of recouping the \nresident count from them in order to have the funds to support \nobstetrical training for their residents elsewhere.\n  Moreover, the cap does not include residents who continue to be part \nof the residency program, but who have been sent outside of the \nhospital for training. This penalizes all primary care specialties, but \nespecially family medicine, where ambulatory training has historically \nbeen the hallmark of the specialty. This is particularly ironic since \nother specialty programs that now begin training in settings outside \nthe hospital will, under the new rules, have those costs included in \ntheir Medicare graduate medical education funding.\n  All told, the Maine Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program will \nsee its graduate medical education funding reduced by over half a \nmillion dollars a year as a result of the cap established by the BBA.\n  The example I have just used is from Maine, but the problems created \nby the BBA's graduate medical education changes are national in scope. \nIt has created disproportionately harmful effects on family practice \nresidencies from Maine to Alaska. A recent survey of all family \npractice residency program directors has found that:\n  56 percent of respondents who were in the process of developing new \nrural training sites have indicated that they will either not implement \nthose plans or are unsure about their sponsoring institutions' \ncontinued support.\n  21 percent of respondents report planning to decrease their family \npractice residency slots in the immediate future. The majority of those \nwho are planning to decrease their slots are the sole residency program \nin a teaching hospital. This means that, under current law, they have \nno alternative way of achieving growth, such as through a reduction of \nother specialty slots in order to stay within the cap.\n\n  And finally, the vast majority of family practice residencies did not \nhave their full residency FTEs captured in the 1996 cost reports upon \nwhich the cap is based.\n  In addition to this survey, we have anecdotal information from \nresidencies across the country detailing how they have lost funding \neither because of where they trained their residents or because their \nresidents had been extended sick or maternity leave. For example, one \nfamily practice residency in Washington State last year had an \nequivalent of 14 residents training outside of the hospital and four in \nthe hospital. Under the BBA, their cap would be four. By contrast, had \nall of their residents been trained in the hospital up to this point, \ntheir payment base would have been capped at 18, even if they trained \nresidents in non-hospital settings in the future.\n  The Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act we \nare introducing today will address these problems by basing the cap on \nthe number of residents ``who were appointed by the approved medical \nresidency training programs for the hospital'' in 1996, rather than on \nthe number of residents who were ``in the hospital.''\n  I am also concerned that the Balanced Budget Act and its accompanying \nregulations will severely hamper primary care residency programs that \nare expanding to meet local needs. Specifically, a new residency \nprogram that had not met its full complement of accredited residency \npositions until after the cutoff date of August 5, 1997, is precluded \nfrom increasing its number of residents unless the hospital decreases \nthe number of residents in one of its other specialty programs. \nHowever, over forty percent of the nation's family practice residency \nprograms are the only program sponsored by the hospital. This provision \ntherefore completely precludes such a hospital from expanding its \nresidency program to meet emerging primary care needs.\n  To address this problem, the legislation we are introducing today \nwould allow the small number of programs at hospitals that sponsor just \none residency program to increase their cap by one residency slot a \nyear up to a maximum of three. In addition, to enable a number of \nfamily practice residency programs that are already in the pipeline to \nget accredited and grow to completion, the bill extends the cutoff date \nto September 1999.\n  And finally, the Balanced Budget Act gave the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to give ``special consideration'' to new \nfacilities that ``meet the needs of underserved rural areas.'' The \nHealth Care Financing Administration has interpreted this to mean \nfacilities that are actually in underserved rural areas. There have \nbeen several recent expansions in family practice residency programs \nthat include a rural training track, with residents located in outlying \nhospitals, or with satellite programs designed specifically to train \nresidents to work with underserved populations.\n  Even though these new programs or satellites required accrediting \nbody approval, they are still part of the ``mother'' residencies, which \nmay not be physically located in an underserved rural area. While these \nare not technically new programs, I believe that the definition should \nbe expanded to include such endeavors, given the value of these \nprograms in addressing the needs of underserved populations. Therefore, \nthe Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act would \nexpand the definition to include ``facilities which are not located in \nan underserved rural area, but which have established separately \naccredited rural training tracks.''\n  Mr. President, while the changes we are proposing today are \nrelatively minor and technical in nature, they are critical to the \nsurvival of the small family practice residency programs that are so \nimportant to our ability to meet health manpower needs in rural and \nunderserved areas. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical \nAmendments and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 541\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, the Graduate \nMedical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1999. This legislation \nwill alleviate unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 regarding Graduate Medical Education (GME).\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained important and necessary GME \nreform. However, a small number of the changes in the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, have grave consequences for many residency programs, \nparticularly for programs that have been training in ambulatory \nsettings, are small, or who produce physicians to serve in rural areas. \nThe impact has been disproportionately harmful to programs that: have \nalready been training in ambulatory settings (because the hospitals in \nwhich they were located were not allowed to count the residents they \nhad serving in community settings in the cap); are small, such as \nhospitals with only one residency program; and train physicians for \npractice in rural areas.\n  The impact is especially damaging to family practice residency \nprograms. Only family practice residents have been trained extensively \nout of the hospital and only family practice residencies were \nsignificantly harmed by this provision in the BBA. In fact, a recent \nsurvey indicates that 56 percent of family residency program directors \nbelieve that the BBA provisions will preclude their development of \nrural training sites.\n  Senator Collins' and my legislation would include the following \nlegislative remedies:\n  Recalculate the IME and DME caps based on the number of interns and \nresidents who were appointed by the approved medical residency training \nprograms for FY 1996, whether they were being trained in the hospital \nor in the community;\n  Change the cutoff date for adjusting the DME funding cap to September \n30, 1999, to allow those programs already in the approval process for \naccreditation to continue to realization; and\n  Expand the exception to the funding caps to include programs with \nseparately accredited rural training tracks even if the sponsoring \nhospital is not located in a rural area, and for residency programs \nwhere a primary care training program is the only one offered in the \nhospital.\n  This legislation is important for Alaska's first and only residency \nprogram. The Alaska Family Practice Residency is specifically designed \nto train physicians to practice medicine in rural Alaska.\n  Alaska's rural health care problems are tough: 74% of Alaska is \nmedically under-served. Many villages populated by 25-1000 individuals \ndo not have access to physicians. Physician turn-over rate is high \nwhich makes it impossible for patients to establish long-term \nrelationships with their physician to manage chronic disease or to do \npreventative medicine. The result is that bush Alaska has much higher \nrates of preventable diseases.\n  This legislation is truly imperative to Alaska health care. While \nother residency programs have the luxury of educating their residents \non rural health issues, for us it is a necessity.\n  Mr. President, our legislation corrects a small deficiency in the BBA \nof 1997 that has had a large, unintended impact on programs training \ncommunity-based and rural doctors. I hope my colleagues can join our \nefforts and support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Burns, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 542.

It is \nprojected that 60 percent of all jobs will require high-tech computer \nskills by the year 2000, yet 32 percent of our public schools have only \none classroom with access to the Internet.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we act now to provide our \nnation's students with the necessary technological background so they \ncan succeed in tomorrow's high-tech workplace and ensure our country's \nfuture position in competitive world markets.\n  The Department of Education recommends that there be at least one \ncomputer for every five students. According to the Educational Testing \nService, in 1997, there was only one computer for every 24 students, on \naverage. Not only are our classrooms sadly under-equipped, but even \nthose classrooms with computers often have systems which are so old and \noutdated they are unable to run even the most basic software programs, \nare not multi-media capable and cannot access the Internet. Mr. \nPresident, one of the more common computers in our schools today is the \nApple IIc, a computer so archaic it is now on display at the \nSmithsonian.\n  While this technological deficiency affects all of our schools, the \nstudents who are in the most need are receiving the least amount of \ncomputer instruction and exposure.\n  According to the Secretary of Education, 75.9 percent of households \nwith an annual income over $75,000 have computers, compared to only 11 \npercent of households with incomes under $10,000. This disparity exists \nwhen comparing households with Internet access as well. While 42 \npercent of families with annual incomes over $75,000 have on-line \ncapability, only 10 percent of families with incomes $25,000 or less \ncan access the Internet from their homes.\n  Rural areas and inner cities fall below the national average for \nhouseholds that have computers.\n  Nationwide, 40.8 percent of white households have computers, while \nonly 19 percent of African-American and Hispanic households do. This \ndisparity is increasing, not decreasing. And, Mr. President, this \nunfortunate trend is not confined simply to individual households, it \nis present in our schools as well.\n  Education should be a great equalizer, providing the means by which \nAmericans can take advantage of all the opportunities this country can \noffer, regardless of background. Yet, Educational Testing Service \nstatistics show schools with 81 percent or more economically \ndisadvantaged students have only one multi-media computer for every 32 \nstudents, while a school with 20 percent or fewer economically \ndisadvantaged students will have a multi-media computer for every 22 \nstudents. That is a difference of 10 students per computer. \nFurthermore, schools with 90 percent or more minority students have \nonly one multimedia computer for every 30 students.\n  Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable.\n  The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 contains a provision, The 21st \nCentury Classrooms of 1997, which allows a corporation to take a \ndeduction from taxable income for the donation of computer technology, \nequipment and software.\n  Unfortunately, since The 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997 has been \nimplemented, there has not been a significant increase in corporate \ndonations of computers and related equipment to K-12 schools. The \ncurrent incentives do not provide enough tax relief to outweigh the \ncosts incurred by the donors. Moreover, the restrictions limiting the \nage of eligible equipment to two years or less and the narrow \ndefinition of ``original use'' has greatly\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nlimited the number of computers available for qualified donation. As a \nresult, the Detwiler Foundation, a California-based organization with \nunparalleled status as a facilitator of computer donations to K-12 \nschools nationwide, reports they ``have not witnessed the anticipated \nincrease in donation activity'' since the enactment of the 1997 tax \ndeduction.\n\n  Mr. President, to increase the amount of technology donated to \nschools, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would expand the parameters \nof the current tax deduction and add a tax credit, which operates like \nthe R tax credit. Specifically, the bill would do the following:\n  First, this legislation would allow a tax credit equal to 30 percent \nof the fair market value of the donated computer equipment. An \nincreased tax credit provides greater incentive for companies to donate \ncomputer technology and equipment to schools. This includes computers, \nperipheral equipment, software and fiber optic cable related to \ncomputer use.\n  Second, it would expand the age limit to include equipment three \nyears old or less. Many companies do not update their equipment within \nthe two year period. This provision increases the availability of \neligible equipment. Three year old computers equipped with Pentium-\nbased or equivalent chips have the processing power, memory, and \ngraphics capabilities to provide sufficient Internet and multi-media \naccess and run any necessary software.\n  Third, the current limitation on ``original use'' would be expanded \nto include the original equipment manufacturers or any corporation that \nreacquires the equipment. By expanding the number of donors eligible \nfor the tax credit, the number of computers available will increase as \nwell.\n  Lastly, enhanced tax credits equal to 50 percent of the fair market \nvalue of the equipment donated to schools located within designated \nempowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations \nwould be implemented. Doubling the amount of the tax credits for \ndonations made to schools in economically-distressed areas will \nincrease the availability of computers to the children that need it \nmost.\n  Bringing our classrooms into the 21st century will require a major \nnational investment. According to a Rand Institute study, it will cost \n$15 billion, or $300 per student, to provide American schools with the \ntechnology needed to educate our youth; the primary cost being the \npurchase and installation of computer equipment. At a time when the \ngovernment is planning to spend $1.2 billion to wire schools and \nlibraries to the Internet, the demand for this sophisticated hardware \nwill be greater than ever.\n  The Detwiler Foundation estimates that if just 10 percent of the \ncomputers that are taken out of service each year were donated to \nschools, the national ratio of students-to-computers would be brought \nto five-to-one or less. This would meet, or even exceed, the ratio \nrecommended by the Department of Education.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act will provide powerful tax \nincentives for American businesses to donate top quality high-tech \nequipment to our nation's classrooms without duly increasing Federal \nGovernment expenditures or creating yet another federal program or \ndepartment. Encouraging private investment and involvement, this Act \nwill keep control where it belongs--with the teachers, the parents, and \nthe students.\n  This bill is not simply another ``targeted tax break.'' Broad-based \ntax relief and reform efforts should work to lower tax rates across the \nboard while continuing to retain and improve upon the core tax \nincentives for education, homeownership, and charitable contributions. \nThe New Millennium Classrooms Act expands the parameters and thus the \neffectiveness of an already existing education and charity tax \nincentive, one which will effectively bring top-of-the-line technology \ninto all of our schools.\n  With the passage of the New Millennium Classrooms Act, all our \nchildren will have an equal chance at succeeding in the new \ntechnological millennium.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section by \nsection analysis, and a letter from the Detwiler Foundation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I am writing you because of the \n     Detwiler Foundation's unparalleled status as a facilitator of \n     computer donations to K-12 schools across the United States. \n     Our experience--eight years in computer solicitation, \n     refurbishing and placement, working through various types of \n     facilities in states across the nation--leaves us uniquely \n     qualified to provide perspective on computer donation \n     history, process and trends. Because of our depth of \n     knowledge in this area, it has been requested that we offer \n     information and insight on legislation that may be coming \n     before you this year.\n       As you move into the heart of the nation's legislative \n     workload for 1999 we understand that many different issues \n     will be on the agenda. The Detwiler Foundation Computers for \n     Schools Program is dedicated to increasing and enhancing \n     school technology available across the nation. As you might \n     imagine, we are keenly interested in all matters that help us \n     support that goal. Perhaps as you consider legislation for \n     this session you will examine existing statutes for \n     charitable contributions of computers and computer equipment \n     to schools and education-benefit organizations like ours.\n       Two years ago Congress enacted the 21st Century Classrooms \n     Act as part of the Tax Relief Act of 1997 (HR2014). This \n     provision allows corporations that donate computers to \n     qualified organizations (schools and education-benefit non-\n     profits) to receive an enhanced charitable contribution tax \n     deduction. The Detwiler Foundation welcomed this legislation \n     and considered it a significant development in our efforts to \n     support a computer-literate and technologically-prepared \n     society.\n       While we remain unqualifiedly grateful to the sponsors and \n     supporters of the 21st Century provision, we have not \n     witnessed the anticipated increase in donation activity. We \n     have been told by companies in a position to utilize the \n     legislation that, for the most part, it does not fully meet \n     their business cycle needs. We have also come to understand \n     that, even though company executives work hard to serve their \n     communities and the nation--and often succeed in so doing--\n     they still must ultimately answer to their shareholders. The \n     current legislation, they say, does not offer them \n     significant assistance in that responsibility.\n       The Detwiler Foundation suggests that an expansion of the \n     current code will bring about the results sought by the \n     authors of the 21st Century Classrooms Act while maintaining \n     the budgetary responsibility these times demand. Our \n     experience to this point is that no donors to our program \n     have been able to apply provisions of the current code to \n     their donations. In other words, donations have not attached \n     to the Balanced Budget offset outlay made for the existing \n     legislation. It is our firm belief that the following \n     amendments will meet the goals of the legislation while \n     maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n       Expand the ``eligible equipment'' provision to include \n     computers three (3) years old or less.\n       Provide donors shall a contribution credit against taxable \n     income equal to a percentage of the original basis of the \n     donated equipment. There should be a greater credit for \n     contributions to schools in federally-recognized empowerment \n     zones.\n       Offer the enhanced benefit to all IRS-designated (``C'' and \n     ``Subchapter S'') corporations.\n       Allow donee or facilitator to enhance and upgrade equipment \n     as is reasonable and necessary and recover the cost of work \n     done to add value to the equipment in addition to recovering \n     the cost for shipping, installation and transfer.\n       Make the legislation effective January 1, 2000 and extend \n     its lifetime through December 31, 2004.\n       The Detwiler Foundation addresses this issue as an \n     organization working with state governments and local \n     entities in every part of the nation. While we have no \n     statistical evidence to certify this, we are as we understand \n     it (and as is generally conceded) the single most prolific \n     source of donated computers for schools across the nation. \n     Last year we coordinated more than 12,000 computer donations. \n     Furthermore, we have been facilitating these contributions \n     since 1991. Our program has become the model for many other \n     agencies now involved in soliciting and providing computers \n     for schools. It is from that vantage point that we provide \n     our insights and observations.\n       We offer these suggested changes to the legislation after \n     having estimated the financial impact of these changes. This \n     estimate is based on our experience and our informed \n     perspective--you will find a copy accompanying this letter. \n     In coming to our conclusions, we attempted to be what we \n     consider generous, or even liberal, in our assignments of \n     applicable donations, facilitators and receiving schools and \n     tax credits. In other words, we have attempted to err on the \n     ``high'' or most expensive side in this equation. We believe \n     the actual costs to government coffers will be substantially \n     less than our educated guess.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration, and the very \n     best to you as you tackle this session's legislative agenda.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jerry Grayson,\n                                                Regional Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues Senators \nAbraham and Wyden to introduce the New Millennium Classrooms Act.\n  Technology is a wonderful thing. It increases our productivity, \nenhances the way we communicate with each other, and opens up access to \nwhole new worlds at the click of a finger.\n  It is becoming an integral part of the way America does business. Our \neconomy has become more and more globalized. Our jobs, our cars, and \nour toys are more and more high-tech. Computers have become such a big \npart of American business that it has been projected that 60 percent of \nAmerican jobs will require high-tech computer skills by 2000--just next \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, there is an important part of our society that has not \nkept pace with this technology craze--our schools. We are falling \ndismally short of meeting the Department of Education's recommendation \nof 1 computer per 5 students. American schools had an average of just 1 \ncomputer per 24 students in 1997.\n  Not only are there too few computers in the classrooms, but those \nthat are there are old and outdated, unable to run today's software and \napplications. In fact, the most popular model of computer in our \nschools is the Apple IIc. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this \ncomputer, you can see one just down the street in the Smithsonian.\n  Too many of today's schoolchildren are missing out on one of the \ngreatest advancements in computer applications--the Internet. Thirty-\ntwo percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access \nto the Internet. This is not right. Our kids deserve the cutting edge \nof technology, not the 21st century equivalent of chalk and slates.\n  In 1997, Congress recognized the need for more and better computers \nin our schools enacting a corporate charitable tax deduction for school \ncomputer donations. Unfortunately, the deduction was crafted narrowly \nwith various restrictions and limitations so that we have not seen a \nsignificant increase in computer donations to our schools.\n  The New Millennium Classrooms Act is designed to address the \nshortcomings of the current deduction by expanding limits on the \ndeduction and adding a tax credit equal to thirty percent of the fair \nmarket value of the donated computer equipment. This provides greater \nincentives for corporations to donate computer technology and equipment \nto our schools.\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\n  Allowing computer manufacturers to donate computers and other \nequipment returned to them through trade-ins or leasing programs will \nexpand both the number of eligible donors and the qualified equipment \nto be donated.\n  An enhanced 50 percent tax credit for donations to schools located in \nempowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations will \nhelp to address the growing technology gap between our urban and rural, \nrich and poor schools. This will help focus the donations to those kids \nwho need the technology the most, to those kids who are less likely to \nhave a computer at home.\n  A good education for our children is the key to the future of our \ncountry. Without current computers and equipment in our schools, we \ncannot keep our kids on the cutting edge of technology where they \nbelong. This bill contains real incentives for private organizations to \nget involved and donate computers and equipment to schools in order to \nhelp educate our children. This is important to our kids, our schools, \nand our future. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Hagel, \n        Ms. Collins, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 543. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n     Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \nSenators Jeffords, Frist, and Hagel in introducing the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act. I first \nintroduced this legislation in the 104th Congress, in conjunction with \nRepresentative Louise Slaughter in the House. Since then I have worked \nextensively with many of my colleagues to ensure that this legislation \neffectively addresses the need for protections against genetic \ndiscrimination in the health insurance industry. This bill builds on \nand improves the language included in the Patients' Bill of Rights--\nPlus (S. 300).\n  Progress in the field of genetics is accelerating at a breathtaking \npace. Who could have predicted 20 years ago that scientists could \naccurately identify the genes associated with cystic fibrosis, cancer, \nParkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases? Today scientists can, and as a \nresult doctors are increasingly better able to identify predispositions \nto certain diseases based on the results of genetic testing. These \nresults mean that doctors are better able to successfully treat and \nmanage many diseases. Scientific advances hold tremendous promise for \nthe approximately 15 million people affected by the over 4,000 \ncurrently-known genetic disorders, and the millions more who are \ncarriers of genetic diseases who may pass them on to their children. In \nfact, just this month scientists reported that one of the genes \nimplicated in advanced breast cancer is also related to the final \nstages of prostate cancer. Because science progresses my legislation \nhas not remained static and it represents the best of genetic \nadvancements and the most comprehensive definitions of genetic issues. \nI have been working hard with experts in the genetics field, Chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Senator Jim \nJeffords, Senator Bill Frist, and Senator Chuck Hagel to improve upon \nthe language included in the Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus. Today's \nbill is the result of an enormous amount of time and effort, and I want \nto thank my three colleagues for their willingness to devote so much of \ntheir attention to this important issue.\n  Unfortunately as our knowledge of genetics and genetic predisposition \nto disease has increased, so has the potential for discrimination in \nhealth insurance based on genetic information. In addition to the \npotentially devastating consequences health insurance denials based on \ngenetic information can have on American families, the fear of \ndiscrimination has equally harmful consequences for consumers and for \nscientific research. But genetics still isn't an exact science. We all \nmust remember that prediction does not mean certainty. For example, the \nAlzheimer's gene has less than a 35 percent prediction certainty. \nScience has not yet progressed to the point where it can tell us \ndefinitely and without doubt what will happen if a mutation is found \nand it is this uncertainty that makes our legislation so very, very \nimportant.\n  As a legislator who has worked for many years on the issue of breast \ncancer, and as a woman with a history of breast cancer in her family, I \ncontinue to be amazed and delighted with the treatment advances based \non the discoveries of two genes related to breast cancer--BRCA1 and \nBRCA2. Keep in mind that women who inherit mutated forms of either gene \nhave an 85 percent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, \nand a 50 percent risk of developing ovarian cancer. Not very good odds.\n  Although there is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry \nthe mutated gene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it \npossible for carriers of these mutated genes to take extra precautions \nsuch as mammograms, self-examinations, and even enrollment in research \nstudies in order to detect cancer at its earliest stages. Many women \nwho might take extra precautions if they knew they had the breast \ncancer gene may not seek testing because they fear losing their health \ninsurance. And what are the implications when women are afraid of \nhaving a genetic test--or testing their daughters?\n  The implications are simply devastating. One of my constituents from \nHampden, Maine put it best:\n\n       I'm a third generation [breast cancer] survivor and as of \n     last October I have nine immediate women in my family that \n     have been diagnosed with breast cancer * * *. I want my \n     daughters to be able to live a normal life and not worry \n     about breast cancer. I want to have the BRCA test [for breast \n     cancer] done but because of the insurance risk for my \n     daughters' future I don't dare.\n\n  Nine women in Bonnie Lee Tucker's family have breast cancer, yet the \nfear of discrimination was so strong that she would forgo testing that \ncould potentially save her own or her daughters' lives.\n  Patients like Bonnie Lee Tucker may be unwilling to disclose \ninformation about their genetic status to their physicians out of fear, \nhindering treatment or preventive efforts. And though it could save her \nlife or the life of one of her daughters she is unwilling to \nparticipate in potentially ground-breaking research trials because she \ndoes not want to reveal information about their genetic status and is \nafraid of losing her health insurance. Bonnie Lee Tucker should not \nhave to bet her life and the life of her daughter this way.\n  Americans should not live in fear of knowing the truth about their \nhealth status. They should not be afraid that critical health \ninformation could be misused. They should not be forced to choose \nbetween insurance coverage and critical health information that can \nhelp inform their decisions. They should not fear disclosing their \ngenetic status to their doctors. And they should not fear participating \nin medical research.\n  We must ensure that people who are insured for the very first time, \nor who become insured after a long period of being uninsured, do not \nface genetic discrimination. We must ensure that people are not charged \nexorbitant premiums based on such information. We must ensure that \ninsurance companies cannot discriminate against individuals who have \nrequested or received genetic services. We must ensure that insurance \ncompanies cannot release a person's genetic information without their \nprior written consent. And we must ensure that health insurance \ncompanies cannot carve out covered services because of an inherited \ngenetic disorder. Our bill does just that.\n  As the Senate moves forward with the Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus \nwe must focus on this important issue and should act as quickly as \npossible to put a halt to the unfair practice of discriminating on the \nbasis of genetic information, and to ensure that safeguards are in \nplace to protect the privacy of genetic information.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to \nintroduce the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance \nAct of 1999 with my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Hagel, and \nCollins. We have worked diligently on this legislation for several \nyears to bring this issue to the forefront of the Congressional agenda \nand to craft a solid piece of legislation that will provide patients\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nwith real protections against genetic discrimination in health \ninsurance.\n  Scientists anticipate that the entire human genome will be completely \ndecoded within the next few years. This unprecedented accomplishment \nwill usher in a new era in our understanding of diseases that afflict \nall Americans and is bound to expand our understanding of human \ndevelopment, health and disease. Ultimately, our hope is that medical \nscience will capitalize on these scientific advances to promote the \nhealth and well-being of our citizens.\n  It is the discovery of ``disease genes'' that provides the eye of the \ncurrent legislative storm. Scientists have already identified genes \nthat are associated with increased risk of certain diseases including: \nbreast cancer, colon cancer and Alzheimer`s dementia. In time, more \ngenes will be linked to risk of future disease. While early knowledge \nof disease risk is imperative to our ability to take measures to \nprevent disease, many fear some form of retribution for carrying \n``bad'' genes and, therefore, refuse testing. Discrimination in health \ninsurance, either by denial of coverage or excessive premium rates, is \nthe major concern of most individuals. For example, nearly a third of \nwomen offered a test for breast cancer risk at the National Institutes \nof Health declined citing concerns about health insurance \ndiscrimination.\n  Biomedical research and scientific progress march on and do not pause \nfor social and public policy debate and legislation. The escalating \nspeed of genetic discovery mandates that Congress act now to prohibit \ndiscrimination against healthy individuals who may have a genetic \npredisposition to disease. The bill I have been working on with \nSenators Snowe and Jeffords prohibits group health plans or health \ninsurance issuers from adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic \ninformation regarding an individual. In the individual insurance \nmarket, our bill prohibits health insurance issuers from using \npredictive genetic information to deny coverage or to set premium \nrates. Furthermore, insurers are prohibited from requesting predictive \ngenetic information or requiring an individual to undergo genetic \ntesting. If genetic information is requested for diagnosis of disease, \nor treatment and payment for services, health insurers are required to \nprovide patients a description of the procedures in place to safeguard \nthe confidentiality of such information.\n  The deciphering of the human genome presents an unparalleled \nopportunity to more completely understand disease processes and cures. \nWe want patients to benefit from our investment in biomedical research \nand fully utilize medical advancements to improve their health. This \nwill not be possible unless individuals are willing to be tested. \nPatients must feel safe from repercussions based on their genetic \nprofile. Prohibition of genetic discrimination in insurance will remove \nthe greatest barrier to testing and thus further accelerate our \nscientific progress.\n  My Senate colleagues and I are in the process of scrutinizing the \nquality of the medical care in our country. Increasing access to health \ncare and improving the quality of that care are two cornerstones of the \nSenate Republican Patients' Bill of Rights (S.300/S.326). I believe \nthat quality is best achieved when patients and their care givers can \nmake fully informed decisions regarding different treatment options. In \naddition, the essence of a long and productive life is the adoption of \nhealthy habits including preventative measures based on disease risk \nassessment. As a result, testing for genetic risk becomes an \nindispensable part of quality health care--which is why Senators Snowe, \nJeffords, Hagel, Collins, and I felt strongly that genetic \ndiscrimination provisions must be included our Patients' Bill of \nRights. Patients must not forgo genetic testing because of fear of \ndiscrimination in insurance. We have the opportunity--we have the \nduty--to dispel the threat of discrimination based on an individual's \ngenetic heritage. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nthese provisions this year as the health care debate moves forward.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I introduce \nthe ``Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of \n1999,'' with my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Frist, Hagel, and Collins. \nThese protections will give all Americans the assurance that the \nscientific breakthroughs in genetics testing are only used to improve \nan individual's health and not as a new means of discrimination.\n  On May 21st of last year, I held a Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee hearing on ``Genetic Information and Health Care,'' which \nproved to be one of the most important of the Committee's hearing \nduring the 105th Congress. At that hearing, the Committee was presented \ninformation regarding the enormous health benefits that genetic testing \nresearch may contribute to health care, particularly in preventative \nmedicine. Additionally, we heard compelling testimony from witnesses \nwho fear that genetic testing will be used to discriminate against \nindividuals with asmyptomatic conditions and to deny them the access to \nhealth insurance coverage that they have traditionally enjoyed.\n  Following that hearing, I directed my staff to work with the offices \nof Senator Frist and the other members of the Labor Committee, together \nwith the office of Senator Snowe, to draft legislation that build on \nSenator Snowe's bill, S. 89, to ensure that individuals would be able \nto control the use of their predictive genetic information. The results \nof these efforts are reflected in the genetic information provisions of \nS. 300, ``The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act.''\n  Our legislation addresses the concerns that were raised at the \nhearing:\n  1. It prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies in \nall markets from adjusting premiums on the basis of predictive genetic \ninformation.\n  2. Prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies from \nrequesting predictive genetic information as a condition of enrollment.\n  3. It allows plans to request--but not require--that an individual \ndisclose or authorize the collection of predictive genetic information \nfor diagnosis, treatment, or payment purposes. In addition, as part of \nthe request, the group health plans or health insurance companies must \nprovide individuals with a description of the procedures in place to \nsafeguard the confidentiality of the information.\n  For a society, it is often said, demography is destiny. But for an \nindividual, as we are learning more and more, it is DNA that is \ndestiny. Each week, it seems, scientists decipher another peace of the \ngenetic code, opening doors to greater understanding of how our bodies \nwork, how they fail, and how they might be cured.\n  Everyday we read of new discoveries resulting from the work being \nconducted at the National Center for Human Genome Research. As our body \nof scientific knowledge about genetics, increases, so, too, do the \nconcerns about how this information may be used. There is no question \nthat our understanding of genetics has brought us to the brink of a new \nfuture. Our challenge as a Congress will be to help ensure that our \nsociety reaps the full health benefits of genetic testing and also to \nput to rest any concerns that the information will be used as a new \ntool to discriminate against specific ethnic groups or individual \nAmericans.\n  With the enactment of the ``Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in \nHealth Insurance Act of 1999'' as a part of S. 300--``The Patients' \nBill of Rights Plus Act''--we will be able to ensure that these \nscientific breakthroughs stimulated by the Human Genome Project will be \nused to provide better health for all members of our society and not as \na means of discrimination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 545. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal years \n1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAdministration's 1999 Reauthorization bill at the request of \nTransportation Secretary Rodney Slater. I introduce it so that it can \nbe part of the debates on the future of our aviation system. There are \nmany provisions that I do not support and the Secretary understands \nthis. However, the FAA needs adequate funding.\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\n The money is in the Airport and Airways Trust Fund--we just need to \nunlock it.\n  The items which concern me include the PFC and doing away with the \nHigh Density Rule and fees. Furthermore, I take issue with the \nPerformance Based Organization though I recognize that many segments of \nthe industry support it. We will not privatize the ATC System, but we \nmust make sure FAA has the tools and money to do its job.\n  I intend to work with the Secretary and Senators McCain, Rockefeller, \nand Gorton to accomplish this common goal.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Hollings, I \nam introducing the Administration's legislative proposal for \nreauthorizing the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration. I do \nso at the request of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater who is \neager to have the Senate consider his key initiatives.\n  Among other provisions, the bill includes a number of initiatives \nthat will be beneficial to small communities, modeled in part after S. \n379, the Air Service Restoration Act, which I introduced earlier this \nyear, along with Senators Dorgan, Wyden, Harkin, and Bingaman. Several \nof these provisions also have been incorporated into the FAA \nreauthorization bill, S. 82, which has been favorably reported by the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Many of my colleagues share my own commitment to addressing the \ncritical needs and concerns of small communities--the challenges they \nface in general, and the lack of air service in particular. I am very \npleased that the Secretary's bill offers leadership in this area.\n  I must also point out, however, that there are other areas of the \nAdministration's bill that I am reserving judgment on and may not be \nable to support. The Secretary is aware of my concerns, and I want to \nwork with him and my colleagues on crafting a meaningful legislative \npackage to reform the FAA, strengthen the Airport Improvement Program, \nenhance aviation competition and address the needs of small \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 546. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for 100 percent of the health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            The Health Insurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Health \nInsurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1999, to immediately put our nation's \nsole proprietors on par with their larger corporate competitors with \nrespect to the tax treatment of their health insurance costs, without \nany further delay.\n  I have argued for some time that it's indefensible that our federal \ntax laws tell some of our biggest corporations that they can deduct 100 \npercent of their health insurance costs, while others, mostly smaller \nbusinesses, are told they can deduct only a smaller share of their \nhealth insurance costs. Although we've recently made some progress in \naddressing this problem, the appropriate solution remains elusive.\n  Moreover, the reasons for promptly correcting this tax inequity are \neven more urgent today as many small businesses, especially our family \nfarmers, are now facing the financial struggles of their lives. Not \nonly is continued delay of this equitable tax treatment unacceptable \nfor family farmers and ranchers whose documented risks in business are \nreflected in higher health costs, but it's also diverting resources \naway from the operations of farms, ranches and Main Street businesses \nin rural America at a time when many simply can't afford it.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has taken some steps in \naddressing this unfair disparity in the deductibility of health \ninsurance costs by allowing sole proprietors to deduct a larger share \nof their health insurance costs. But we've been taking steps that are \ntoo small and too slow. This year, sole proprietors may deduct only 60-\npercent of their health insurance costs for tax purposes. This glaring \nunfairness is scheduled to be fixed by the year 2003, when our nation's \nsmall business owners will finally be able to claim a 100-percent \ndeduction, just like large corporations already enjoy. But this is \nsimply too late for many small businesses.\n  We can no longer delay providing this tax relief because many of the \nself-employed who would benefit from it--including farmers and \nranchers--are struggling through the worst farm crisis in memory. \nThat's why my legislation would provide farmers, ranchers and other \nsole proprietors a full, 100-percent tax deduction for this year's \nhealth insurance costs.\n  Mr. President, the health of a farm family or small business owner is \nno less important than the health of the president of a large \ncorporation, and the Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple \nfact now. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and join \nme in immediately ending this tax inequity at the first available \nopportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Biden, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 547. A bill to authorize the President to enter into agreements to \nprovide regulatory credit for voluntary early action to mitigate \npotential environmental impacts from greenhouse gas emissions; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  Credit for Voluntary Reductions Act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Mack, \nLieberman, Warner, Moynihan, and a host of others to introduce the \nCredit for Voluntary Reductions Act of 1999.\n  This bipartisan legislation addresses a major disincentive that is \npreventing voluntary, cost-effective, and near-term actions by U.S. \nentities to reduce the threat of global climate change. In a word, this \ndisincentive is uncertainty. Let me explain.\n  There is growing certainty in the international scientific community, \nand indeed within our own business community, that human actions may \neventually cause harmful disturbances to our global climate system. \nUnfortunately, no one in the business world or the Congress knows for \nsure what, if anything, might be done in the future to stabilize \natmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngases.\n  Will the 1997 Kyoto Protocol ever be ratified and implemented in the \nUnited States? Many, particularly here on Capitol Hill, believe not. If \nthe Kyoto Protocol is never implemented, will something else replace \nit? More persons than not think this is a real possibility.\n  Will the United States ever reach the point where greenhouse gas \nmitigation is legally required? Observers on all sides of this debate, \nirrespective of their preference, will concede that there is a \nreasonable probability of future government regulation in one form or \nanother. Or, at least there is no guarantee that mandatory action will \nnever be imposed.\n  But when might such government requirements take effect? How would \nthey be designed? Finally, who will be subjected to them? What emission \nsources might be exempted? No one can answer these questions \ndefinitively. And such inquiries will likely go unanswered for a \nconsiderable amount of time into the future.\n  While the Credit for Voluntary Reductions legislation does not \nintroduce, encourage, or suggest in any way the need for a regulatory \nprogram--the fact remains that none of us can predict what will happen \nscientifically or politically on the climate change issue over the next \nseveral years or decades.\n  In the face of this policy uncertainty, it is easy to understand why \nmany corporate leaders and small businessmen alike are reluctant to \ntake big steps--even if certain voluntary actions improve their bottom \nline. Business leaders, with history as their guide, are worried that \ntheir own government will discount or not credit these good, but \nvoluntary deeds under some potential, future regulatory regime.\n  They fear that, after all is said and done, they will have been \nforced to spend twice as much to control pollutants as their laggard \ncompetitors. In the face of this uncertainty, business may be inclined \nto wait to reduce emissions until after the diplomatic, political, and \nregulatory dust has cleared. Meanwhile, billions more tons of \ngreenhouse gases are released by man into\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nthe atmosphere every year--and important, cost-effective opportunities \nto reduce emissions may be lost.\n  It is this uncertainty, this regulatory and financial risk, that our \nlegislation is intended to diminish.\n  The proposal clears the way for voluntary projects that otherwise \nmight not go forward. It is designed to reduce the current uncertainty \nand risk faced by potentially regulated entities to the government. \nThis legislation gets the government out of the way so that the \nmarketplace may determine new and cost-effective ways to do business \nwhile emitting less.\n  How does the legislation work? We authorize the President to enter \ninto greenhouse gas reduction agreements with entities operating in the \nUnited States.\n  Once executed, these agreements will provide credits for voluntary \ngreenhouse gas reductions and sequestration achieved by domestic \nentities over the voluntary period. Because we do not know when, if \never, the U.S. will impose emission reductions, we do not know the \nduration of the actual voluntary period. The bill does, however, \nestablish a 10-year sunset on the voluntary crediting period.\n  An entity earns one-for-one credit if it reduces its aggregate \nemissions from U.S. sources below the applicable baseline for the \nduration of the voluntary period. On the sequestration side, the entity \ncould offset emissions, and potentially earn credits thereby, if it \nincreases its net sequestration above the applicable sequestration \nbaseline during the voluntary period.\n  While I expect a great deal of debate on the establishment of \nbaselines, and likely some significant changes, we wanted to initiate \nthe debate by establishing a baseline that uses recent historical \nemissions data. In the bill as introduced, we suggest an averaged \nbaseline made up by actual emission levels from 1996 through 1998.\n  Mr. President, while I have an open mind on how we establish \nbaselines or other performance measurements in this measure, I want to \nbe clear that I will insist on a benchmark that is fair for business \nand that is environmentally sound. Clearly, we will be required to deal \nwith continued business growth in this bill. That is, how to achieve \nclear environmental gains under this voluntary approach while still \ncrediting the good deeds of growing and changing industries.\n\n  There are other key issues, important details, that we will need to \npin down in the coming weeks. To ensure the economic and environmental \nintegrity of this program, it is incumbent upon us to require that the \ngovernment credits are issued for verifiable and legitimate actions \nthat contribute to climate stabilization. If a credit represents a ton \nof greenhouse gases in some future marketplace, or as an offset to some \nfuture regulatory obligation, than it must be a ton reduced or \nsequestered, not a phantom thereof.\n  We will also be careful to establish a system that recognizes past \nactivities, that is, climate mitigation projects that have occurred \nsince the early 1990's, that clearly can be shown to be measurable \nemission reduction or sequestration actions.\n  The recognition of both overseas and sequestration activities also \npresent some unique challenges if we are to maintain a true \nenvironmental program that happens to be voluntary. But the development \nof carbon sinks and overseas emission reduction projects also provide \ntremendous opportunities to address potential climate change in a cost-\neffective and whole way. If we are going to meet the challenges before \nus on global change, we will do so with all of the tools that science \ntells us are available.\n  Mr. President, I could not be more pleased that we have been able to \nestablish both business and environmental allies for this cause. \nLeading companies from the electric utility sector, a number of \npetroleum and natural gas companies, important automakers, agriculture, \nthe cement makers, aluminum, chemicals, forestry, and other energy \nintensive industries recognize what is at stake here and are working \nwith us to represent their interests. Many of them are also making \ngreat strides to benefit the global environment and they should be \nappropriately recognized.\n  One important area that we will need to spend some time on is the \nproduct manufacturing sector. I recognize that appliance, air \nconditioning, and many product manufacturers believe that credits must \nbe available for their voluntary improvements in energy efficiency and \nother actions which directly and indirectly reduce or mitigate \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The legislation is perhaps not as clear as it \nneeds to be on this important issue and I intend to work closely with \nthese growing industries and other interested parties to address it.\n  Our environmental allies recognize that there is an important \nopportunity here to achieve constructive, cost-effective, and voluntary \nstrategies to address the threat of global climate change. Many of them \nrecognize that our legislation is designed to offer a platform to \ndiverse interests, including those with clashing objectives, for moving \nforward to support an initiative through which businesses can serve \ntheir own economic self-interest while bringing about environmental \nimprovement.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are offering today includes very \nfew revisions from the voluntary credits bill (S. 2617) that we \nintroduced last October. This is not because we think we have the \nperfect document--not at all. We need to go through the process--hold \nhearings, continue to meet with industry and the environmental \ncommunity, have discussions with Senate colleagues--before we make any \nsignificant revisions. But we will continue to do those things, and we \nwill make improvements to this important legislation.\n  While I have strong beliefs on the science of climate change and find \nsome significant merits in the Kyoto Protocol--this legislation is \ncompletely agnostic on both. The fact is, this bill creates an ``escrow \naccount'' for any U.S. entity that has made up its own mind to do \nthings to earn emission credits--nothing more and nothing less with \nrespect to ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol or any \nother international or domestic regulatory program.\n  The issue of global climate change is serious business. While the \ninternational and domestic processes play out over the next period of \nyears, let us move forward with sensible, cost-effective, voluntary \nincentives. What is the alternative?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record. Finally, I encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at \nthis initiative, to talk with their constituents, and to consider \nworking with us to improve and advance good, bipartisan, and voluntary \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                 S. 547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Chafee, Lieberman, and others, in introducing the \nCredit for Voluntary Early Action Act. This measure is an important \nfirst step towards reducing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding any \npossible regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill will \nprovided us a valuable platform for a thorough discussion of this \nimportant issue and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in our \nefforts.\n  In my state of Florida, we learned long ago that a healthy \nenvironment is fundamentally necessary for a healthy economy. This is \nevidenced by our congressional delegation's historic bipartisan \nconsensus on such important national issues as the protection of the \nFlorida Everglades and our efforts to stop oil and gas exploration off \nour beaches. The citizens of my state know full well how necessary it \nis we keep our environment clean and pristine.\n  I'm proud to stand with my colleagues here today and take Florida's \ncommon sense, market-based attitude on the environment to the national \nlevel. The legislation we're sponsoring today would encourage and \nreward voluntary actions businesses take to reduce the emission of \npotentially harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.\n  Under our bill, the President would be authorized to provide \nregulatory credit to companies who take early voluntary action to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. This credit could be used to comply \nwith future regulatory\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nrequirements and--in a market-based approach--traded or sold to other \ncompanies as they work to meet their own environmental obligations.\n  Participants in this innovative program would agree to annually \nmeasure, track and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions. Credit \ngiven would be one-for-one, based on actual reductions below an agreed-\nupon baseline. Credits issued under the program would be subtracted \nfrom total emissions allowed under future regulatory emissions \nrequirements.\n  I believe this approach makes sense for many reasons. For one, there \nare many uncertainties surrounding the issue of greenhouse gas \nemissions and their relation to global warming. The complexities and \nuncertainties associated with understanding the interactions of our \nclimate, our atmosphere and the impact of human behavior are enormous. \nI have my own concerns about the science behind this issue, and have \ntremendous concerns about the regulatory approach outlined in last \nyear's Kyoto agreement. It is not my intent--in cosponsoring this \nbill--to validate Kyoto or the underlying science. Those issues are \nbest left to the scientists and future congresses. Today, we are simply \ntrying to clear the way for voluntary emissions-reductions projects \nthat would otherwise be delayed for years. And we accomplish this in a \nway that is not costly to the taxpayers.\n  It makes sense to provide appropriate encouragement to businesses who \nwant to invest in improved efficiency--those who want to find ways to \nmake cars, factories and power production cleaner. Under our bill, \nthese companies are encouraged--not based on government fiat or \nhandout--to get credit for their own initiative and problem solving \nskills.\n  Another reason I believe this legislation would be beneficial is \nbecause today's businesses have no control over the regulations that \ncould be required of them down the road. Although today's Congress has \nno desire to legislate requirements on greenhouse gases such as carbon \ndioxide, it is extremely difficult to predict where the scientific and \neconomic data will carry future policymakers. In my view, it makes \nsense to encourage businesses to be proactive in protecting themselves \nfrom any future restrictions enacted by a more regulatory-minded \nCongress and administration.\n  Mr. President, all of us agree that a healthy environment is \nimportant to our future. It's time to put partisanship aside and solve \nour environmental problem in a way that will allow business to be in \ncontrol of their own future while doing their part to address global \nwarming. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions they take \nnow, businesses can be prepared for any regulations in the future.\n  I look forward to beginning an earnest debate about this issue with \nmy colleagues in the United States Senate. I believe we have an \ninnovative approach to confronting as issue fraught with uncertainties. \nWe should be looking to solve more of our problems by using our free \nmarket philosophy rather than by costly Washington mandates that my not \nwork. The Credit for Voluntary Early Reductions Act is responsible \neffort to validate on the national level what we've always known in \nFlorida: a healthy environment is key to a healthy economy.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join today with my \ncolleagues Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and Senators Mack, Warner, Moynihan, Reid, Wyden, \nJeffords, Biden, Baucus, and Collins in introducing this important \nlegislation. The point of this bi-partisan legislation is simple. It \nwill provide credit, under any future greenhouse gas reduction systems \nwe choose to adopt, to companies who act now to reduce their emissions. \nThis is a voluntary, market-based approach that is a win-win situation \nfor both American businesses and the environment.\n  Many companies want to move forward now to reduce their greenhouse \ngas emissions. They don't want to wait until legislation requires them \nto make these reductions. For some companies reducing greenhouse gases \nmakes good economic sense because adopting cost-effective solutions can \nactually save them money by improving the efficiency of their \noperations. Companies recognize that if they reduce their greenhouse \ngas emissions now they will be able to add years to any potential \ncompliance schedule, allowing them to spread their investment costs \nover a longer span of time. Under this legislation, businesses will \nhave the flexibility to innovate and develop expertise regarding the \nmost cost-effective ways in which their particular company can become \npart of the solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This bill ensures that companies will be credited in future reduction \nproposals for actions taken now, thereby removing impediments \npreventing some voluntary efforts that would provide large \nenvironmental benefits. Focusing American ingenuity on early reductions \nwill also help stimulate the search for and use of new, innovative \nstrategies and technologies that are needed to enable companies both in \nthis country and worldwide meet their reduction requirements in a cost-\neffective manner. Development of such strategies and technologies will \nimprove American competitiveness in the more than $300 billion global \nenvironmental marketplace.\n  Early action by U.S. companies will begin creating very important \nenvironmental benefits now. By providing the certainty necessary to \nencourage companies to move forward with emission reductions, this \nlegislation will lead to immediate reductions in greenhouse gas \npollution. Once emitted, many greenhouse gases continue to trap heat in \nthe atmosphere for a century or more. Early reductions can begin to \nslow the rate of buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping \nto minimize the environmental risks of continued global warming. It \njust makes sense to encourage practical action now.\n  The bill will help us deal with the serious threat posed by global \nclimate change. Emissions of greenhouse gases that result from human \nactivity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, are causing \ngreenhouse gases to accumulate in the atmosphere above natural levels. \nMore than 2,500 of the world's best scientific and technical experts \nhave concluded that this increase threatens to change the balance of \ntemperature and precipitation that we rely on for a host of economic \nand societal activities. The American Geophysical Union, a professional \nsociety comprised 35,000 geoscientists, recently stated that ``present \nunderstanding of the Earth climate system provides a compelling basis \nfor legitimate public concern over future global- and regional-scale \nchanges resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.''\n  We recently learned from scientists that 1998 was the hottest year on \nrecord and that nine of the hottest ten years occurred in the past \ndecade. Scientists believe that a rise in global temperature may in \nturn result in sea level rise and changes in weather patterns, food and \nfiber production, human health, and ecosystems. Beyond the science that \nwe know, our common sense tells us that the risks associated with \nclimate change are serious. Weather-related disasters already cost our \neconomy billions of dollars every year.\n  The climate agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 was an historic \nagreement that provided the foundation for an international solution to \nclimate change. The protocol included important provisions, fought for \nby American negotiators, aimed at establishing real targets and \ntimetables for achieving emissions reductions and providing flexibility \nand market mechanisms for reducing compliance costs as we work to limit \nour emissions of greenhouse gases. In Buenos Aires last year, the \ninternational community began developing the details of the protocol. I \nhad the privilege of participating as a Senate observer at both the \nKyoto and Buenos Aires climate change conventions. I was particularly \nencouraged that developing countries, including Argentina and \nKazakstan, indicated their willingness in Buenos Aires to limit the \ngrowth of their greenhouse gas emissions. Nations of the world are all \ncoming to recognize that climate change is an issue of grave \ninternational concern and that all members of the global community must \nparticipate in solving the problem.\n  Unfortunately, the current atmosphere in Congress is such that some\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nwould block any steps related to climate change until the Kyoto \nprotocol is ratified by the Senate. President Clinton has said he will \nnot submit the Kyoto protocol for ratification until developing \ncountries demonstrate meaningful participation. I am encouraged by the \nprogress made in Buenos Aires and am proud that the United States, by \nsigning the protocol, is committed to a leadership role in the global \neffort to protect our Earth's irreplaceable natural environment. But to \ndefer debate and action on any proposal that might reduce greenhouse \ngases until after Senate consideration of the protocol is to deny the \nUnited States the ability to act in its own economic and environmental \nself-interest. The issue at stake is how to develop an insurance policy \nto protect us against the danger of climate change. Regardless of our \nindividual views on the Kyoto protocol, we in Congress must focus our \ndebate on the issue of climate change and work to forge agreement on \nhow we can move forward. Unfortunately, we have done too little to \nattack the escalating emissions of greenhouse gases which threaten our \nhealth, our safety and our homes.\n  I'm particularly pleased that the legislation grows out of principles \ndeveloped in a dialogue between the Environmental Defense Fund and a \nnumber of major industries. I am encouraged that since the introduction \nof a similar version of this bill last year, we have received many \nconstructive comments from those in the business and environmental \ncommunities. Many good suggestions are on the table now and we expect \nthat many are yet to come; we welcome broad participation as we move \nforward on this legislation. I am committed to working through some of \nthe important issues that have been raised. Indeed, I believe that it \nwill be through the ongoing constructive participation of the widest \nspectrum of stakeholders that we will enact a law that catalyzes \nAmerican action on climate change and delivers on the promise of \ncrediting voluntary early actions.\n  I hope that my colleagues and their constituents will take an honest \nand hard look at this initiative and consider working with us to \nimprove and advance good legislation that begins to address the \nprofound threat of global climate change. This legislation alone will \nnot protect us from the consequences of climate change, but it is a \nconstructive and necessary step in the right direction. I believe that \nit is crucial that we begin to address the important issue of climate \nchange now because we have a moral obligation to leave our children and \ngrandchildren a vibrant, healthy, and productive planet and thriving \nglobal economy.\n  Mr. President, the debate about climate change is too often vested--\nand I believe wrongly so--in false choices between scientific findings, \ncommon sense, business investments and environmental awareness. The \napproach of this bill again demonstrates that these are not mutually \nexclusive choices, but highly compatible goals.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring \nlegislation introduced today by Senator Chafee and my other colleagues \nto establish a voluntary incentive-based program to reduce the \nemissions of greenhouse gases.\n  This is an innovative concept that is in its formative stages. I am \npleased to join in support of the concept of providing binding credits \nfor industries who can verify reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. \nWhile there are significant issues that must be resolved in the final \nversion of this legislation, I believe this voluntary approach has \nsignificant potential to encourage real reductions in greenhouse gas \nemissions. I look forward, as a member of the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works, to actively participating in the further development \nof this legislation.\n  Mr President, I also want to make clear that my support for this \nlegislation does not indicate a change in my position on the Protocol \non Global Climate Change--the Kyoto Protocol. I continue to strongly \nfeel that the protocol is fatally flawed, and in its current form, \nshould not be ratified by the Senate. My objections to this \ninternational agreement have been stated many times before. The \nagreement does not include appropriate involvement by key developing \nnations and it sets unachievable timetables for emissions reductions by \ndeveloped nations. I am concerned that the end result would be \nunrealistic emission reduction requirements imposed on the United \nStates without appropriate reductions assigned to other countries, and \nthat in the end the United States economy would be severely impacted.\n  The legislation I am supporting today does not endorse the Kyoto \nprotocol or call for a regulatory program to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. This legislation simply ensures that if the private sector \ntakes important steps today to achieve reductions in their emissions, \nthen these actions will be credited to them if there is a mandatory \nreduction program in the future.\n  Now, Mr. President, how we devise a legislative package that provides \nthese credits and verifies if emissions are reduced will require \nsignificant discussions through the Committee's hearing process. For my \npart, I am enthusiastic about a successful resolution of these many \nissues. I look forward to particularly working to ensure that \nappropriate credit is provided for substantial carbon storage. Any \nlegislative effort must recognize the important role of carbon \nsequestration in determining emission reduction strategies.\n  This bill is about protecting United States companies that have or \nare interested in taking voluntary steps to lower their output of \ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These companies have \nrequested the protection this bill provides and I intend to work \nclosely with Senator Chafee and others to deliver it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues today in \nintroducing the Credit for Voluntary Reductions Act of 1999. I am \npleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The bill represents a far sighted effort to encourage early \nreductions of greenhouse gases. Under our program, companies in a wide \nrange of industries may participate in a voluntary, market-based system \nof credit by making measurable reductions in greenhouse gases.\n  We have learned from our experience with implementing the 1990 Clean \nAir Act Amendments that the use of market-based incentives is the most \ncost-efficient, effective way to encourage corporate responsibility \nwith respect to air emissions. Credit based systems have proven to \neffect emissions reductions which are larger than anticipated, at \nsignificantly lesser cost. The program laid out in our bill will remove \nmarket disincentives to taking action on greenhouse gas emissions and \nreward the initiative and innovation in the corporate sector.\n  My good friend Senator Chafee has highlighted today what is perhaps \nthe most important issue facing any climate change legislation. While \nthere is growing scientific certainty that human actions may eventually \ncause harmful disturbances to our climate system, no one is sure what \nmay be done in the future to mitigate the effects of any atmospheric \ndisruptions. The legislative and diplomatic proposals are myriad. \nUncertainty over how climate change will be addressed, if at all, is a \nformidable hurdle to corporate actions which may begin to mitigate the \nproblem. By simply establishing a system of credits which may be used \nat a later time to document emissions reductions, our bill begins to \naddress this issue of uncertainty and provide incentives for positive \naction on emissions reductions.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this innovative \nlegislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support our efforts.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, climate change poses potential real \nthreats to Vermont, the Nation, and the World. While we cannot yet \npredict the exact timing, magnitude, or nature of these threats, we \nmust not let our uncertainty lead to inaction.\n  Preventing climate change is a daunting challenge. It will not be \nsolved by a single bill or a single action. As we do not know the \nextent of the threat, we also do not know the extent of the solution. \nBut we cannot let our lack of knowledge lead to lack of action. We must \nstart today. Our first steps will be hesitant and imperfect, but they \nwill be a beginning.\n  Today I am joining Senator Chafee, Senator Mack, Senator Lieberman \nand a host of others in cosponsoring the Credit for Early Action Act in \nthe United States Senate.\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\n  Credit for Early Action gives incentives to American businesses to \nvoluntarily reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. Properly \nconstructed, Credit for Early Action will increase energy efficiency, \npromote renewable energy, provide cleaner air, and help reduce the \nthreat of possible global climatic disruptions. It will help industry \nplan for the future and save money on energy. It rewards companies for \ndoing the right thing--conserving energy and promoting renewable \nenergy. Without Credit for Early Action, industries which do the right \nthing run the risk of being penalized for having done so. We introduce \nthis bill as a signal to industry: you will not be penalized for \nincreasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy, you \nwill be rewarded.\n  In writing this bill, Senators Chafee, Mack, and Lieberman have done \nan excellent job with a difficult subject. I am cosponsoring the Credit \nfor Early Action legislation as an endorsement for taking a first step \nin the right direction. I will be working with my colleagues throughout \nthis Congress to strengthen this legislation to ensure that it strongly \naddresses the challenges that lie ahead. The bill must be changed to \nguarantee that our emissions will decrease to acceptable levels, and \nguarantee that credits will be given out equitably. These modifications \ncan be summarized in a single sentence: credits awarded must be \nproportional to benefits gained. This goal can be achieved through two \nadditions: a rate-based performance standard and a cap on total \nemissions credits.\n  The rate-based performance standard is the most important item. A \nrate-based standard gives credits to those companies which are the most \nefficient in their class--not those that are the biggest and dirtiest \nto begin with. Companies are rewarded for producing the most product \nfor the least amount of emissions. Small and growing companies would \nhave the same opportunities to earn credits as large companies. This \nsystem would create a just and equitable means of awarding emissions \ncredits to companies which voluntarily increase their energy efficiency \nand renewable energy use.\n  The second item is an adjustable annual cap on total emissions \ncredits. An adjustable annual cap allows Congress to weigh the number \nof credits given out against the actual reduction in total emissions. \nSince the ultimate goal is to reduce U.S. emissions, this provision \nwould allow a means to ensure that we do not give all of our credits \naway without ensuring that our emissions levels are actually \ndecreasing.\n  With these two additions, Credit for Early Action will bring great \nrewards to our country, our economy, and our environment. It will save \nmoney, give industry the certainty to plan for the future, and promote \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy, all while reducing our risk \nfrom climate change. This legislation sends the right message: \ncompanies will be rewarded for doing the right thing--increasing energy \nefficiency and renewable energy use.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this important legislation. In particular, I want to thank \nSenator Chafee for his foresight and leadership on this most difficult \nissue. The science, politics, and economics of climate change all \npresent major issues, and only someone as dedicated and tenacious as \nSenator Chafee could provide the leadership to get us to this point \ntoday. My good friend, Joe Lieberman, who has been another leader in \nthe Senate on this tough issue, and Connie Mack, deserve our thanks for \nbringing us together around this first step in the long path toward \nmanaging the problem of climate change.\n  The science of climate change is sufficiently advanced that we know \nwe face a threat to our health and economy; but we are only beginning \nto come to grips with how we can manage that threat most effectively, \nand--this is the key--most efficiently. Climate change presents us with \na classic problem in public policy--it is a long-term threat, not \ncompletely understood, to the widest possible public. And it is an \nissue whose resolution will require taking steps now with real costs to \nprivate individuals and businesses, costs that have a payoff that may \nonly be fully apparent a generation or more in the future.\n  Mr. President, we have learned a lot in the years that we have been \nmaking federal environmental policy here in the United States. We have \nmuch more to learn, but we have made real advances since the early \ndays, when we did not always find the solutions that got us the most \nenvironmental quality for the buck. The bill we are introducing today \nreflects one important lesson: businesses can be a creative and \nresponsible part of the solution to environmental problems. In fact, it \nis fair to say that we would not be here today if it were not for the \nleadership of groups like the International Climate Change Partnership \nand the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, both of which have \nprovided a forum for responsible businesses to reach consensus on this \nissue. Significantly, it was a leading environmental group, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, that has provided indispensible technical \nexpertise to turn good intentions into the bill we have here today.\n  Drawing on our experience with tradable sulphur dioxide credits, this \nbill looks to the day when we have reached the kind of agreement--\nwhether based on our evolving commitments under the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change or some other authority--that \nestablishes an emissions credit trading regime for greenhouse gases. \nThe best science--and political reality--tells us that current rates of \ngreenhouse gas emissions are likely to result not only in measurable \nchange in global temperatures, but also in a public demand to do \nsomething about it. That in turn will change the cost of doing business \nas usual for the industries that are major sources of those gases.\n  But right now, if responsible firms--like DuPont and General Motors, \nif I can mention just two that operate in Delaware--want to do \nsomething to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they not only get no \ncredit in any future trading system--they actually lose out to firms \nthat decide to delay reductions until such a system is in place. Those \nwho procrastinate, under current law, not only avoid the cost today of \ncleaning up their emissions, but they would be in a position to receive \ncredits for the kinds of cheaper, easier steps that more responsible \ncompanies have already taken. This is certainly not the way to \nencourage actions now that help air quality in the short term. And \nevery action we take now, by reducing the long-term concentrations of \ngreenhouse gases that would otherwise occur, lowers the overall \neconomic impact of complying with any future climate change policy.\n  One way out of this problem, Mr. President, is the bill we are \nintroducing today--to assure firms who act responsibly today that their \ninvestments in a better future for all of us will be eligible for \ncredit. At the same time, we will thereby raise the cost of delay.\n  As with so much in the issue of climate change, this bill is a work \nin progress. Different kinds of firms, with different products, \nprocesses, and histories, face significantly different problems in \ncomplying with the demands of an early credit system. We must be sure \nthat we provide the flexibility to encourage the widest variety of \nreductions. And while we want to encourage the greatest reductions as \nsoon as possible, we must be sure that we have the best information--\nand credible verification--on the effects of various kinds of early \naction. Without accurate verification and reporting, we cheapen the \nvalue of actions taken by the most responsible firms.\n  This bill marks a real change in our approach to climate change: we \nhave moved beyond the days of heated, irreconcilable arguments between \nthose who see climate change as a real threat and those who don't. Now, \ncooler heads can discuss the best way to face the future that we are \nbuilding for our children.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof this important legislation.\n  This bill is a good beginning for a discussion in the Senate on how \nwe can begin to develop constructive solutions to the problem of global \nclimate change.\n  Climate change is real. Over the last 130 years, since the beginning \nof the Industrial Revolution, global average surface temperatures have \nincreased by one degree. Scientists project that this trend will \ncontinue and most of them\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nbelieve the trend is due to increases in carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gas emissions from human activity. The temperature increase \nmay not sound like much, but the consequences of even such a small \nglobal change could be enormous. This warming trend could have many \neffects, including even more unpredictable weather patterns, and major \nshifts in agricultural soils and productivity and wildlife habitat. To \nme, that drives home the need to deal with the problem.\n  As I have mentioned to some of my colleagues, there is a vivid \nexample of the warming in my home state of Montana. The Grinnell \nGlacier in Glacier National Park has retreated over 3,100 feet over the \npast century. If this continues, Park Service scientists predict this \n10,000 year old glacier will be entirely gone within 30 years. This \nglacier is a symbol and treasure to Montanans and its disappearance \nwould be a hard thing to explain to our children and their children.\n  This and other potential consequences of climate change are serious \nenough to warrant some action to reduce the threat it poses. The bill \nwe are introducing today will hopefully be an incentive for people to \ntake steps toward reducing the threat. This bill, the Credit for \nVoluntary Early Action Act, would allow those who voluntarily choose to \nreduce emissions of greenhouse gases or to ``sequester'' them (meaning \nto keep them out of the atmosphere and in the soil or locked up in \ntrees or plants) to get credit for those efforts. At some point in the \nnear future, these credits are expected to have monetary value and \ncould be sold in a domestic or global trading system.\n  As my cosponsors acknowledge, this is not a perfect bill, but a \ncomplicated work in progress. As the Senate considers this matter, I am \nparticularly interested in seeing how agriculture and forestry might \nbenefit by participating in a credit system. These credits could be a \nfinancial reward for the good stewardship already taking place on \nAmerica's farmland. Agriculture needs every opportunity to pursue \nmarkets, even if we're talking about unconventional products like \ncarbon credits, to help with the bottom line.\n  We already know that crop residue management and conservation tillage \nvastly improve carbon storage in soils and have side benefits, such as \nreducing erosion. Soils have an immense potential for locking up carbon \nso that it enters the atmosphere more gradually. Returning highly \nerodible cropland to perennial grasses could prove to be similarly \neffective. Many of these practices are already an important part of \nprecision agriculture, so would be obvious low-cost ways for farmers \nand ranchers to earn credits. It is important that the rules of any \ntrading system be written right, so they can work for agriculture. We \ncan't let our international competitors, like Canada or Australia, be \nthe only ones writing the rules in this developing market.\n  Besides rewarding those who are willing to take early actions and \nmove beyond normal business practices to address climate change, let's \nstart to think outside the box about what else we can do. The U.S. has \nthe most advanced environmental technology sector in the world. From \nnew uses for agricultural waste and products to state-of-the-art \npollution controls, we are leaders in improving efficiency and reducing \nwaste. We need to jump start our public and private research and \ndevelopment structure so that it really focuses on new cost-effective \nproducts and systems that produce less greenhouse gas to meet a global \ndemand.\n  The Administration's Climate Change Technology Initiative is a \nreasonable first step. But, so far, Congress has approached this issue \nwith a business as usual attitude. It's time to get serious and \ncreative about developing more advanced technologies. We should be \nreviewing all the tools at our disposal, from research and development \nprograms to taxes.\n  We need to make this investment in our environmental future for the \nsame reasons that we make investments in our economic future. People \nprepare for retirement because they want to reduce risks and reduce the \ncost of responding to future problems. For similar reasons, we need to \nmake prudent investments like providing credit for early action, to \nreduce risks and reduce the cost of responding to future climate change \nproblems. The more time we let go by, and the longer we let greenhouse \ngas concentrations rise unchecked, the more expensive the future's \nrepair bills could be.\n  There is still a long way to go with any climate change treaty. There \nmust be real participation by the developing countries, like China, \nIndia, Brazil, etc. Carbon trading rules and the role of agriculture in \nsequestering carbon must be more clearly defined. In the meantime, \nhowever, the bill we're introducing will allow us to see what works and \nto get a leg up on the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, this bill starts an important dialogue about our \ncountry's contribution to world greenhouse gas concentrations. Make no \nmistake, there is still a lot of work ahead for all of us to make this \nbill a reality. But this country cannot afford to play the part of the \nostrich with its head in the sand. We must seriously engage this \nmatter. We owe it to our children.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the efforts of my \ncolleague Senator Chafee for the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act \nhe has introduced that will encourage the reduction of greenhouse gases \ninto the atmosphere. The concept of this bill is a creative step toward \nawarding those industries who take early actions to reduce their \noverall emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, \nwhich are thought to be causing changes in climate around the globe.\n  The bill would set up a domestic program that gives companies certain \ncredits for the voluntary actions they take for reducing the amount of \ngreenhouse gases they emit into the air. These credits could then be \nused in meeting future reductions, or could be sold to other companies \nto help with their own reductions. Strong incentives would also be \nprovided for those companies developing innovative technologies that \nwill help reduce the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases.\n  The Chafee bill clearly puts us at the starting line in the 106th \nCongress for addressing the continuous domestic buildup of greenhouse \ngases. I do feel the bill needs to take a further step in the race to \nmake our planet more environmentally and economically friendly, \nhowever. We need to establish domestic credits for carbon sequestration \nthat will help reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and \nthereby help to address the complex issue of climate change. I plan to \ncontinue to work with Senator Chafee to take that next step.\n  Maine is one of the country's most heavily forested states, with much \nof its land devoted to forests, and so has much to offer towards the \nreduction of carbon in our atmosphere. The State's forestlands have \nbeen a large key to our quality of life and economic prosperity. These \nforests absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, allowing the \nsignificant sequestration of carbon, serving as carbon ``sinks''.\n  Because of continuous improvements made in forest management \npractices and through extensive tree replanting programs, forests all \nover the country continue to sequester significant amounts of carbon. \nThrough active forest management and reforestation, through both \nnatural and artificial regeneration, the private forests, both \nindustrial and non-industrial, are helping to decrease carbon dioxide \nemissions that are occurring both from natural processes and human \nactivities into the atmosphere.\n  The addition of credits for greenhouse gas reductions for forestry-\nrelated carbon sequestration activities should be a part of the \nvoluntary credits system the bill proposes so as to allow the owners of \nthe forests of today--and tomorrow--to voluntarily participate and \nreceive credits for carbon sequestration. This should not be difficult \nto do since the U.S. Forest Service already follows a carbon stock \nmethodology that is used by the Environmental Protection Agency to \ndocument the nation's carbon dioxide emissions and inventories for \ncarbon storage.\n  I realize that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nhas been tasked to prepare a special report that is expected out next \nyear that may help define appropriate definitions and accounting rules \nfor carbon sinks. In the meantime, I do not believe it will be helpful \nto leave the issue of carbon sequestration unacknowledged in any \ndomestic program--and to cause\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nlosers along with winners in the process. We are all in a race against \nan uncertainty that no one can afford to lose.\n  As I mentioned, I believe that the goals of the Chafee bill are \nadmirable and will allow for a dialogue to begin, hopefully on the \nscience as opposed to the politics, for what can be done domestically \nwithin the global climate change debate. I hope to be included as a \npart of that dialogue and urge that those who speak to carbon \nsequestration credits be heard through the public hearings process or \nby amending the bill in a way that will not only encourage sustainable \nforest management, but also stimulate incentives for maintaining \nhealthy forests. The discussion on the importance of carbon \nsequestration within our terrestrial ecosystems--long a large component \nof the climate change debate--must continue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 548. A bill to establish the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort \nMiamis National Historical Site in the State of Ohio; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                           FALLEN TIMBERS ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould designate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort Miamis as \nNational Historic Sites.\n  Mr. President, the Battle of Fallen Timbers is an early and important \nchapter in the settlement of what was then known as the Northwest \nTerritory. This important battle occurred between the U.S. army, led by \nGeneral ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne, and a confederation of Native American \ntribes led by Tecumseh, in 1794. More than 1,000 Indians ambushed \nGeneral Wayne's troops as they progressed along the Maumee River. \nDespite an unorganized defense, U.S. troops forced the tribes to \nretreat. The Treaty of Greenville was signed in 1795, and it granted \nthe city of Detroit to the United States as well as secured the safe \npassage along the Ohio River for frontier settlers.\n  The Battle of Fallen Timbers began Ohio's rich history in the \nformation of our country. And the citizens of Northwest Ohio are \ncommitted to preserving that heritage. The National Register of \nHistoric Places already lists Fort Miamis. In 1959, the Battle of \nFallen Timbers was included in the National Survey of Historic Sites \nand Buildings and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in \n1960. In 1998, the National Park Service completed a Special Resource \nStudy examining the proposed designation and suitability of the site \nand determined that the Battle of Fallen Timbers Battlefield site meets \nthe criteria for affiliated area status. So it remains only for \nCongress to officially recognize the national significance of these \nsites.\n  My legislation would recognize and preserve the 185-acre Fallen \nTimbers Battlefield site. It would uphold the heritage of U.S. military \nhistory and Native American culture during the period of 1794 through \n1813. It would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in the preparation and implementation of the Plan to the \nState, its political subdivisions, or specified nonprofit organization.\n  Mr. President, the people of Northwest Ohio are committed to \npreserving the heritage of their community, the State of Ohio, and the \nUnited States. Therefore, the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort \nMiamis sites deserve national historical recognition for the history \nthat they represent. For these reasons, I am proposing this important \npiece of legislation today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage school construction and rehabilitation through the creation \nof a new class of bond, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n          THE EXPAND AND REBUILD AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprovide a tax credit for the bond holders of public school construction \nbonds, totaling $1.4 billion each year for two years. To qualify to use \nthe bonds, the bill requires schools to be subject to state academic \nachievement standards and have an average elementary student-teacher \nratio of 28 to one.\n  Bonds could be used if school districts meet one of three criteria:\n  (1) The school is over 30 years old or the bonds will be used to \ninstall advanced or improved, telecommunications equipment;\n  (2) Student growth rate will be at least 10 percent over the next 5 \nyears; or\n  (3) The construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet natural \ndisaster requirements.\n  The bill is the companion of H. R. 415, introduced by my California \ncolleague, Representative Loretta Sanchez.\n  The bonding authority can leverage additional funds and it offers a \nnew financing tool for our schools that can complement existing funding \nsources in an effort to address the need to repair and upgrade existing \nschools. It offers assistance especially for small and low-income \nschool districts because low-income communities with the most serious \nneeds may have to pay the highest interest rates to issue bonds, if \nthey can be issued at all. Because the bonds provide a tax credit to \nthe bond holder, the bond is supported by the federal treasury, not the \nlocal school district.\n  The nation's schools are crumbling. We have many old schools. One \nthird of the nation's 110,000 schools were built before World War II \nand only about one of 10 schools was built since 1980. More than one-\nthird of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more \nyears old and need to be repaired or replaced. The General Accounting \nOffice has said that nationally we need over $112 billion for \nconstruction and repairs at 80,000 schools.\n  My state needs $26 billion from 1998 to 2008 to modernize and repair \nexisting schools and $8 billion to build schools to meet enrollment \ngrowth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds \nproviding $6.5 billion for school construction.\n  In addition to deteriorating schools, some schools are bursting at \nthe seams because of the huge numbers of students and we can expect \nmore pressure as enrollments rise. The ``Baby Boom Echo'' report by the \nU.S. Department of Education in September 1998, found that between 1988 \nand 2008, public high school enrollment will jump by 26 percent and \nelementary enrollment will go up by 17 percent. In 17 states, there \nwill be a 15 percent increase in the number of public high school \ngraduates. This school year, school enrollment is at a record level, \n52.7 million students.\n  My state faces severe challenges:\n  1. High Enrollment: California today has a K-12 public school \nenrollment at 5.6 million students which represents more students than \n36 states have in total population, all ages. We have a lot of \nstudents.\n  Between 1998 and 2008, when the national enrollment will grow by 4 \npercent, in California, it will escalate by 15 percent, the largest \nincrease in the nation. California's high school enrollment is \nprojected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Each year between \n160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms. \nApproximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools \nin the state during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 \nmillion to 6.8 million.\n  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per \nclass between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student \npopulation. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. \nCalifornia needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years \njust to keep pace with the projected growth.\n  2. Crowding: Our students are crammed into every available space and \nin temporary buildings. Today, 20 percent of our students are in \nportable classrooms. There are 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in \n1998.\n  3. Old Schools: Sixty percent of our schools are over 40 years old. \n87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and repair buildings, \naccording to the General Accounting Office. Ron Ottinger, president of \nthe San Diego Board of Education has said: ``Roofs are leaking, pipes \nare bursting and many classrooms cannot accommodate today's computer \ntechnology.''\n  4. High Costs: The cost of building a high school in California is \nalmost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in \nCalifornia, it is $27 million. In California, our costs are higher than \nother states in part because our schools must be built to withstand \nearthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. \nCalifornia's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to \nconstruction costs. Here's what it costs to build schools in \nCalifornia: an elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school \n(7-8), $12.0 million; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.\n  5. Class Size Reduction: Our state, commendably, is reducing class \nsizes in grades K through 3, but this means we need more classrooms.\n  Here are some examples in California of our construction needs:\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\n  Los Angeles Unified School District got 16,000 additional students \nthis year and expects an 11 percent enrollment growth by 2006. Because \nof overcrowding, they are bussing 13,000 students away from their home \nneighborhoods. For example, Cahuenga Elementary School has 1,500 \nstudents on 40 buses, with some children traveling on the bus two hours \nevery day. Not only is this essentially wasted time for students and an \nexpense of school districts, it means that it is very difficult for \nparents to get to their children's schools for school events and \nteacher conferences.\n  Half of LA Unified's students attend school on a multi-track, year-\nround schedule because of overcrowding. This means their schools cannot \noffer remedial summer school programs for students that need extra \nhelp.\n  Olive View School in Corning Elementary School District, with over 70 \npercent of students in portable classrooms, needs to replace these \naging and inadequate facilities.\n  Fresno Unified School District has a backlog of older schools needing \nrepairs. For example, Del Mar Elementary School has a defective roof. \nChuck McAlexander, Administrator, wrote me: ``The leakage at Del Mar is \nso bad that the plaster ceiling of the corridor was falling and has \nbeen temporarily shored with plywood.''\n  San Bernardino City Unified School District, which is growing at a \nrate of over 1,000 students per year, has 25 schools over 30 years old, \nbuildings needing improved classroom lighting, carpeting, electrical \nsystems, and plumbing. Several schools need air condition so they can \noperate year-round to accommodate burgeoning enrollment.\n  Berkeley High School was built in 1901 and damaged by the 1989 Loma \nPrieta earthquake. They are still trying to raise funds to replace the \nbuilding.\n  Polytechnic High School in Long Beach is over 100 years old and \nhouses 4,200 students. The last repairs were done in 1933. Long Beach \nofficials wrote:\n\n       ``The heating system is in desperate need of replacement \n     with continual breakdowns and the constant need for \n     maintenance. The roofs have exceeded their average life \n     expectancy by 20 years. Flooring and equipment have been \n     damaged several times during the rainy season. There have \n     been instances where classrooms had to be evacuated due to \n     health and safety issues. The electrical systems that were \n     designed for 2,000 students can no longer support the needs \n     of over 4,000 students, especially after taking into account \n     the need for increased technology. The antiquated plumbing \n     system is in desperate need of repair. . . . The entire \n     support infrastructure, water, sewer and drainage facilities \n     are in dire need of replacement as the age of these systems \n     have well exceeded their lifespan.''\n\n  The elementary school in the Borrego Unified School District has a \ndeteriorating water well, with silt and inadequate pressure. The \nmiddle-high school has an intercom and fire alarm system inoperable \nbecause of a collapsed underground cable.\n  In San Diego, 49 schools need roof repairs or replacement. Ninety-one \nelementary schools need new fire alarms and security systems. Mead \nElementary School, which is 45 years old, has clogged and rusted \nplumbing beyond repair, with water pressure so weak that it amounts to \na drip at times.\n  Ethel Phillips Elementary School, age 48, in the Sacramento City \nUnified School District, has dry rot in the classrooms because of water \ndamaged and needs foundation repairs and new painting, to preserve the \nbuilding.\n  Loleta Union School District, which is in an area of seismic \nactivity, needs an overhaul of the wiring to support modern technology.\n  San Pasqual Union School District's only water well is contaminated \nand the 30-year-old roof needs replacement.\n  At the San Miguel Elementary School in San Francisco, the windows are \nrotting and the roof is leaking so badly that they must set out buckets \nevery time it rains.\n  And on and on.\n  School overcrowding places a heavy burden on teachers and students. \nStudies show that the test scores of students in schools in poor \ncondition can fall as much as 11 percentage points behind scores of \nstudents in good buildings. Other studies show improvements of up to 20 \npercent in test scores when students move to a new facility.\n  The point is that improving facilities improves teaching and \nlearning. I hope that this bill will offer some help and most \nimportantly provide new learning opportunities for our students. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n         Summary of Feinstein-Sanchez School Construction Bill\n\n\n                              Tax Credits\n\n       Provides $1.4 billion in tax credits in FY 2000 and $1.4 \n     billion in tax credits in FY 2001 to any bondholder for \n     public elementary and secondary school construction and \n     rehabilitation bonds. Similar to the Qualified Zone Academy \n     Bonds created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, bondholders \n     would receive a tax credit, rather than interest.\n\n\n                            Eligible Schools\n\n       To qualify to use the bonds, students in the schools must \n     be subject to state academic achievement standards and tests;\n       schools must have a program to alleviate overcrowding; the \n     school district must have an average elementary student-\n     teacher ratio of 28 to one at the time of issuance of the \n     bonds; and meet one of the following three criteria:\n       1. The school to be repaired is over 30 years old or the \n     bonds are used to provide advanced or improved \n     telecommunications facilities.\n       2. The student growth rate in the school district will be \n     at least 10 percent over the next 5 years.\n       3. School construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet \n     natural disaster requirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of Cuba continues to commit widespread and well documented \n     human rights abuses in Cuba;\n       Whereas such abuses stem from a complete intolerance of \n     dissent and the totalitarian nature of the regime controlled \n     by Fidel Castro;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba routinely restricts worker's \n     rights, including the right to form independent unions, and \n     employs forced labor, including that by children;\n       Whereas Cuba is bound by the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba has detained scores of \n     citizens associated with attempts to discuss human rights, \n     advocate for free and fair elections, freedom of the press, \n     and others who petitioned the government to release those \n     arbitrarily arrested;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba has recently escalated \n     efforts to extinguish expressions of protest or criticism by \n     passing state measures criminalizing peaceful pro-democratic \n     activities and independent journalism;\n       Whereas the recent trial of peaceful dissidents Vladimiro \n     Rica, Marta Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne, and Rene Gomez \n     Manzano, charged with sedition for publishing a proposal for \n     democratic reform, is indicative of the increased efforts by \n     the Government of Cuba to detain citizens and extinguish \n     expressions of support for the accused;\n       Whereas these efforts underscore that the Government of \n     Cuba has continued relentlessly its longstanding pattern of \n     human rights abuses and demonstrate that it continues to \n     systematically deny universally recognized human rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, the United States should make all \n     efforts necessary to pass a resolution, including introducing \n     such a resolution, criticizing Cuba for its human rights \n     abuses in Cuba, and to secure the appointment of a Special \n     Rapporteur for Cuba.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, last week, the Senate passed a resolution \ncalling for condemnation of the human rights situation in China by the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Commission. I will send to the floor \nshortly a similar resolution condemning the human rights situation in \nCuba which, unfortunately, is considerably worse than the situation in \nChina.\n  This resolution calls on the President to make every effort to pass a \nresolution at the upcoming meeting of the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission criticizing Cuba for its abysmal record on human rights. It \nalso calls for the reappointment of a special rapporteur to investigate \nthe human rights situation in Cuba.\n  Last year, for the first time in many years, no resolution on the \nhuman rights situation in Cuba was passed by the United Nations Human \nRights Commission. Perhaps this was due to the hopes that were raised, \nraised as a result of the Pope's visit to Cuba in January of 1998. \nUnfortunately, there has been a significant worsening of the human \nrights situation in Cuba over the last year.\n  Example: The independent group, Human Rights Watch, states:\n\n       As 1998 drew to a close, Cuba's stepped up persecutions and \n     harassment of dissidents, along with its refusal to grant \n     amnesty to hundreds of remaining political prisoners or \n     reform its criminal code, marked a disheartening return to \n     heavy-handed repression.\n\n  Example: The Cuban Government recently passed a measure known as Law \n80 which criminalizes peaceful prodemocratic activities and independent \njournalism, with penalties, Mr.\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nPresident, of up to 20 years of imprisonment.\n  Example: The State Department, in its recent report on human rights \ndated February 26, 1999, notes that the Government of Cuba continues to \nsystematically violate the fundamental civil and political rights of \nits citizens. Human rights advocates and members of independent \nprofessional associations, including journalists, economists, doctors \nand lawyers, are routinely harassed, threatened, arrested, detained, \nimprisoned and defamed by the Government. All fundamental freedoms are \ndenied to the citizens. In addition, the Cuban Government severely \nrestricts worker rights, including the right to form independent trade \nunions, and employs forced labor, including child labor.\n  Example, and the most recent and continuing example of the horrible \nrepression in Cuba, is the trial of four prominent dissidents--\nVladimiro Roca, Marta Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne, and Rene Gomez \nManzano. These prominent dissidents are now at trial on charges of \nsedition. After being detained for over 18 months for the peaceful \nvoicing of their opinions, the trial of these four brave individuals \nhas drawn international condemnation.\n  To demonstrate the hideous nature of the Castro regime, Marta Beatriz \nRoque has been ill, believed to be suffering from cancer, but has been \ndenied medical attention during her detention.\n  During the trial, authorities have rounded up scores of other \nindividuals, including journalists and dissidents, and jailed them for \nthe duration of the trial. The trial was conducted in complete secrecy, \nwith photographers prevented from even photographing the streets around \nthe courthouse in which the trial was held.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not the type of conduct that we have come to \nexpect in our hemisphere, where Cuba remains the only nondemocratic \ngovernment. This level of repression and complete disregard for \ninternational norms cannot be ignored. The human rights situation in \nCuba calls out for action by the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission.\n  I am going to ask, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record two \neditorials on this subject. But let me read one from the Washington \nPost of this week, March 2, 1999. This editorial says, in part:\n\n       Many of the counties engaged in these contacts with Cuba do \n     so on the basis that by their policy of ``constructive \n     engagement'' they are opening up the regime more effectively \n     to democratic and free-market currents than is the United \n     States by its harder-line policy.\n       The trial of the four provides a good test of this \n     proposition. The four are in the vanguard of Cuba's small \n     nonviolent political opposition. Acquittal would indicate \n     that in this case anyway the authorities are listening to the \n     international appeals for greater political freedom. But if \n     the four are convicted and sentenced, it will show that the \n     regime won't permit any opposition at all. What then will the \n     international crowd have to say about the society-\n     transforming power of their investments?\n\n  Mr. President, last month we voted unanimously to support a similar \nresolution on human rights in Cuba. Unfortunately, as I indicated, the \nsituation in Cuba is worse than in China. The situation in Cuba \ndeserves the full effort of our Government to assure that this \nsituation is not ignored by the international community.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution which is cosponsored \nby Senators Mack, Helms, Torricelli, and DeWine. I also ask unanimous \nconsent, to have printed in the Record the editorial I referenced from \nthe Washington Post of March 2, and an editorial from the Ft. \nLauderdale Sun-Sentinel of March 2.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 1999]\n\n                            The Havana Four\n\n       Vladimiro Roca, Martha Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne, Rene \n     Gomez: Note those names. They are dissidents in Communist-\n     ruled Cuba who went on trial in Havana yesterday. These brave \n     people were jailed a year and a half ago for holding news \n     conferences for foreign journalists and diplomats, urging \n     voters to boycott Cuba's one-party elections, warning \n     foreigners that their investments would contribute to Cuban \n     suffering and criticizing President Fidel Castro's grip on \n     power. For these `offenses' the four face prison sentences of \n     five or six years.\n       Castro Cuba has typically Communist notions of justice. By \n     official doctrine, there are no political prisoners, only \n     common criminals. President Castro rejects the designation of \n     the four, in the international appeals for their freedom, as \n     `prisoners of conscience.' Their trial is closed to the \n     foreign press. Some of their colleagues were reportedly \n     arrested to keep them from demonstrating during the trial.\n       Fidel Castro is now making an energetic effort to recruit \n     foreign businessmen to help him compensate for the trade and \n     investment lost by the continuing American embargo and by \n     withdrawal of the old Soviet subsidies. He is scoring some \n     successes: British Airways, for instance, says it is opening \n     a Havana service. Many of the countries engaged in these \n     contacts with Cuba do so on the basis that by their policy of \n     `constructive engagement' they are opening up the regime more \n     effectively to democratic and free-market currents than is \n     the United States by its harder-line policy.\n       The trial of the four provides a good test of this \n     proposition. The four are in the vanguard of Cuba's small \n     nonviolent political opposition. Acquittal would indicate \n     that in this case anyway the authorities are listening to the \n     international appeals for greater political freedom.

It should be.\n       Vladimiro Roca, Marta Beatriz Rogue, Felix Bonne and Rene \n     Gomez Manzano, spent more than a year in prison before they \n     were charged with a crime. After 19 months of detention, they \n     stand accused of sedition, a stretch even by communist Cuba's \n     standards.\n       The four human rights activitists have done nothing \n     seditious. They did attack the political platform of the \n     Fifth Cuban Communist Party Congress.\n       They called the platform out of touch with reality and said \n     it offered no real solutions--to any of Cuba's complex \n     problems. They volunteered one solution--ditching Cuba's one-\n     party system.\n       For their unsolicited advice in July 1997, the four \n     dissidents found themselves promptly behind bars. They had \n     committed the ``seditious''--not to mention courageous--act \n     of distributing their written criticism to foreign \n     journalists. For their ``crimes,'' prosecutors are asking for \n     six years for Roca, who is the son of well-known communist \n     leader Blas Roca, and five years for the others.\n       The case is one of the most important human rights tests \n     for Cuba in years. On the other hand, Cuba has become more \n     flexible on religious and some economic matters. On the other \n     hand, it has just passed repressive laws for many so-called \n     political crimes.\n       This past weekend, Cuban security forces also rounded up \n     more than half a dozen political dissidents in an apparent \n     attempt to prevent public demonstrations during the trial. \n     Last year, a small group of activists clashed with pro-\n     government forces in Havana during the trial of several \n     lesser-known dissidents.\n       In this latest human rights case, Pope John Paul II, King \n     Juan Carlos of Spain and other world leaders are pressing for \n     the dissidents' release.\n       Even if there are no protest signs outside the courthouse \n     in Havana this week, the world is watching the outcome of \n     this trial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2336-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 58--RELATING TO THE RETIREMENT OF BARRY J.

Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the \nSenate the recent celebration of a special anniversary of one of our \nfinest national treasures and most historic sites--the Vicksburg \nNational Military Park.\n  On February 20, 1999, ceremonies were held at the Vicksburg National \nMilitary Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the establishment of the park. The statues of the first \ntwo superintendents of the park, Stephen D. Lee and William T. Rigby, \nwere rededicated with several of their descendants in attendance.\n  This park was the seventh National Park established, and is the site \nof the campaign and siege of Vicksburg. On February 21, 1899, President \nWilliam McKinley signed the legislation which created the park. \nAlthough originally envisioned to include 4,000 acres, today the park \nis comprised of over 1,800 acres with 1,324 monuments, markers and \ntablets. There are twenty-seven state monuments. In July of this year, \nthe Kentucky monument will be dedicated.\n  The U.S.S. Cairo, a Civil War gunboat, which was sunk by Confederate \nmines just North of Vicksburg on the Yazoo River on December 12, 1862, \nwas raised in 1964 and is displayed at the park as one of the best-\npreserved Vessels of its type.\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n  The park is also the home of Vicksburg National Cemetery, established \nin 1866. Interred on the grounds are over 18,000 Union soldiers, of \nwhich the identities of 12,000 are unknown. Veterans of the Mexican, \nand Spanish-American Wars, World War I and II, and the Korean conflict \nalso rest in the cemetery.\n  Over the past few years, the Senate has supported funding for the \nconstruction of a canopy to protect the U.S.S. Cairo, for the \nrestoration of monuments at the Park which have deteriorated, and for \nthe acquisition of parcels of land that are valuable for the \npreservation and interpretation of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg.\n  I hope Senators will be mindful of the valuable national assets at \nthe Vicksburg National Military Park as the Senate considers funding \nfor the National Park Service in the coming months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks delivered by \nPark Superintendent, William Nichols, and Historian, Terrence Winschel, \nat the re-dedication of the Lee and Rigby monuments be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Remarks of Terrence J. Winschel\n\n       On the hot afternoon of May 22, 1863, General Lee watched \n     in awe as Union troops poured out a ravine 400 yards east of \n     here and deployed into line of battle on a ridge opposite his \n     lines. One Confederate soldier who gazed over the parapets of \n     earth and log recorded for posterity that the Federals \n     deployed into line of battle with man touching man, rank \n     pressing rank, and line supporting line. He could see Union \n     officers riding up and down the lines giving encouragement to \n     their men, making sure that all was set for the advance. He \n     watched as the colors were uncased and caught the breeze \n     above the lines, and listened to the sound of cold steel as \n     the enemy affixed their bayonets in final preparation for the \n     charge. To him the sight was grim, irresistible, yet \n     magnificent in the extreme this pageantry of war.\n       But there was little time for admiration as the blue lines \n     swept across the fields. With a mighty cheer the Federals \n     swarmed up the slopes and into the ditches fronting the \n     Vicksburg defenses. Planting several stands of colors atop \n     the Confederate fortifications, a handful of Union troops \n     entered Railroad Redoubt before you--the city's defenses had \n     been pierced.\n       With calm determination, Stephen D. Lee rode to the point \n     of danger. Exhorting his men to stand their ground in the \n     face of overwhelming numbers, he gathered reinforcements in \n     hand and led the counterattack which drove the Federals back \n     and sealed the breach. It was the most sublime moment of his \n     distinguished military career.\n       Thirty-six years later, this grand soldier of the \n     Confederacy was named Chairman of the Vicksburg National \n     Military Park Commission. He had worked tirelessly by example \n     in the post war era to take Yankees and Rebels and make them \n     Americans. Now he would forge from this bloody field of \n     battle an eternal monument commemorating American valor to \n     remind the generations that would follow of the sacrifices \n     made on their behalf by the men in blue and gray.\n       In recognition of Lee's life of service to his nation and \n     the American people, his fellow commissioner William T. Rigby \n     sought to erect and dedicate within the general's lifetime a \n     monument of bronze on the grounds of this battlefield which \n     he made a shrine. Without Lee's knowledge, Rigby solicited \n     contributions making himself the first donation.\n       In May 1908, veterans of the 22d Iowa Infantry, the very \n     unit which pierced the lines at Railroad Redoubt, assembled \n     in Vicksburg for a reunion and invited General Lee to attend. \n     Although his health was broken, Lee came to Vicksburg and \n     praised his former enemies for their courage and bravery \n     exhibited on that bloody day. Captain Rigby took advantage of \n     Lee's visit and asked the general to pose for a photograph on \n     the spot from which he watched the charge. Lee came to this \n     very place, stood erect with the posture of a soldier, and \n     with his head turned slightly to the north, the fire of \n     younger days returned to his eyes for the final time. Four \n     days later, he died in Vicksburg, a place with which his name \n     is synonymous.\n       The photograph taken that day was the basis for this \n     monument which was dedicated on June 11, 1909. It reminds us \n     today of courage, duty, honor, and stands as an enduring \n     symbol of the love and respect that former enemies had for \n     men turned brothers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Remarks of William O. Nichols on Capt. William T. Rigby\n\n       We are gathered here before the statue of Captain William \n     T. Rigby, the second person to serve as chairman of the Park \n     Commission. In this capacity, Captain Rigby served from 1901 \n     until 1929. . . . Obviously, these were the formative years \n     for the development of this park. It was Captain William \n     Rigby who designed and shaped and molded this park into what \n     we see and what we have here today. Captain Rigby truly was \n     and is the father of this great park.\n       We are delighted to have with us today the granddaughter of \n     Captain Rigby. . . . Isabel Rigby . . . who is 86 years young \n     . . . and who is joining us after just having returned to the \n     United States from a week trip abroad to the Union of South \n     Africa. Park historian Terry Winschel will be next on the \n     program following and he will be followed by Miss Rigby.\n       William Titus Rigby was a native of Red Oak, Iowa. He was \n     only 21 when he enlisted in the Union Army. He was a man of \n     integrity, honesty and decency, and these qualities soon \n     earned him a commission as a second lieutenant. He was later \n     promoted to the rank of captain and it was in that capacity \n     that he served for the balance of the war.\n       After the war, William Rigby returned to his native Iowa \n     and entered Cornell College from which he graduated in 1869. \n     That same year he married Eva Cattron. They enjoyed sixty \n     years of marriage and raised three children: Will, Charlie \n     and Grace. Isabel Rigby who is with us today is the daughter \n     of Charlie.\n       During the time he was in the trenches around Vicksburg in \n     1863 William Rigby certainly could not have ever imagined \n     that some thirty years later he would return to lead the \n     effort to establish a national military park. In 1895 he was \n     elected secretary of the Vicksburg National Military Park \n     Association and for the next four years he travelled across \n     the nation speaking to veterans' groups, legislators and \n     members of Congress to generate support for the park measure. \n     His efforts and those of General Lee were ultimately \n     successful when the legislation was passed by Congress and \n     signed into law by President William McKinley on February 21, \n     1899.\n       The park legislation created a three-man commission to \n     oversee the development and management of the park. All three \n     had to be veterans of the Vicksburg campaign, one had to be a \n     Confederate representative and two were to be Union. General \n     Lee of course was the logical choice to be named the \n     Confederate representative. As Illinois had the largest \n     number of troops engaged in the Vicksburg campaign, James \n     Everest from that State was selected as the second \n     commissioner. Despite all his work on behalf of the \n     association to establish the park, partisan politics reared \n     its ugly head and almost resulted in Captain Rigby not being \n     selected as the third commissioner. But--those who had worked \n     with him now raised such a hue and cry that Secretary Alger \n     ultimately capitulated and named him the third commissioner.\n       Captain Rigby was the only one of the three commissioners \n     who actually moved to Vicksburg. He established his residence \n     and a park office here and subsequently became known as the \n     resident commissioner, busying himself with the acquisition \n     of land, the construction of the tour road and bridges, \n     placing tablets and securing the impressive monuments for \n     which this park is rightly noted. He devoted the last thirty \n     years of his life to make Vicksburg National Military Park \n     the finest in the world. More than any other man, our park \n     today is the result of Captain William Rigby's labors.\n       Perhaps the greatest testimony to William Rigby's service \n     can be found in the letter of resignation written to him by \n     General Lee on November 21, 1901. General Lee's letter reads \n     as follows:\n       ``I felt at the time when Colonel Everest and yourself--by \n     your votes--made me your chairman that it was an act of \n     delicate courtesy extended to me by former antagonists. But, \n     now, dear friend: From the very inception of the park \n     movement, you have been the most active and industrious \n     person connected with the enterprise. You have done more work \n     and put more thought on the great enterprise than any other \n     member or person connected with the park. From this fact I \n     have never failed to agree with you in almost every \n     suggestion or act connected with your management, and I \n     really feel from our association and work you are now the \n     most competent member to be the permanent chairman of the \n     commission. I therefore tender to you my resignation as \n     chairman of the commission and request that you assume all \n     the duties of the office as permanent chairman.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Remarks of William O. Nichols on Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee\n\n       Welcome. I am Park Supt Bill Nichols. We are gathered here \n     this day to pay homage to two gentlemen who played a \n     prominent role in making Vicksburg National Military Park the \n     beautiful and significant site that it is today. In this \n     park's 100 year history, there have been only twelve persons \n     who served as its superintendent. These two gentlemen we \n     honor today were this park's first superintendents (although \n     they didn't have that title, that is in fact what they were). \n     I personally have a feeling of great empathy for these two \n     men: for the responsibilities they bore, for the actions they \n     took, the examples they set for the 10 superintendents who \n     followed them . . . . For what they did during the critical \n     formative years to mold this park into the great memorial it \n     is today.\n       We are here at the monument to General Stephen D. Lee. \n     Stephen Dill Lee was a graduate of the United States Military \n     Academy at West Point who served his nation faithfully until \n     the outbreak of the Civil War. With the secession of his \n     native South served the confederacy with his customary skill, \n     rising to become the youngest lieutenant general in the \n     Confederate Service. Following the war, he worked tirelessly \n     to unite\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n     the people of the Nation, to rebuild the South, and to care \n     for Confederate veterans. His was a life of service to \n     others, but perhaps his most lasting contribution was the \n     establishment and development of this park.\n       The support of Confederate veterans was essential to secure \n     passage of legislation to establish a park at Vicksburg. \n     After all, the loss of Vicksburg was a stunning defeat to the \n     Confederacy. Supporters of the park idea found the ally they \n     needed in the person of General Lee who was highly respected \n     throughout the State and the Nation. In October of 1895 when \n     Union and Confederate veterans banded together to form the \n     Vicksburg National Military Park Association, it was Stephen \n     D. Lee who was the unanimous selection to be its president. \n     He was the instrumental person in this movement which was \n     culminated on February 21st, 1899, when the legislation was \n     signed into law by President William McKinley establishing \n     the park. General Lee was appointed to be the Confederate \n     representative on the three-man commission established to run \n     the park.\n       And Lee was immediately elected as chairman, thus becoming \n     the park's first superintendent. Although General Lee \n     remained in Columbus, he supported the Resident Commissioner \n     William Rigby and thus his influence remains every where to \n     see.\n       In November 1901, the pressures of time became too much for \n     him and he resigned his chairmanship--but he continued on the \n     park commission until his death in 1908. His last act of life \n     was to attend a reunion of union veterans, the very troops \n     who penetrated Lee's lines here at Vicksburg at the Railroad \n     Redoubt. In the Spirit of national unity he praised his \n     former enemies for their bravery and their devotion to duty . \n     . . four days later he died here in Vicksburg and was laid in \n     state in the park office where men in Blue and Gray again \n     gathered to mourn the loss of a great American.\n       We have with us today descendants of General Lee--whom I \n     would like to recognize. They are: great-grandson Hamilton \n     Lee. He has with him his daughter, Avery. Next, another great \n     grandson, Terry Batcheldor and his wife Ginny. Next, there is \n     a great-great-grandson Stephen Lee. And last but certainly \n     not least, great-great-great-grandson David Langstaff, who is \n     accompanied by his three children, Meridith, Chris and Todd.\n       We are delighted that these members of the Stephen D. Lee \n     family are with us today to participate in this ceremony to \n     remember their ancestor who made such a significant \n     contribution to the development of this national \n     park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2342-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TOBACCO SETTLEMENT FUNDS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak to S. 346, \nlegislation introduced by Senators Bob Graham (D-Florida) and Kay \nBailey Hutchinson (R-Texas), which provides that the federal money \nobtained by the states in the tobacco settlements remains in the hands \nof the states.\n  Let me briefly review the history of why we are here today discussing \ntobacco recoupment. On November 23, 1998, 46 states, including my own \nstate of Michigan, reached a $206 billion settlement with the major \ntobacco manufacturers. Michigan's share of the settlement is \napproximately $8.2 billion ($300 million per year over 25 years). \nStates that entered into the settlement have begun to plan for the \nallocation of funds received under those agreements.\n  This settlement was the result of a great undertaking by the states. \nOver the last decade, state governments initiated lawsuits against the \ntobacco industry, asserting a variety of claims, including the \nviolation of consumer fraud and other state consumer protection laws. \nSeveral state lawsuits did not include any claims for reimbursement of \ntobacco related health costs paid under the Medicaid program. Some \nstates, such as Michigan, included Medicaid recovery as a part of its \nclaim.\n  The Department of HHS claims a portion of the settlement represented \nby reimbursement of Medicaid costs it funded. However, because there \nwere multiple bases for the state claims against the tobacco companies \nand because it would be difficult to accurately assess which portion of \nthe states' settlement funds represents Medicaid reimbursement. I will \nsupport an amendment to this bill which will keep in the states any so \ncalled ``federal share'' funds if spent by the states on a variety of \nhealth and education related activities.\n  It is with the preceding in mind that I have joined on as a co-\nsponsor of S. 346. I urge the passage of S. 346, with an amendment \nalong the lines described. This will hopefully expedite the process of \nthese funds being used in a responsible and healthy manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2342-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO WILBUR MACDONALD NORRIS, JR.\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of a dynamic Kentucky judge-executive and dedicated \nteacher, Wilbur MacDonald Norris, Jr.\n  Wilbur ``Buzz'' Norris served the State of Kentucky for 39 years, \nfirst as a teacher of government and politics for 30 years at Daviess \nCounty High School, and then for 9 years as Daviess County's judge-\nexecutive, the county's highest ranking elected official. Buzz also \nserved his country with service in the United States Army for two \nyears.\n  Buzz is truly a product of Kentucky. He completed his undergraduate \ndegree at Kentucky Wesleyan College, and received a master's degree \nfrom Western Kentucky University. Buzz's deep-rooted background in \nKentucky certainly served him well in his years of commendable service \nto our great state.\n  Buzz's career in Daviess County politics was marked by his \nwillingness to fight for what was best for the county. He was heralded \nfor his ability to work with county officials of both parties, and was \neffective numerous times in bringing the sometimes opposing sides \ntogether in a compromise that pleased almost everyone and was always of \nbenefit to Daviess County.\n  Buzz was praised for bringing hundreds of jobs to the county with the \ncreation of MidAmerica Airpark and bringing Scott Paper, now Kimberly-\nClark, to Daviess County. It is widely speculated that, without these \ntwo companies' presence in Daviess County and Buzz's essential role in \nbringing them to the Owensboro, the county's economy would never have \nreached its current level of growth.\n  The legacy Buzz has left in Kentucky county politics also includes \nhis efforts to build and maintain a much-needed landfill in Daviess \nCounty. The completion of the landfill will save the county countless \ndollars in fees in the future, and leaves yet another lasting impact \nfrom Buzz's priceless leadership.\n  Aside from Buzz's successful career holding county office, some of \nhis proudest accomplishments come from his 30 admirable years as a \nteacher. Buzz taught high school politics and government classes at \nDaviess County High School and served the county by teaching a \n``Problems in Government'' class for the Daviess community. Students in \nthe class followed Buzz' example and plunged into the politics of local \nconcerns, impacting decisions about topics such as highways and \ndowntown revitalization.\n  Buzz Norris left his mark on Daviess County, and I have no doubt he \nwill continue to contribute his time, effort and energy to the \ncommunity for many years to come. I thank Buzz for his service to \nKentucky, and I am confident my colleagues join me in my commendation \nof his work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2342-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2342-S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AIRLINE PASSENGER FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for the Airline Passenger Fairness Act. I commend Senators \nWyden and McCain for bringing this crucial consumer issue before the \nSenate in a bipartisan manner. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure that each and every one of us in this body \nhas experienced his or her fair share of frustration with air travel. \nWhether it's late flights, bad meals, long lines, or lost luggage, \nwe've all gotten the short end of the stick at one point or another.\n  When it comes to air travel, we are all consumers. And this bill \nassures the protection of consumer interests. The Airline Passenger \nFairness Act would ensure that passengers have the information that \nthey need to make informed choices in their air travel plans. Given the \nrecent spate of airlines' customer relations debacles, I hope this bill \nwill also encourage some of them to treat their customers with more \nrespect.\n  Mr. President, financial statements and the stock market don't lie. \nMost airlines have been experiencing years of exploding growth and \nrecord profits. Unfortunately, some employees and consumers have not \nshared in the boom. While this bill doesn't address all consumer \nconcerns, it does move us forward in a constructive manner.\n  Mr. President, it's probably about time air travelers' interests \nreceived our attention. According to the Department of Transportation, \nconsumer complaints about air travel shot up by\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nmore than 25 percent last year. Those complaints run the gamut from \nephemeral ticket pricing; being sold a ticket on already oversold \nflights; lost luggage; and flight delays, changes, and cancellations. \nThis bill addresses these issues and more.\n  Perhaps of more importance, this bill does so without forcing \nairlines to compile information that they don't already keep. The bill \nsimply allows air travelers the right to that basic information and the \nability to make informed decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am fortunate to represent and be a customer of the \nnation's premier airline when it comes to customer satisfaction. For \nyears, Midwest Express Airlines has enjoyed some of the highest airline \ncustomer satisfaction ratings in the country. For those of my \ncolleagues who haven't had the pleasure to ride on Midwest Express, I, \nand I'm sure I speak for the senior Senator from Wisconsin, encourage \nyou to do so.\n  Mr. President, Midwest Express maintains those superlative ratings \nbecause it already incorporates some of the provisions spelled out in \nthis bill. Midwest Express already tries to notify its travelers if it \nanticipates a flight delay, flight change, or flight cancellation. The \nairline already attempts to make information on oversold flights \navailable to its customers. Midwest Express already makes efforts to \nallow its customers access to frequent flyer program information.\n  These are some of the reasons the airline has been awarded the \nConsumer Reports Travel Letter Best Airline Award every year from 1992 \nto 1998; Zagat Airline Survey's #1 Domestic Airline award in 1994 and \n1996; Travel & Leisure's World's Best Awards for Best Domestic Airline \nin 1997 and 1998; and Conde Nast Traveler's Business Travel Awards for \nBest U.S. Airline in 1998, among many awards.\n  Mr. President, other airlines should see this bill as a challenge to \nmeet the lofty standards set by airlines like Midwest Express.\n  Mr. President, air travel is on the rise, but so are air travel \ncomplaints. This bill responds to the complaints by giving our \nconstituents access to the information they need to make wise choices \nin air travel. Airlines truly concerned about their customers should \nalready be making these efforts. As I noted, one Wisconsin-based \nairline is already making the effort. I urge my colleagues to join in \nthis effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2343-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXXON VALDEZ OILSPILL\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this month is the 10th anniversary \nof the infamous Exxon Valdez oilspill. On March 24, 1989, one of \nExxon's largest tankers, under the command of a captain who had been \ndrinking and had abandoned the bridge, struck Bligh Reef and spilled 11 \nmillion gallons of North Slope crude oil into the pristine waters of \nPrince William Sound.\n  The Exxon Valdez oilspill remains the largest man-made environmental \ndisaster in American history. The oil spread almost 600 miles, harming \nwildlife, closing fisheries, and damaging the subsistence way of life \nof Alaska Natives living in the region. To its credit, Exxon spent as \nmuch as $2-3 billion trying to rectify the effects of the spill, but \nmuch damage remains.\n  The spill brought home to all of us in the Pacific Northwest a deeper \nappreciation for the importance of preventing oilspills. Clean water, a \nvibrant fishery, and abundant wildlife are all parts of our Northwest \nway of life, and they are all at risk to oilspills.\n  In Commerce Committee hearings shortly after the spill, I told the \nExxon CEO that a Japanese CEO would have been expected to resign after \nsuch a calamity. I said this not to be unkind, but because of my \nstrongly-held view that oilspills caused by a company's reckless \nconduct cannot be tolerated.\n  It is now 10 years later, and Exxon is ready to move on. It has \nannounced its intention to merge with Mobil, creating the largest \ncorporation in the world, with annual revenues of over $180 billion.\n  The federal government is in the process of reviewing this proposed \nmerger. I object to the merger of Exxon and Mobil unless Exxon first \nresolves some important unfinished business resulting from the 1989 \nspill. That unfinished business is the litigation brought by the tens \nof thousands of fishermen, small business owners, and Alaska Natives \nwho were harmed by the spill.\n  About 6,500 of these people live in Washington State. They, too, \nwould like to move on with their lives, but they can't. They have been \nwaiting ten years since the spill, and almost five years since a \nfederal jury determined that Exxon should pay them over $5 billion.\n  They will be waiting a lot longer if Exxon has its way. Every year of \ndelay is worth about $400 million to Exxon, the difference between the \n6 percent interest rate on the $5 billion judgment and Exxon's own rate \nof return of about 14 percent on the same $5 billion. If this case \ndrags on long enough, Exxon will be able to pay most of the jury \nverdict out of money that it made solely because of the delay in paying \nthe judgment.\n  Exxon has appealed the jury verdict, raising a number of issues. This \nis to be expected in a case involving this much money. But while this \ncase crawls through our court system, the victims are left waiting for \nclosure to a horrible event that changed their lives forever, and they \nare waiting for a sense that justice has been done. We need to find a \nway to meet these perfectly understandable human needs. Exxon has the \npower and resources to make that happen.\n  We need to send the strongest possible message to Exxon and other oil \ncompanies: you use our waterways to transport your product, and you \nknow the consequences if your product spills, so it is your duty to \ntake every precaution. If you act recklessly, you will pay dearly.\n  That message is fading after 10 years, and will be largely lost after \na merger of these proportions. Now, before the merger, we have an \nopportunity to make an indelible impression on what would be the \nlargest corporation on Earth--that an oilspill like this must never \nhappen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2343-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2343-S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WAYNE PERKEY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Wayne \nPerkey for 30 years of dedicated service to WHAS-AM radio and his \nlisteners in Louisville, Kentucky.\n  Wayne's voice has been heard by thousands of listeners over the past \n30 years as a constant in the life of morning talk radio. He has made \nan unforgettable impression on WHAS radio, and has carefully molded the \nstation into what it is today. When Wayne began work at WHAS the \nstation had primarily an all-music format, and Wayne spent years \ntransforming the station from that format into the all-talk format that \nthey have today.\n  Most stations would not have been able to accomplish that kind of \ntransition without losing a number of listeners, but Wayne's voice on \nthe morning airwaves clenched listener support and WHAS has enjoyed \nlong-lived success. Wayne's positive, up-beat morning program made \nWayne an icon in the Louisville market. Certainly he is a mainstay that \nwill be missed.\n  He presented up-to-the-minute news to hundreds of thousands of \nKentuckians for the past 30 years and used his position at WHAS to \nserve the community. Wayne says that one of the things that drew him to \nwork at WHAS in the first place was the stations' Crusade for Children \nprogram. He immediately took an interest in the Crusade, and played an \nintegral role as master of ceremonies for many of his 30 years.\n  The Crusade is known as the most successful single-station telethon \nin the United States, raising $70 million for the care and treatment of \nhandicapped children in Kentucky and Southern Indiana since its \ninception in 1954. Wayne saw how vital this program was to the millions \nof children who benefit from the Crusade each year, and has committed \nto emcee the telethon for one last year.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 15, submitted \nearlier today by Senators McCain, Kennedy and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 15) honoring Morris \n     King Udall, former United States Representative from Arizona, \n     and extending the condolences of the Congress on his death.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Morris King Udall, \nformer United States Representative from Arizona, and extending the \ncondolences of the Congress on his death.\n  An anonymous poet wrote that, ``virtue is a man's monument.'' \nUndoubtedly, the wise poet had in mind a soul the likes of Morris King \nUdall, a man of monumental virtue.\n  Mo Udall was an extraordinary human being who lived an extraordinary \nlife. Of humble beginnings, the son of St. Johns, Arizona rose to \nbecome one of the most influential and beloved legislators in the \nhistory of our Republic.\n  We are thankful for the gift of his company. We remember his brave \njourney. And we celebrate a remarkable life well-lived.\n  For over 30 years, Mo Udall graced our national and political life \nwith his sweet humility, gentle kindness and legendary wit. A man of \nkeen vision and great heart, he exemplified all that is good and decent \nabout public service.\n  Mo Udall was what we all want our leaders to be. He was a powerful \nman who cared not about power for its own sake, but saw it as an \nopportunity--a sacred responsibility to do good as he saw it--to \nchampion noble causes. His many important successes are written in the \nlaws of our nation.\n  His legacy endures in the halls of the Congress, with men and women \nwhom he humbled and instructed with his example. It endures among \nNative Americans whose welfare and progress he made his great purpose. \nAnd, it endures in the American parks and wildlands he fought to \nprotect with his vision and his guiding ethic of environmental \nstewardship.\n  It is fitting that the easternmost point of the United States, in the \nVirgin Islands, and the westernmost point, in Guam are both named Udall \nPoint. The sun will never set on the legacy of Mo Udall.\n  Carl Albert, former speaker of the House, said that Mo had written \none of the most remarkable legislative records of all time. And he was \nright.\n  But Mo Udall will not be remembered simply for his prolific \nlegislative achievements or the landmarks that bear his name. His most \nextraordinary monument is the virtue with which he lived his life and \nserved his country.\n  He fought the good fight in a touch arena, while remaining a man of \nunsurpassed integrity, boundless compassion and unfailing good humor. \nHe knew glorious victories and bitter defeats, serene contentment and \nprofound suffering. Through it all, he remained a humble man of \nuncommon decency whose example offers a stark contrast to the meanness, \npettiness and pride that soil too much of our political culture.\n  Mo was never known to be moved by flattery, puffed by tribute, or \nimpressed by his own success. He knew that a man is only as great as \nthe cause he serves--a cause that should be greater than himself.\n  Now did we ever know Mo to be discouraged in defeat. Through injury, \nillness, disappointment and, from time to time, failure, he was a \nfighter.\n  His humble perspective was as wise as it was delightful to observe. \nHe leavened his wisdom with his legendary wit. Mo employed humor not \nsimply to entertain, which he did like no other, but as a subtle and \nbenevolent instrument to calm troubled waters, to instruct the \nunknowing, to humble the arrogant, and to inspire us all to be better \nand to do better.\n  Most often he was the target of his own barbs. He loved to tell the \nstory about his campaign visit to a local barbershop where he announced \nhis run for the presidency, and, as Mo told it, the barber answered. \n``We know. We were just laughing about that.'' Most certainly an \napocryphal story, but typical of Mo to tell it on himself.\n  Mo once said, ``the best political humor, however sharp or pointed, \nhas a little love behind it. It's the spirit of the humor that counts * \n* * over the years it has served me when nothing else could.'' It has \nserved us well too.\n  While most remembrances of Mo focus on his grace, humor, and \nenvironmental leadership, perhaps understated is what he did for Native \nAmericans. When very few cared enough. Mo Udall toiled in an often \nfruitless and thankless vineyard on Indian issues. Moved by their \ndesperate poverty and duty bound to honor the dignity of the first \nAmericans and the solemn commitments made to them, Mo took up their \njust cause. He didn't do it for praise or recognition, he did it \nbecause it was the right thing to do. That was all the motivation and \nthanks he needed, and it characterized so aptly the benevolence of his \npolitical life.\n  How proud Mo must be that a new generation of Udalls have entered \nCongress. May their careers, like Mo's, light the way to more \nenlightened and civil public discourse.\n  The Navajo say ``May you walk in beauty.'' All his days, Mo Udall \nwalked in beauty and he shared his beauty generously with us all. He is \ngone now, and we will miss him.\n  May we find cheer in the echoes of Mo Udall, the little boy from St. \nJohn's who became a giant, touching us one more time with those words \nwe always loved to hear, ``I'm reminded of a story * * *.''\n  May each of us--may our country--forever find cheer, instruction and \ninspiration in his story. A story of monumental virtue. The remarkable \nstory of Morris K. Udall.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we celebrate the life of a very \nspecial American, Congressman Morris K. Udall. Today, and every day, I \nthink of him for all the wit and wisdom he shared with the world, and \nfor the remarkable commitment he made to public service and the causes \nhe believed in.\n  Mo inspired us with his integrity, compassion, dedication and humor.\n  His loss is deeply felt by all who knew him.\n  I first got to know Mo Udall when I came to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1978. He was a leader on issues that are still \ncritical to the national debate, including protecting the environment, \npromoting honesty and fairness in the financing of campaigns, and \nmaking quality health care more accessible. I had the pleasure of \nworking closely with him and sharing his passion on these priorities.\n  When I was a struggling young Congressman, Mo went the extra mile to \nlend me his support and his assistance. He was always willing to offer \na joke or a piece of advice, and he even traveled to the middle of \nSouth Dakota on behalf of this very junior Member of Congress.\n  I am certainly not the only one who has benefited from the generosity \nof Morris Udall. In particular, those who shared his struggle with \nParkinson's disease owe him a great debt of gratitude for his work on \nraising the awareness and funding for research on this debilitating \nillness. Although complications related to Parkinson's ultimately took \nhis life, it is my hope that a speedy discovery of better treatments \nand, eventually, a cure for Parkinson's will be Mo's legacy to those at \nrisk of developing this deadly disease.\n  I join my colleagues both to celebrate the life of this remarkable \nman as well as to express my deepest sympathy to Mo Udall's family, \nespecially his wife, Norma, and his children, Mark, Randolph, Judith, \nAnne, Bradley and Katherine. They have had the pleasure of knowing him \nbest, and they will certainly feel his loss the most.\n  There will never be another man with Mo Udall's unique combination of \nwit\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\nand passion. We are all better for having worked with and learned from \nthis wonderful leader. As we honor him today, as we celebrate his life \nwith our words, may we also be challenged to follow in his footsteps as \na dedicated servant of the people and honor him with our actions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am honored to cosponsor the resolution \nhonoring Mo Udall, introduced by Senator McCain.\n  Mo Udall was one of those rare figures who defines description. A \ngreat statesman, a forceful environmentalist, a civil rights champion, \na talented humorist, writer, athlete, and a wonderful family man--he \nwas all those things and more. Mo Udall was larger than life, and will \nforever live beyond his life with a legacy that is woven into the \nfabric of our nation.\n  On protection of our natural resources, Mo was a true pioneer. He \nfought for environmental causes long before they became popular. His \nfirst bills to protect Arizona lands came in his early days as a \nRepresentative. He saw a need to protect the land for its intrinsic \nvalue, and for its reflection of our own values as a society. He was a \nvisionary.\n  It took years of his tremendous dedication and his omnipresent wit \nbefore his vision took hold, but what a vision it was. One hundred \nmillion acres of lands in Alaska are preserved through the Alaska Lands \nAct of 1980. One million acres of land in Arizona are preserved through \nthe Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984. Against great odds and after \nseveral Presidential vetoes, strip-mining laws were reformed in 1977. \nNuclear waste management was vastly improved in 1982. Mo Udall was the \nauthor of each of these initiatives, which are only the highlights of \nan illustrious career.\n  Mo Udall was a pioneer in other ways. He quit his law firm upon \njoining the House in 1961, not the usual practice in those days. He was \none of the first Congressmen to disclose his personal finances, before \nit was required. He organized introductory sessions for freshman \nCongressmen, shedding light and humor on the arcane ways of Congress, \nand fighting to reform some of those ways. He championed the rights of \nNative Americans, supporting their efforts to protect their lands, \nfamilies and welfare. His integrity and honesty were untouchable. When \nhe was right on an issue, he was gracious about it, and when he was \nwrong on an issue, he was honest about it.\n  Mo Udall's legacy survives in many ways. As a tribute to his 30 years \nof public service, Congress created the Morris K. Udall Foundation in \n1991, which provides scholarships for Native American students, and the \nmediation of environmental disputes. Mo always attempted to balance the \noften conflicting desires of conservationists and developers, as he did \nin writing legislation for the Central Arizona Project. I could not \nthink of a better celebration of his career than the creation of this \nFoundation.\n  Just last November, Mo saw a new generation of Udalls take up the \ntorch of civic service. His son Mark and nephew Tom each won a seat in \nthe House. But the torch is carried not only by his relatives. Part of \nMo Udall's legacy--the humor, wit, dedication to public service, \ncivility, and honesty--lives within each of us, and the greatest \ntribute we can make to Mo is affirm that legacy, carry it with us \nthrough our careers, and pass it on to the next generation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor for me to join in this \ntribute to a wonderful friend and outstanding colleague, Congressman Mo \nUdall. He served the people of Arizona with extraordinary distinction \nand he was a dear friend to all of us in the Kennedy family.\n  Mo came from a remarkable family with a long and respected history in \npolitics and public service. His grandfather led a wagon train of \nsettlers into the territory in the 1880's. His father served as chief \njustice of New Mexico's State Supreme Court. His brother, Steward \nUdall, served with President Kennedy in Congress, and my brother \nrespected his ability so much that he appointed him to serve as \nsecretary of Interior in the years of the New Frontier. Today, Mo's \nson, Mark, and his nephew, Tom, are carrying on the great Udall \ntradition of public service as newly elected member of the House of \nRepresentatives. So the Chambers of Congress ring once again with the \nrespected Udall name.\n  Mo came to Congress a year before I did, and under similar \ncircumstances. He was elected in 1961 to fill the seat vacated when his \nbrother Stewart became Secretary of the Interior.\n  Every working man and woman in America owes a debt of gratitude to Mo \nfor his many years of distinguished public service. His brilliant \nleadership on important environmental issues, campaign financing, and \nreform of the House of Representatives itself endeared him to all of us \nwho knew him, and to millions who benefited from his extraordinary \nachievements.\n  On many issues, he was far ahead of his time, and his courage in \ntackling difficult challenges in a Congressional career of thirty \nbrilliant years was admired by us all. President Kennedy would have \ncalled him a profile in courage, and so do I.\n  As Chairman of the Interior Committee, Mo was ``Mr. Environment'' in \nthe Congress, urging the nation to deal more effectively with the \nincreasingly urgent environmental challenges we faced. He worked hard \nto designate millions of acres of federal lands as wilderness, and to \nenact landmark legislation to regulate the strip mining industry and \nmanage nuclear waste. Mo was at the forefront of efforts year after \nyear to protect the environment, expand the country's national parks, \npromote land-use planning and restructure the energy industry. It came \nas no surprise when the National Wildlife Federation named Mo as its \nlegislator of the year as early as 1973.\n  Under Mo's leadership, Congress passed the nation's first campaign \nfinance reform legislation in 1971. That landmark disclosure law, which \nrequired federal candidates to file detailed public reports of their \nfinancing, remains one of the most important aspects of election reform \nas we know it today.\n  As a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, Mo led \nbattles to improve pay scales for federal employees, institute a system \nof merit pay, and reform and strengthen the entire Post Office \nDepartment.\n  Mo's leadership was equally pre-eminent on many other issues. \nSomehow, for thirty years, whenever you probed to the heart of a major \nbattle, you always found Mo Udall championing the rights of citizens \nagainst special interest pressure, defending the highest ideals of \nAmerica, and always doing it with the special grace and wit that were \nhis trademark and that endeared him to Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  I think particularly of his influential role in ending the Vietnam \nwar. Mo Udall was one of the first members of Congress in the 1960's to \nbreak with the Administration and oppose the war. Because of Mo, we \nwere able to end the war more quickly.\n  I also think of his early battles to reform the seniority system and \nto make the Congress more responsive to the people we serve. In \ncarrying forward these efforts today, we continue to follow the paths \nhe blazed so well throughout his remarkable career.\n  Above all, I think of the extraordinary courage he displayed in his \nlatter years, battling the cruel disease that finally led to his \nresignation from the Congress, in 1991, thirty years almost to the very \nday since he arrived in the House. in his final battle, as in so many \nother battles, Mo won the respect and admiration and affection of us \nall.\n  And through it all, Mo charmed friend and foe alike with his \nextraordinary sense of humor. Mo came from a small town named St. Johns \nin Arizona, and he loved to tell people that he knew something about \nsmall towns. As he said, ``I was in fifth grade before I learned the \ntown's name wasn't `Resume Speed.' ''\n  He was also the master of the self-deprecating joke. He often told \nthe story of his visit to New Hampshire during the presidential \nprimaries in his 1976 campaign. At one stop, his advance woman urged \nhim to shake a few hands in a nearby barber shop. So he stuck his head \nin the door and said, ``I'm Mo Udall, and I'm running for President!'' \nThe barber replied, ``Yes, I know. We were just laughing about that \nthis morning.''\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\n  His brilliant wit could ease even the tensest moments and bring \npeople together. When Mo Udall laughed, Congress and the nation laughed \nwith him, and then went on to do the nation's business more \neffectively.\n  I have many warm memories of the years that Mo and I served together \nin Congress. In so many ways, Mo was a Congressman for all seasons. He \nserved the people of Arizona and America long and well. We miss his \nstatesmanship, and we miss his friendship too. We miss you, Mo, and we \nalways will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like pay tribute to one of the \nmost widely admired and respected Members of Congress of this half of \nthe century, Morris `Mo' Udall.\n  It has been said that Mo Udall represented a time when friendships \nmattered more than politics. Indeed, he was an honest and \nstraightforward person in a town notoriously short on such people, and \nhe always tried to foster cooperation, especially among representatives \nfrom the Western states. We collaborated on many issues over the years, \nand I considered him a very good friend.\n  During the 1980's we served as co-chairman of the Copper Caucus and \nworked to help address the serious issues facing the American copper \nindustry at the time. Together, we championed the cause of a new dollar \ncoin, which, I'm pleased to say, is scheduled to go into circulation \nnext year. We also worked to craft a sound nuclear waste management \npolicy, and as Chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular \nAffairs, his help was invaluable in designating parks, wilderness, and \nother recreation areas in New Mexico.\n  I believe it is this area--land stewardship--where he left his most \nindelible mark. He cherished the land not only for the natural \nresources it can provide, but for its recreational and ecological value \nas well. Under his 14 year leadership, the House Interior Committee \nbecame one of the most efficient and effective committees in Congress, \nsometimes responsible for a quarter of the legislation passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. It is true that every person who stops to \ntake a picture at a national park or hikes through a wilderness area \nowes a debt of gratitude to Mo Udall. His efforts in this area have \ntouched us all.\n  Perhaps the second greatest legacy Mo Udall leaves behind is his \nlegendary humor. In his 1988 book ``Too Funny to be President,'' he \nwrote ``It's better to have a sense of humor than no sense at all.'' Mo \nput this ``sense'' to good use, often employing it to make a point or \ndefuse a tense situation. His philosophy was that the best political \nhumor always ``has a little love behind it,'' and I can hardly think of \na man more loved by his peers than Mo Udall.\n  Today, a new generation represents the Udall name in Congress. Mo's \nnephew, Tom Udall, is the newest member of the New Mexico Delegation, \nand I look forward to working with him in the same manner as I worked \nwith his uncle. Tom and Mo's son, Mark Udall, do have big shoes to \nfill, but they also have an exemplary model to follow, and I trust they \nwill carry on the Udall tradition of unswerving integrity and honor.\n  Arizona has lost a beloved native son, and New Mexico has lost a good \nfriend and neighbor. His wit, grace and unflagging passion for the West \nwill be missed by all of us who had the privilege to work with him.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nremember an extraordinary and respected individual. I join the \nmultitude of people who noted the passing of Morris K. Udall on \nDecember 13, 1998 with much sadness. He will be sorely missed, \nespecially by those of us who had the great privilege of knowing him \nand benefiting from his goodwill and humanitarianism.\n  As a distinguished Member of the United States House of \nRepresentatives for more than 30 years, Morris K. Udall's leadership, \ndiligent efforts and commitment to his duties have added a measure of \nintegrity to the Congress. History should record that throughout his \ncareer, Morris K. Udall was of great intellect and a champion for those \nwho had little voice. He was an eloquent spokesman for the rights of \nNative Americans, a leader in education and environmental protection, \nand a true advocate for all Americans who suffer from Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  The people of Arizona have lost a true son and great friend. We will \nmiss him. I will miss him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to honor \nthe memory of our distinguished colleague, Morris K. Udall, who \ntirelessly infused into American politics his eloquent humor, grace, \nand dignity during his thirty year career in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. His death from Parkinson's Disease on December 12, \n1998, was a great loss for the American people, and I am honored to \nhave served with Mo and to preserve his legacy in our continued efforts \nto cure Parkinson's Disease.\n  I must point out that over one million Americans suffer from \nParkinson's Disease symptoms, and 60,000 more are diagnosed each year; \none every nine minutes. About forty percent of those patients are under \nage 60, and advanced symptoms leave people unable to complete their \nworking careers. The disease is estimated to cost our nation about $25 \nbillion annually. To help ease this suffering and remove the economic \nburden of Parkinson's Disease, I was pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education \nAct, signed into law on November 13, 1997 and sponsored by our \ndistinguished colleagues Senators McCain and Wellstone. The Udall bill \nauthorized a comprehensive Parkinson's Disease research and education \nprogram within the National Institutes of Health, and improved the \ncoordination of all Parkinson's initiatives across the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  On a personal note, I agree with the conventional wisdom that Mo had \na marvelous sense of humor, as exemplified in his book, ``Too Funny to \nbe President.'' One of my favorite anecdotes originates during his bid \nfor the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1976. Dutifully \ncampaigning for the New Hampshire primary, he introduced himself to a \nbarber as ``Mo Udall, running for President.'' The man chuckled and \nproceeded to respond, ``I know. We were laughing about that just this \nmorning.''\n  Mo's accomplishments during his distinguished career are innumerable, \nfrom his tireless promotion of environmental conservation to his \nefforts to preserve the rights of our country's most vulnerable \npopulations. I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this \nresolution to honor one of the most civil, respected, and effective \nlegislators of our time, Mr. Morris King Udall, and I extend my sincere \ncondolences to the Udall family for their loss.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, perhaps because of the title of his book, \n``Too Funny to Be President,'' a lot of people will remember Morris \nUdall chiefly for his wit and his humor. And that, in and of itself, is \nnot a bad way to remember Mo Udall. Because all of us need to remember \nthat while what we do, and the issues we deal with, are serious \nmatters, there is neither need nor reason to take ourselves too \nseriously. Morris Udall excelled in using humor to remind us of that.\n  But his quick wit and often self-deprecating humor never could mask \nhis deeply-rooted commitment to public service, his love of the land \nand people of Arizona, and the seriousness with which he took his \nresponsibilities to the Congress, to his state and its people, and to \nthis nation.\n  Morris Udall was a legislator in the most proud tradition of the \nterm. He understood that legislation is the process by which we \nrecognize a problem or an injustice and, as a nation, undertake to \nrectify that wrong. He understood that legislation did not mean \nintroducing a bill and putting out a press release; that legislation \nwas not complete simply because we held a hearing to let everyone know \nthat we were aware of the problem; or that simply because a bill was \npassed and signed into law our responsibilities were ended.\n  Mo Udall understood that until--at the instigation of the legislation \nwe passed and under our oversight--someone from the United States \ngovernment actually went out there and corrected the problem, ended the \ninjustice, or righted the wrong, the legislative process was not \ncomplete and our job remained undone. And Mo Udall was always willing \nto stay the course until we had fully met our responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\n  He is probably most remembered for his environmental initiatives; for \nhis belief that this land is the most sacred trust bestowed upon the \nAmerican people--and that blessed as we are by vast natural beauty and \nresources, we have a moral responsibility to preserve and protect that \ntrust and to make wise use of those resources.\n  Anyone who has ever seen the natural wonder that is the Arizona \nlandscape understands at once the roots of Mo Udall's love for this \nland. Clearly he had a vision that generations yet unborn should grow \nup and enjoy nature's bounty and splendor just as he had. And my \ngranddaughters--and their grandchildren--will have that opportunity in \nlarge part because of years of hard work by Mo Udall. They will have \nthe opportunity to enjoy and appreciate America's natural wonders and \nresources not just in Arizona but across this land. And Morris Udall's \nfamily--including a son and a nephew who have followed him here to the \nCongress, as well as his brother Stewart who proceeded him to the House \nof Representatives and then moved on to become Secretary of the \nInterior and was a partner in many of Mo's accomplishments--can point \nto so much: acres and acres of natural beauty, clean water, and \nspectacular wildlife, and say, ``There, that is part of Morris Udall's \nlegacy.''\n  But there is another aspect to Morris Udall's legacy that I hope will \nbe remembered equally, and that is his understanding of both the role \nand the limits of politics. He was an enormously talented politician, \nwinning re-election year after year through changing times and shifting \nconstituencies, and building a national following through his work on \nissues whose scope reached far beyond the boundaries of his \ncongressional district. And he understood that politics is important, \nbecause the political process is the way in which a democracy defines \nits priorities and allocates its resources.\n  But Morris Udall understood that politics has its limits as well. \nThat whatever our internal debate, partisan politics must end at the \nwater's edge and the nation's borders and that Americans will speak \nwith one voice when it comes to dealing with the world, and ensuring \nour national interests. He also said that when it came to the people of \nArizona, they had not elected Morris Udall to be a Democratic \nCongressman just as they had not elected Barry Goldwater to be a \nRepublican Senator. They had elected an Arizona congressman and an \nArizona senator to look out for their interests and the interests of \ntheir state. And whether Carl Hayden or Barry Goldwater or John Rhodes \nor Dennis DeConcini shared his party label or not, he joined with them \nto look out for the interests of the people of Arizona here in the \nHalls of Congress.\n  And there was somewhere else that Mo Udall believed politics had its \nlimits, and that was off the House floor or the campaign trail, away \nfrom the harsh debate, where friendships can develop regardless or \npartisan political stripe or ideology. He could count among his friends \nliberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans; simply because \nof his decency, his character, his interest in so many things both \nwithin and outside the political arena, and yes, his humor.\n  And perhaps most of all--at least in terms of his relationships with \nthose of us here in the Congress--because Morris Udall could look \nbeyond all of our differences and see that which I believe all of us \nhave in common: the desire to make life better for our children, our \nneighbors, our states, and out nation.\n  That, I hope, will be as much a lasting part of Morris Udall's legacy \nas the natural wonders that will be there for our grandchildren because \nMo Udall recognized a need and saw it's resolution through.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, as an original cosponsor of his \nresolution to recognize the life and achievements of a remarkable man, \nthe late Congressman from Arizona, Morris K. ``Mo'' Udall.\n  Congressman Udall served with distinction in the House of \nRepresentatives from 1961 to 1991. Until the advanced stages of \nParkinson's disease forced him into early retirement, Mo was an active \nand vital member of Congress. I came to know him well during my years \nin the House when Congressman Udall chaired the House Committee on \nInterior and Insular Affairs.\n  Congressman Udall's death this past December marked the end of his \ncourageous battle against Parkinson's disease and of a life-long \ndedication to public service. His commitment and devotion to the \nenvironment, government reform, health care and civil rights advanced \nthese causes and established a legacy that will not soon be forgotten. \nHowever, as a former athlete myself, I will forever remember Mo as the \n6-foot, 5-inch former professional basketball player, with a heart of \ngold and wonderful sense of humor.\n  It is impossible to fully recognize the impact that Congressman \nUdall's tireless efforts have had on this Congress, the State of \nArizona, and our Nation.\n  Mere words cannot express the respect, gratitude and sense of loss \nthat we feel for this extraordinary man. I can only say, ``Thank you, \nMo.'' We will all miss you.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring a distinguished public servant and a highly respected Member \nof the United States Congress, Morris K. Udall, who died on December \n12, 1998.\n  Mo Udall was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a \nspecial election held on May 2, 1961, succeeding his brother, Stewart, \nwho had resigned from the House to serve as Secretary of the Interior \nin the Kennedy Administration. He served the citizens of Arizona and \nhis nation with great distinction until his resignation on May 4, 1991. \nI was elected to the House of Representatives on November 3, 1970 and \nam proud to have served in the House with Mo Udall during the 92nd, \n93rd and 94th Congresses.\n  Mr. President, Mo Udall was one of the most productive and creative \nlegislators of his time. He chaired the House Committee on Interior and \nInsular Affairs from 1977 to 1991 and used this position very \neffectively to move numerous important environmental measures through \nthe Congress. The National Wildlife Federation named Mo Udall its \nLegislator of the Year in 1974 and in 1980 Congress passed his Alaska \nLands Act, which doubled the size of our national park system and \ntripled the size of the national wilderness sytem. His accomplishments \nin this critical area reflect a Westerner's deep love and respect for \nthe land.\n  Mo Udall's intelligence, sense of humor and civility endeared him to \nhis colleagues and to the citizens of Arizona's District 2 whom he \nserved so well. He was the keynote speaker at the Democratic National \nConvention in 1980 and was paid a special tribute by the Democratic \nParty during the 1992 national convention.\n  When Mo Udall retired in 1991, Washington Post reporter, David \nBroder, had this to say:\n\n       The legacy he left is imposing and enduring, it ranges from \n     strip mining and Alaska wilderness legislation to the reform \n     of archaic committee and floor procedures that congressional \n     barons had used to conceal their arbitrary power. For a whole \n     generation of congressmen, Udall became a mentor and a model, \n     he was special and precious to many of us.\n\n  Mr. President, Mo Udall was special. He provided a positive and \nunifying force in the U.S. Congress which has been sorely missed. He \nwas a good friend and respected colleague in the public service, and I \nwould like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to extend \nmy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to his family.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with the passing of Morris K. Udall on \nDecember 12, 1998, there is a little less humor, and humanity in the \nworld.\n  On that day, the nation lost a remarkable man of unyielding warmth \nand uncompromising ethics--and an individual who increased the stock of \npublic service by adhering to the very highest principles of \nleadership. Mo Udall exemplified all that is noble about our field of \nendeavor, and I was honored to serve with him in the House of \nRepresentatives. He was a man of stature in every sense in the world, \nand his legacy still looms large on America's political landscape. I \nadmired him as a colleague and a person.\n  Mo Udall was truly an American original, a son of the great Southwest \nwho seemed at home wherever he was. He had a natural way with people--\nmaybe because he had a way of making everyone feel important, feel like \nthey had something to contribute. His faith\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nin people was genuine and unwavering, as was his belief in the power of \ngovernment to be a positive force in the lives of those he served.\n  I always had a sense that Mo was someone who truly enjoyed what he \ndid, and felt privileged to be doing it. It saddened me deeply when I \nlast saw Mo, in the grips of a cruel and unforgiving disease. But that \ndisease, while it deprived Mo of so much of the life he'd always known, \nnever managed to wrest from him his dignity. And my sadness was \ntempered by the notion that this was a man who could look back on his \nlife's work and feel that it stood for something. That it had truly \nmade a difference. And I think that all of us in public service would \nlike to be able to say that when all our votes have been cast and our \ntenure in this great institution has passed into history, in that \nregard, we should all be as fortunate as Morris K. Udall.\n  Similarly, we can all take lessons from his extraordinary life. He \nbrought good cheer and laughter to a process that needs humor like an \nengine needs oil--without it, the wheels of government seize up; \npolitical discourse overheats. Indeed, as Mo himself once wrote, ``In \ntimes of national strife, humor can bring a diverse society closer \ntogether * * * In times of national tragedy, disappointment, or defeat, \npolitical humor can assuage the nation's grief, sadness or anger, and \nthus make bearable that which must be borne.''\n  Of course, while Mo never took himself too seriously, he understood \nfull well the gravity of his work. Again, to use Mo's own words, ``* * \n* the business of government is serious business, and in politics, as \nin any other endeavor, wisecracks are no substitute for substance.''\n  Certainly, there was no lack of substance in Mo Udall's record, as \neven a cursory review of his accomplishments would reveal. Deeply \ncommitted to environmental issues, he worked toward a healthier world \nfor future generations. Determined to erase the divisions among us, he \nhelped champion civil rights. Weary of abuse in our nation's elections, \nhe fought for campaign finance reform. Respectful of the natural beauty \nwith which we've been blessed, he introduced legislation to protect our \nnation's most precious resources.\n  And mindful of the solemn responsibility we have to those who first \noccupied these lands, he was a trusted friend to native Americans. In \nfact, Mo was chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular \nAffairs when I fought for federal recognition of the Aroostook Band of \nMicmac Indians in northern Maine--and I will forever appreciate all of \nhis wise guidance, input, and assistance.\n  Throughout it all, and despite his deeply held beliefs, Mo Udall \nnever viewed ``bipartisanship'' as a four letter word. He knew that \nreaching out will always be more effective than digging in. That's not \nto say Mo Udall wasn't proud to be a Democrat--indeed, he was fiercely \nproud of his political affiliation--but at the end of the day, he \nalways favored progress over party, civility over shrillness, and \nsolutions over sound bites. He was more interested in fixing problems \nthan scoring political points, and that made him a winner in the eyes \nof his constituents as well as a hero to all those who see public \nservice as a worthy pursuit.\n  In closing, let me just say that, for all of Mo's accomplishments, \nperhaps time will prove this last one to be his greatest. For Mo Udall \nwas living proof that there are good people in politics. At a time when \ncynicism about government is considered intellectually chic, Mo Udall \nreminds us all that integrity and hard work never go out of style. If \nthe reputation of an institution is like the balance in a bank \naccount--the sum of its credits and debits--then Mo Udall made more \nthan his share of deposits over his 30 years in Congress. And he never \nwithdrew a dime.\n  Today, Congress is the richer for it, public service is the richer \nfor it, and the American people are the richer for it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \ngreatest Americans to serve our Nation in this Capitol in this century.\n  Mo Udall was a man of grace, humor and dignity. In this time in \nWashington when we have all suffered under the burden of too much \npartisanship and too much personal vitriol in our political life, it \nwould serve us well to contemplate the life of Mo Udall. This is a man \nwho fought hard for what he believed. This is a man who entered more \nthan his share of bruising political battles and yet used his enormous \nwit to soften the edges and to civilize the struggle. More often than \nnot, the butt of the humor was Mo Udall, himself. When we who work here \nin Washington take ourselves too seriously, we might remember Mo's \nexplanation that he was ending his 1976 campaign for the Presidency \nafter six second-place finishes in Democratic primaries ``because of \nillness. The voters got sick of me.'' He loved to quote Israeli Prime \nMinister Golda Meir's warning, ``Don't be humble, you're not that \ngreat.''\n  Mo Udall was both humble and great. Mo Udall's sense of humor was so \nmuch a part of his legacy that we sometimes forget his towering \naccomplishments as an environmentalist and reformer. I worked with Mo \non one of his signal accomplishments the passage in 1980 of the Alaska \nLands Act which more than doubled the size of the national park system \nand which President Jimmy Carter called ``the most important \nconservation legislation of the century''. Among his many successful \nefforts to protect our nation's environment was his decade-long battle \nin the 1970's to pass tough strip mining reclamation legislation. As \nChairman of the House Interior Committee he repeatedly led efforts to \nexpand the national park system and to protect the nation's wildlife, \nrivers, forests and wilderness areas.\n  Throughout his career, Mo Udall was in the front ranks of those who \nfought for accountability and reform in public office. He battled for \ncampaign finance reforms, and reforms in the Congress itself, including \nfinancial disclosure, reform of the seniority system, and lobby reform. \nHe was among the leaders of the fight in 1971 for the Federal Election \nCampaign Act, the first substantial revision of campaign financing laws \nsince 1925.\n  In his 1988 book, ``Too Funny To Be President'', Mo Udall revealed \nthat his ``guiding light'' came from Will Rogers: ``We are here for \njust a spell and then pass on. So get a few laughs and do the best you \ncan. Live your life so that whatever you lose, you are ahead.''\n  Mr. President, Morris ``Mo'' Udall is way, way ahead.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, Morris King Udall is my cousin. \nBut he is more than a kinsman to me. He is a political exemplar and a \nsource of wisdom and humor still. I lament his passing but I rejoice in \nhis legacy.\n  I was but a boy of 8 years when Morris was elected to Congress from \nArizona to replace his brother Stewart. It was 1960 and Stewart Udall \nbecame the Interior Secretary for John F. Kennedy. It was then that I \nrealized more fully my maternal heritage to public service. My mother, \nJessica Udall Smith, often held up the service of Morris and Stewart \nUdall as public examples worthy to follow in order to make the world a \nbetter place and to lighten the burdens of human kind.\n  I grew up as best I could in the tall shadows of Udall giants. I \nchoose to follow their path to pubic service. The way is sometimes hard \nand the storms many. But it is a way made easier by the humor of Morris \nUdall. He taught me that humor directed at oneself is usually best and \noften funniest. He wrote to me that the only cure for political \nambition is embalming fluid. He told me to use any of his jokes `cause \nhe'd ``stole `em all fair `n square.''\n  I learned from him that the greatest thing about the United States of \nAmerica is not that any boy or girl can grow up to be President, but \nthat any boy or girl can grow up making fun of the President. I learned \nall of this from cousin Mo and so, so much more.\n  May God bless the memory of Morris K. Udall and may we all fondly \nremember him too.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues the \nSenior Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senior Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) to pay tribute to Morris K. Udall. While my \nfriends from Arizona and Massachusetts enjoyed direct personal and \nworking relationships with Mo Udall, I never knew him. But, I believe \nthat those members of this body who worked with Mo Udall were infected \nby his unwavering commitment to his colleagues and share Udall's desire \nto work in a bipartisan\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nfashion. I feel that I am a part of this legacy, and that is why I am \njoining in paying tribute to Udall's life.\n  Central parts of Udall's legislative agenda were his commitment to \nthe reform of campaign financing and his commitment to environmental \nprotection. In 1967, Udall wrote in a constituent newsletter about the \nperilous position in which the drive to raise money places young \naspiring legislators. He argued, setting the stage for the reform of \nthe 1970s, that ``drastic changes'' were ``needed to breathe new life \ninto American politics and recapture our political system from the \nmoney changers.'' I am inspired by Udall's remarks, in my own work on \ncampaign finance reform with the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), especially when I reflect on the fact that these are neither \nnew nor resolved problems.\n  I also share Mo Udall's great respect for America's public lands. I \nhave been a co-sponsor of the bill to protect the coastal plain of the \nArctic National Wildlife refuge for three Congresses, and I have joined \nin the fight to protect the public lands of Southern Utah. Both of \nthese campaigns date back to unfinished business that Udall began with \nthe Alaska Lands Act and with his commitment to designating and \nprotecting our country's special wild places.\n  In addition to conveying my own admiration for Mo Udall, I am also \nhere to share the reflections of my own home state. Wisconsinites have \na special fondness for Mo Udall for several reasons. Udall, who began \nhis presidential quest as a long shot, a relatively unknown Arizona \ncongressman, turned out to be a serious contender for the presidency. \nWith his special brand of humor, Udall was a reformer who didn't come \nacross as self-important. He outlasted bigger-name contenders and \nbecame Jimmy Carter's major rival for the nomination.\n  As a presidential candidate, Udall was unafraid to describe himself \nas part of a political tradition near and dear to the heart of the \nBadger State--progressivism. ``Liberal,'' Udall said, was just a \nbuzzword. He didn't mind answering to it but by his standards he felt \nthat he should more accurately be described as a ``progressive,'' in \nthe tradition of Wisconsin's Fighting Bob LaFollette and in line with \nthe presidencies of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and John \nKennedy. During the 1976 campaign, a commitment to progressivism nearly \nhanded him Wisconsin's nod. Udall's biggest disappointment was in \nWisconsin, where two networks declared him the winner and the April 7, \n1976 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's front page declared: ``Carter Upset \nby Udall.'' After going to bed as the winner of Wisconsin, Udall woke \nup as the runner-up when Carter pulled it out by less than 1% of the \nvote. Those premature reports turned out to be as close to victory as \nUdall got in the Democratic primaries that year.\n  It is my understanding that following his unsuccessful campaign for \nPresident, Udall framed that Milwaukee Journal Sentinel cover and it \nremained hanging on the wall within arm's length of his desk in his \nCapitol Hill office.\n  Second, Wisconsinites truly appreciated an accomplished national \nlegislator who could laugh at himself. That's a rarity in politics. \nIt's also why Udall is being remembered with such respect and affection \nfrom both sides of the political aisle. It is my understanding that \nUdall always had a one-liner. When Udall wrote a book about his '76 \ncampaign, he called it ``Too Funny to Be President.'' A few of \nWashington's more somber commentators had suggested in '76 that Udall \nwas too witty to be taken seriously. Udall disagreed: ``I've had a lot \nof letters about it. People found it a very appealing characteristic. \nThey don't like pomposity. I took problems seriously--but not myself. \nThe humor was directed at me, at other politicians, at the political \nprocess. I thought it was a big asset. It showed some stability and \nsensitivity.''\n  That book describes a 1976 campaign discussion in Wisconsin that \nUdall had with a 70-year old farmer in the northern part of my state. \nAccording to Udall, the farmer asked: ``Where are you from son?'' \n``Washington, DC,'' Udall replied. ``You've got some pretty smart \nfellas back there ain't ya?,'' said the farmer. ``Yes sir, I guess we \ndo.'' ``Got some that ain't so smart too, ain't ya?,'' the farmer \ncontinued.'' ``Well,'' Udall replied, ``I guess that's true too.'' \n``Hard to tell the difference, ain't it,'' the farmer concluded with a \nlaugh. Having traveled to every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties every \nyear as part of my commitment to hold an annual town meeting, I share \nUdall's delight in this anecdote and his characterization of this truly \nWisconsin exchange ``In a democracy, you see,'' Udall said, ``the \npeople always have the last laugh.''\n  Udall will be long remembered for his character and fundamental \ndecency. Without him, we must all strive to put issues before party and \nto complete the people's business. On behalf of myself and the citizens \nof my state, I wish to convey our greatest sympathy to Mo Udall's \nfamily. We are a greater country for his service. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this Nation lost one of its great leaders \nwhen Morris K. Udall passed away on December 12, 1998. I was lucky \nenough to serve with Mo for ten years in the House of Representatives. \nHe was an inspiration to me when I first came to Congress, an able \nrepresentative of the people of Arizona, and an accomplished leader for \nour nation.\n  Mo Udall served the people of the Second District of Arizona for 30 \nyears. I want to thank the citizens of Arizona's Second District for \nblessing our entire nation with a Congressman whose dedication and \nservice represented the voices of millions of Americans throughout our \nnation. I want to thank them for electing Mo Udall in 1961, and for \ncontinuing to do so in each of the 15 elections that followed. The \nSecond District of Arizona shared with the entire nation a leader who \ntruly improved our cultural and natural heritage.\n  Mo Udall was a visionary. He came to Congress in 1961 and put that \nvision into action. As Chairman of the House Interior and Insular \nAffairs Committee from 1977 to 1991, Mo was responsible for some of our \nmost progressive environmental accomplishments--designating millions of \nacres of federal lands as wilderness, banning development on millions \nof acres in Alaska, and reforming strip mining and nuclear waste \nmanagement.\n  His conservation ethic is what I, and so many others, respected about \nhim most. But there was more to him than that. He was widely regarded \nfor his sharp wit and keen intellect. For so many reasons, he was \nrespected by his Congressional colleagues, as well as the press and the \npublic.\n  When Mo retired from Congress, David Broder wrote, ``The legacy he \nleft is imposing and enduring. It ranges from strip mining and Alaskan \nwilderness legislation to the reform of archaic committee and floor \nprocedures that congressional barons had used to conceal their \narbitrary power. For a whole generation of congressmen, Udall became a \nmentor and a model--and they will miss him as much as the press \ngalleries do.''\n  Just last week, I joined Congressman George Miller in introducing a \npiece of legislation that I hope would make Mo Udall proud. It is up to \nthose of us still in Congress to carry on his legacy of environmental \nresponsibility. Lucky for us, there are two new Udalls in town. Mo's \nson, Mark Udall, was just elected to Congress from Colorado, and his \nnephew, Tom Udall, was elected to Congress from New Mexico. I look \nforward to working with them both. With their help, maybe we will be \nable to sustain the Udall environmental vision.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 25, 1999, Barry Wolk, who has \nfaithfully served the United States Senate for nearly 24 years, will \nretire. Barry began his career in September 1975 as Technical Advisor \nto the Secretary of the Senate. In January of 1983, he was appointed \nDirector of Printing Services, and in November 1996, Barry assumed the \nresponsibilities of Director of the newly created Office of Printing \nand Document Services.\n  Since 1996, the Office of Printing and Document Services has served \nas liaison to the Government Printing Office, managing all of the \nSenate's official printing. The office assists the Senate by \ncoordinating the preparation, scheduling, and delivery of Senate \nlegislation, hearing transcripts, committee prints and other documents \nto be printed by GPO. In addition, the office assigns publication \nnumbers to each of these documents; orders all blank paper, envelopes \nand letterhead for the Senate; and prepares page counts of all Senate \nhearing transcripts in order to compensate commercial reporting \ncompanies for the preparation of hearings. The Office of Printing and \nDocument Services is also responsible for providing copies of \nlegislation and public laws to the Senate and general public.\n  I commend Barry Wolk for his dedicated service to this institution \nand wish him many years of health and happiness in his retirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize Barry \nWolk, Director of Printing and Document Services, as he concludes over \n23 years of service to the United States Senate. I know I speak for all \nof my colleagues, their staffs and others in the Senate community in \nacknowledging his excellence service. The Senate is well served by \nstaff such as Mr. Wolk--people who are dedicated to the Senate and \nserve without partisanship year after year in carrying out critical \nadministrative functions without which any institution could not carry \nout its mission.\n  Mr. Wolk has spent his Senate career serving in the Office of the \nSecretary of the Senate. He has carried out the Secretary's statutory \nresponsibilities to ensure that Senate committee hearings are printed \nand has supplied Senators' offices and committees with stationary and \nother necessary items.He also assisted the Secretary in reducing the \ncost of these services through automation.\n  The Senate is fortunate to have so many long-term and dedicated \nemployees like Barry Wolk. As Barry leaves the Senate and enters a new \nphase of his life, I join my colleagues in wishing him and his family \nwell.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, for 24 years Justice Harry Blackmun gave \nvoice on the highest court in this land to ordinary Americans. He gave \nvoice--in his own words--to ``the little guy.'' Early this morning, \nthat voice was silenced. Harry Blackmun died at the age of 90.\n  He was an extraordinary man and a quintessential American. His tenure \non the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court extended through the \nterms of nine Presidents.\n  Years ago, Justice Blackmun predicted the first thing obituary \nwriters would say of him today is that he was the man who wrote Roe v. \nWade, and that clearly was the best known and most controversial \ndecision in Justice Blackmun's career. But Harry Blackmun stood for \nmuch more than that. He was regarded by many as the Justice most \ninsistent that the Court confront the reality of the problems it \nconsidered and the real-world consequences of those decisions.\n  In a dissenting opinion, he once challenged what he called ``the \ncomfortable perspective'' from which his fellow Justices ruled that a \n$40 fee did not limit a poor woman's right to choose. The reason he saw \nthat matter differently from his fellow Justices was due--at least in \npart--to the fact that Harry Blackmun had been raised differently.\n  He was born in Nashville in 1908 but grew up in St. Paul, MN. His \nfather owned a hardware store and a grocery store. His family did not \nhave a lot of money. When Harry Blackmun was 17 years old, he was \nchosen by the Harvard Club of Minnesota to receive a scholarship. At \nHarvard, he majored in mathematics. To cover living expenses, he worked \nas a janitor and a milkman, painted handball courts, and graded math \npapers.\n  He considered seriously going to medical school but chose Harvard \ninstead. He worked that same string of odd jobs to pay for his room and \nboard all the way through law school. After law school, he spent 16 \nyears in private law practice in St. Paul.\n  In 1950, Harry Blackmun became the first resident counsel at the \nworld-renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. He later called this ``the \nhappiest decade'' in his life, because it gave him ``a foot in both \ncamps--law and medicine.''\n  A lifelong Republican, Justice Blackmun was nominated in November of \n1959 by President Eisenhower to the U.S. Court of Appeals' Eighth \nCircuit. At the time, he was labeled a conservative.\n\n  In April of 1970, he was nominated by President Nixon to the Supreme \nCourt. He had been recommended to President Nixon by a man with whom he \nhad been friends since they attended kindergarten together: Chief \nJustice Warren Burger. Justice Blackmun was, in fact, the third choice \nto fill the seat vacated by Abe Fortas. Typical of his self-effacing \nwit, he often referred to himself as ``Old No. 3.''\n  When the FBI conducted its prenomination investigation of Harry \nBlackmun, they turned up only one complaint: He works too hard.\n  In his early days on the Court, Justice Blackmun tended to vote with \nhis old friend, the Chief Justice. In fact, their records were so \nsimilar they were called by some ``the Minnesota Twins.''\n  As he began his second decade on the Court, Justice Blackmun found \nhis own voice. He began to use that voice more frequently and more \nforcefully to speak for those he thought too often went unnoticed by \nthe Court. He emerged as one of the Court's most courageous champions \nof individual liberty. His overriding concern was balancing and \nprotecting the rights of individuals against the authority of the \ngovernment.\n  He was a staunch defender of free speech and what he called ``the \nmost valued'' of all rights: the right to be left alone.\n  He was criticized by some and praised by others for what many people \nperceived as a change in his political beliefs. He always insisted to \nfriends that he had not moved to the left; rather the Court had moved \nto the right. ``I've been called liberal and conservative; labels are \ndeceiving. I call them as I see them,'' he said.\n  Roe v. Wade combined Justice Blackmun's two most enduring interests: \nthe right to privacy, and the relationship between medical and legal \nissues. For weeks before writing the majority opinion, he immersed \nhimself in historical and medical research at the Mayo Clinic.\n  Over the years, he would receive 60,000 pieces of hate mail as a \nresult of his decision. He read every one of them. Once when he was \nasked why, he replied, simply, ``I want to know what the people who \nwrote are thinking.''\n  He understood why Roe v. Wade produced such strong passions in \npeople--because it had elicited strong feelings in him.\n  In 1983, he gave a long interview to a reporter--something that \nremains nearly unprecedented for a Supreme Court Justice. In that \ninterview, he recalled what it was like to write the opinion in that \nlandmark case.\n\n       I believe everything I said in the second paragraph of that \n     opinion, where I agonized, initially not only for myself, but \n     for the Court.\n       Parenthetically, in doing so publicly, I disobeyed one \n     suggestion Hugo Black made to me when I first came here. He \n     said, ``Harry, never display agony in public, in an opinion. \n     Never display agony. Never say `This is an agonizing, \n     difficult decision.' Always write it as though it's clear as \n     crystal.''\n\n  Justice Blackmun wrote an agonized opinion because for him--and, he \nunderstood, for most people--abortion is an agonizing decision. It was \nthen, and it remains so today.\n  I, for one, am grateful to Justice Blackmun that he did not try to \nminimize the difficulty of that decision. To do so would have been \ndisrespectful, I believe, to the vast majority of Americans who are \ntruly torn, intellectually and emotionally, by the question of \nabortion.\n  In 1994, when Justice Blackmun announced his retirement, he told \nPresident Clinton, ``I'm indebted to the Nation . . . for putting up \nwith the likes of me.''\n  Today, as we bid farewell to Harry Blackmun, it is we who are \nindebted to him. He was the champion of liberty, and ``we are not \nlikely to see the likes of him'' for a long time.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Justice Blackmun's friends and \nfamily, especially his wife and partner of 58 years, Dottie, and their \nthree daughters, Nancy, Sally and Susan. Our Nation will miss Harry \nBlackmun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/04/senate-section/article/S2351-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
