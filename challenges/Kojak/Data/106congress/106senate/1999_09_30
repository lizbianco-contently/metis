Mr. President, when we concluded yesterday afternoon, \nthe ranking member and I talked about a unanimous-consent agreement for \nall amendments to be filed. We had talked about 12 noon today, and \nthere was concern that since the announcement was made late in the day, \nSenators would not have an opportunity to understand that since many \nhad gone home. But it is my expectation that when Senator Harkin \narrives, we will confer and try to pick a time when we will ask \nunanimous consent that all amendments be filed.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1810, Withdrawn\n\n  On behalf of Senator Gregg, I withdraw the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1809\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essential point on the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia is to add $200 million to afterschool programs. I believe \nafterschool programs are very valuable, and I have supported \nafterschool programs in the past. In fact, in collaboration with \nSenator Harkin, we included $200 million in addition to the $200 \nmillion now allocated for afterschool programs. This is an enormous \nincrease on a program that just 3 years ago was at $1 million, then \nincreased to $40 million, then to $200 million, and we have doubled it \nthis year to $400 million. It is an integral part of the school \nviolence prevention initiative.\n  In crafting this bill, which comes in at $91.7 billion, Senator \nHarkin and I have made an assessment of priorities among some 300 \nprograms. And while we would like to have more money for afterschool \nprograms--we would like to have more money for many programs--it simply \nis not possible to do it.\n  In crafting this bill, which will be passed by the Senate, to get at \nleast 51 votes, there is very considerable concern on my side of the \naisle about a bill with $91.7 billion. Then we have to go to \nconference. Then we have to find a bill which the President will sign. \nThe metaphor is, it is like running between the raindrops in a \nhurricane. So it is\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\nwith reluctance I must oppose the Boxer amendment; it is not realistic \nto do it.\n  Some have argued that the $200 million advocated yesterday by Senator \nMurray, which was defeated, or the $200 million sought to be added by \nSenator Boxer would dip into Social Security. I am not going to make \nthat argument because no one really knows that. We are determined to \ncraft a total appropriations package which is within the caps. In order \nto accomplish that, there has to be advance funding. Of course, the \nBoxer amendment provides for advance funding as well. But at some \npoint, if there is sufficient advance funding going into the projected \n$38 billion in surplus for fiscal year 2000, even on the advance \nfunding line, Social Security will not be intact, and I think there is \nagreement that we have to protect Social Security and Medicare, that \nour expenditures even on an advance line cannot go beyond.\n  I note my distinguished colleague from California is ready to present \nher case, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment I have at the desk is No. 1809? I just want to make \nsure that is what the clerk has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I am going to make some very brief remarks and then yield 7 minutes \nto the Senator from Massachusetts, who is such a leader on education. I \nwill begin just by setting the stage for his remarks.\n  The amendment we have at the desk--and it is cosponsored by many on \nmy side of the aisle--would allow 370,000 children the opportunity to \nget into afterschool programs. This is a program that works. I \nunderstand both sides agree that it works. The difference is that we on \nthis side want to be a little more bold. We want to really say that if \neducation is a priority, and if our children are a priority, we ought \nto go up to the President's requested level of $600 million for this \nprogram.\n  The bill goes up to $400 million. That leaves out 370,000 children.\n  Think of the impact for those children. It doesn't only impact them \nwhere they are safe after school. It impacts their parents, their \ngrandparents, their communities, and their neighborhoods.\n  It is a very simple amendment. We use a technique used all through \nthe bill, which is forward funding. We don't touch Social Security or \nanything else. We simply forward fund it because the school year starts \nlater, and that kind of funding would work.\n  I want to share with my colleagues before you hear from Senator \nKennedy that last night the National Association of Police Athletic \nLeagues was so delighted to hear we had this amendment pending that \nthey got on the phone and called everyone they could in the Senate. I \nam going to read a little bit from their letter:\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Police Athletic \n     Leagues is endorsing and supporting Senator Boxer's \n     afterschool legislation, and anticrime amendment to the \n     Labor-HHS appropriations bill. It would add $200 million to \n     the 21st century learning center funding. This would total \n     $600 million.\n\n  This is what the National Association of Police Athletic Leagues \nsays.\n\n       Our kids need it. They need to be in safe places during \n     nonschool hours. There is no safer place in any community \n     than the school, especially when law enforcement personnel \n     are involved in their activities. This is where PAL plays a \n     part in the afterschool and anticrime amendment. The \n     amendment directly addresses the issue of the juvenile crime \n     rate during nonschool hours by providing productive \n     activities, and improves the academic and social outcome for \n     students.\n\n  He goes on to explain how the Police Athletic Leagues is involved in \nafterschool programs.\n  We are very delighted to be here this morning. We are pleased Senator \nGregg withdrew his amendment because I think it flattened the issue. We \nare all for IDEA, and that has been taken care of in the bill before \nus. But afterschool has been shorted.\n  At this time, I am pleased to yield 7 minutes of time to Senator \nKennedy, who is our leader in the Senate on education issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. This \nhas been an ongoing and continuous effort on her part, since the \nbeginning of this program 3 years ago when it started out as an \nextremely modest program. The reason it has grown to where it currently \nstands at $200 million, is to a great extent, because of Senator Boxer \nbringing to the attention of both the administration and the Congress, \nthe impact of this program on children, on families, and also in terms \nof law enforcement.\n  I think many of us were heartened earlier this year when the \nPresident asked for $600 million. But I think most of us thought, given \nthe amount of the request for that program, that it far exceeded that \nby two or three times. As with very strong programs, it will get the \nkind of focus, attention and priority it deserves. I want to express \nour appreciation to the Appropriations Committee because they have at \nleast added some resources to that.\n  But, of course, we face a significant decline in terms of the \ncommitment from the House of Representatives. By accepting the Boxer \namendment, we will strengthen the commitment that our appropriators \nhave demonstrated in terms of funding this program.\n  As we come into the second day's debate on this appropriations bill, \nwe are seeing the targeting of scarce resources that we have at the \nnational level in areas of proven achievement and accomplishment.\n  Yesterday, under the leadership of Senator Murray in the area of \nsmaller class size--and the record is very complete--with smaller class \nsize and with better trained teachers, the academic achievement and \naccomplishment for children are enhanced significantly, and the \nbenefits of those experiences stay with those children. Of course, if \nthey are enhanced later on, they even expand. The afterschool program \nis a similar program.\n  If we are able to take both of these programs together--smaller class \nsize and afterschool programs--with the kind of improvement of those \nafterschool programs, including tutoring, helping children with their \nhomework, and also exposing children in many different instances, as we \nsee in Boston, to a wide variety of other subjects--for example, \nphotography and graphic arts, areas which have awakened enormous \ninterest among children--students may find these are areas where they \nmay concentrate either near school or later as the source of \nemployment.\n  The bottom line is very clear. The results are in. Every dollar we \ninvest in afterschool programs means that a child will have an enhanced \nacademic achievement and accomplishment, period.\n  As this country debates, families say: What can we do about \neducation?\n  This morning many families, as they saw their children going off to \nschool, were saying: I hope my child is going to have a good day in \nschool; that they are going to have good teachers; and that they are \ngoing to continue their learning experience.\n  One of the things we know and that has been demonstrated and proven \nis that afterschool programs work. They have a positive academic impact \nin terms of children. This ought to be prioritized. That is what this \namendment does.\n  I welcome the fact that Senator Gregg withdrew his amendment because \nI think it is rather cynical to try to place disabled children against \nafterschool children. Hopefully, we are interested in all children. \nDisabled children go to afterschool programs. Why try to say to people \nin local communities: Look, you have to do this, or do that? We ought \nto do what is necessary in terms of those children who qualify for \nIDEA, and we ought to do something for the afterschool program. Now we \nhave the opportunity to do something for the afterschool program.\n  I want to state very quickly some of the results of the afterschool \nprogram to date. One is in the student achievement. The second is in \ndecreasing juvenile crime.\n  The Senator from California has been able to reflect that in the very \nstrong support from law enforcement officials that she mentioned in the \nRecord. That has been demonstrated. It was demonstrated in Waco, TX, \nwhere many of the students participated in what they called the Lighted \nSchools Program for afterschool programs. They saw an important and \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nreduction in juvenile delinquent behavior over the course of the school \nyear. It produces that result, as we saw, as in some of the \npresentations we made yesterday about giving the students a youthful, \nproductive, and healthy kind of alternative to using their time in a \nwasteful way after school. It has the result of reducing juvenile \ncrime.\n  Finally, the parents support it. In Georgia, over 70 percent of \nstudents, parents, and teachers agree that children are receiving \nhelpful tutoring in The Three O'clock Project, a statewide network of \nafterschool programs. The parents are the ones who have been the \nstrongest supporters of this program.\n  As we have seen in other programs, there is no requirement and no \nmandate on this. If the local school and community want to do it, they \nhad better get their applications in because there are going to be \nscarce resources. We are doing it on the basis of a solid record of \nachievement, academic improvement, and reduction in crime. They have \nseen that there have been expanded opportunities for students because \nof additional learning experiences.\n  This is a win-win-win. I think the Senate of the United States ought \nto go on record in supporting what the parents want and what has been \ndemonstrated to be effective in enhancing academic achievement in \nafterschool programs.\n  We are glad for what the appropriators have done. But we are talking \nabout a $1.7 trillion budget. We think $200 million more for the \nafterschool program, which will bring it up to the $600 million the \nPresident had requested, makes a good deal of sense. Again, it is an \nissue of priority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator have an additional \n2 minutes. I will ask him to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think my friend makes a very important \npoint about the priorities when he talks about the overall size of this \nbudget of the United States of America. Comparing that with the $200 \nmillion we are asking for in this program would add 370,000 children \nwho are awaiting in line.\n  I ask my friend another question. Our friend from Pennsylvania is not \nsupporting our amendment and alludes to the fact that, well, we just \ncan't keep spending more. But yet every Republican, as I remember, \nvoted for an enormous tax cut of billions and billions of dollars. Now \nthat is off the table.\n\n  I say to my friend, it seems ironic there would be complaints about \nspending more on education than the bill already provides, when every \nsingle one of my Republican friends voted for this huge tax cut to \nbenefit the wealthiest. All we want is to take a relatively small \namount of that and put it into afterschool.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We had a tax cut \nfor $792 billion over the period of the next 10 years. As the Senator \nremembers, we had the opportunity to fully fund the IDEA program and \nonly reduce the tax cut by one-fifth. That was real money going toward \neducation for the disabled. That was rejected on party lines. Those who \nare advocating and supporting the Boxer amendment supported it. It was \nturned down on the other side.\n  If we were able to have that amount of money that would be used in \nthe tax cut, why not take $200 million of that $792 billion and put it \nin afterschool programs to service 370,000 children? It makes sense to \nme.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to give my friend some information. I know he \nfought this tax battle and a lot of the numbers have perhaps slipped \naway. The number of dollars that would have been lost in the school \nyear 1999-2000 as a result of the Republican tax cut was $5.273 billion \nin the first year, this year that we are talking about.\n  They were willing to give to the wealthiest people in this country \n$5.273 billion in the school year 1999-2000. All we are asking is to \ntake the latter part of that figure--the $5 billion we are not \ntouching--the $273 million.\n  When it comes to priorities, I think this vote is very important.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has brought up an enormously important \npoint, one that some Members understand, and hopefully the American \npeople understand.\n  To move ahead with that tax cut would mean an effective reduction in \nsupport of programs that reach out and benefit children in the public \nschools. That is part of the money they were going to use to fund that \ntax break, and, of course, the President vetoed it so we are able to at \nleast effectively hold those programs at their current level.\n  However, the Senator additionally makes the point that we have \n447,000 new children going to school this next year, about 300,000 the \nfollowing year, and 300,000 the next year. Unless we see an important \nincrease, we will not be able to serve all the children in need.\n  I think the Senator from California's program will move us down that \nroad in an important way.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the agreement to vote at 10 o'clock is \ncomplicated by the withdrawal of the Gregg amendment. For the record, I \nask unanimous consent the time restraints outlined in the previous \nconsent agreement apply to the Boxer amendment, with a vote to occur at \n10 o'clock. That is our plan 6 minutes from now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. By way of brief reply to the arguments made by the \nSenator from California, did I understand the Senator from California \nto say that no Republican voted against the $792 billion proposed tax \ncut?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thought that was correct. How many did vote against it?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Quite a few. I wouldn't want to cite an exact number.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't think it was ``quite a few.'' It might have been \nthree.\n  I stand corrected.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It might have been more than three; it was some.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I stand corrected. I apologize. I know my friend did vote \nagainst it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I can testify to that from direct personal knowledge; I \nvoted against it and others did. There were some Republicans against \nthe tax cut.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I congratulate the Senator for that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We thank the Senator more for the accurate \nidentification than the congratulations. My vote against it was based \nupon concern of what the surplus would be.\n  I think it ought to be noted the President has come forward with a \nproposal for a tax cut of his own. It is not a tax cut of the magnitude \npassed by the Senate and the House, but he has come forward with a role \nfor a tax cut.\n  Back to the issue on more money for afterschool programs. I think it \nis very important to consider this issue in the perspective of what has \nhappened with this program which was created as recently as 1994. For \nthe fiscal year 1995, enacted in 1994, the last year when the Congress \nwas controlled by the Democrats, the afterschool program was $750,000. \nThe next year it was $750,000. In fiscal year 1997, it went to $1 \nmillion. In 1998, when I chaired the subcommittee and Senator Harkin \nwas ranking, we raised it to $40 million. Last year, we raised it to \n$200 million. This year, we are raising it another $200 million. I \nbelieve there has been a real recognition of the value of the \nafterschool program.\n  The Senator from California and I had an extended debate yesterday \nafternoon on the question of whether there would be a request for more \nmoney. Had we added $400 million, there would still have been many \napplications and many meritorious applications. Among the total \nnumber--there were some 2,000 applications--only 184 were granted. That \nbrings me to the conclusion that regardless of what we craft in a bill \nand how much money we add for afterschool programs there will be an \neffort by someone to up the ante so that no figure is satisfactory.\n\n  Someplace the line has to be drawn. The overall education budget, \nwhich the subcommittee recommended and the full committee recommended \nand is now before the Senate, increases educational funding over last \nyear by $2.3 billion--$2.3 billion. It is more than $500 million more \nthan the President's request. When we take education in the\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\naggregate, we have done more than President Clinton has asked. When we \ngo down to some of the specific items, we have not put quite as much as \nhe wants into some programs. He asked for the program on preparing \ndisadvantaged secondary high school students for college, GEAR UP; he \nasked for an increase from $120 million to $240 million, doubling it. \nWe increased it to $180 million, $60 million over last year's funding \nlevel.\n  However, the Congress has the principal responsibility in the \nappropriations process under the Constitution. It is true the President \nhas to sign the bill, but we are the baseline appropriators. While we \nhave disagreed on some of the priorities, I believe that Senator Harkin \nand I have crafted a bill, which the subcommittee accepted and the full \ncommittee accepted, that is a realistic and appropriate allocation of \nthose priorities. It is for that reason, as much as I like afterschool \nprograms, there has to be some limit before we go into Social Security, \nsome limit considering how much we have added to education.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a clarification on a \nconversation we had a moment ago?\n  Mr. SPECTER. On the four Republicans who voted against the tax bill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, it is only two, that is what we were told.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senators Voinovich, Collins, Snowe, and I all voted \nagainst the tax bill; it was a 50-49 vote. One Republican was absent, \nfour Republicans voted against it. Forty-five Democrats voted against \nit, plus four Republicans: Voinovich, Collins, Snowe, and Specter.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have the vote. It shows two voted against.\n  Mr. SPECTER. You have the first tax bill, the bill out of the Senate, \nwhere Voinovich and Arlen Specter voted against it. The conference \nreport, which is the tax bill, had four Republicans voting in \nopposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was speaking about the vote in the Senate, when the \nSenate bill came before us. There were two and you were one of the two. \nI want to make sure the Record shows that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a vote in the Senate on the conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fine. Then we could say two voted against it the first \ntime in the Senate and when it came back from the conference, four.\n  The point I made is very obvious.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from California agree that some \nRepublicans voted against it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree that two Republicans out of 55 voted against it \nin the Senate. I don't know what the point is. I am glad you did, \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take that as a concession that some \nRepublicans voted against it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, don't. I don't mean it as a concession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to table. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been working quite some time now to \nget a final agreement on how to bring up the FAA reauthorization bill. \nThis is important legislation. We have tried to extend the time, and \nthere has been resistance to that. We have tried to direct a \nconference; there has been resistance to that.\n  So it is important we have a couple days to have debate relevant \namendments and deal with this issue. We are working on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I think we have resolved most of the questions. If there \nis any one remaining problem, I would like to flesh it out so we can \ndeal with it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, October 4, it be in order for \nthe majority leader to proceed to the consideration of S. 82, the FAA \nreauthorization bill, that the majority and minority managers of the \nbill be authorized to modify the committee amendments and, further, \nthat only aviation-related amendments and relevant second-degree \namendments be in order to the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will object at this point. I do so only \nbecause it is my understanding that the junior Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, is still awaiting an answer from the manager of the bill, \nSenator McCain. They have been negotiating now for several days. The \nSenator from New York indicated he hopes that in a matter of hours he \nwill hear from Senator McCain's office. As soon as he gets that \nclarification from Senator McCain, I think he will be more than happy \nto agree to this unanimous consent request. I will certainly notify the \nmajority leader when that happens. Then it would be my expectation we \ncould agree to this unanimous consent request. We have worked through a \nnumber of other problems and issues Senators have raised.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators, especially those on my \nside of the aisle who have worked with us to get to this point. This is \nan important bill. It needs to be done. I hope it will be done next \nMonday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Democratic leader for that response.\n  The manager of the bill and the ranking member, Senator McCain and \nSenator Hollings, are really anxious to go forward with this. There is \nan understanding on both sides of the aisle that this is very important \nlegislation we have to complete.\n  We have worked through problems that Senator Robb had, Senator \nAbraham, a number of Senators who have amendments, but they will be \nable to offer those relevant amendments under this agreement.\n  I hope later on today we can lock in this agreement and be on this \nbill then next Monday, and after a reasonable time for debate and \namendments, surely we can finish it by the close of business on \nTuesday.\n  Also, Mr. President, there had been an indication that some amendment \nmight be offered on the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill on an \nunrelated matter but one with which, frankly, we are prepared to go \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11666-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11666-S11669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-28\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\nthat at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, October 6, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of treaty document \nNo. 105-28 and the document be placed on the Executive Calendar, if not \npreviously reported by the committee.\n  I further ask consent that at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the Senate begin \nconsideration of treaty document No. 105-28--this is the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty--and the treaty be advanced through the various \nparliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the \nresolution of ratification, and there be one relevant amendment in \norder to the resolution of ratification to be offered by each leader; \nin other words, there would be two of those.\n  I further ask that there be a total of 10 hours of debate to be \nequally divided in the usual form and no other amendments, \nreservations, conditions, declarations, statements, understandings, or \nmotions be in order.\n  I further ask that following the use or yielding back of time and the \ndisposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption \nof the resolution of ratification, as amended, if amended, all without \nany intervening action or debate.\n  I also ask consent that following the vote, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, the resolution to return to the President be \ndeemed agreed to, and the Senate immediately resume legislative \nsession.\n  Basically, after consultation on both sides of the aisle, and \nespecially with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we are \nasking that we go to a reasonable time for debate and a vote on this \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I think this treaty is bad, bad for the country and dangerous, but if \nthere is demand that we go forward with it, as I have been hearing for \n2 years, we are ready to go.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object to this request for three \nreasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First, 10 hours of debate is totally insufficient for a \ntreaty as important as this. I appreciate very much the majority \nleader's willingness to respond to the continued requests we have made \nfor consideration of this treaty. He and I hold a different view about \nthe importance of it, but we are certainly willing to have a debate and \nhave the vote.\n  I appreciate as well his willingness to respond as quickly as he has. \nIn this case, we have been attempting to get to this point for a long \nperiod of time. But October 6 is a time that I don't think allows for \nadequate preparation for a debate of this magnitude.\n  Keep in mind, no hearings have been held yet on this issue. \nUnfortunately, as a result of that, I don't think people are fully \ncognizant of the ramifications of this treaty and the importance of it. \nI will certainly agree to a time certain if we can extend the length of \ndebate.\n  I would also be concerned about the language in the unanimous-consent \nrequest that assumes this treaty will be defeated. The last paragraph \nmakes an assumption that we are not prepared to make at this point. We \ndon't think it necessarily will be defeated.\n  We look forward to working with the leader and coming up with a time \nwe can debate it and give it the time it deserves. I hope it will be \ndone sometime this coming month. I look forward to working with the \nmajority leader to make that happen.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, three responses: First, if additional time \nis needed to have a full debate, I think we can work that out. Second, \nwith regard to the leader's objection, I guess to the language in the \nlast paragraph, we can talk about that and probably can work out an \nagreement to drop that. Third, there have been lots of hearings on this \nissue over a long period of time and a lot of individual briefings by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. I think the Senator would be \nsurprised at the amount of knowledge Members have on this subject.\n\n  Finally, there is one sure way it will be defeated--that is, not to \never take it up. I would like us to get a time as soon as possible, \nwithin the very near future, and have that debate and have a vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Do I have time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy of the majority leader. I hope \nwe can find a way by which we are able to debate and vote on this \ntreaty. I don't share the opinion that it is dangerous. I think it is \nimportant for the interests of this country that we ratify this treaty. \nWhatever the agreement, I also think it would be useful to have a \nhearing in the coming days and have the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nothers come forward and tell us their views.\n  Mr. LOTT. One observation, if the Senator will withhold for a second: \nThis agreement doesn't preclude hearings in the appropriate committees \neither this week or next week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand it would not preclude it, but would it \nnecessarily include it? Does the majority leader think such hearings \nwill be held? Notwithstanding that, I still think, one way or the \nother, we ought to get to this treaty, get it to the floor, debate it, \nand vote on it.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are ready, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator believe there will be a hearing in the \ncoming days?\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't know. I assume that could happen. There are at \nleast two chairmen who would probably be willing to do something in \nthat area.\n  I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am getting a little weary of this \nbusiness of saying this is true and that is true when it is not true.\n  We have held at least nine hearings on this matter. We have invited \nSenators to come. They didn't want to come. I have done the best I can \nto have hearings. But if the Senators won't come, and if the news media \nwon't report what we have had, I believe I have discharged my \nresponsibility.\n  Let's hear no more about ``no hearings.'' There have been hearings; \nthe Senators from the other side just didn't participate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if it would be appropriate, I yield the \nfloor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am always reluctant to disagree publicly \nwith my friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the full committee, \nbecause we get along so well. We have a fundamental disagreement on \nthis issue. But I am unaware of any hearings we have had in the Foreign \nRelations Committee on this treaty.\n  We have had hearings on the ABM Treaty. We have had hearings on the \nABM Treaty. We have had hearings on the protocol to the ABM Treaty, and \nthe demarcation issue. We have had hearings on the impact of theater \nmissile defense. We have had those hearings. They all implicate the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But we have had, to the best of my \nknowledge, no hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I note for the Record one Senator's view. I think it is shared by \nmany.\n  This is the single most significant issue facing the entire question \nof proliferation of nuclear weapons, and it holds the key for good or \nbad, depending on your perspective, on every other aspect of our \nstrategic defenses.\n  So it is, to me, not reasonable. The chairman has been very \nstraightforward with me--and I respect him for it--in the many urgings \nI have made to him to have hearings. He said to me: Joe, we will have \nhearings if the following things occur.\n  He lays it out. He said: We will have hearings if we first do ABM, if \nwe first do the Kyoto treaty, if we first do other things. He has set \npriorities. He has been straightforward, honest, and up front about it \nfor the last 2 years. This is the only thing he and I have had a real \ndisagreement on.\n  But the idea that we have had hearings on this treaty is not true. I \nam not suggesting that the chairman is intentionally misleading the \nSenate. He may think in terms of since we have had hearings that \nimplicate other aspects of our strategic defenses and our strategic \noffensive capability that we have done this, but we haven't.\n  The Government Affairs Committee, I thought, had some hearings on it \nrelating particularly to the stockpiling\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\nissue and the testing of the stockpiling. And I think maybe even the \nArmed Services Committee may have had hearings on it.\n  But I want to get something straight. I am going to sound to the \npublic like a typical Washingtonian Senator. The only outfit that has \njurisdiction over this is the Foreign Relations Committee--the Foreign \nRelations Committee. That is one of our principal functions.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, we haven't had hearings.\n  Let me say one word in conclusion.\n  I am willing and anxious to have an up-or-down vote on this because, \nas the majority leader said, if we don't vote, the treaty loses anyway. \nI would rather everybody be counted. I want everybody on the line. I \nwant every Senator voting yes or no on this treaty so we all can put \nourselves in line so that, if India and Pakistan end up--while we are \npleading with them to ratify this treaty, while we are pleading with \nthem not to deploy--if they end up deploying nuclear weapons, I am \ngoing to be on the floor reminding everybody what happened and the \nsequence of events. I will not be able to prove that is why they did \nit. But I can sure make a pretty strong case.\n\n  I want everybody coming up this next year--everybody from the \nPresidential candidates to all of our colleagues running for \nreelection--to be counted on this issue.\n  That is why I am willing--I am in the minority--to have the vote \ntoday. I am willing to go ahead. I am not the leader. But I will tell \nyou, I think this is a critical issue. We have had no hearings.\n  It makes sense what my friend from North Carolina says--that we \nshould have hearings, and we should do it in an orderly fashion. We \nshould proceed this way. Apparently, we are not going to proceed this \nway; therefore, we will have to do it in a way in which the committee \nsystem was not designed to function. If that is the only way we can get \na vote, fine.\n  I conclude by saying that I don't doubt for a second the intensity \nwith which my friend from North Carolina believes this treaty is \nagainst the interests of the United States any more than he doubts for \na second my deep-seated belief that it is in the ultimate interest of \nthe United States.\n  But these are the issues over which people should win and lose. These \nare the big issues. These are the issues that impact upon the future of \nthe United States and the world. This is the stuff we should be doing \ninstead of niggling over whether or not you know somebody smoked \nmarijuana or did something when they were 15. This is what this body is \ndesigned to do. This is our responsibility, and I am anxious to engage \nit.\n  If it is 10 hours, 2 hours, or 20 hours, the longer the better to \ninform the American public. Hearings would be illuminating.\n  But since that is probably not going to happen, I say to my friend \nfrom North Carolina that I am ready to go. I expect he and I will be \ngoing toe to toe on what is in the interest of America. I respect his \nview. I thank God for him. I love him. But he is dead wrong on this. \nBut I still love him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum so I can \nget my records over here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I ask unanimous consent \nthat the quorum call be suspended, and that at the conclusion of \nSenator Cleland's remarks I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, I ask that I be recognized following the remarks of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my dear friends from the other side of the \naisle are refusing to agree to a unanimous consent agreement to bring \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for debate and a \nvote on October 7, 1999.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for me to \nrequest Senator Cleland be recognized for whatever time he needs and at \nthe conclusion of his remarks I be recognized again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom North Carolina objected to my being recognized following his \nstatement on the floor. The Senator from North Carolina, as I \nunderstand, is propounding a unanimous consent request that the Senator \nfrom Georgia be recognized, following which he be recognized. I ask \nconsent I be recognized following the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, first, to yield \nto our colleague from Georgia for purposes of a request and then for \npurposes of making a unanimous consent request that has to do with \nestablishing my order in the line to offer an amendment relative to the \npending legislation.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Did the Senator from North Carolina object?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, he did.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator from North Carolina object if my motion \nwas to yield to the Senator from Georgia for purposes of the motion he \nwishes to make?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think the Record will show I already \nrecommended Senator Cleland be recognized at the conclusion of which I \nshall have the floor; is that not the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am asking unanimous consent to yield to the Senator \nfrom Georgia for the purposes of the motion of the Senator from \nGeorgia; is there objection to that?\n  Mr. HELMS. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina added to that \nhe be recognized immediately after the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I accept that if I could be recognized between the \nSenators from Georgia and North Carolina for purposes of my procedural \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I don't understand the request.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The request is, first, that the Senator from Georgia be \nrecognized for the purposes of a motion, and I be recognized for a \nunanimous consent that will only ask my amendment be taken up as the \nnext Democratic amendment relative to the pending legislation; and then \nthe third step is the Senator from North Carolina would be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nFlorida, we already have a Democratic amendment that is mine; we are \nwaiting to do that. That is the next one.\n  Mr. HELMS. We can't have a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object to the request of the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The Senator from \nFlorida has the floor.\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to yield to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, who gets the \nfloor when the Senator from Georgia has finished his remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The floor is open.\n  Mr. HELMS. I object unless it is recognized by all that I get the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't \nobject to the Senator from Georgia speaking. I don't object to the \nSenator from North Carolina speaking. I simply ask if the Senator from \nNorth Carolina gets consent to be recognized, that I get consent to be \nrecognized following his presentation. As I understand it, he has \nobjected to that; is that the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Is there an objection to his \nrequest now?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Whose request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yours.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will certainly not object to my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Senate Resolution 192 introduced earlier by \nmyself and the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.Res. 192) extending birthday greetings and \n     best wishes to Jimmy Carter in recognition of his 75th \n     birthday.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau once said ``If one \nadvances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to \nlive the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success \nunexpected in common hours.'' I rise before my colleagues today to \nreflect on the successes of one of our nation's great leaders and to \npay tribute on the occasion of his 75th birthday, President Jimmy \nCarter.\n  James Earl Carter, Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. \nPeanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith \nwere mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the \nUnited States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, he married Rosalynn \nSmith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III \n(Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn.\n  After seven years' service as a naval officer, Jimmy Carter returned \nto Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he \nwas elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern \ngovernors, he attracted attention by emphasizing the environment, \nefficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. I was \npleased to serve in the Georgia State Senate during his Governorship \nand to support his reform agenda.\n  Jimmy Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 \nand began a two-year campaign that quickly gained momentum. At the \nDemocratic National Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. \nHe campaigned hard, debating President Ford three times, and won the \nPresidency in 1976 by 56 electoral votes. One of the greatest honors of \nmy life was when President Carter chose me to lead the Veterans' \nAdministration. In fact, I was President Carter's first scheduled \nappointment--it was not more than a couple hours after the inauguration \nwhen he asked me to be a part of his administration. It remains one of \nmy proudest moments.\n  As President Jimmy Carter worked hard to combat the continuing \neconomic woes of inflation and unemployment by the end of his \nadministration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs \nand a decrease in the budget deficit, measured as a percentage of the \ngross national product. He dealt with the energy shortage by \nestablishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic \npetroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government \nefficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation \nof the trucking and airline industries.\n  President Carter also sought to improve the environment in many ways. \nHis expansion of the National Park System included protection of 103 \nmillion acres of Alaskan wilderness. To increase human and social \nservices, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social \nSecurity system, and appointed record numbers of women, African-\nAmericans, and Hispanics to jobs in the Federal Government.\n  In foreign affairs, Jimmy Carter set his own style. His championing \nof human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other \nnations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, \nhe helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in \nobtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the \nwork of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II \nnuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.\n  Remarkably fit and compulsively active, President Carter remains a \nleading figure on the world stage. After leaving the White House, Jimmy \nCarter returned to Georgia, where in 1982 he founded the nonprofit \nCarter Center in Atlanta to promote human rights worldwide. The Center \nhas initiated projects in more than 65 countries to resolve conflicts, \nprevent human rights abuses, build democracy, improve health, and \nrevitalize urban areas.\n  His invaluable service through his work at the Carter Center has \nearned him a record that many regard as one of the finest among any \nAmerican ex-President in history. Jimmy Carter's high-profile, high-\nstakes diplomatic missions produced a cease-fire in Bosnia and \nprevented a United States invasion of Haiti. He supervised elections in \nnewly democratic countries and has aided in the release of political \nprisoners around the world.\n  Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, still reside in Plains, Georgia \nand enjoy their ever-growing family which now includes 10 \ngrandchildren. I ask my colleagues today to join with Mrs. Carter, \nJack, Chip, Jeff, and Amy to honor President Carter on his 75th \nbirthday.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few comments on \nthe occasion of the 75th birthday of our Nation's 39th President and \nfellow Georgian, James Earl Carter.\n  I have known President Carter and his lovely wife Rosalynn since my \ndays in the Georgia State Senate, and I have always known him to be a \nvery gracious, forthright, and effective public official. Jimmy Carter \nhas dedicated his life to his country--graduate of the United States \nNaval Academy, member of the Georgia State Senate, Governor of Georgia, \nand of course, President of the United States.\n  Many former Presidents choose a slower and more relaxed lifestyle \nonce they leave office. But not Jimmy Carter. Since leaving office, he \nhas been a leading advocate for democracy, peace, and human rights \nthroughout the world. The Carter Center, headquartered in Atlanta, is \none of the most renowned organizations in the area of promoting health \nand peace in nations around the globe.\n  Mr. Carter has also been a leader in our country's struggles to end \npoverty. In 1991 he launched the Atlanta Project, an initiative aimed \nat attacking social problems associated with poverty.\n  Besides the Atlanta Project, Mr. and Mrs. Carter are regular \nvolunteers for Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization \ndedicated to ending homelessness throughout the world. As two of \nHabitat's most well-known volunteers, each year they lead the Jimmy \nCarter Work Project, a week-long event that brings together volunteers \nfrom around the world for this noble effort.\n  Mr. President, the resolution brought forward by my colleague Mr. \nCleland and myself will express the Senate's best wishes to President \nCarter on his\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\n75th birthday. I can not think of someone more deserving of this honor. \nI wish Jimmy and his wife Rosalynn well on this occasion, and encourage \nmy colleagues to do likewise. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and the preamble \nbe considered and agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table without intervening action, and any statements relating \nto the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 192) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 192\n\n       Whereas October 1, 1999, is the 75th birthday of James Earl \n     (Jimmy) Carter;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter has served his country with \n     distinction in the United States Navy, and as a Georgia State \n     Senator, the Governor of Georgia, and the President of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter has continued his service to the \n     people of the United States and the world since leaving the \n     Presidency by resolutely championing adequate housing, \n     democratic elections, human rights, and international peace;\n       Whereas in all of these endeavors, Jimmy Carter has been \n     fully and ably assisted by his wife, Rosalynn; and\n       Whereas Jimmy Carter serves as a living international \n     symbol of American integrity and compassion: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends its birthday greetings and best wishes to Jimmy \n     Carter; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to Jimmy Carter.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be the next \nDemocratic Senator to be recognized for purposes of an amendment after \nSenator Reid of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11670-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11670-S11681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I said a moment ago, and I repeat for \nemphasis, I am absolutely astonished our friends across the aisle \nrefuse to agree to the majority leader's unanimous consent agreement to \nbring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for debate \nand vote on October 7.\n  I think this refusal is significant because of the incessant \ngrandstanding that has been going on by the administration and some \nSenators and, of course, the liberal media that are not going to tell \nthe facts about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--all clamoring that \nthere is such an urgent need for immediate Senate action on the CTBT. \nIt has been proclaimed constantly that the Senate absolutely must \nratify the treaty so the United States can participate in the October 6 \nthrough 8 conference in Vienna. Yet when the majority leader offered a \nunanimous consent agreement to bring the treaty to a vote in time for \nthat conference, the same people clamored for more action, running for \nthe hills and demanding more time and making other demands.\n  If it were not so pitiful, this behavior would be amusing. I am not \ngoing to let Senators have it both ways. The same people who have been \ncriticizing the Foreign Relations Committee for inaction on the CTBT \nare now refusing to a date certain, and a timely vote on the CTBT.\n  Of course, some are hiding behind the idea that more hearings are \nneeded for a full Senate vote. Hogwash. For the record, the Committee \non Foreign Relations has held in the past 2 years alone 14 hearings in \nwhich the CTBT was extensively discussed. Most folks don't show up for \nthe hearings--the train was too late or whatever. This number of 14 \ndoes not include an even larger number of hearings held by the Armed \nServices Committee and the Intelligence Committee on CTBT relevant \nissues, nor does this include three hearings by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on the CTBT and relevant issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent this list documenting each Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Foreign Relations Committee Hearings During Which the CTBT Was \n                               Discussed\n\n       February 10, 1998--(Full Committee/Helms), 1998 Foreign \n     Policy Overview and the President's Fiscal Year 1999 Budget \n     Request.

Mr. President, at least 17 respected witnesses have \ndiscussed their views on both sides of the CTBT question in the past 2 \nyears. The administration itself has included this treaty in testimony \non five occasions. More than 113 pages of committee transcript text are \ndevoted to this subject. I have a stack of papers here that are CTBT \ntestimony and debate within the committee. A record can be made of how \nthis has been delayed and by whom.\n  Mr. President, I find it puzzling that some in the Senate are \nobjecting to the unanimous-consent request of the majority leader. The \nForeign Relations Committee has thoroughly examined this matter. We \nhave heard from experts on this very treaty. Let me share this with the \nSenate, the people listening, and the news media--that have not covered \nhearings on this matter but whose editors have said it is a disgrace \nthat a vote has not been allowed on the CTBT treaty. Here are the \npeople who have discussed the CTBT before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Let me point out, we have hearings fairly early in the morning, maybe \ntoo early for some to come. But I look on both sides of the aisle, and \nI have seen, sometimes, nobody on one side. Anyway, here is a list of \nthe people I recall having discussed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nwith the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n       The Honorable Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of State;\n       The Honorable Karl F. Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of \n     State for South Asian Affairs;\n       Mr. Robert Einhorn, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Nonproliferation;\n       The Honorable R. James Woolsey, Former Director, Central \n     Intelligence Agency;\n       Dr. Fred Ikle, Former Director, Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency;\n       The Honorable Stephen J. Solarz, Former U.S. Representative \n     from New York;\n       The Honorable William J. Schneider, Former Under Secretary \n     of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology;\n       Dr. Richard Haass, Former Senior Director, Near East and \n     South Asia, National Security Council;\n       The Honorable Stanely O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State \n     for East Asian and Pacific Affairs;\n       The Honorable James R. Schlesinger, Former Secretary of \n     Defense;\n       The Honorable Eric D. Newsom, Assistant Secretary of State \n     for Political-Military Affairs;\n       The Honorable Ronald F. Lehman, Former Director, Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Agency.\n\n  Parenthetically, I might say, not one word, as I recall, has been \npublished by the same newspapers that have been piously declaring there \nmust be action on the CTBT.\n  To continue the list:\n\n       General Eugene Habiger, Former Commander-in-Chief, U.S. \n     Strategic Command;\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\n       The Honorable Frank G. Wisner, Vice Chairman, External \n     Affairs, American International Group;\n       Dr. Stephen Cohen, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy Studies, \n     The Brookings Institution;\n       The Honorable Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of \n     State; and\n       The Honorable Richard Butler, Former Executive Chairman \n     United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM).\n  I think this record will show--it should--that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has thoroughly examined this matter. We have pleaded for \nmembers of the committee, several of them, to come to a meeting once in \na while. I have done everything I could to get this thing orderly \npresented to the Senate. All I have received are communications from \nSenators with a veiled threat if I did not proceed in some other way. \nWe have certainly talked about this treaty in more depth than many \nother treaties, to my knowledge.\n  Those who are objecting, and objected to the majority leader's \nproposition this morning, don't want more hearings; what they want is \nmore delay. You see, until a few minutes ago, until the majority leader \noffered his unanimous consent request, the same people who are now \ndemanding more hearings were ready to dispense with further debate and \ngo to a vote. Let me tell you what I mean.\n  The American people may recall, if they were watching C-SPAN, that \nPresident Clinton, in his State of the Union Address on January 27, \n1998, declared: ``I ask the Senate to approve it\" --the CTBT--and he \nsaid ``this year'' in mournful tones.\n  In other words, the President was ready for a vote in 1998. Then a \nyear later, the President said:\n\n       I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the \n     Treaty now.\n\n  ``Approve it now,'' he said. He did not say approve the CTBT after \nmore hearings.\n  On July 23, 1998, the Vice President, Mr. Gore, asked the Senate to \n``act now'' on the CTBT, and all the while the New York Times and the \nWashington Post, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, have been saying that \nHelms is holding up this treaty.\n  In February, Secretary Albright asked for approval of the CTBT ``this \nsession.'' And in April she said:\n\n       . . . the time has come to ratify the CTBT this year, this \n     session, now.\n\n  On January 12, 1999, the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, \ndeclared:\n\n       . . . it would be a terrible tragedy if our Senate failed \n     to ratify the CTBT this year.\n\n  The point I am making is that the list goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, 45 Democratic Senators wrote to me asking me to allow \na vote:\n\n       . . . with sufficient time to allow the United States to \n     actively participate [sic] in the Treaty's inaugural \n     Conference of Ratifying States. . . .\n\n  That conference begins next week.\n  At a recent press conference for the cameras, Senator Specter, my \nfriend, declared:\n\n       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was submitted to the \n     Senate months ago, and it is high time the Senate acted on \n     it.\n\n  Senator Murray called for:\n\n       . . . immediate consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty.\n\n  Senator Dorgan said that:\n\n       . . . we must get this done at least by the first of \n     October.\n\n  I must observe that the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, also had very strong words on this matter. Just 6 days ago, he \nproclaimed:\n\n       Senate Republicans have permitted a small number of Members \n     from within their ranks to manipulate Senate rules--\n\n  I wonder how we did that when I was not looking. No rules have been \nmanipulated, and I resent the inference. But to continue his quote--\n\n       from within their ranks to manipulate Senate rules and \n     procedures to prevent the Senate from acting on the CTBT. . . \n     . I would hope we would soon see some leadership on the \n     Republican side of the aisle to break the current impasse and \n     allow the full Senate to act on the CTBT . . . That effort \n     must begin today.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope when we get to the debate, however long it \nlasts, that we will not have the spectacle of Senator Kennedy again and \nagain offering his minimum wage amendment. He keeps it in his hip \npocket all the time and pulls it out anytime he can stick it up, and he \nwill debate it for an hour or 2. We have to have some understanding \nabout what we are going to debate, when we do debate, and I hope we \nwill debate on the terms the Senator from Mississippi, the majority \nleader, offered.\n  I think all this speaks well of the majority leader, and I \ncongratulate him.\n  I congratulate him for having the will to do this because this has \nbeen insulting on many occasions as a political issue, which it is not.\n  I hope the Senate Democrats will reconsider their refusal to agree to \na CTBT vote after having demanded it so often.\n  Let me go back in time a little bit. I have been waiting for the \nPresident of the United States to follow up on his written commitment \nto me that he will send up the ABM Treaty, and I have been hoping to \nsee a treaty on two or three other things.\n  I am not in the mood to leave the American people naked against a \nvery possible missile attack, and that has been my problem. The \nPresident of the United States has insisted on keeping the ABM Treaty \nalive when that would forbid anything happening in terms of defending \nthe security of the American people. I was unwilling to do that until \nhe followed through on his written guarantee to me that he would send \nthe ABM Treaty to me and to the Senate.\n  I trust in the future that the media will, for once, acknowledge some \nof their statements regarding the CTBT for what they have really said \nbecause it is inaccurate and misleading to the American people.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Carolina, \nfor whom I have great respect, it is not and will never be my intention \nto prevent him from speaking on the floor. That was not the purpose of \nthe unanimous consent request or the objections.\n  I have talked to him personally about this issue. He feels very \nstrongly about it, as the Senator from Delaware indicated. The Senator, \nwho is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has a right to \nfeel very strongly about his position. I respect that very much. This \nis an issue that is very important to this country and, in my judgment, \nto the world.\n  We have a circumstance where 154 countries have become signatories to \nsomething called the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Forty-seven \ncountries have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This \ncountry has not.\n  Mr. President, 737 days ago or so, this treaty was sent to the Senate \nby this administration; 737 days later we have not acted on this \ntreaty. Some feel very strongly this treaty is not good for our \ncountry. The majority leader made that case. The chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Senator from North Carolina, makes \nthat case. They have strong feelings about it. I respect that. Other \npeople have strong feelings on the other side, including myself.\n  I believe strongly this country has a moral responsibility in the \nworld to lead on the question of the nonproliferation of nuclear \nweapons. Not many countries have access to nuclear weapons or possess \nnuclear weapons. Many would like to. How do we prevent the spread of \nnuclear weapons in this world, at a time when the shadow of nuclear \ntests recently made by India and Pakistan suggest there is an appetite \nfor acquisition of nuclear weapons and testing of nuclear weapons? Two \ncountries that do not like each other and share a common border explode \nnuclear weapons literally under each other's chins. Shouldn't that tell \nus there are serious challenges ahead with respect to nuclear weapons \nand the spread of nuclear weapons? I think so.\n  A unanimous consent request was propounded by the majority leader to \nbring up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next week. As far as I am \nconcerned, it is all right with me. I have been suggesting it ought to \nbe brought up for a debate. It probably would be better if there was a \nhearing first and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other respected \nfolks came and set out their views and then, a couple of days later, \ndebate it and vote on it. That would probably be a better course.\n  Even in the absence of that, as far as I am concerned, bring it up. \nThe Democratic leader said he thought 10 hours was probably not enough \ntime. The majority leader said in response we can\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\nperhaps lengthen that. Maybe, based on that discussion, there can be an \nagreement today. I hope so. This ought to be brought up for a vote. I \ndo not think the objection by the Democratic leader was an objection to \nsay it ought not be brought up. He was concerned about time. It \noccurred to me from the response of the majority leader that can be \nworked out. In any event, as far as I am concerned, bring it up next \nweek. Let's have a debate next week and a vote next week.\n  Twenty-one nations have ratified this treaty since the beginning of \nthis year. Most of our allies have ratified this treaty, but we have \nnot. Some say it is dangerous, as the majority leader alleged today, \nusing the term ``dangerous'' for this country. Others say it is not in \nthis country's interest, that it will weaken this country, leave us \nunprotected.\n  Let me describe some of the support for this treaty, going back to \nPresident Eisenhower who pushed very hard in the final term of his \nPresidency to get a treaty of this type. General Shelton, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, supports this treaty and testified \nrecently again in support of the treaty. Four previous Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff--General Shalikashvili, Gen. Colin Powell, \nAdmiral Crowe, and Gen. David Jones--also endorse that same position, \nthat the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is good for this country \nand ought to be ratified by this Senate.\n\n  Does anyone really feel Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, and \nGeneral Shelton would take a position that they think will weaken this \ncountry? Are they the extreme left? Are they the folks who, on the \nextreme of politics in this country, believe we ought to disarm? I do \nnot think so. The Secretary of Defense supports this treaty and \nbelieves it ought to be ratified. I would not expect that he and Colin \nPowell and Admiral Crowe and all of those folks would do so unless they \nfelt very strongly that this treaty is in this country's interest.\n  A former Member of this body, Senator Hatfield, someone for whom I \nhave the greatest respect, offered some sound advice on this subject. \nSenator Hatfield, incidentally, was one of the first servicemen to walk \nin the streets of Hiroshima after the nuclear strike on that city. I \nwant to read what former Senator Hatfield said to us. He said:\n\n       It is clear to me that ratifying this treaty would be in \n     the national interest, and it is equally clear that Senators \n     have a responsibility to the world, to the Nation and their \n     constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the \n     Senate to consider this treaty.\n\n  He, perhaps better than anybody in this body, understands the horror \nof nuclear weapons, having walked the streets of Hiroshima after the \nstrike on that city.\n  I quoted the other day Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union who \nwarned that in a nuclear war the living would envy the dead.\n  The question for this country is, Will we stand and provide world \nleadership on the issue of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons or \nwill we decide it is not our country's responsibility; it is someone \nelse's responsibility? Let England do it. Let France do it. Let Germany \ndo it. Let Canada do it.\n\n  We are the only country in the world with the capability of providing \nsignificant leadership in this area. We must, in my judgment, ratify \nthis treaty.\n  There are safeguards in this treaty. I will not spend much more time \ndiscussing it right now because we are on another piece of legislation, \nand that is important, too. But I make these comments because the \nsafeguards in this treaty are quite clear.\n  This is not a case where this country will ratify a treaty that, in \neffect, disarms us. We are not conducting explosive tests of nuclear \nweapons now. We have unilaterally decided--7 years ago--we are not \nexploding nuclear weapons.\n  What contribution would be made by a test ban treaty? Simply this: If \nyou cannot test your weaponry, you have no notion and no certainty that \nany weapons you develop are weapons that work. We have known for 30 and \n40 years that the ability to suppress the testing of nuclear weapons \nwill be the first step, albeit a moderate step, in halting the spread \nof nuclear weapons. This, in my judgment, in fact, is not a moderate \nstep--this is a baby step.\n  If we cannot take this baby step on this important treaty, how on \nEarth are we going to do the heavy lifting that is necessary following \nthis that will lead to the mutual reduction in the stockpile of nuclear \narms? Tens of thousands of nuclear arms--30,000 nuclear weapons between \nus and Russia alone.\n  How are we going to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and halt \nthe spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and reduce the threat \nthat comes from the nuclear weapons tests that occurred in Pakistan and \nIndia? How on Earth are we going to provide the leadership that is \nnecessary, the tough leadership that is necessary in these areas if we \ncannot take this small step to ratify a treaty that has been signed by \n154 countries now, and that makes so much sense, and that our Joint \nChiefs of Staff have said represents this country's interests? How on \nEarth are we going to do the tough work if we cannot take this first \nstep?\n  I have a lot more to say on this subject. I have expressed to the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, it is not my intention to \nbe an irritant to anybody in this Chamber personally. I do not ever \nintend to suggest that someone who believes differently than I do is \ntaking that position for any other reason except for the passion they \nhave about this country and the policies they think will strengthen it.\n  But we have a very significant disagreement about this issue. It is a \nvery significant and important issue. I believe in my heart very \nstrongly this country has a responsibility to lead in the right way on \nthis matter.\n  My hope is the unanimous consent request propounded by the majority \nleader--if there is more time needed; and the majority leader indicated \nthat he was agreeable to that--my hope is that before the end of today \nwe will have an agreement on when it will be brought to the floor, and \nthen let's have a robust, aggressive, thoughtful debate so the country \ncan understand what this means. Then let's have a vote and decide \nwhether this country decides to ratify this important treaty that has \nbeen discussed for some 40 years--whether this country will take the \nfirst step that will help halt the spread of nuclear weapons around the \nworld.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course I will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I wish to commend our colleague for the very \nforthright way in which he has, for some period of time, expressed his \nstrong views, the need for this treaty to be considered by the Senate. \nI strongly support the request of the majority leader, and I share with \nyou the hope that our leadership can work this out and we can move \nexpeditiously.\n  I assure my colleague, I have just had the opportunity to speak with \nmy distinguished ranking member, Senator Levin. The Armed Services \nCommittee will promptly conduct hearings regarding that area for which \nwe have oversight responsibility.\n  The point I wish to make to my colleague is, it is going to require \nthe most careful consideration by all Senators to reach this vote. Much \nof the relative material that convinces this Senator to oppose the \ntreaty simply cannot be disclosed in open. I am going to urge our \ncolleagues, and I am sure with the assistance of our leadership, we can \nprovide more than one opportunity for each Senator to learn the full \nrange of facts regarding this treaty and its implications for this \nNation.\n  Yes, I want to see America lead, but I want to make certain that \nleadership role that exists today can exist a decade hence, 15 years, \n20 years hence. That is the absolute heart of this debate: What steps \ndo we take now to ensure that our country can maintain its position of \nworld leadership in the decades to come?\n  We shall develop the facts, those of us who are most respectful of \nyour viewpoint, as I am sure you are of mine. It will be a historic \nvote for this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. One of my deep regrets is that he does not support this \ntreaty because I have great respect for him and have worked with him on \na number of matters. He truly knows this area and studies this area. \nThere is room for disagreement.\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\n  But I say, again, that Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, \nGeneral Shelton, and so many others have reviewed all of the same \nmaterial--much of it secret material, secret documents--and have come \nto a different conclusion, believing that this treaty is very important \nfor this country and that it is very important to ratify this treaty.\n  But my hope mirrors that of Senator Warner, that when we have this \ndebate, we will have a debate about ideas and about the kind of public \npolicy that will benefit this country and the world, the kind of public \npolicy that will allow us to continue to be strong, to have the \ncapability to defend our liberty and freedom, but the kind of policy \nthat will also provide leadership so this country can help prevent the \nspread of nuclear weapons in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I first acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan, who has called the attention of this Congress and this \nSenate to this important issue. I hope his efforts will prevail in \nbringing this issue to the floor of the Senate.\n  In my lifetime, it is interesting to look back and reflect on things \nwhich were so commonplace and now are so rare. I can recall, as a child \nin the 1950's, in my classroom when we were being instructed about the \nneed to ``duck and cover,'' the possibility that there might be an \nattack on the United States of America. That was generated by the fact \nthat the Soviets had detonated a nuclear weapon. We were technically \nemerging into a cold war, and there was a belief that we had to be \nprepared for the possibility of an attack.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, when my wife and I bought a little \nhouse, the first house we ever owned--1600 South Lincoln Avenue; an \nappropriate name in Springfield, IL--we moved into the house and went \nin the basement and were startled to find a fallout shelter that had \nbeen built to specifications. Someone had believed in the 1960s this \nwas an appropriate thing to put in a house in Springfield, IL, because \nof the possibility that we may face some sort of attack, a nuclear \nattack on the United States.\n  You can remember the monthly air raid sirens that used to call our \nattention to the fact that we had a system to warn all of America of a \npotential attack. You may remember, not that many years ago, movies on \ntelevision and long debates about a ``nuclear winter,'' what would \nhappen with a nuclear holocaust.\n  That conversation was part of daily life in America for decades. Then \nwith the end of the cold war, and the disintegration of the Soviet \nUnion, and the Warsaw Pact nations not only leaving the Soviet \ndomination but gravitating toward the West--with countries such as \nPoland and Hungary and Czechoslovakia coming to join NATO--many of us \nhave been lulled into a false sense of security that the threat of \nnuclear weapons is no longer something we should take seriously. In \nfact, we should.\n  In fact, we are reminded, from time to time, that the so-called \nnuclear club--the nations which have nuclear capability--continues to \ngrow. That is why this particular treaty and this debate are so \nimportant.\n  One of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Threat assessments \nregularly warn us of the possibility that North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or \nsome other nation may acquire or develop nuclear weapons. Our most \nbasic interest in relations with Russia today is to see that it \ncontrols its nuclear weapons and technology and that Russian scientists \ndo not come to the aid of would-be nuclear proliferators. In other \nwords, in a desperate state of affairs, with the Russian economy, we \nare concerned that some people will decide they have a marketable idea, \nthat they can go to some rogue nation and sell the idea of developing a \nnuclear weapon, adding another member to the nuclear club, increasing \nthe instability in this world.\n\n  Congress spends millions of dollars to fight nuclear proliferation, \nto stop the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide, and to support the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n  For the past several years, I have been involved in an Aspen \nInstitute exchange, which has opened my eyes to the need for our \nconcern in this area. Senator Lugar is a regular participant as well, \nand Senator Nunn has been there in the past, when we have met with \nmembers of the Russian Duma and leaders from that country and have \nlearned of the very real concern they have of the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons still sitting in the old Soviet Union, a stockpile of weapons \nwhich, unfortunately for us, has to be minded all the time for fear \nthat the surveillance, the inspection, and the safety would degrade to \nthe point that there might be an accidental detonation. Those are the \nvery real problems we face, and we vote on these regularly.\n  Yet we in the Senate, despite all of these realities, have had \nlanguished in the committee one of the most effective tools for \nfighting nuclear proliferation--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a \ntreaty which, as the Senator from North Dakota indicated, has been \nratified by over 130 nations but not by the United States of America.\n  The idea of banning nuclear tests is not a new one. It is one of the \noldest items on the nuclear arms control agenda. Test bans were called \nfor by both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Steps were taken toward \na ban in the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, but other incremental \nsteps were eschewed in favor of a comprehensive treaty.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a key piece of the broader \npicture of nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. Consider this: \nWhen nonnuclear countries--those that don't have nuclear weapons--agree \nthey are not going to have a nuclear arsenal and sign the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, an essential part of that bargain for the smaller \nnations, the nonnuclear powers, and those that have it, was that \nnuclear countries were going to control and reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons.\n  An integral part of that effort is this treaty. It is virtually \nimpossible to make qualitative improvements in nuclear weapons or \ndevelop them for the first time without testing. Just a few months ago, \nthe Senate overwhelmingly voted to reorganize the Department of Energy \nbecause of our deep concern about what secrets may have been stolen \nfrom our nuclear labs. The potential damage from this espionage is \ndisturbing.\n  In the case of China, the entry into force of this treaty could help \nmitigate the effect of the loss of our nuclear secrets. More than old \ncomputer codes and blueprints would be needed to deploy more advanced \nnuclear weapons. Extensive testing would be required. In the cases of \nIndia and Pakistan, U.S. ratification of this treaty would pressure \nboth countries to sign the treaty, as they pledged to do following \ntheir nuclear test last year.\n\n  In fact, the leadership role of the United States is essential to \nencourage the ratification of the treaty by many other nations. If the \nleading nuclear power in the world, the United States of America, fails \nto ratify this treaty to stop nuclear testing, why should any other \ncountry? The United States has a responsibility of moral leadership. \nMany who take such pride in our Nation and its role and voice in the \nworld tremble when faced with the burden of leadership. The burden of \nleadership comes down to our facing squarely the need to ratify this \ntreaty.\n  The United States has declared that its own nuclear testing program \nhas been discontinued, but it is still absolutely in our national \ninterest to be part of a multinational monitoring and verification \nregime. That way we can shape and benefit from that same regime. The \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty says if the treaty has not been entered \ninto force 3 years after its being open for signing, the states that \nhave ratified it may convene a special conference to decide by \nconsensus what measures consistent with international law can be taken \nto facilitate its entry into force.\n  Only those states that have ratified it would be given full voting \nprivileges. The special conference is going to take place this fall. It \nwill set up monitoring and verification of nuclear testing worldwide so \nthe components will\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\nbe operating by the time the treaty does enter into force. This regime \nwill include the International Data Center and many other elements that \nare important for success.\n  The United States should be part of that process, but it will not be, \nbecause the Senate has not voted on this treaty. This country certainly \nconducts its own monitoring for nuclear tests, but if we participate in \nan international regime, our country can benefit from a comprehensive \ninternational system. It is important to recall that if China or Russia \nwere to resume testing, the United States, under this treaty, would \nhave the right to withdraw and resume our own, if that is necessary for \nour national defense.\n  If the United States does not ratify the treaty in the first place, \nhowever, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may never enter into force. \nWe would be faced with the prospect, once again, of a major nuclear \npower's resuming nuclear testing. When President Eisenhower and \nPresident Kennedy called for a nuclear test ban, a major impetus was \nthe public outcry over environmental damage caused by these tests.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Congressional Record at this \npoint a letter I received from major national environmental \norganizations supporting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and decrying \nthe environmental damage to both our national security and our planet \nif the treaty is not ratified.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n      Re: Major national environmental organizations' support of \n                     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin: We urge the Senate to give its consent \n     to ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty this year. The \n     timing is critical so that the United States can participate \n     in this fall's special international conference of Treaty \n     ratifiers.\n       We support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) because \n     it is a valuable instrument in stemming the proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons and reducing the environmental and security \n     threats posed by nuclear arms races. Under the CTBT, non-\n     nuclear weapons states will be barred from carrying out the \n     nuclear explosions needed to develop compact, high-yield \n     nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles and confidently \n     certify nuclear explosive performance. The Treaty is \n     therefore vital to preventing the spread of nuclear missile \n     capability to additional states. In addition, the Treaty will \n     limit the ability of the existing nuclear weapons states to \n     build new and destabilizing types of nuclear weapons.\n       Since 1945, seven nations have conducted over 2,050 nuclear \n     test explosions--an average of one test every 10 days. \n     Atmospheric tests spread dangerous levels of radioactive \n     fallout downwind and into the global atmosphere. Underground \n     nuclear blasts spread highly radioactive material into the \n     earth and each one creates a permanent nuclear waste site. \n     This contamination presents long-term hazards to nearby water \n     sources and surrounding communities. Also, many underground \n     tests have vented radioactive gases into the atmosphere, \n     including some of those conducted by the United States. Of \n     course, the ultimate threat to the environment posed by \n     nuclear testing is the continuing and possibly increasing \n     risk of nuclear war posed by proliferating nuclear arsenals.\n       In addition to protecting the environment, the CTBT will \n     enhance U.S. security with its extensive monitoring system \n     and short-notice, on-site inspections. These will improve our \n     ability to discourage all states from engaging in the testing \n     of nuclear weapons.\n       Ending nuclear testing has been a goal of governments, \n     scientists, and ordinary citizens from all walks of life for \n     over forty years. The CTBT has already been ratified by many \n     other nations, including France, the United Kingdom, and \n     Japan. The vast majority of Americans support approval of the \n     CTBT. The effort in this country to stop nuclear testing that \n     began with public outrage about nuclear fallout and has been \n     pursued by American Presidents since Dwight Eisenhower can \n     now be achieved. With U.S. leadership on the CTBT, entry into \n     force is within reach. It is vital that the U.S. set the \n     example on this important environmental and security issue; \n     with your leadership and support, the CTBT can finally be \n     realized.\n           Yours sincerely,\n         Rodger Schlickeisen, President, Defenders of Wildlife; \n           Mike Casey, Vice-President for Public Affairs, \n           Environmental Working Group; Matt Petersen, Executive \n           Director, Global Green USA; John Adams, Executive \n           Director, Natural Resources Defense Counsel; Amy Coen, \n           President Population Action International; James K. \n           Wyerman, Executive Director, 20/20 Vision; Brian Dixon, \n           Director of Government Relations, Zero Population \n           Growth; Fred D. Krupp, Executive Director, \n           Environmental Defense Fund; Brent Blackwelder, \n           President, Friends of the Earth; Phil Clapp, President, \n           National Environmental Trust; Robert K. Musil, \n           Executive Director, Physicians for Social \n           Responsibility; Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra \n           Club; Bud Ris, Executive Director, Union of Concerned \n           Scientists.\n\n  This is a letter that has been circulated and signed by the leaders \nof at least a dozen major environmental groups. I note in the letter it \nstates that since 1945, the last 54 years, seven nations in this world \nhave conducted 2,050 nuclear test explosions, an average of 1 test \nevery 10 days, leaving nuclear fallout, radioactive gases, in many \ninstances, in our atmosphere. We certainly never want to return to that \nday again. Unless the United States is a full partner in this \ninternational effort to reduce nuclear testing, that is a possibility \nlooming on the horizon.\n  Senator Helms, who spoke on the floor earlier, has said he puts this \ntreaty in line behind amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nand the Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. convention on global climate change, \nboth of which the President has not yet submitted to the Senate. My \ncolleague says that ABM changes are essential for the national missile \ndefense to move forward, which is true. But national missile defense \ndoes not yet work. We don't have this technology to build an umbrella \nof protection over the United States so that any nuclear missile fired \non us can somehow be stopped in the atmosphere without danger to the \npeople living in this country.\n  If we decide to deploy such a defense, we will need to negotiate more \nABM Treaty changes. That is something in the future. We have time to \naddress that. But we also need to accept the immediate responsibility \nof ratifying this treaty. Not too many months ago in this Chamber, we \npassed a resolution which says if the national missile defense system \nor so-called star wars system should become technologically possible, \nwe will spend whatever it takes to build it. I have to tell you that I \nvoted against it. I thought it was not wise policy.\n  Quite honestly, the idea that we are somehow going to insulate the \nUnited States by building this umbrella and therefore don't have to \ndeal with the world and its problems in nuclear proliferation, in my \nmind, is the wrong way to go. We should be working diplomatically as \nwell as militarily for the defense of the United States. When we have \nthe support of the commanders of the Nation, of course, and those who \nare in charge, the Joint Chiefs, time and again for this treaty, it is \nevidence to me that it is sound military policy.\n  In short, Mr. President, I conclude by saying, we must not delay any \nlonger. We must ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know my colleagues are anxious to get to \nthe business at hand. I assure the floor I will take only 5 minutes. If \nthe clerk will let me know when I am headed towards 5 minutes, I would \nappreciate it.\n  I will refrain from responding and speaking to the Test Ban Treaty at \nlength at this moment.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is not only a \ncolleague, but he is a personal friend. We have strong disagreements on \nthis issue.\n  I don't mean to nickel and dime this, but we haven't had any hearings \non the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  At the outset, I send to the desk a list of all the hearings the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee had for the 105th and 106th \nCongress's since submission of the CTBT.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Activities\n\n       January 8, 1999, Informal State Department Briefing on \n     Peacekeeping.\n       January 27, 1999 (Subcommittee on International Economic \n     Policy, Export, and Trade Promotion/Hagel), IMF Reform and \n     the Global Financial Crisis.\n       January 29, 1999, Informal State Department Briefing on \n     Peacekeeping.\n       February 5, 1999, Informal State Department Briefing on \n     Peacekeeping.\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\n       February 24, 1999 (Full Committee/Helms), 1999 Foreign \n     Policy Overview and the President's Fiscal Year 2000 Foreign \n     Affairs Budget Request.\n       February 24, 1999 (Subcommittee on European Affairs/Smith), \n     Anti-Semitism in Russia.

Mr. President, I can understand why the Senator may think \nwe have had hearings because we have had hearings on other subjects \nthat implicate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is mentioned by \nwitnesses. But we have never had a hearing on the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty--a treaty of great consequence to the United States and the \nworld--conducted in the traditional way. We never had a hearing where \nwe said this is what we are going to talk about. We need a hearing \nwhere we bring up the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of Defense, or major voices in America who oppose this \ntreaty--fortunately, I think there are not that many--or significant \nfigures and scientists who have spoken and know about this issue. We \nhaven't had one of those hearings at all.\n  I submit for the Record, again, a letter from the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee sent to the President of the United States \non January 21, 1998, with a concluding paragraph, which reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Mr. President, let me be clear. I will be prepared to \n     schedule Committee consideration of the CTBT only after the \n     Senate has had an opportunity to consider and vote on the \n     Kyoto Protocol and the amendments to the ABM Treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As congress prepares to reconvene \n     shortly, I am convinced that it is important to share with \n     you the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's agenda relating \n     to consideration of treaties during the second year of the \n     105th Congress.\n       There are a number of important treaties which the \n     Committee intends to take up during 1998, and we must be \n     assured of your Administration's cooperation in making \n     certain that these treaties receive a comprehensive \n     examination by the Senate.\n       Mr. President, the Committee's first priority when Congress \n     reconvenes will be to work with you and Secretary Albright to \n     secure Senate ratification of NATO expansion. The expansion \n     of the Atlantic Alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic is of critical importance, and we have come a \n     long way in resolving some of the concerns that I, and other \n     Senators, had raised about various details of this expansion \n     (e.g., ensuring an equitable distribution of costs, limiting \n     Russian influence in NATO decision making, et al.)\n       While much work remains to be done, I am confident that if \n     we continue to work together, the Senate will vote to approve \n     the expansion of the Atlantic Alliance early this Spring.\n       Following the vote on NATO expansion, the Committee will \n     turn its attention to several other critical treaties which \n     could affect both the security of the American people and the \n     health of the United States' economy. Chief among these are \n     the agreements on Multilateralization and Demarcation of the \n     1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, and the Kyoto \n     Protocol to the UN Convention on Climate Change.\n       Mr. President, I feel obliged to make clear to you my \n     concern that your Administration has been unwisely and \n     unnecessarily engaged in delay in submitting these treaties \n     to the Senate for its advice and consent.\n       Despite your commitment, made nearly eight months ago, to \n     submit the amendments to the ABM Treaty to the Senate, we \n     have yet to see them. As our current stand-off with Iraq \n     clearly demonstrates, the danger posed by rogue states \n     possessing weapons\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n\n     of mass destruction is growing--and, with it, the need for a \n     robust ballistic missile defense.\n       The Senate has not had an opportunity to consider the \n     rationale behind the ABM Treaty since that treaty was \n     ratified nearly 26 years ago, in the midst of the Cold War. \n     The world has changed a great deal since then. It is vital \n     that the Senate conduct a thorough review of the ABM Treaty \n     this year when it considers and votes on the ABM \n     Multilateralization and Demarcation agreements.\n       Similarly, the Senate is forced to continue to wait for any \n     indication that your Administration intends to submit the \n     Kyoto Protocol for the Senate's advice and consent. Indeed, I \n     have heard a great deal of discussion from supporters of this \n     treaty indicating that the Administration may attempt to \n     circumvent both the Senate--and the American people--by \n     simply imposing the treaty's requirements on U.S. businesses \n     by executive order. Mr. President, I must respectfully \n     counsel this would be extremely unwise.\n       This treaty clearly requires the advice and consent of the \n     Senate. further, because the potential impact of the Kyoto \n     Protocol on the American economy is so enormous, we owe it to \n     the American people to let them know sooner, rather than \n     later, whether they will be subject to the terms of this \n     treaty.\n       Ironically, while the Administration has delayed in \n     submitting these vital treaties to the Senate, some in your \n     Administration have indicated that the White House will press \n     the Senate for swift ratification of the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately following the vote on NATO \n     expansion.\n       Such a deliberate confrontation would be exceedingly unwise \n     because, Mr. President, the CTBT is very low on the \n     Committee's list of priorities. The treaty has no chance of \n     entering into force for a decade or more. Article 14 of the \n     CTBT explicitly prevents the treaty's entry into force until \n     it has been ratified by 44 specific nations. One of those 44 \n     nations is North Korea, which is unlikely to ever ratify the \n     treaty. Another of the 44 nations--India--has sought to block \n     the CTBT at every step: vetoing it in the Conference on \n     Disarmament so that it could not be submitted as a Conference \n     document. India has opposed it in the United Nations. And, \n     India has declared that it will not even sign the treaty.\n       By contrast, the issues surrounding the ABM Treaty and the \n     Kyoto Protocol are far more pressing (e.g., the growing \n     threat posed by nuclear, biological, or chemical tipped \n     missiles, and the potential impact of the Kyoto Protocol on \n     the U.S. economy).\n       Mr. President, let me be clear: I will be prepared to \n     schedule Committee consideration of the CTBT only after the \n     Senate has had the opportunity to consider and vote on the \n     Kyoto Protocol and the amendments to the ABM Treaty.\n       When the Administration has submitted these treaties, and \n     when the Senate has completed its consideration of them, \n     then, and only then, will the Foreign Relations Committee \n     consider the CTBT.\n       Mr. President, please let's work together, beginning with \n     the effort to secure Senate ratification of NATO expansion \n     this Spring, and then with your timely transmittal of these \n     treaties.\n           Sincerely and respectfully,\n                                                      Jesse Helms.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the chairman has been true to his word. He \nhas had no hearings because that has not been done yet.\n  I think I understand how the Senator from North Carolina connects the \nrationale of these treaties, and he thinks the orderly way to do it is \nto do it only after we do other things, but that makes the point. We \nhave had no hearings on this treaty.\n  I think the public may be surprised to know this treaty calls for no \nmore nuclear testing by the United States and other nations. We haven't \nbeen testing. There is a moratorium on nuclear testing. That occurred \nin 1992 in the Bush administration.\n  What we are talking about doing that my friends are talking about is \nso dangerous and damaging to U.S. interests; that is, to sign a treaty \nto say we will not test, we are not testing now. The United States made \na unilateral decision not to test.\n  Now we have the rest of the world ready to sign up, and we are saying \nwe are not going to ratify, or up to now we are saying we are not even \ngoing to have a hearing on this subject.\n  Again, I will get into the merits of the treaty later because I am \nconfident the leadership of the Senate will come up now with the \nproposal as to how to proceed.\n  But I urge my friend from North Carolina, and I urge my colleagues to \nurge my friend from North Carolina, to hold hearings. Bring the experts \nup. Bring the military up.\n  By the way, one last substantive thing I will say about the treaty is \nthat we are the only nation in the world that has spent billions of \ndollars and committed billions in the future to a method by which we \ncan take our existing stockpile of nuclear weapons and test them for \ntheir continued utility without ever exploding them. I will explain in \ndetail later what I mean by the stockpiling program we have.\n  We, of all nations in the world, are the one best prepared and best \nsuited for taking the last chance of any nation in the world to promise \nnot to test because we are one of the few nations in the world with \ncertainty that can guarantee that even if we don't test weapons we can \ntest, by exploding them, their continued utility by very complicated, \nvery sophisticated scientific computer models that we have designed. We \nhave committed that we will continue in the future to fund to the tune \nof billions of dollars this program.\n  In a strange way, if you went out to the public at large and said: By \nthe way, do you think we should sign a treaty that says we can't test \nnuclear weapons if the rest of the world signs a treaty that says you \ncan't test nuclear weapons, knowing that we can detect all but those \nkinds of explosions that will not have any impact on another nuclear \ncapability, when we have already decided not to test unilaterally, and \nwe are the only nation in the world that has the sophistication and \ncapacity to test by means other than exploding our nuclear arsenal; \nwhat do you think the public would say?\n  I conclude by saying this: We have had no hearings. There is a \nlegitimate debate about whether or not we should do this.\n  This is a thing for which the Senate was conceived--to make big \ndecisions such as this.\n  This is the reason the founders wrote in a provision in the U.S. \nConstitution that said a treaty can be negotiated by a President, but \nit can only come into effect after the Senate has ratified it. It \ndidn't say the House. It didn't say a referendum. It didn't say the \nAmerican people. It said the Senate. Other than the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, in a decision of who should sit on it, there is no \nother function that is of greater consequence that the Senate performs \nthan determining whether to ratify or reject a treaty with the United \nStates of America.\n\n  It seems to me that when we exercise that function, we should do it \nresponsibly and thoroughly.\n  We have never done it on a matter of grave consequence without \nthoroughly investigating it through the hearing process and through one \nof the oldest committees that exists in the Senate--the Foreign \nRelations Committee--the unique function of which is to recommend to \nthis body what our bipartisan considered opinion is after hearing the \ndetails of the treaty.\n  I look forward to the debate.\n  I have urged the President of the United States--I will urge him \npersonally--and have urged the administration, if this date is set, \nthat the President take this case directly to the American people on a \nnationally televised broadcast and lay out for them what the stakes \nare.\n  This is no small decision. This is a vote that I promise you, whether \nyou are for it or against it, your children and your grandchildren and \nhistory will know how you cast it. I am not so smart to know exactly \nwhat the outcome will be in history's judgment, but I am certain of one \nthing: You are not going to be in a position where you can say at a \nlater date this was a vote of little consequence.\n  Mr. President, as folks back home in Delaware say, this is what we \nget paid the big bucks for. This is why we are here. This is the \npurpose of our being here.\n  It is true. The amendments we are going to discuss on legislation \nthat is before us are important. It is true that some of it will affect \nthe lives of hundreds or thousands of Americans. But I can't think of \nanything we will do in this entire Congress or have done in the \nprevious Congress that has the potential to have as much impact on the \nfate of the world as this treaty. I cannot think of anything. I defy \nanyone to tell me, whether they are for or against this treaty, what we \ncould be discussing of greater consequence than how to deal with the \nprospect of an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust.\n  Tell me if there is anything more important to discuss than whether \nor not over the next days, weeks, months,\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\nyears, and decades we should make a judgment from both a survival as \nwell as environmental standpoint that we will or will not continue to \nblow up, in the atmosphere or underground, nuclear weapons. I defy \nanyone to tell me what is more important to discuss.\n  That is not to suggest that those who think this treaty is a bad idea \nare motivated by anything other than good intentions. As my dear mother \nwould say and as the nuns used to make me write on the blackboard after \nschool when I misbehaved: The road to hell is paved with good \nintentions.\n  Failure to ratify this treaty, I firmly believe, paves the road to \nhell--to nuclear hell. I don't know whether it will work, but I am \nvirtually certain in my mind--just Joe Biden, my mind--that if we do \nnot ratify this treaty, we virtually lose any ability to control the \nproliferation of nuclear capability.\n  They talked about when the Russians detonated their first hydrogen \nbomb. I am not sure, but I think it was Edward Teller who said: Now we \nhave two scorpions in the bottle. I am here to tell my colleagues what \nthey already know. We have many more than two scorpions in that bottle \nnow. If we do not begin to take a chance, a very small chance, on a \ntreaty that says no more detonation of nuclear weapons, we will have \ndozens of scorpions in that bottle with not nearly as much to lose as \nthe former Soviet empire and the United States.\n  There was one advantage when there was a Soviet empire: They had as \nmuch to lose as they had to gain. The only person I worry about in a \ncontest of any kind--athletic, political, or as a representative of the \nFederal Government of the United States of America with another \ncountry--I don't like dealing with someone else who has little to lose \nbut has significant capacity to inflict a vast amount of damage.\n  While I have the floor, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter. My friend from Pennsylvania has been one of the most outspoken \nproponents of bringing up this treaty. I am sure it will be before the \nSenate because of his advocacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may have the attention of the Senator from \nDelaware, I do believe it is important for the Senate to consider the \ntreaty. I support it. I believe it is very difficult for the United \nStates to use moral suasion on India and Pakistan not to have nuclear \ntests if we have not moved forward on the ratification process.\n  However, I ask my colleague from Delaware about the problems of \nconsidering the treaty on this state of the record where we have been \nlooking for some expert guidance on some questions which are \noutstanding as to whether there can be an adequate determination of our \npreparedness without having tests.\n  One thing we have to consider very carefully is whether the interests \nof disarmament will be promoted by pressing to bring the treaty now, \nwhich may result without the two-thirds ratification, as opposed to \ntrying to clear up some concerns which some have expressed.\n  I am prepared to vote in favor of the treaty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond to the Senator, he raised the $64 \nquestion. He and I have been discussing how to get this up for a long \ntime, over 2 years. He will recall, last year, I was of the view I did \nnot want to take a chance of having the treaty up for fear it could be \ndefeated before we had the ability to get all the data before the \nSenate that I believed would persuade Senators to overwhelmingly \nsupport the treaty.\n  I changed my mind. The reason I changed my mind is--I have great \nrespect for my friend from North Carolina, Senator Helms--I have \nlearned one thing: When he says something ain't going to happen, it \nain't going to happen on his watch. He made it very clear, there will \nbe no hearings on this treaty. I have been with him for 27 years. We \nare truly personal friends. I know when he says it, he means it, which \nmeans I have lost any hope that he will be persuaded, or be persuaded \nby his Republican colleagues in the caucus, to have hearings.\n  I then reached the second conclusion: We are hurtling toward a \ndisaster on the subcontinent with India and Pakistan, and with Korea. \nAs the Senator knows, if they arm, if they deploy, we will see China \nmaking a judgment to increase its nuclear arsenal and we will see the \nlikelihood that Korea will not be able to be leveraged.\n  Here is the point. I have made the judgment, for me--and I may be \nwrong--if we don't agree to this proposal, we will get no vote on this \ntreaty for 2 years and the effect will be the same.\n  I am being very blunt. I believe I am looking for the political God's \nwill to have people have a little bit of an altar call. It is one thing \nto say privately you are against the treaty or to say you are for it \nbut there is no vote on it. It is another thing to be the man or woman \nwho walks up in that well and casts the 34th vote against the treaty \nand kills the treaty. They will have on their head--and they may turn \nout to be right--and they will be determining by their vote the single \nmost significant decision made relative to arms, nuclear arms, that has \nbeen made since the ABM Treaty. I think they may begin to see the Lord. \nIf they don't, then I think the American public will make a judgment \nabout it. The next President--whether it be Bush, Gore, or McCain--will \nbe more likely to send back another treaty.\n  I am at a point where it is time to bring in the sheep. Let's count \nthem, and let's hold people responsible. That is as blunt as I can be \nwith my friend.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Delaware for responding, and I \nwill not ask another question because I want to move on to the next \namendment.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that whatever technical information is \navailable on some of the outstanding questions will be made available \nto the Senators before the vote so we can have that determination made \nwith all the facts available.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is appalling that our Republican \nfriends will use any means necessary to kill the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. We need time to debate this Treaty in a responsible manner, \nespecially since the Foreign Relations Committee has still not held a \nsingle hearing devoted solely to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  On September 24, 1996, President Clinton became the first world \nleader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. On that day, \nPresident Clinton praised the treaty as the ``longest-sought, hardest--\nfought prize in the history of arms control.''\n  Today, we stand on the verge of losing this valuable prize. For \nalmost two years, the Treaty has languished in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee--with no action, no debate, and no results. Now, \nwith the September 23 already passed, the United States may well \nforfeit its voice on the treaty if the Senate does not act quickly, and \nin a responsible way, to ratify it.\n  We have a unique opportunity in the Senate to help end nuclear \ntesting once and for all. Other nations look to the United States for \ninternational leadership. President Clinton has done his part, in \nsigning the Treaty and submitting it to the Senate for ratification, as \nthe Constitution requires. Now the Senate should do its part, and \nratify the Treaty. Ratification is the single most important step we \ncan take today to reduce the danger of nuclear war.\n  Withholding action on this treaty is irresponsible and unacceptable. \nThe Treaty is in the best interest of the United States and the global \ncommunity. Ratification of this agreement will increase the safety and \nsecurity of people in the United States, and across the world. But, \nuntil the Senate ratifies this treaty, it cannot go into force for any \nnation, anywhere.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of the American \npeople and it has widespread public support. Recent bipartisan polls \nfound that over 8 out of 10 Americans support its ratification. These \nstatistics cut across party lines and are consistent in all geographic \nregions. The Treaty also has the strong support of present and past \nmilitary leaders, including four former Joint Chiefs of Staff--David \nJones, William Crowe, Colin Powell, and John Shalikashvili--and the \ncurrent JCS, Hugh Shelton.\n  The United States has already stopped testing nuclear weapons. \nEnsuring that other nations follow suit is critical for our national \nand international security. Particularly in the wake of recent \nallegations of Chinese nuclear espionage, it is essential that\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\nwe act promptly to ratify this agreement. China is a signatory of the \nTreaty, but like the United States, China has not yet ratified it. \nPrompt Senate ratification of the Treaty will encourage China to \nratify, and discourage China from creating new weapons from stolen \nnuclear secrets.\n  In 1963, after President Kennedy had negotiated the landmark Limited \nTest Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union to ban tests in the atmosphere, \nhe spoke of his vision of a broader treaty in his commencement address \nat American University that year. As he said:\n\n       The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, \n     would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most \n     dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a \n     position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \n     hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of \n     nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n\n  In 1999, those words are truer than ever.\n  I commend President Clinton and my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have joined together to speak out on this issue, and I urge \nthe Senate to act responsibly on this very important treaty.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our \ncolleagues in support of prompt Senate consideration of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the CTBT.\n  The issue of arms proliferation is at the heart of our national--and \ninternational--security. In the post-cold war world we are no longer \nfaced with a military threat posed by the Soviet Union, but in some \nways the world now is a more dangerous place than it was just a decade \nago, with many smaller, unpredictable threats taking the place of a \nsingle large one. U.S. and international security are now threatened by \ntransfers of nuclear, conventional and non-conventional materials among \nnumerous states. Nuclear testing last year by India and Pakistan, the \nattempts of other states to obtain nuclear and ballistic missile \ntechnology, and the growing threat of weapons of mass destruction \nreinforce the need for a comprehensive international effort to end \nnuclear testing and curb the illicit transfer and sale of nuclear, \nballistic, and other dangerous technology.\n  I have been a strong supporter of prompt Senate action on the CTBT \nsince President Clinton submitted the treaty to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent on September 22, 1997--2 years ago last week. As a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I continue to feel \nstrongly that the committee should have thorough hearings specifically \non this important treaty at the earliest possible date. I know that the \nchairman of the committee and I do not agree on the importance of the \nCTBT, but I hope he will agree that the Senate must fulfill its advice \nand consent obligations with respect to this treaty.\n  I continue to hear from numerous Wisconsin residents who favor prompt \nSenate action on--and ratification of--the CTBT.\n  The CTBT, which has been signed by more than 150 nations, prohibits \nthe explosion of any type of nuclear device, no matter the intended \npurpose. India and Pakistan's nuclear tests only underscore the \nimportance of the CTBT, and serve as a reminder that we should redouble \nour efforts to bring the entire community of nations into this treaty. \nWhile I am pleased that both of those countries have agreed to sign the \ntreaty, I regret that they did so only after intense international \npressure, and only after they conducted the tests they needed to become \ndeclared nuclear states.\n  We must do more to ensure that no further tests take place.\n  The United States must lead the world in reducing the nuclear threat, \nand to do that we must become a full participant in the treaty we \nhelped to craft. I am deeply concerned that the third anniversary of \nthe date the CTBT opened for signature, September 24, 1996, passed last \nweek without Senate advice and consent to ratification. This failure to \nact by the United States Senate means that, according to the treaty's \nprovisions, the United States will not be able to participate actively \nin the upcoming conference, which is reserved for only those countries \nwho have deposited their instruments of ratification. That conference \nis currently scheduled to begin on October 6, 1999. Because we cannot \nparticipate, the United States will be at a severe disadvantage when it \ncomes to influencing the future of the treaty and encouraging other \ncountries to sign or ratify.\n  Mr. President, I again urge the Senate to act on this important \ntreaty at the earliest possible date. The credibility and leadership of \nthe United States in the arms control arena is at stake.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to \noffer some remarks on a matter of extreme importance to this Nation and \nto the world--the matter of preventing the further proliferation of \nnuclear weapons among the nations of the world through ratification and \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Two weeks ago--September 10--was the third anniversary of the United \nNation's overwhelming vote to approve a treaty banning the testing of \nnuclear weapons. The General Assembly voted 158 for to 3 against the \ntreaty, with a handful of abstentions.\n  Last week, on September 24, the United States observed the third \nanniversary of signing that treaty and, on September 22, marked the \nsecond anniversary of its receipt by the Senate for our advice and \nconsent.\n  In accordance with article 14 of the treaty, preparations are now \nunderway to convene an international conference of states which have \nratified the treaty to negotiate measures to facilitate its \nimplementation. I'm sorry to say, Mr. President, that unless the Senate \nacts immediately to ratify this treaty, the United States--an original \nsignatory to the treaty and a leader in the global movement to stop the \ntesting of nuclear weapons--will not take part in that conference.\n  Our absence sends a troubling message to the international community \nlooking for our leadership.\n  Mr. President, I am very sorry to say that essentially nothing has \nhappened since President Clinton signed the treaty on behalf of the \nUnited States on September 24, 1996, and sent it to the Senate for \nconsideration on September 22, 1997.\n  There have been no hearings, there has been no debate on the Senate \nfloor, there has been no vote on ratification. This is an extremely \nimportant treaty that I believe, and the great majority of Americans \nagree, would help to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nduring the coming millennium. And yet the Senate has not even begun the \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I believe the United States and the nations of the \nworld have come to a historic crossroads--a crossroads that symbolizes \nAmerica's view of the future and the potential direction of the \ninternational system regarding the control and eventual eradication of \nnuclear weapons.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty lies at the center of the \ncrossroads, and provides us with two basic options.\n  We could elect to ratify the treaty and seek its broadest \nimplementation in order to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear \nweapons;\n  Or, we could elect not to ratify the treaty, having decided as a body \nthat permitting the testing of nuclear weapons by all current and \nfuture nuclear powers is in the interest of safety and security of the \nUnited States and the world.\n  If we chose not to ratify the treaty, that choice would permit us to \npursue future avenues for nuclear superiority in response to nuclear \nweapons developed by our real or potential adversaries.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our Nation has already been down that \nroad. It was called the nuclear arms race. It cost the Nation over a \ntrillion dollars according to a recent study by the Brookings \nInstitution. And that's just money. It doesn't include the opportunity \ncost of brainpower and skills not used to address other national \nproblems such as medical and environment science or education.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the way things stand, we are not \nbeing permitted to make either choice. Despite repeated requests by \nMembers of the Senate to address this vital national and international \nsecurity issue, the\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\nSenate has done nothing to move this treaty forward and debate it.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has taken no action with respect to \nthe treaty and is preventing the Senate from debating and voting in \nthis most critical issue to the future of world peace. By his actions, \nthe chairman of the committee is preventing the Senate from carrying \nout its constitutional duties and obligations to give advice and \nconsent regarding the CTBT.\n  Mr. President, I support the call to hold hearings and bring this \ntreaty to the floor for a debate and a vote. The American people \nstrongly support this treaty and deserve to have that view represented \nand debated in the Halls of Congress.\n  Will the treaty be an effective means to prevent the spread of \nnuclear weapons? Let's debate the point.\n  Will the treaty be verifiable? Let's hear from the experts on that \ncrucial issue.\n  Will the CTBT serve America's national security interest? Let's \nexamine that from every angle.\n  As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks today, Mr. President, I \nbelieve the Nation and the world stand at a historic crossroads with \nrespect to the spread of nuclear weapons. I believe it is our duty and \nobligation to the American people to choose the proper road to take. \nThe key word, Mr. President, is ``Choose.'' The Senate is currently \nbeing prevented from making a choice--and in so doing, a choice is \nbeing made for us--by a few individuals seeking to advance an unrelated \npolitical agenda.\n  I'm certain I share an abiding faith in our democratic system with \nthe Members of this body. If that's so, a debate, discussion, and vote \non perhaps the most critical security issue facing our Nation today \nshould be placed before the Senate as soon as possible. Failure to \npermit such a debate and vote suggests to me either a lack of faith in \nthe democratic process or a disdain for its importance or validity.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support efforts to \nbring the CTBT to the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to add a few thoughts for \ntoday's debate regarding consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  I strongly believe that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--or C-T-B-\nT--is in our Nation's national security interests. But before I discuss \nmy reasons for supporting the treaty, let me first say why the Senate--\neven those who are unsure of the treaty-should support its \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  The Senate should hold hearings and consider and debate the treaty. \nThe Senate should vote on the treaty by March of next year.\n  Let me now mention some history of this issue and mention some of the \nmajor milestone along the road to ending nuclear weapons testing. In \nfact, next month, the month of October, is the anniversary of many \nimportant events.\n  On October 11, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force \nafter being ratified by the Senate in an overwhelming, bipartisan vote \nof 80-14 just a few weeks earlier. This treaty paved the way for future \nnuclear weapons testing agreements by prohibiting tests in the \natmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. It was signed by 108 \ncountries.\n  Our nation's agreement to the Limited Test Ban Treaty marked the end \nof our above ground testing of nuclear weapons, including those at the \nU.S. test site in Nevada. We now know, all too well, the terrible \nimpact of exploding nuclear weapons over the Nevada desert. Among other \nconsequences, these tests in the 1950's exposed millions of Americans \nto large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which accumulates in the \nthyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. ``Hot Sports,'' \nwhere the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest, were identified by a \nNational Cancer Institute report as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131. \nThe ``Hot Spots'' included many areas far away from Nevada, including \nNew York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Outside reviewers have shown that the \n5-16 rad level is only an average, with many people having been exposed \nto much higher levels, especially those who were children at the time.\n  To put that in perspective Federal standards for nuclear power plants \nrequire that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further \nunderstand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this: 150 \nmillion curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear \nweapons testing in the United States, above three times more than from \nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plants disaster in the former Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, it is all too clear that outlawing above-ground tests \nwere in the interest of our nation. I strongly believe that banning all \nnuclear test is also in our interests.\n  October also marked some key steps for the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. On October 2, 1992, President Bush signed into law the U.S. \nmoratorium on all nuclear tests. The moratorium was internationalized \nwhen, just a few years later, on September 24, 1996, a second step was \ntaken--the CTBT, was opened for signature. The United States was the \nfirst to sign this landmark treaty.\n  President Clinton took a third important step in abolishing nuclear \nweapons tests by transmitting the CTBT to the Senate for ratification. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has yet to take the additional step of \nratifying the CTBT. I am hopeful that we in the Senate will debate and \nvote on ratification of the Treaty, and continue the momentum toward \nthe important goals of a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons testing.\n  Many believed we had conquered the dangerous specter of nuclear was \nafter the Cold War came to an end and many former Soviet states became \nour allies Unfortunately, recent developments in South Asia remind us \nthat we need to be vigilant in our cooperative international efforts to \nreduce the dangers of nuclear weapons.\n  The CTBT is a major milestone in the effort to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a permanent ban on \nall nuclear explosions in all environments for any purpose. Its \n``zero--yield'' prohibition on nuclear tests would help to halt the \ndevelopment amd development of new nuclear weapons. The treaty would \nalso establish a far reaching verification regime that includes a \nglobal network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic and \nradionuclide monitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test \nsites to deter and detect violations.\n  It is vital to our national security for the nuclear arms race to \ncome to an end, and the American people recognize this. In a recent \npoll, more than 80% percent of voters supported the CTBT.\n  It is heartening to know that the American people understand the \nrisks of a world with nuclear weapons. It is now time for policymakers \nto recognize this as well. There is no better way to honor the hard \nwork and dedication of those who developed the LTBT and the CTBT than \nfor the Senate to immediately ratify the CTBT.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11681-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11681-S11720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n         RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000 --Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, ``Prairie Home Companion'': My wife and I \nhave enjoyed many Sunday afternoons listening to this great program on \npublic radio. It lasts 2 hours; there is music, comedy, drama. It is a \ngreat program. It comes on public radio.\n  On public television, we all watched the series on the Civil War. I \ndon't know if there was a more dramatic, a more effective presentation \nof history ever made on public broadcasting than of the Civil War.\n  It was tremendous.\n  Then several years later, the same person who produced the Civil War \nseries produced a magnificent series on baseball, the history of \nbaseball. It had pictures we had never seen, stories we had never \nheard, all on public broadcasting, all without any type of commercial \ninterruption of any kind.\n  I watched on public broadcasting, public television, a presentation \nabout the city of New York. I have been to the city of New York \nnumerous times. Never did I see New York as it was shown in that \nprogram. I saw parts of New York I would never, ever be able to see. I \nunderstand New York better than I would have ever been able to \nunderstand New York as a result of that program on public television.\n  I am a fan of public broadcasting. I think America is a fan of public \nbroadcasting. We can look back to the mid-1990s when Newt Gingrich took \ncontrol of the House of Representatives and publicly proposed cutting \nall public broadcasting funds.\n  There has been an effort by public broadcasters to do all kinds of \nthings to be able to meet the demands of their viewers. One of the \nthings they have done--there is report language in this bill that I \nthink is important, and that is to stand up and say what they have done \nas far as selling lists of their subscribers is wrong. We have public \nbroadcasting selling lists to Democratic organizations; we have public \nbroadcasting selling lists to Republican organizations. They were put \nup to bid, in effect, and that is wrong. The report that accompanies \nthis bill says, in very strong terms, that was wrong.\n  It was wrong. I acknowledge that without any question. But we have to \ndecide whether we want to have a public broadcasting system or not have \na public broadcasting system. Either we fund the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting so they can exist or we decide to end it. I prefer the \nformer. I prefer that we fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nI suggest we increase funding as indicated in this amendment, this \nyear, by $125 million.\n\n  I think it is important we talk about public broadcasting, what it \ndoes for this Nation. As long as the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting is leery of Congress cutting their funds--and certainly \nthey should be--I suspect they will begin to sound more and more like \nprivate broadcasting stations.\n  There was one article in the Washington Post, written by a man named \nFrank Ahrens, in which there was substantial research about what has \nhappened to public broadcasting. We find there has been a 700-percent \nincrease in corporate funding over just the past few years, since \nCongressman Gingrich got involved in this. It is not just listeners who \nare noticing the change. Private stations, which are not tax exempt as \nare these public broadcasters, are voicing their concern about an \nincreasingly uneven playing field--as well they should.\n  Why do they do that? They do it because corporate support has shifted \nradically in the past several years. In fact, at WAMU, which is a \nstation here in Washington, the broadcasts of which we hear all over \nthe country, the station president said it has gone up significantly. \nThat is an understatement.\n  Bob Edwards, for those of us who listen to public broadcasting--and I \nlisten to it in the morning more than any other time; I listen to the \nmorning edition--he is even more blunt. Bob Edwards says:\n\n       Underwriting has kept us alive.\n       It has cut into our air time. If you have to read a 30-\n     second underwriter credit, that's less news you can do.\n\n  That is an understatement. There is much less news that is done. \nUnderwriting spots sound like commercials, a trend that troubles \nlisteners, and recent surveys show this.\n  As this article indicates, the public is getting upset about this. In \nBoston, a radio station called WBUR has aggressively pursued corporate \nunderwriting, as many stations around America have--in fact, they have \nall done this. It lists 315 corporate sponsors on its web site--1 radio \nstation.\n  The corporations love to advertise on public radio. They believe \ndemographically they have an audience that listens to their messages, \nunderstands their messages; many times they are well-educated, upper-\nmiddle-class listeners who have expensive tastes and, some say, the \nmoney to indulge them. Moreover, they trust public radio much more than \nlisteners trust, perhaps, commercial radio.\n  We know on WAMU and other public radio stations, the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute, the lobbying arm for the atomic power industry, has done a \nlot of advertising. This comes not from the Senator from Nevada but \nfrom this article from the Washington Post. With its ads, the Nuclear \nEnergy Institute says, by using their slogan, ``Nuclear technology \ncontributes to life in many ways you probably never thought of.''\n  This upset listeners. There was a lot of complaining. As Bob Edwards, \nthe host of the program indicated, there was an e-mail campaign \nsuggesting NPR was in the pocket of the nuclear industry. I personally \ndo not think they are. But when this advertising takes place, people do \nnot have to stretch really far to come to that conclusion.\n\n  The same radio station, WAMU, decided several years ago they were \ngoing to do a show sponsored by the National Agricultural Chemical \nAssociation which advertised its products as safe. People complained \nbecause some people do not like these chemicals that are put on crops. \nCalls came in suggesting the radio station was in the pocket of this \nchemical company. That is really not true, but people can draw that \nconclusion because of the advertising that takes place on public radio.\n  Still, public radio managers are concerned and they are inventing all \nkinds of ways to get around FCC rules. They are creating promotions \nwith adjectives and lengthy explanations: ``the blue-chip company,'' \n``18 million customers worldwide,'' and ``converting natural gas to \nsulfur-free synthetic fuels.'' These are some of the catchwords they \nare using to try to get around some of the FCC rules.\n  In this Congress, earlier this year, Congressman Markey from \nMassachusetts and Congressman Tauzin from Louisiana drafted a bill that \nwould tighten the FCC rules and also increase spending by as much as 60 \npercent for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. They were--I \nshould not say forced; they decided on their own, I am sure, but as a \nresult of all the publicity that was engendered as a result of learning \nthese public broadcasting organizations were selling their subscribers' \nlists, they backed off this legislation. They said they were going to \ngo forward with it soon. There is a sentiment all over America that we \nhave to have either public broadcasting or commercial broadcasting. \nThis mix is not working because the mix is coming out as commercial \nbroadcasting.\n  It is not just lawmakers and listeners who are concerned and taking \nnote of this advertising policy, but commercial radio stations are \nconcerned. Public broadcasting is tax free. Commercial broadcasters \nbelieve it is unfair that public stations can air essentially the same \nadvertising they do and not have to pay the same taxes. They are \ncompeting in a way that is unfair to commercial broadcasters. ``It's \nnot an even playing field,'' says Jim Farley, the vice president for \nnews at WTOP here in Washington.\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\n  I listen to WTOP. It is a great news station. I think if we are going \nto have public broadcasting, it should be public broadcasting. People \nshould not have to guess whether or not it is a commercial station or \nit is public broadcasting. I agree with Jim Farley. It is not an even \nplaying field.\n  The increased presence of corporate underwriters has led some \nlisteners and even those within public radio to fear underwriters might \ninfluence the news coverage in segments they sponsor. There are not \nmany other conclusions you can reach if, in fact, you are advertising \nsome commercial product.\n  The reason people can come to that conclusion without a lot of \nstretch is, for example, ``Marketplace,'' which is a public radio \nprogram, aired stories about General Electric being indicted for price \nfixing but ignored a 1990 boycott of the company by the people who \nobjected to its participation in the nuclear weapons industry.\n  Why did some people come to that conclusion? Because General Electric \nprovides more than 25 percent of the funding for this program. There \nwas no other conclusion one could reach. The show's general manager now \ncalls the fact they did not run stories about this boycott a lapse, a \nmistake. I submit, we should not have these problems with public \nbroadcasting.\n  My amendment simply says if we are going to have public broadcasting, \nwe should have public broadcasting. Even though this money I am \nsuggesting we vote for is not enough to solve all the problems, it is a \nstep in the right direction and will take some of the pressure off \npublic broadcasting.\n  This is money well spent. It is important we in America feel good \nabout our public broadcasting. I submit that programs such as ``Prairie \nHome Companion,'' the series on the Civil War and baseball and New York \nand a multitude of other programs we have all enjoyed should continue \nwithout commercial interruption.\n  I believe we should adequately fund this organization. Whether it is \nadequate funding or not is something we can all debate, but it is at \nleast a step in the direction of giving public broadcasting a shot in \nthe arm, funding which has been taken from them as a result of the \nactivities of Congress since 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order prior to the vote on or in relation to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered and argued \nby the Senator from Nevada because the subcommittee worked out a very \ncarefully crafted set of priorities, joined in by the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, my distinguished ranking member. In structuring a \nbill of $91.7 billion, we had to take into account many programs, some \n300 programs. There is difficulty in having this bill accepted with 51 \nvotes considering the expenditures involved.\n  We have given priority to items such as education where the bill is \n$500 million in excess of the President's request. We have given \npriority to programs for the National Institutes of Health and raised \n$2 billion. We have had to cut some programs which I, frankly, did not \nlike to see cut. But we have established the priorities.\n  With respect to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, we have \nincreased their funding by $10 million, from $340 million to $350 \nmillion. This year's allocation of $340 million was an increase from \n$300 million the year before and an increase from $250 million the year \nbefore that. It is true that back in 1992, the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting had an allocation of $327 million and it has gradually \nbeen built up. I have been supportive of public broadcasting. The \nquestion is on priorities, and it is my judgment that in a tight fiscal \nyear with tight budget constraints that we have been reasonably \ngenerous with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  On another matter I think ought to be commented upon, although it is \nnot the reason for opposing the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, \nis the finding by the inspector general of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting that 53 of the 591 public broadcasting grantees exchanged \ndonor lists with or rented them to political organizations, which is a \nmatter of some consequence. Earlier this year, the Boston Globe \nreported that the local public television station in Boston, WGBH, \nexchanged its donor list with the Democratic Party. There were other \nmedia reports about exchanges involving public broadcasting with WNET \nin New York, WETA in Washington, DC, and WHYY in Philadelphia.\n  Steps have been taken by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \nstop that practice, but I do think it is a factor which ought to be in \nthe public record and ought to be commented upon at this time.\n  It would be a curious reward if, in the face of a problem this year \nof this magnitude, we had a proportionately large increase in the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. These factors were considered very \ncarefully when our bill was crafted. I do listen to public broadcasting \nmyself, and I do concur with Senator Reid that it is a very useful \ninstrumentality, given the considerations on commercial broadcasting. \nBut we have gone about as far as we can go in allocating a $10 million \nincrease which brings the corporation up to $350 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill and the Senator \nfrom Iowa have done a good job in constructing this $91.7 billion bill, \nand they have included things regarding health and education. There is \nnothing more educational for the American public than to do a good job \nfor public broadcasting.\n  As I said earlier, the sales of the donor lists were brought about \nbecause of the financial pressure on these institutions. I do not \ncondone that, and I agree with the language of the report which does \nnot condone that.\n  I suggest this is money well spent out of $91.7 billion. This money \nis a mere pittance and it would be very important to spend to help the \nAmerican public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the actual vote on this amendment not \ntake place until there is an agreement between the two leaders as to \nwhen it should take place.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for that observation. It \nis my hope we can stack the votes until late this afternoon. We find \nthat the votes set for 15 minutes with a 5-minute leeway go much \nlonger. We have an amendment lined up by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson, to start in 10 minutes, and behind that--in sequencing we \nhave had two amendments from that side of the aisle, so we are looking \nfor another Republican amendment behind Senator Hutchinson. Then we \nwill have Senator Graham of Florida.\n  We wish to move this bill expeditiously giving ample time with time \nagreements. So we will be looking to stack the votes very late this \nafternoon. Then we have lined up an amendment on ergonomics to come \nlate this afternoon. It is anticipated there will be considerable \ndebate on that. But we want to move through the ``meat'' of the day, so \nto speak, getting as much done as we can. So I concur with what Senator \nReid has had to say about stacking the votes later.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I also say, while we are waiting for Senator Hutchinson to \ncome to the floor, that we have the 2 o'clock cutoff for the submission \nof amendments. We hope Members will come forward with amendments as \nquickly as possible, recognizing we are trying to move this bill along \nas quickly as we can. So we hope everyone, especially the staffs who \nare listening, will take that into consideration, as I am sure they \nare--that consideration will be given to the submission of amendments, \nworking under the time constraints we have.\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while not an enormous matter, while we \nare waiting for the next amendment to be offered, the issue has arisen \nas to whether the lists were made available to which political parties. \nI have been furnished, by staff, with a response by the inspector \ngeneral of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to Congressman \nDingell's questions in the House of Representatives.\n  This is one question:\n\n       When stations made donor lists available to Democratic \n     organizations either directly or through list brokers/\n     managers, were the lists made available to Republican \n     organizations as well?\n\n  Answer by the inspector general, as represented to me here:\n\n       Although, none of the identified exchanges or rentals of \n     donor names from public broadcasting stations involved \n     Republican organizations, we could not conclude that such \n     names were not available to them. In this regard, we found no \n     indications or evidence that Republican organizations had \n     ever sought or been turned down for names requested from \n     public broadcasting stations. In addition in visiting two \n     stations, we were advised that when they learned that names \n     were being exchanged with or rented to Democratic \n     organizations, they had proposed exchanges with Republican \n     organizations to their direct mail consultant or list broker. \n     These stations were later advised that such exchanges were \n     turned down.\n\n  I think it advisable, having read from part of these responses, that \nthe full text of the responses to Congressman Dingell's questions be \nprinted in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe responses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Corporation for Public     Broadcasting,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1999.\n     Hon. John D. Dingell,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Commerce, Room 2125, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Dingell: The Office of Inspector General \n     appreciates the opportunity to clarify any questions Congress \n     has resulting from our recent report on Public Broadcasting \n     Stations exchange or rental of membership/donor names with \n     political organizations. We have accordingly prepared \n     Attachment 1 which contains the office's conclusions \n     regarding the questions raised in your September 20, 1999 \n     letter.\n       If your staff wishes to discuss these matters further, \n     please have them contact me at (202) 879-9660.\n           Sincerely\n                                                  Kenneth A. Konz,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Attachment 1\n\n\n              Responses to Congressman Dingell's Questions\n\n       1. Is there any evidence to suggest that any donor list \n     transactions between stations and Democratic organizations \n     were politically motivated?\n       No. Stations across the country universally denied that any \n     decisions to exchange donor lists or rent names to any \n     outside organization were politically motivated. \n     Additionally, top management officials were not aware that \n     such exchanges were being made. Instead, such exchanges seem \n     to grow from the need to utilize direct mail solicitation as \n     a basis for raising membership revenue for the station. \n     Because dealing with political organizations was such a minor \n     part of their direct mail solicitation process, we concluded \n     that political motivations were not considered.\n       2. When stations made donor lists available to Democratic \n     organizations either directly or through list brokers/\n     managers, were the lists made available to Republican \n     organizations as well?\n       Although none of the identified exchanges or rentals of \n     donor names from public broadcasting stations involved \n     Republican organizations, we could not conclude that such \n     names were not available to them. In this regard, we found no \n     indications or evidence that Republican organizations had \n     ever sought or been turned down for names requested from \n     public broadcasting stations. In addition in visiting two \n     stations, we were advised that when they learned that names \n     were being exchanged with or rented to Democratic \n     organizations, they had proposed exchanges with Republican \n     organizations to their direct mail consultant or list broker. \n     These stations were later advised that such exchanges were \n     turned down.\n       3. Were any contacts with political organizations initiated \n     directly by station representatives? What role did list \n     brokers/managers play in these transactions?\n       Based on the responses we got to the survey and our visits \n     to stations, we found that all arrangements with political \n     organizations were made by direct mail consultants or list \n     brokers. Generally, such consultants developed plans for \n     direct mail campaigns. Given the number of  solicitations \n     planned, the consultant proposed various lists from which \n     names could be exchanged or acquired based on the \n     demographics of the target audience and success in using, \n     such lists in previous direct mail solicitations. The \n     stations simply saw the names of the proposed lists and \n     were given the opportunity to eliminate those \n     organizations they did not want to exchange with. \n     Therefore, they usually went along with the lists \n     recommended. In cases where political organizations \n     desired exchanges, they would go to the list broker who \n     (in some cases) had authority to exchange names or who, if \n     they did not have authority, would get back to the \n     stations to obtain authorization or rejection.\n       4. Is there any evidence of a station, or list broker/\n     manager acting on behalf of a station, refusing a request for \n     a list exchange or rental from either a Republican \n     organization or a list broker/manager known to be acting on \n     behalf of a Republican organization?\n       We saw no indication that exchanges or rentals from \n     Republican organizations were turned down. On the other hand, \n     we saw some exchanges with Democratic organizations were \n     turned down because the stations had a policy of not \n     exchanging with political organizations.\n       As a general rule, we saw stations looking for names for \n     use in direct mail solicitations. In this regard, in \n     reviewing acquisition of names, stations obtained names not \n     only from apparent Democratic organizations, but also from \n     apparent Republican organizations. For the stations we \n     visited, more than one third of the stations got significant \n     portions (20 percent or more) of such names from apparent \n     Republican organizations. Thus, we have no basis to conclude \n     that exchanges sought by Republican organizations would have \n     received any different consideration from those sought by \n     Democratic ones.\n       5. In your judgment, did any station violate any Federal of \n     State law or regulation in conducting these donor list \n     transactions?\n       Our office did not find clear evidence of any violation of \n     Federal or State laws or regulations. CPB has the authority \n     for making grants to public broadcasters under section 396 of \n     the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. In examining the \n     provisions of the Act, as well as CPB grant terms and \n     conditions in affect at the time of grant award, we noted \n     that no specific restrictions existed related to direct mail \n     solicitations and the exchange of membership/donor lists with \n     other organizations. Since we were unable to find evidence \n     showing political motivation to support particular parties or \n     candidates, we did not identify any violations of existing \n     CPB statutes or regulations.\n       Our office is not an expert in all the Federal or State \n     laws or regulations which might govern the exchange of rental \n     of membership/donor lists. we have in this instance heard \n     that questions have been raised regarding the possibility \n     that stations may have violated provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Service (IRS) requirements concerning non profit \n     organizations. We understand the IRS was looking into the \n     situation. They would be the appropriate organization to \n     indicate whether there were any violations to that law.\n       6. How did stations benefit from list exchanges or rentals \n     with political organizations?\n       In our opinion, stations did not obtain any extraordinary \n     benefit from exchanges or rentals with political \n     organizations. While on one hand the stations did get names \n     from such organizations, they paid for them just like other \n     exchanges with or rentals from non profit organizations or \n     even commercial entities. In both cases, the cost of direct \n     mail solicitations was reduced when names were acquired \n     through exchanges, rather than rentals.\n       In evaluating benefits to the station, we noted that \n     successful lists only averaged one contribution or membership \n     for every 100 direct mail solicitations (1 percent). \n     Furthermore, only a small proportion of the names used in \n     direct mail solicitations were derived from political \n     organizations. For the stations we visited names from \n     apparently political organizations, ranged from only .3 \n     percent to 6.4 percent of the names acquired for direct mail \n     solicitations. Thus, we concluded that involvement with \n     political organizations in this process did not provide \n     material benefits to public broadcasting stations.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator would withhold.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not want to get into a ``who did this; \nwho did not do that.'' I acknowledge, selling the lists was wrong. The \nfact is, though, that PBS stations made these lists available to both \nparties. Without getting too partisan, we know the Bush family has made \ntheir lists available to groups, also. These groups include the\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n\nCitizens for a Sound Economy and the Heritage Foundation. These are \ncertainly if not Republican organizations, I would clearly say, \nRepublican-leaning organizations.\n  I also think it is important to note we are talking about the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. And the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting has a policy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are not on the Senator's time now. We are waiting \nfor Senator Hutchinson to come. I got the floor on my own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a time agreement on the amendment. \nThere is a current time agreement. If the Senator wishes to----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield time from my side to the Senator from Nevada.\n  I ask the Senator, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. REID. Just a few minutes, a couple minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Two minutes. We only have about 4 minutes left. If you \ntake 2 minutes, I will have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 6 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Take 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting now \nhas a policy. We do not need to talk about what has gone on before. We \nall recognize it was wrong and is wrong.\n  I again state I approve wholeheartedly with the language in the \nreport that was submitted by the manager and the ranking member of this \nbill and which I understand had the full committee chairman's undying \nsupport; that is, the Senator from Alaska was also upset about the \ntrading of lists, which we all agree is wrong.\n  I support the present policy. If you want to sell your list to a \npolitical party, you are not going to get any funding from the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the Senate floor we do not frequently \nhave the quality of evidence which assures authenticity, unlike a \ncourtroom where you have to have witnesses who saw, observed, or \ndocumentation which is authenticated.\n  I have marveled, from time to time, during my tenure in the Senate \nhow many representations of fact are made which have no authentication. \nWe had a little time left over from the debate, so the Senator from \nNevada and I have talked a little bit about these lists being made \navailable to political parties.\n  You have the inspector general's report which will be made a part of \nthe Record which says what it says. I have already stated that. I am \nnot going to repeat it. But what we say on this Senate floor is viewed \nby a lot of people. I am sure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nwill be looking very closely at what Senator Reid and I have had to \nsay. And other public institutions will be on notice, as well, that \nwhen there is public money involved, it is a public trust and not to be \npartisan for either Democrats or Republicans, and that we will take a \nlook at it.\n\n  Again, I repeat that, notwithstanding this concern, we did not seek \nto have that influence our determination as to what the funding should \nbe. We added $10 million. We know the problem has been rectified, but \nwe want the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and everyone else, to \nbe on notice that the Congress will not tolerate partisanship or \npolitical activity of either party with public money, which is a \nFederal trust.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be postponed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the hour of 12:30 has arrived. We expect \nthe offerer of the next amendment to be here within a very short period \nof time. In the interim, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment, the next amendment will be \noffered in the queue by the Senator from Arkansas. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be awarded one hour of debate, equally \ndivided, with no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Hlavacek, \na fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of this appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. A unanimous consent \nwas asked. Was there approval that there be a time limit on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The time limit is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour of debate equally divided with no \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1812\n\n              (Purpose: To transfer amounts appropriated.)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), for himself, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Allard, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1812.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n\n         transfer of funds for the consolidated health centers\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $25,472,000 of the amounts appropriated for the National \n     Labor Relations Board under this Act shall be transferred and \n     utilized to carry out projects for the consolidated health \n     centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 254b).\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators DeWine, Allard, Thomas, Crapo, and Helms as cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nto the appropriations bill on Labor-HHS. I think it is one that should \nbe easy for Members to support. Let me very basically explain it, and \nthen I will go into more detail.\n  This would shift $25.472 million from the National Labor Relations \nBoard to the Consolidated Health Centers Program. The $25.472 million \nis the increase in spending that has been added to the budget of the \nNLRB. I will explain this in further detail, but this would take that \nexpense and shift it to what is a critical program for underserved \nareas in health care in this country.\n  The NLRB requested an increase of $25.472 million in funding for the \nfiscal year 2000. Their argument is they need that increase in funding \nto reduce their backlog in cases. However, when one looks at the \nsituation at the NLRB and looks at their own statistics provided by the \nNational Labor Relations Board, justification for an increase is simply \nnot there.\n  In its annual report, the NLRB stated the number of cases that were \npending before the NLRB declined from 37,249 in fiscal year 1997 to \n34,664 in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\n1998. The NLRB further reported the number of cases the NLRB is \nreceiving declined from 39,618 in fiscal year 1997 to 36,657 in fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  From their own statistics, it is clear that the National Labor \nRelations Board can fulfill its statutory mandate to administer the \nNational Labor Relations Acts without the better than $25 million \nincrease in funding. In fact, the NLRB did not receive an increase last \nyear and was not only able to fulfill their mandate but achieved these \nresults which I have cited in seeing a decrease in the number of cases.\n  How is that possible? When adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 1998, \nwhile the NLRB budget declined by 21 percent, the number of charges \nreceived and processed has declined by 31 percent. While the NLRB can \nrightly say they have had a declining budget, if you look at the number \nof charges they have received and processed, it has had an even more \ndramatic decline.\n  In his statement before the House Subcommittee on Labor-HHS, on March \n25, the NLRB general counsel, Fred Feinstein, stated that the NLRB has \nadopted a program called Impact Analysis through which the NLRB has \nmoved beyond the first-in-first-out approach in an effort to assure \nthat the cases it gets to first are those that are central to its core \nmission.\n  He further stated that the Impact Analysis Program has allowed the \nNLRB to assure that its backlog consists of lower priority cases. Not \nonly has the backlog decreased but the cases that are in their own \nsystem are not of a lower priority.\n  The NLRB estimates that of the 35,000 total charges filed each year, \nonly approximately one-third--or 10,500--are found to have merit. The \nNLRB further estimates that of the 10,500 charges each year that are \nfound to be meritorious, 86 percent--or 9,030--are settled.\n  Therefore, the NLRB adjudicates only approximately 4 percent--or \n1,470--of the charges it receives each year. So over 35,000 total \ncharges, less than 4 percent, or about 4 percent, are ever adjudicated. \nSo from the NLRB's own numbers, only 10,500 of the 35,000 charges have \nmerit and 65 percent of all unfair labor practice charges are dismissed \nor withdrawn.\n\n  Let me reiterate. Sixty-five percent of all unfair labor charges are \ndismissed or withdrawn because they are found to be without merit.\n  Where does that leave us as a body? How do we justify funding their \nrequest at better than a $25 million increase at a time that the number \nof cases is decreasing and the number of adjudications is down 40 \npercent? How do we justify that?\n  I know. I simply can't justify that. I think many of my colleagues \nwill agree.\n  If a society can be judged by how it treats its less fortunate, if a \nsociety is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, then we \nmust and the NLRB must make better use of resources and decide that we \nwill tip the scales this time in favor of individuals, particularly \nchildren, who need health care.\n  That is why my amendment will shift $25.472 million from the NLRB to \nthe Consolidated Health Centers. It is not a cut in NLRB funding but a \nshifting of what would have been an increase in their funding to a \ncritically urgent program, the Consolidated Health Centers.\n  The Consolidated Health Centers Program is a Federal grant program \nfunded under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act to provide \nfor primary care health services in medically underserved areas \nthroughout the United States.\n  I suspect that the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Kansas, \nknows well about these kinds of underserved areas. In my home State of \nArkansas--we have many in the Mississippi Delta region--they are \ndesperately in need of these kinds of community health clinics. \nSpecifically, this program makes grants to public and nonprofit private \nentities for the development and operation of community, migrant, and \nhomeless health centers.\n  Key to the mission of the Consolidated Health Centers Program is its \nrecognition of the contours of our country and its diverse geography. \nHealth care is needed in areas where economic, geographic, and cultural \nbarriers limit access to primary health care for a substantial portion \nof the population. It might surprise a lot of folks, but today one-\nfifth of Americans live in rural areas. And many are in desperate need \nof health care.\n  I grew up in a little town of 894. It is now up to 1,300. It is in a \nrural part of Arkansas. I wouldn't trade that place for growing up for \nany place in the world. But I know that while we have serenity, we have \nlow crime--we had wide open spaces to run on the farm, and it was a \nwonderful place to grow up--there are also a lot of amenities most \npeople take for granted which we didn't have. Whether it is in Kansas \nor Arkansas or Iowa, people living in those rural areas may be willing \nfor the benefits they receive not to have the metro system, not to have \na nice theater, not have the grand malls, and some of the things we \nenjoy so much in the Nation's Capital.\n  However, the tragedy is not only do they give up those amenities but \ntoo often in Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, across the Mississippi Delta and \nother rural areas, they also give up opportunities because of the \neconomic deprivation of some of the areas that have good quality health \ncare. Indeed, some don't have adequate health care facilities at all, \nwhile we take for granted such areas as the Pentagon City Mall, Tysons \nCorner, full service hospitals, dental centers, podiatrists, \nchiropractors, virtually a doctor for every part of your body.\n  But that does not happen in the Mississippi Delta, rural Kansas, or \nIowa. These health centers provide access to basic yet essential health \nservices, including preventive health and dental services, acute and \nchronic care services, appropriate hospitalization, and specialty \nreferrals. These centers are the safety net providers for those who \nfall through the cracks in our current health insurance marketplace. We \nmay fight and we may argue on the floor of this Senate as to what we \nshould do about managed care reform, what we should do about providing \nhealth care for those uninsured, but we don't need to argue about the \nneed to increase funding for these vital community health centers. They \nare the ultimate safety net in our society.\n  Health centers provide health care to people regardless of their \nability to pay. By law they serve anyone who walks in through their \ndoors--rich or poor, insured or not. Of the clients received by \ncommunity health centers, 44 percent are children, 66 percent have \nincomes below poverty level. That is the issue before the Senate in \nthis amendment: Are we going to fund more bureaucracy at the NLRB at a \ntime they have a declining number of cases or are we going to shift the \nincrease for small rural communities desperately in need of greater \nhealth care? In Arkansas alone, 41 health centers currently serve \n80,000 Arkansans. Once again, 44 percent are children and two-thirds \nhave incomes below the poverty level.\n  Last month, during our August recess, I had the opportunity to visit \n13 counties in the delta region. They are the poorest of the poor. They \ndon't need a handout, but they need a helping hand, especially in the \narea of health care. I recently visited a new health clinic in Parkin, \nAR, made possible through a grant in this program, Consolidated Health \nCenters Program. I commend all the dedicated public servants and health \ncare professionals at the Parkin Medical Clinic and all of the health \ncenters in Arkansas for the invaluable contributions they make to their \ncommunities and commitment to improving public health.\n  At a time when the number of uninsured in our country is over 40 \nmillion and growing, the community health centers play a pivotal role \nin providing care to those who need it most, the uninsured. By spending \n$25 million more for the health centers, we will enable them to serve \n83,000 more people. That won't cover the expected need, but it is a \nstep in the right direction. They say they need $264 million more to \nmaintain current levels of coverage and care. Last year, we increased \nfunding by $100 million for the health centers. Senator Specter--and I \napplaud his efforts in this appropriations bill--increases funding for \nthe health centers by $99 million in addition. That is a good start, \nbut they say in order to maintain current service they need $264 \nmillion.\n  I believe this is a good investment and it is an easy choice. The \nchoice is funding more bureaucracy at the NLRB\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\nat a time caseload is falling or shifting that increase to the \ncommunities, to the deprived and neglected communities of this country \nin which there is a high percentage of uninsured and a high percentage \nof children who don't have access to health care. We can help that \nsituation and provide tens of thousands of people health care by the \nsimple passage of this amendment.\n\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 17 minutes 51 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent, without it being taken off of the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object. If the Senator wants to speak, why not have the \nSenator yield time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming whatever time he desires.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Arkansas. I am Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on \nEmployment, Safety and Training. I have worked closely with Senator \nHutchinson to assure small businesses are treated fairly by the NLRB. I \nhave numbers as well that show there is difficulty with that.\n  I held a hearing in July that clearly illustrated how small business \nowners that win against the NLRB on an action against the employer get \nleft with thousands of dollars of legal bills. Aggressive actions \ncontinue to be brought against the small business owners with no relief \nin sight. That has to be solved.\n  Regarding this movement for community health centers, regardless of \nhow much it takes to take care of the present situation, Wyoming \ndoesn't have a community health center. We have a need for it equally. \nI hope that is included in the suggestions for where this money will be \ngoing. I understand the need to raise enough funds to be able to \nsupport the current efforts.\n  I ask people to take a look at the record of the hearings we held on \nthis subject of the National Labor Relations Board and the unfairness \nwith which they have treated some of the employers, the huge bills \nemployers have been left with, in spite of some of them representing \nthemselves before the committee. Such practices are wrong and need to \nbe stopped.\n  We shouldn't have additional funds for a function that is actually \ndecreasing the load. We also find there is a decrease in cases going \nbefore those people.\n  Earlier this year at a field hearing about the National Labor \nRelation Board's treatment of small businesses by the safety \nsubcommittee, a small business employer named Randall Truckenbrodt \ntestifies that in one year alone, over 36 unfair labor practice charges \nwere filed against his company. After a prolonged legal battle, Randall \nwon all 36 charges. The cost of defending himself, however, totaled a \nwhopping $80,000, a sum which he testified, ``could have been triple \nhad I not represented myself.'' As a former small business owner, I \nshudder to think that such a practice could ever occur--much less to a \nsmall business--and I am dumbstruck by reports that what happened to \nRandall happens all the time. Such practices are more than wrong, they \nshould be stopped. I support this amendment, which would allow NLRB to \nfocus on their existing responsibilities and not allow additional funds \nfor random, meritless claims brought against small businesses by the \nNLRB--an intimidating bureaucracy that can sometimes strong-arm the \nlittle guy who doesn't have the resources to defend himself.\n  I have great concerns over the actions of the NLRB against small \nbusinesses, and before we give it 25 million additional dollars, I \nthink we need to get to the bottom of NLRB's treatment of these \nsmallest of businesses. I support Senator Hutchinson's amendment which \nwould transfer the $25.7 million increase for the National Labor \nRelations Board to Consolidated Health Centers under the Public Health \nService Act.\n  Community health centers play a vital role in providing primary care \nservices to underserved areas. The Labor HHS bill provides a $99 \nmillion increase for CHCs--Consolidated Community Health Centers \nProgram--for poor, rural areas. HRSA, however, testified and requested \n$264 million just to maintain levels of coverage and care.\n  Health centers serve over 10 million people nationwide, over 4 \nmillion of which are uninsured. By spending $25 million more for health \ncenters, health centers estimate that they will be able to serve over \n83,000 more people.\n  Bottom line, this amendment will bring better health care to millions \nof Americans, rather than harming more small businesses by allowing the \nNLRB to run wild in filing meritless claims against them, and therefore \nI rise to strongly support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when this bill was crafted with some 300 \nitems, great care was exercised on the establishment of priorities. \nThat is always a difficult matter. Where is the $1.800 trillion in \nFederal money to be spent? We have a bill of $91.7 billion. We have had \na series of amendments to change the allocations and assessments of \npriorities which the ranking member and I came to initially with staff, \nand then the subcommittee and then the full committee.\n  I am inclined to agree with my colleague from Arkansas about the \ndesirability of having more money in the consolidated health centers. \nHe came from a small town, as he recited, of several hundred that has \ngrown to more than 1,000. The town where I went to high school was a \nbig city by comparison. It had several thousand people. Russell, KS, \nhas now 4,998 people. It used to have 5,000 until Dole and I left town.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Arkansas has had to say about the \nvirtues of living in a small town. I have appreciated the virtues of \nliving in a small town even more since I moved to a big city. I knew \nRussell, KS, was a great place to live, but after I moved to \nPhiladelphia I concluded Russell, KS, was a greater place to live.\n  When the Senator from Arkansas talks about smalltown life and the \nneed for health centers, he is right. They are needed not only in \nArkansas but in Pennsylvania, in Kansas, and everywhere.\n  When we made the allocations, as has already been noted by the \nSenator from Arkansas, we paid a very substantial increase to \nconsolidated health centers. Consolidated health centers were a little \nover $900 million and we added $99.3 million to bring them to $1.24 \nbillion. That is, I am advised, $79 million over the President's \nrequest.\n  But, even so, when the Senator from Arkansas says he would like to \nhave more money, I would not disagree with him. But then it is a \nquestion of establishing priorities, as to what we do. I listened \nclosely to the statistics which were cited by the Senator from Arkansas \non the decrease in the backlog. But even after the backlog has \ndecreased--and I am searching for those exact statistics myself--there \nstill is an enormous backlog which is pending before the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  When the Senator from Arkansas makes a comment about the board \nestablishing priorities, I think that is to the board's credit. They \nare not going to be able to take all the cases, so they ought to \nestablish priorities. I hope their priorities are not subject to as \nmuch challenge as mine are on the floor. I am not really too serious \nabout that, there haven't been too many challenges. But then the day is \nnot over yet, either. We are waiting for all the amendments to be filed \nby 2 o'clock this afternoon.\n  But I compliment the National Labor Relations Board for establishing \npriorities, to take up the most important cases first. The fact that \nthere are a great many unmeritorious claims filed is not surprising. \nThere are sometimes unmeritorious amendments filed--not this one. But \nthere are lots of cases filed in court or any adjudicatory process \nwhere there are unmeritorious matters. But I do not think that can be \nthe basis of judgment. My analysis of the caseload of the National \nLabor Relations Board, and I am going to put these figures into shape \nduring the\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\ncourse of this debate, to be specific and put them into the \nCongressional Record, is that this funding is needed.\n  The National Labor Relations Board, by word of just a little \nexplanation for those who may be watching on C-SPAN2, is a board \ncreated to take into consideration complaints, either by labor or by \nmanagement, as to what is happening in a labor practice and to identify \nunfair labor practices and to produce labor peace by having an \nadministrative remedy which would stop people from going into court.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak who are waiting now, but I \nthink a careful analysis of the backlog, of the procedures of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, and the entire picture, will show that \nthis kind of increase is warranted and certainly in consideration of \nthe significant increase accorded to the consolidated health centers, \nwhich I have already noted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would my colleague from Iowa like?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask my colleague from Iowa a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not have the floor yet.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a question pending of the Senator from Iowa, \nhow much time does he want?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I leave the floor, might I ask \nmy colleagues from Iowa and Pennsylvania a question? I want to know the \nparliamentary situation. Do we have an agreement for no second-degree \namendments and this would only be debated for an hour? Could I get some \ninformation about this?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond to the question, I was off the floor \nfor a moment, actually, in the lunchroom. I came back to the floor. A \nunanimous consent request had been propounded for an hour time \nagreement, equally divided, with no second-degree amendments. It was \nlater determined that was not really acceptable to the Democratic side \nof the aisle. I said to the Senator from Iowa, when I came back in: If \nit causes you heartburn, we will eliminate it.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the part as to ``no second-degree \namendments'' be rescinded, but the time as to 1 hour equally divided \nremain in effect.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could make it clear to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, if there is an objection--I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I think his unanimous consent request is very much in the \nspirit of fairness.\n\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if that is not \nacceptable, kind of sneaking a unanimous consent request in--this is a \nvery important amendment. There ought to be second-degree amendments on \nevery single amendment introduced to this bill forthwith with no time \nagreement if we are going to play that way. That is just not \nacceptable. We need much more time and we certainly should have the \nright to second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized. I think \nhe was yielded time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I assume I have some of my 5 minutes left--I hope?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I say I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He is a true gentleman, I think, in the spirit of comity \non the Senate floor, to recognize the unanimous consent request that \nwas proffered earlier was not acceptable to this side. I bear some \nresponsibility for that. I was engaged in a conversation with my staff \nand did not even hear the unanimous consent request propounded, so I \nbear some responsibility for that.\n  As I said, in the spirit of comity and the smooth functioning of the \nSenate, my friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, came back on the floor and said he would move to vitiate \nthat unanimous consent agreement, which he did, I think, again, in the \ntrue spirit of comity and smooth functioning of the Senate. That then \nwas objected to, I guess, by the Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield the floor back to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I heard there was a problem--we work \ntogether on too many matters over too long a period of time. If it was \ninadvertently entered into, we are prepared not to hold anybody to it. \nWe have a lot of work to do. If we did not have a lot of work to do, we \nstill would not hold them to it if it was inadvertently entered into.\n  I have just discussed that with my colleague from Arkansas. I think \nwe can work this out in the course of the next few minutes, if the \nSenator from Iowa will take his 5 minutes to argue on the merits.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I can have another 5 minutes to talk about the \namendment itself?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I allocate 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment propounded by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas really would harm the NLRB \ndrastically. The Senator from Arkansas said the caseload had gone down. \nThat is true, the caseload did go down, I assume because we increased \nsome of the funding and they were able to, then, hire some more staff \nand decrease the caseload.\n  If now, however, we cut the funding, they are going to have to \nrelease those people and fire people who were hired; therefore we will \nbe right back where we started from.\n  We keep hearing about the backlog. What is the backlog? The NLRB, at \nthe end of last fiscal year, had 6,198 cases pending at the end of the \nlast fiscal year. I understand some of those were reduced last year, \nbut we are still in the neighborhood of about a 5,500-case backlog. So \nI do not know how the Senator from Arkansas can argue we are making \ngreat progress. We are making a little bit of progress. But to take the \n$25 million out of the NLRB would put us right back where we were \nbefore, and you would see the backlog start going back up again. That \nmay not be his intention, but that is exactly what would happen.\n  At this funding level, the staffing, I am told, would have to be \nreduced by at least 100 people below the current level. That would be \nabout a 5-percent reduction. Again, that would mean the backlogs would \ncontinue to go up. The time to process the claims would grow \nsignificantly, and that would hurt not just the employees but also the \nemployers. Both sides are harmed when they get this kind of backlog at \nthe NLRB. Again, they are most effective when they can get at this in a \nhurry. Workers who are fired for union organizing must sometimes wait \nweeks or months for cases to be processed. Then when the remedy does \ncome through it is too late. People have to move on with their lives. \nThey have found other jobs, they get the remedy, but it is too late to \nmake any kind of difference at all.\n  Employers are hurt because a delay causes back pay to add up until \nthe case is resolved. This creates uncertainty. It destabilizes the \nworkplace. I have had employers who have contacted my office and said: \nCan't you do something about NLRB? There is a case pending. It is \ncausing us a lot of headaches. So it is not just labor, but it is also \nmanagement that is hurt when you have this kind of backlog.\n  If this amendment goes through the funding level right now would put \nus, as I understand it, below the 1993 inflation-adjusted level for the \nNLRB. During that period of time, the number of cases has gone up. So \nyou can see the number of cases has gone up. We took a little bit out \nlast year because of some additional staffing we gave them. This budget \ncut would put us back where we were in 1993.\n  Of course, not only would the present backlog of cases take more \ntime, we could see actually more cases piling up behind the ones that \nare there.\n  Again, there is some thought that the NLRB is a kind of a prolabor \norganization. The NLRB is effective because it is a nonmanagement, \nnonlabor, independent board. It promotes stable and productive labor \nrelations. If they are not able to do their job, our whole society \nbreaks down.\n  Let me get to the point. The Senator from Arkansas wants to take $25 \nmillion out of this and put it into community health centers. I take a \nback seat to no one in supporting community\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\nhealth centers--consolidated health centers I guess they are now \ncalled--and have worked over the years with Senator Specter, as a \nmatter of fact, to increase funding for our community health centers. \nThey do a great job. In many cases, they are really the only source for \na lot of low-income people who have no health care insurance.\n  We worked very hard--Senator Specter, I, and our staffs--to get a \n$100 million increase. We are up to slightly over $1 billion now for \ncommunity health centers, and they need the money. But I do not think \nthey need the money at the expense of taking it out of the NLRB. We \ngave them a $100 million increase. I believe this will be more than \nsufficient to help get new community health centers started next year \nand to adequately fund the ones in existence.\n  While I support community health centers, this is not the way to get \nmoney for them, by taking it out of the NLRB and taking it out of the \nmore rapid resolution of the backlog of cases. Many times, the workers \nwho are waiting to get a case heard are the same ones who are low \nincome and need to have their cases resolved so they can get on with \ntheir jobs and their lives.\n  I yield back whatever remaining time I have.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick \nThompson from the HELP Committee staff and Mark Battaglini, who is a \nfellow, be granted the privilege of the floor during the debate on S. \n1650, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the numbers \nused a minute ago in talking about the number of cases filed and the \nnumber of cases disposed of in this seemingly inverted pyramid of \nbacklog of cases. It did not happen that way.\n  In 1997, there were 37,000 cases pending. In 1998, there were 34,000 \ncases pending. That is a decrease in the number of cases pending. That \nis not the same as the number of cases filed. There were 39,000 cases \nfiled in 1997; there were 36,000 cases filed in 1998. Both of those \nnumbers show a decrease in cases--a decrease in the number that were \npending and a decrease in the number that were filed. The Senator from \nIowa mentioned there was a decrease in the backlog, that they were \nworking that down.\n  Let me tell you how part of that backlog happens. In my previous \nlife, before I came to the Senate, I was an accountant. One of the \npeople I did accounting for received one of these notices of audit from \nthe National Labor Relations Board. They came in--it was about 10 days \nwork for me--and they looked over all of the accounts and decided at \nthe conclusion of that time verbally, not in writing, that there was no \nviolation. We said: Great; we will wait for your letter. It is \nmy understanding they are still waiting for that letter.\n\n  As far as they know, that is still a case pending. All of the work \nwas done, a decision was rendered verbally, and that ought to dispose \nof it. I know for that year it was still a case pending. For an \nemployer, sometimes this gray cloud hangs over, even after they have \nbeen assured there is no problem. That shows up in these statistics of \nthe backlog.\n  The other number presented, the number they worked, actually \nincreased; the number pending evidently was not pending in the next \nyear. So they were working a full 37,000 cases in 1997, plus a few more \nto work that backlog down.\n  This agency has been working the cases. They have been eliminating \nextra cases, some of which I do not think should have been part of the \nbacklog anyway. Now we are talking about significantly increasing the \namount of dollars. There would be an appropriate time to do that.\n  One of the things we talked about in a hearing in the subcommittee \nwas the legal fees these businesses have to put up when cases are \nbrought, and the cases, in some instances, are frivolous. At any rate, \nthe decision ought to be on whether the small business wins or not, and \nif they win, they ought to get back the costs they have expended on \nthis.\n  Part of the testimony in that hearing was from some other employers \nwho would never take a case to the NLRB because they know it is going \nto be more expensive to fight it than to pay it. That is not the way \nthe American Government is supposed to work. Businesses are not \nsupposed to live in fear of expensive litigation by their Federal \nGovernment with their tax money.\n  Perhaps an increase ought to accompany making a change where there is \nsome reimbursement for these small business employers who win--only \nwhen they win. But there could be a degree of fairness built in this at \nthe same time there is an increase. Until that happens, the community \nhealth centers are the place to put the money.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first I will speak to procedure and \nthen to substance.\n  I apologize to my friend from Arkansas, for whom I have a lot of \nrespect even though we do not agree on all issues. I used the words \n``sneak through,'' and I should not have said that. He is above board, \nand I know that. However, I do want to make it clear, my very good \nfriend, Senator Harkin, was talking to someone when that happened and \ntherefore was not fully aware of this agreement.\n  The fact is, on our side we believe this goes against our \nunderstanding of the way we operate. There was no intention of going \nforward with a unanimous consent agreement that would limit this to 1 \nhour with no second-degree amendments.\n  I say one more time, I certainly hope my colleague from Arkansas will \nunderstand that. I hope he will understand this is above and beyond the \ndebate. We can always debate issues. This is generating a lot of anger \nand indignation.\n  For my own part, I am committed to doing a second-degree amendment on \nevery amendment that comes to the floor forthwith, with no time limit \nat all, because I believe this should not have gone this way as a \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The reason I feel strongly about the procedure is because of the \nsubstance of what this is about. To me, it is a matter of justice \ndelayed is justice denied. I tell you, what is real important in our \ncountry is that people have the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, to earn a decent living, to give their children the care \nthey know they need and deserve.\n  Frankly, we ought to be doing much more by way of labor law reform. \nBut when you cut into the NLRB's budget, and you are going to reduce \nstaff by an additional 100 women and men, the only thing you are doing \nis you are making it impossible for many working people to have \njustice.\n  I do not even know the figures because I came rushing to the floor \nwhen I heard about this, but there are well over 10,000 people who are \nillegally fired. And quite often----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Is the Senator aware that the amendment does not cut \nthe budget for the NLRB, that it only flat-lines, it only eliminates \nthe increase in funding at a time when only 4 percent are being \nadjudicated and the number of cases is falling?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I am well aware \nthat it flat-lines, but it is similar to what we talk about with the \nveterans' health care budget. When you flat-line, and you do not take \ninto account additional inflation, then basically the effect of it is a \nreduction.\n  My understanding is that you have a reduction of about 5 percent. If \nthat is the effect, and if we cut into the man and woman power \nrequirements of the\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nNational Labor Relations Board, I am unalterably opposed to this \nbecause working people in this country have a right to be able to make \nan appeal. It should not be profitable for companies to illegally fire \npeople. It should not be easy for companies to break the law. When we \ntry to go after the NLRB, what we are doing is going after the rights \nof working people.\n  So I say to my colleagues, an awful lot is at stake here. The \nNational Labor Relations Board is all about a framework of laws we have \nset up in our country. It is all about making sure working people have \ncertain rights. I think this amendment guts some of those rights by \nbasically stripping away some of our enforcement power.\n  So I say to my colleague on the other side of the aisle that I do not \naccept this choice he presents to us. I think my colleague from Iowa \nprobably will be talking about what he has heard from the community \nhealth care clinics. But to pit one group of low-income citizens \nagainst another group of low- and moderate-income people, working-\nincome people, I think is simply outrageous.\n  Knowing the people I have met who work at the community health care \nclinics, I doubt the people who work at our community health care \nclinics are interested in some additional funding for them if that \nmeans taking away from the rights of working people. We are basically \ntalking about the same group of citizens--hard working, not necessarily \nmaking a lot of money, hoping that they will get a fair shake, hoping \nthat they will get decent health care, or hoping that their rights will \nbe respected.\n  I again say to my colleagues that when you flat-line the budget, you \neffectively cut the budget. You cut into the NLRB's capacity and \nability to represent working people. There will be more and more and \nmore delay. As my colleague from Pennsylvania said, justice delayed is \njustice denied. That is what this amendment is--it is a justice \ndelayed/justice denied amendment as it affects working people in this \ncountry.\n\n  Therefore, I would like to have the opportunity--we would like to \nhave the opportunity to offer a second-degree amendment. I hope my \ncolleague from Arkansas will reconsider, given the fact that there is, \nat best, confusion about what happened; and we are hoping we can go on \ntogether in good faith. If not, I say, one more time, that for my own \npart, I will just offer second-degree amendments to every single \namendment offered on the other side of the aisle, with no time limit \nwhatsoever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator from Pennsylvania have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could have 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I hope I can have the attention of Senators and the Senator from \nArkansas, the proponent of the amendment.\n  I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health \nCenters on the phone. They said to me that I could say the following \nthings publicly:\n  No. 1, they did not ask for nor seek this amendment.\n  No. 2, they are quite happy with the Specter-Harkin increases that \ncame in the appropriations bill and hope that we can keep it in \nconference--which I publicly assure them and others that we will do \neverything we can to keep the $100 million increase.\n  And, No. 3, while they appreciate the intention of the Senator from \nArkansas to get more funding for community health centers, they do not \nwant it to happen at the expense of the NLRB.\n  So I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health \nCenters. I wanted to make that point; that they would not want this to \nhappen at the expense of the NLRB.\n  I yield back my time, I guess.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just respond to the Senator from Iowa.\n  I do not know who he spoke to at the health centers. I suppose \nwhoever it was is a spokesman for all of them. But the ones I would \nlike to speak for are the 83,000 people who could be served if this \namendment were adopted. The $25 million, it is estimated, would allow \nthese health centers to be able to serve 83,000 more people. Those are \nthe ones I am concerned about. I am not so much concerned about whoever \nin Washington, DC, decided that the NLRB needed a big increase.\n  The fact is, the NLRB has said with this increased funding they will \nhire 122 more people, and they will buy an $11 million computer system. \nSo I would say to the Senator from Minnesota, that is the issue. Do you \nwant an $11 million computer system for the NLRB and 122 more employees \nor do you want to help 83,000 more people to get health care in the \ndelta and the poor areas of this country who are currently not \nreceiving it?\n  It is a pretty simple issue. We can try to cloud it with \nparliamentary questions. We can try to cloud it with questions about a \nUC that was adopted. But there is a very fundamental question in which \nI believe very strongly.\n  I oftentimes hear the Senator from Minnesota speak with great passion \nand the Senator from Iowa speak with great passion as to how they are \nprepared to create a problem in the Senate in order to further their \ngoals. I admire them. I respect them for their commitment.\n  I just say, I have a deep belief about those who are being served by \nthese community health centers. I have visited them. I see the good \nwork they do. I see the fact that poor people can walk in and not have \nto worry about presenting an insurance policy in order to get help. I \nknow the value of helping those little children in the delta when they \nget preventive health care services now and what that is going to save \nus down the line, not only in terms of our budget but in terms of the \nquality of life that they are going to be able to live.\n  Once again, I reiterate the numbers concerning the NLRB. We have \nseen, over the last 25 years, their budget cut by 21 percent, while the \ncaseloads have dropped 31 percent. This isn't a new thing. Last year, \nwe flat-lined their budget, and the result was they had fewer cases \nfiled and a smaller backlog with a flat-line budget.\n  I think anybody who will listen to the arguments and look at the \nnumbers will have a difficult time accepting the logic that they need \nto hire 122 more people and buy an $11 million computer system, having \na $25 million increase in their budget at a time we could be helping \npoor people get health care around this country.\n  So it is a very clear question. I think clouding it is not the answer \nas to how we resolve it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think we have just reached an agreement informally, \nwhich I would like to propound now as a unanimous consent request.\n  The earlier unanimous consent request prohibiting a second-degree \namendment is vitiated. We will now proceed to have the Senator from \nArkansas offer a second-degree amendment to his first-degree amendment. \nWe will have 30 minutes of debate.\n  It has now been reduced to writing. I will begin again. I ask \nunanimous consent that the previous consent agreement relating to the \npending Hutchinson amendment be vitiated. I ask consent that prior to a \nmotion to table the second-degree amendment to be presented forthwith \nby the Senator from Arkansas, the time be limited to 30 minutes equally \ndivided, and following the disposition of the Hutchinson second-degree \namendment, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reserving the right to object--and I don't intend to \nobject--should the motion on my second degree be a motion to table and \nthe\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\ntabling motion failed, would my second degree still be the pending \nbusiness? I need an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If it fails, then Senator Wellstone will be recognized \nfor offering a second degree.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Should the motion to table fail, I would assume by \nvoice vote my second-degree amendment would be adopted, and then at \nthat point Senator Wellstone would be recognized to offer a second \ndegree. Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could not hear all of this.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. My question is, at the end of the 30 minutes of \ndebate on my second-degree amendment, should there be a motion to table \nmy second degree, and if the motion to table were to fail, my \nassumption is that we would at that point adopt my second degree by \nvoice vote, at which point Senator Wellstone would be recognized to \noffer his second degree. I just wanted that clarified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Reserving the right to object, a question to the \nmanager: Wasn't there a time limit agreed to, if there is a Wellstone \nsecond degree. I thought we were at 30 or 45 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Minnesota be willing to stipulate \nnow to a time agreement, if he is to offer a second-degree amendment, \nsay, to 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say, in good faith, that I am \nnot going to make it open-ended. I am now waiting word from other \noffices as to who will be down here, so I can't agree to a time limit, \nalthough I don't intend to extend it for hours. I have to wait and see \nhow many people want to speak. For right now, I think we should leave \nit as it was and hope my colleagues will trust me that I am not trying \nto drag it on and on. I can't agree to that right now.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a question to the Senator from \nMinnesota, it is your anticipation that it would be relevant to the \nfirst degree?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No objection to the unanimous-consent agreement which we \nhave propounded with modifications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1834 To Amendment No. 1812\n\n              (Purpose: To transfer amounts appropriated)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1834 to amendment No. 1812.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n\n             ``of funds for the consolidated health centers\n\n       ``Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $25,471,000 of the amounts appropriated for the National \n     Labor Relations Board under this Act shall be transferred and \n     utilized to carry out projects for the consolidated health \n     centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 254b).''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, under the UC, it is my understanding \nthat there is no time limit currently on the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes under the unanimous \nconsent, equally divided on the Senator's second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is fine.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me a couple \nminutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't mean to take any more time of the Senator from \nArkansas. I can't help poking a little bit at him before the vote.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Arkansas is trying to take \n$25 million out of the NLRB for the community health centers. Why \ndidn't the Senator from Arkansas try to take $25 million out of the \ndefense appropriations to help the community health centers? Why didn't \nhe try to take $25 million out of energy and water or all the other 12 \nappropriations bills that came down here? Why go after the NLRB?\n  As I pointed out, I just spoke with the Association of Community \nHealth Centers. They said that while they appreciate his intentions of \ngiving them more money, they don't want to do it at the expense of the \nNLRB. I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, my staff talked to the community \nhealth centers, and they clarified that they do not oppose this \namendment. In fact, while they may have concerns about how they are \ngetting involved in a political fight before the Senate that may affect \ntheir relationship with the appropriators, in fact I think they would \nvery much welcome the additional $25 million for health care in rural \nareas. That is where their heart is. They want to help people. They are \nnot going to turn away $25 million to help.\n  The Senator from Iowa is concerned about why I didn't take this from \nthe Department of Defense bill or shift it from something else, and why \nwe chose the NLRB. I think I made that case very convincingly. They \nhave done an excellent job. They ought to be commended for their \npriorities and their impact analysis system by which the most critical \ncases are taken first.\n  They have seen a decrease in the backlog. They have seen a decrease \nin the number of cases being filed--all the time not seeing an increase \nin their budget. To increase it by $25 million so they can buy an $11 \nmillion computer and hire 122 more people at a time when there are tens \nof thousands of people in the poor areas of this country being left \nuninsured and without access to basic health care, I think, is a pretty \neasy call.\n  While I think I can make a strong case for why we need to increase \ndefense spending, when we have treatment goals failing in virtually \nevery branch of the military, with the exception of the Marines, and \nwhen we see tens of thousands of our men and women in uniform on food \nstamps, I can tell you why I didn't take it from defense. But the more \nimportant question is why NLRB? Because it is a Washington bureaucracy \nthat is going to get bigger under that plan to buy a computer and hire \n122 more people at a time when they have seen a decrease in the \nworkload. That is why. It is very simple.\n  I know there is a need in the community health centers, and I want to \nhelp them. This is a little bit of help. It is enough help to provide \nhealth care for an additional 83,000 people nationwide. And some of \nthose folks are going to be in the delta of Arkansas.\n  This is not a difficult amendment to vote for. It is a pretty easy \ncase. I have had to come down and defend a lot of amendments on this \nfloor, but I don't think I have ever had one that I felt more strongly \nabout personally or for which it was easier to make the case.\n  The budget for the NLRB has been cut over the years. From 1980 to \n1998--over that 18-year period--their budget declined 21 percent. That \nsounds pretty bad until you realize the number of charges received and \nprocessed declined 10 percent more than that--31 percent.\n  To stand on the floor of the Senate and say we are disenfranchising, \nthat we are denying justice by not increasing by $25 million the budget \nfor a Washington bureaucracy, I am sorry; I don't think that sells. And \nI don't think it is too convincing to those who are going to be denied \nhealth care by the defeat of this amendment.\n  They have done a good job in reducing the backlog. They have done a \ngood job in seeing a fewer number of charges. And they have done so \nwith lower budgets over the last 18 years. It doesn't make any sense \nnow to increase it dramatically by $25 million so they can hire 122 \nmore people and buy an $11 million computer system.\n  I suggest that money would be better used by people in the poor \ncommunities, in the rural areas of this country, to ensure that they \ncan walk in--44 percent of them are children--and not have to worry \nabout presenting insurance documentation when they go\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\ninto these health centers; that they can get treatment. Eighty-three \nthousand more people would be served. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commented earlier that I would defer to \nthe statistics. I am about to put a detailed chart into the Record. It \nis true that the backlog went down from about 6,200 to about 5,500 \nbecause we added $10 million to the budget. We are now proposing to add \napproximately $24 million to the budget, which will buy a computer, \nwhich is not inexpensive. Computers are expensive. That will enable the \nNLRB to move part way into the latter part of the 20th century, if not \nthe 21st century.\n  The projection is that the backlog would then be reduced to about \n1,960 cases. If this is not done, there are many employees who are now \nat the NLRB who would be lost. I think it is plain that for the NLRB to \nkeep up with the backlog and do its job, they need these additional \nemployees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     MAJOR WORKLOAD AND OUTPUT DATA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          FY 1998    FY 1999    FY 2000\n                                           actual    estimate   request\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1) Regional Offices:\n  Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Cases:\n    Situations Pending Preliminary           7,434      6,198      5,487\n     Investigation at Start of Year....\n    Case Intake During Year............  \\1\\ 30,42     30,200     32,000\n                                                 2\n    Consolidation of Dispositions......  \\1\\ 2,327      2,880      2,880\n    Total ULP Proceedings..............     29,331     29,831     32,647\n    Situations Pending Preliminary           6,198      5,487      1,960\n     Investigation at End of Year......\n  Representation Cases:\n    Case Intake During Year............  \\1\\ 6,215      6,179      6,179\n    Dispositions.......................      3,091      3,012      3,218\n    Regional Directors Decisions.......        769        704        722\n(2) Administrative Law Judges:\n  Hearings Pending at Start of Year....      1,210      1,106      1,046\n  Hearings Closed......................        444        521        573\n  Hearings Pending at End of Year......      1,106      1,046        958\n  Adjustments After Hearings Closed....          0          1          1\n  Decisions Pending at Start of Year...        216        134        120\n  Decisions Issued.....................        528        538        590\n  Decisions Pending at End of Year.....        134        120        107\n(3) Board Adjudication:\n  Contested Board Decisions Issued.....        426        532        556\n  Representation Election Cases:\n    Decisions Issued...................        275        237        248\n    Objection Rulings..................        214        171        187\n(4) General Counsel--Washington:\n  Advice Pending at Start of Year......         58        129        172\n  Advice Cases Received During Year....        762        716        760\n  Advice Disposed......................        691        673        785\n  Advice Pending at End of Year........        129        172        147\n  Appeals Pending at Start of Year.....        980        910      1,077\n  Appeals Received During Year.........      3,316      3,313      3,401\n  Appeals Disposed.....................      3,386      3,146      3,828\n  Appeals Pending at End of Year.......        910      1,077        650\n  Enforcement Cases Received During            271        287        304\n   Year................................\n  Enforcement Briefs Filed.............        145        152        161\n  Enforcement Cases Dropped or Settled.         63         64         68\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Actual figures for FY 1998 are preliminary and still being\n  reconciled.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had announced earlier my hope to stack \nthe votes. But in light of the procedural context that we are in now, I \nam advised that there will not be an agreement to set this amendment \naside. It is my hope that we can vote as promptly as possible.\n  I move to table the Hutchinson second-degree amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his \namendment.\n  I have followed the activities of the NLRB for many years--since I \ncame to the Senate, in fact. It is certainly not clear to me that this \nagency needs a $25 million increase over last year's level--\nparticularly when the subcommittee was forced to be so frugal with a \nnumber of other high priority programs.\n  I support the reallocation of these funds to the Consolidated Health \nServices account for the Community Health Centers. We have long worried \nabout access to primary health care for low-income families. This \namendment is a way that we can provide such care for 83,000 more \nAmericans.\n  The Senator from Iowa said that he was told the association \nrepresenting community health centers did not request this amendment. I \ncam appreciate the rationale of the association. They, of course, \nrecognize the hard work done by the subcommittee in putting together \nthis bill and wish to support that by taking a neutral position on the \nHutchinson amendment.\n  However, let's put the amendment in perspective. The NLRB is getting \na $25 million increase--an unprecedented increase--over 10 percent. \nThere has been no justification offered for this increase. The caseload \nhas consistently declined over the decade.\n  Now, the appropriations committee has provided an increase for the \ncommunity health centers of $99.3 million. This is badly needed, \ncomparison with the NLRB notwithstanding.\n  The additional funds provided by the Hutchinson amendment would \npermit health centers to serve 83,000 more people. That is the most \nimportant point, to me.\n  Mr. President, let's compare: $25 million for 122 more federal \nemployees and new computers versus health care for 83,000 Americans. \nThis is a no brainer for me.\n  I hope it is for my colleagues as well. I urge Senators to support \nthe Hutchinson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there still time remaining on the \nHutchinson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that time is allocated to each side, if I might yield \nto the chairman of the subcommittee at this point, I don't want to \ndelay the proceedings, if he wants to move to a vote. It is my \nunderstanding there is time remaining on the debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as manager of the bill, I do wish to move \nto a vote. I would be delighted to hear how much time the Senator from \nIllinois wants, to hear his closing argument, and then to proceed to a \nvote on the tabling motion.\n  How much time would he like?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes would be more than enough.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree. There is another unanimous consent agreement on \ntop of that. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nIllinois speaks for up to 10 minutes, we move to a vote on the tabling \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. With 2 minutes for Senator Hutchinson to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  This is a difficult choice which is offered to us by the Senator from \nArkansas in terms of transferring money because hardly any Member of \nthe Senate will argue that community health centers should have more \nresources. We opened a new one in my hometown. It is very important in \nmany rural areas. In smalltown America, these community health centers \nprovide health care that is not otherwise available. So in that regard \nI applaud his effort. I only take exception to his source.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has been a pain in the side of big \nbusiness for over 60 years because it is a mechanism for dealing with \ndisputes between employers and employees and employees and labor \nunions.\n  There has been an effort by those who cannot repeal the law creating \nthis agency to reduce the resources of the agency and make the delays \nin the backlog so insufferable that the agency virtually was stopped in \nits tracks. Not that many years ago there was a hard freeze on this \nagency which resulted in slowing down the process for years.\n  As I travel around the State of Illinois, and I listen to my \ncolleagues from other parts of the Nation, I find that if you are \ntrying to organize a plant, for example, to bring in a labor union, and \nthere is some dispute about whether both sides are following the law, \nit is almost impossible to turn to the NLRB and expect a timely \ndecision on violations of the law. As a consequence, the whole effort \nof collective bargaining, which has been a recognized legal right in \nthis country for decades, is jeopardized because of efforts to strangle \nthis agency.\n  This is not a voluntary reduction in NLRB funds. This is an effort to \nstop its mission. Frankly, I think that is a serious mistake because we \nunderstand as well that some of the rights that are protected by the \nNational Labor Relations Board were rights that were fought for over \nthe years by many people who gave their blood and their lives to make \ncertain that the concept principle of collective bargaining would be \nrecognized.\n  Listen to this about the agency backlog currently facing the NLRB. \nDespite\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\nthe agency's success in screening out tens of thousands of public \ninquiries and voluntarily resolving the vast majority of its \nrepresentation in unfair labor practice, backlogs continue to grow with \nno concomitant increases in staffing.\n  I salute the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and his counterpart on the Democratic side, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. They have recognized it and put $25 million into the NLRB.\n  When you look to where this money is being spent, it is for things \nthat are absolutely essential--training the people who work there, the \nattorneys, the hearing officers, and the like to make sure people get a \nfair chance and their day in court.\n  The Senator from Arkansas closes out that possibility. He takes the \n$25 million away.\n  Some of the funds here are used to modernize computer equipment to \ndeal with the Y2K problem. The Senator from Arkansas, by cutting $25 \nmillion, makes that more difficult to achieve. A lot of the money is \nused for basic administration of the agency, relocating people where \nthey are needed, where the workload is growing. The Senator from \nArkansas steps in the path of that. I suggest to those listening to the \ndebate on this amendment, don't just dwell on where the money is going. \nLook to the source of the money.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania very eloquently has presented the fact \nthat the backlogs are still a problem and, if we adopt the approach of \nthe Senator from Arkansas, we are going to be, if not turning out the \nlights, dimming the lights in a very important agency where justice is \npart of the agenda; in fact, it is the reason for the existence of the \nagency.\n  Looking at what the NLRB has accomplished in a very short period of \ntime, one understands why they need to be in business and fully \nstaffed. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board cases resulted \nin reinstatement offers to 4,500 American employees who alleged \nunlawful firing or layoff. They also had cases that resulted in back \npay and other monetary recovery to more than 24,000 American workers \ntotaling more than $92 million. They also held nearly 3,800 \nrepresentation elections affecting a quarter million American workers.\n  What the Senator from Arkansas does with his amendment is restrict \nthe power of this agency to do its job, to say to America's workers \nfrom one coast to the other, they are not going to be able to call this \nagency and expect it to be there and be responsive.\n  If you decide in a democratic election by majority vote at your \nbusiness to bargain collectively and to seek representation of a union, \nthe Senator from Arkansas makes sure your telephone call goes \nunanswered at NLRB when you need a helping hand to resolve a dispute \nbetween employer and employee. If you are someone fired and fired \nillegally or unlawfully, who turns to the Federal legal network, the \nNational Labor Relations Board, and says, I was discriminated against, \nI was unlawfully fired, the Senator from Arkansas makes certain your \ntelephone call is not likely to be answered.\n  Mr. President, $25 million is taken out of the agency, including \nmoney for computer modernization. On the whole question of whether or \nnot you are going to have union representation in a free and democratic \nprocess and whether you have the National Labor Relations Board to make \nsure both sides follow the rules, the Senator from Arkansas, with his \namendment, takes the $25 million out of this agency which is necessary \nfor them to keep up with their workload.\n  I say those who oppose the National Labor Relations Board and want to \nclose it down should do it in a clean vote. Put your amendment on the \nfloor to close it down, have it up or down, and decide whether American \nworkers will have this forum for protection or not. But to bleed off \nfrom this agency $25 million they need to protect workers across the \nUnited States in the name of helping community health centers is a \ntactic that should be exposed for what it is. It is an effort to take \naway from a very important agency the resources they need to respond to \nthe requests of American workers across the Nation.\n  I might add for those who think this is another labor amendment or \nantilabor amendment, those who dispute the treatment under their labor \nagreements, employees who believe labor organizations are not treating \nthem fairly, have the National Labor Relations Board to turn to as \nwell; it is not just the private sector companies.\n  American workers' rights are at stake here. This is not just a \nquestion of health care in rural areas, which I support; it is a \nquestion of whether or not we will protect the hard-fought-for rights \nof American workers across the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, to table this motion, to stand by this \nsubcommittee, and make sure the National Labor Relations Board has the \nresources it needs to do the job that is very important to American \nworkers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I regret that the Senator from \nIllinois implies that I deny the employees of this country their right \nunder the National Labor Relations Act. I certainly would not imply by \nhis position that he supports denying 83,000 Americans health care \nserved under the $25 million added to the budget of the health centers. \nI wouldn't make such a suggestion. I regret he made such a suggestion \nbefore the Senate.\n  If we were denying justice for employees, I would not offer this \namendment. The reality is, we are not cutting a dime from the NLRB. We \nare only eliminating the $25 million increase so they can hire 122 more \nemployees and a computer system at a time when the caseload is \ndecreasing. Mr. President, a 31-percent decrease in caseload I don't \nthink justifies a $25 million increase in funding.\n  It is not hard to understand. Make that case to the American people. \nI will go out and say this is what we should do, flat-line their budget \nat a time they have decreasing workload and put more money into \ncommunity health centers. That is what this amendment does.\n  If Members want to vote against community health centers and vote for \nmore bureaucracy, Members have their opportunity. I want to serve those \n83,000 people who will receive health care because of this $25 million \ninfusion into this very worthwhile program. It is bureaucrats at the \nNLRB--122 more employees--or serving people who need health care, \nprimarily children.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the children of this country, not the \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under a previous order, the question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1834. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I would like to object until I look at the change in \nthe language.\n  The wrong page number. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today as Americans head off to work, 17 of \nthem will die and 18,600 of them will be injured on the job. All of us \non the Labor Committee have worked very hard to make sure those numbers \ncome down--not go up. We do not want an increase; we want a dramatic \ndecrease in deaths. We want a dramatic decrease in the number who are \ninjured. I repeat: 17 working Americans will not be returning home \ntonight because they will die on the job.\n  As chairman of the Worker Safety Subcommittee, I feel responsible to \nthose families for making sure we are doing all we can to prevent those \nhorrible accidents from occurring in the first place. I feel \nresponsible for finding solutions that will help protect more workers \nfrom harm.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, is the \nGovernment agency responsible for regulating safety laws in America. \nThe way OSHA is supposed to work is that it should be providing helpful \nassistance to the overwhelming number of employers who are actively \npursuing safer workplaces. And I can tell you that according to OSHA:\n\n       . . . 95 percent of the employers do their level best to \n     try to voluntarily comply with OSHA.\n\n  ``Voluntarily comply with OSHA''--that was stated by Frank Strasheim, \nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary of OSHA.\n  Simultaneously, OSHA should be effectively targeting those employers \nwho are willfully disregarding safety laws. They should be inspecting \nthem. They should be fining them. And they should follow up to ensure \nthe bad practices are stopped before accidents occur.\n  But everyone knows that is not what is actually happening. What is \nhappening is that OSHA lumps all employers together--both the good and \nthe bad--treats them the same, and tries to inspect and fine them all, \nno matter how small or ridiculous the violation. Meanwhile, serious and \npotentially deadly practices go uninspected and unstopped. The result \nis disastrous and, unfortunately, often fatal.\n  I am not trying to decrease any funding for OSHA. What this amendment \ndoes is shift the emphasis so that there is some money being spent on \nconsultation. We have had a lot of hearings. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion. We have said that prevention is where we want to be, \nprevention of an accident, not persecution after a death. That is not \nhow this is supposed to work.\n\n  As reported in the Associated Press, three-quarters of the worksites \nin the United States that had serious accidents in 1994 and 1995 had \nnever been inspected by OSHA during this decade. The report also showed \nthat even OSHA officials acknowledge that their inspectors do not get \nto a lion's share of lethal sites until after accidents occur because \nit takes OSHA, according to the AFL-CIO, over 167 years to reach every \nworksite in this country. We want them to be able to serve everyone, \nbut 167 years? That means the budget would have to be increased 167 \ntimes to do that. The fact is that OSHA neither helps those good-faith \nemployers who want to achieve compliance with the safety laws, nor \neffectively deters bad employers from breaking the law.\n  How long does it take to get an inspection? That varies quite a bit \nby State. Those that are State plan States get a little bit more \nfrequent visits than those that are not State plan States. So the \nFederal ones, some of them, it will be more than 200 years that they \nhave the odds of not getting an inspection.\n  This point is so important, I will say again, because it takes OSHA \nover 167 years to reach every worksite in this country. The fact is \nthat OSHA neither helps those good-faith employers who want to achieve \ncompliance with safety laws, nor effectively deters bad employers from \nbreaking the law. OSHA's response has been to ask Congress for more and \nmore enforcement dollars. I say that response is no response. I say \nthat response only begs the question. Using OSHA's framework, the \nscenario would be as follows: Since it takes 167 years for OSHA to \ninvestigate every worksite in the country, we would need to increase \nOSHA's enforcement budget 167 times in order for OSHA to inspect every \nworksite every year. It doesn't take as long when they are doing \nconsultation, and it reduces accidents.\n  Increasing it 167 times would be a reckless, unrealistic suggestion \nthat doesn't even get to the heart of the problem. That is not even the \nworst part. The worst part is what OSHA's response for more enforcement \ndollars\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\nsays to those 95 percent of employers who are doing their level best to \ncomply. It says: Hey, Mr. Good-Faith Employer, we know you are trying \nto comply, but you are out of luck because even if you are trying to be \nsafe, if you don't know what you are doing, or if you make a wrong \ninterpretation of the statute, we are going to fine you. We are going \nto fine you big.\n  Here are the facts: Employers have to read through, try to understand \nand interpret, and implement over 1,200 pages of highly technical \nsafety regulations--1,200 pages. That is what I have right here. Do you \nknow how big numbers like that are in Washington? I want to make this \nclear as possible so I brought a little show and tell.\n  Before I do that, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1885 To Amendment No. 1846\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify provisions relating to expenditures by the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration by authorizing 50 percent \nof the amount appropriated that is in excess of the amount appropriated \n    for such purpose for fiscal year 1999 to be used for compliance \n  assistance and 50 percent of such amount for enforcement and other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment and \nsend it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1885 to amendment No. 1846.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following: \n     ``That of the amount appropriated under this heading that is \n     in excess of the amount appropriated for such purposes for \n     fiscal year 1999, $16,883,000 shall be used to carry out the \n     activities described in paragraph (1) and $16,883,000 shall \n     be used to carry out paragraphs (2) through (6);''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was mentioning these regulations, these \n1,200 pages of regulations. That is what we expect the businessman to \nknow, understand, and implement. Just imagine, Dodd's Bootery in \nLaramie or Corral West Ranchware in Cheyenne or Bubba's Barbeque in \nJackson. They are supposed to have understood all five of these huge \nvolumes. There are more pages in these OSHA regulations than ``Gone \nwith the Wind'' or ``The Canterbury Tales'' or even the Old Testament \nand the New Testament combined. Adding insult to injury, in many cases \nOSHA's regulations are so complicated and so complex that even if you \nread through it all, deciding one correct interpretation of a rule is \nnearly impossible.\n  Take OSHA's draft safety and health rule, for example. This is the \ndraft one. This is one I have a lot of concern about. What this draft \nrule would require is for almost all employers, regardless of their \nsize or type, to put in place a written safety plan. Now, I am in favor \nof safety plans. I know that safety plans make a difference in safety \nin the workplace. I have watched that. But this is a draft rule. It \nsounds right. This is not only mandatory, but the elements of the rule \nare completely subjective to human nature.\n  For example, the rule requires the program, and I quote, to be \n``appropriate'' to conditions in the workplace and an employer to \nevaluate the effectiveness of the program. He is supposed to evaluate \nthe effectiveness as often as necessary, and where appropriate, to \ninitiate corrective action. So I throw out this question to the Senate: \nHow often is as often as necessary? Is it once a month? Once a week? \nEvery day? I can envision 1,000 different responses from 1,000 \ndifferent angles. So how on Earth do we expect small businesses to \ncope, not only with reading these five volumes but also to understand \nwhat is meant by them, how OSHA would interpret them, and then to draw \nup a safety plan?\n  That, however, is exactly what the draft rule expects every small \nbusiness in this country to do. The safety subcommittee, which I chair, \nhas had two hearings examining the effects of OSHA. The first was a \nhearing to highlight how so many good-faith employers want safe \nworkplaces but are drowning in these 1,200 pages of highly technical \nsafety regulations. Every single one of the employers who came to the \nhearing agreed that they were left to their own to comply with every \none of the thousands of rules without helpful assistance from OSHA.\n  The second hearing we held was about the flip side of that coin, how \nOSHA is not deterring the bad employers from willfully violating safety \nlaws either. The subcommittee heard from family members who lost loved \nones in workplace accidents and how OSHA neither helped prevent those \naccidents from occurring nor adequately responded after the accidents \ntook place.\n  To those people who have told me that the new OSHA is on the right \ntrack and that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' I ask them to read \nthrough our hearing transcript and see if it will change their minds. \nSince I don't have much time, I would like to tell my colleagues about \none of the witnesses who testified before our subcommittee whose name \nis Ron Hayes.\n  In 1993, Ron and his family didn't know much about OSHA and were not \nall that active in the worker safety scene. But in 1993, Ron's 19-year-\nold son, Patrick, was killed at his job in a grain elevator in Florida \nafter being pulled under the grain and suffocated. Losing his son \nchanged Ron's entire life. Since that time, Ron has worked day in and \nday out to get answers about how to make employees safer and healthier.\n\n  Ron and his wife, Dot, struggled to understand why more hadn't been \ndone on behalf of their son and what could be done in the future to \nchange the tide of workers' injuries and deaths.\n  Ron and Dot founded Families In Grief Holding Together, called FIGHT. \nIt is a project to help other families enact changes in the arena of \nworkplace safety and to work through grief. Ron Hayes is one of the \nmost courageous and honest people I have ever met in my life, not to \nmention the fact that he has become one of the most proficient OSHA \nexperts in the country. His story continues to inspire me and push me \nforward.\n  Reading an excerpt from Ron's testimony:\n\n       Each year over 10,000 people are killed on the job. In \n     1993, one of those who died was our beloved son, Patrick \n     Hayes. I did not come here today to rebuke or chastise \n     anyone. I am simply here to plead--no, to beg you great \n     statesmen to work together to come up with positive solutions \n     for a better agency. No one wants to get rid of OSHA, we just \n     want the agency to do its job, protect workers, help train \n     and support business. I ask you great statesmen to lay down \n     your party affiliations and work toward a common goal.\n       I often wonder why the good businesses in our country \n     continue to stay safe. Sometimes they are at a disadvantage \n     by their own good deeds. These good businesses build into \n     their product or bids safety measures and are sometimes \n     undercut or underbid by other uncaring business owners, so \n     under our present OSHA system, where is their benefit? The \n     bad companies know OSHA is ineffective and because of the \n     length of time it will take OSHA to inspect every work site \n     or get around to inspecting them, the odds are on their side \n     and even if caught, they know OSHA will not do much.\n       OSHA's reactive enforcement methodology has not and is not \n     working. Letting OSHA continue in this manner and giving them \n     more and more money each year for enforcement and getting \n     less and less each year is just crazy. Someone has to take a \n     stand and make some hard decisions for our very future.\n\n  Ron's strong, unwavering stand is that OSHA consultation, rather than \nreactive ``find and fine'' enforcement, is the answer that will save \nworkers like Patrick from being killed on the job.\n  I agree with Ron. That is why I am here today with this amendment.\n  The amendment isn't to decrease the enforcement of OSHA. The \namendment is to make sure there is an increase in consultation, an \nincrease in the people who go to the places to look for the problem, \ninterpret the problem, suggest the solution, and also make it a bigger \npenalty if they come back later and it hasn't been solved.\n  My amendment is simple. It puts half of the $33 million increase into \nOSHA's budget, into a consultation group program that helps employers \nknow how to comply. The other half is still an increase directed \ntowards OSHA enforcement.\n  What is OSHA consultation? OSHA consultation is the effective \nalternative to OSHA enforcement. It is what is currently working well \nand is highly praised by employees and employers. It is praised by the \nagency,\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nand it has been praised by this Congress.\n  It allows employers to call OSHA and ask them to come in and help \nthem read through the five volumes of OSHA regulations to see what \napplies to them and how to turn the regulations into tangible safety \nsolutions. It allows employers to ask questions, to get help from the \ninside, and partner with the agency, all without threat of fines or \ncitations. It makes it a little safer for them to ask OSHA questions. \nThat can be as intimidating as it would be for a person to ask the IRS \nquestions. But the consultation function gives them that opportunity. \nThey are expected to fix what is found.\n  Consultation works. The fact is that you cannot force an employer to \ncomply with regulations he doesn't understand or does not know how to \nimplement. It doesn't do any good to threaten employers to comply when \nthey do not know how. If an employer isn't getting the help he needs, \nan inspection won't make the difference. The key is helping employers \nto understand what the regulations mean and how they work.\n  Consultation is the answer because it puts the emphasis on \npartnership, cooperation, and information sharing. And if, as OSHA \nestimates, 95 percent of American employers are trying to do the right \nthing, spending money on consultation is money well spent because the \nvast majority of employers will take OSHA's suggestions to heart and \nbecome safer without the threat of fines and coercion.\n  That allows OSHA to concentrate on the bad employers, to put some \nspecial emphasis there, to go after the people who don't make the \ncorrection, the people who aren't interested in safety and are relying \non getting away on that 167-year inspection schedule.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Look at what Vice President \nGore has said about the virtues of consultation:\n\n       No army of federal auditors descends upon American \n     businesses to audit their books; the Government forces them \n     to have the job done themselves. In the same way, no army of \n     OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate America.\n\n  In his Report on Reinventing Government, the Vice President concluded \nthat employers should be encouraged by OSHA to use private safety \nprofessionals as a way to vastly improve the health and safety of \nAmerican workers ``without bankrupting the federal treasury.'' Such an \napproach would ``ensure that all workplaces are regularly inspected, \nwithout hiring thousands of new employees.'' By establishing incentives \ndesigned to encourage workplaces to comply, ``[w]orksites with good \nhealth, safety, and compliance records would be allowed to report less \nfrequently to the Labor Department, to undergo fewer audits, and to \nsubmit to less paperwork.'' He concluded by saying that ``No army of \nfederal auditors descends upon American businesses to audit their \nbooks; the government forces them to have the job done themselves. In \nthe same way, no army of OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate \nAmerica.''\n  I agree with the Vice President's praise for consultation. This \namendment simply puts the money where our mouths are.\n  A few final remarks to remind everyone what a balanced approach this \namendment really is. Does this amendment tie OSHA's hands on the \nenforcement front? No. It gives OSHA a 50 percent increase over its \n1999 budget to use for enforcement. That is a lot of additional people \nto hire and train. Does this amendment strip OSHA's ability to go after \nthat thin layer of bad work sites? No. They have more money to go after \nthose work sites than they did last year. What it does do is help those \n95 percent of employers who OSHA estimates are doing their best to \ncomply with OSHA and to find safety solutions that work.\n  It helps them out, too.\n  This amendment is more of a statement than it is an actual change \nwithin the department. Oversight capability of seeing where the money \nreally winds up is pretty limited, but our ability to assign it there \nin the first place is not.\n  I am pleased that there is an increase in the budget for OSHA. I am \ndisappointed they didn't designate part of that for consultation as \nwell. Beefing up OSHA's proactive consultation approach empowers both \nOSHA and the employer to achieve safer worksites.\n  I have seen these consultation programs work. I have seen people \nclamoring to have the consultation, and I have seen them get in long \nwaiting lines for it. These are the people who want to comply, who \nunderstand that there are 1,200 pages, and who want to do the right \nthing. But there isn't enough consultation money out there to help them \nget the consultation in a timely fashion. All we are doing is saying, \nplease earmark some of that money for consultation; don't put all of it \ninto enforcement and persecution.\n  By voting in favor of this amendment, OSHA's own consultation \nprograms will be extended to even more employers who are seeking safety \nand health solutions. The result will mean vastly improved safety for \nAmerica's worksites.\n  This is something I have been talking about to all of the Members on \nthe committee since I came to Washington. This is an approach that \nneeds to be stated in our appropriations as well. Again, it is not an \nelimination of safety and not an elimination of inspection but a 50-\npercent increase in the money going to enforcement. That is what we \nneed to have. But we also need to be sure the consultation programs are \nimproving and increasing and are more accessible in a timely manner. If \npeople have to wait a year for a consultation, accidents can happen. \nThey are interested in doing it. They are ready to budget the money to \nfix it because if they don't, it doesn't do them any good.\n  This is an amendment that just places some priority. It doesn't say \nall we are going to do is enforce and that all we are going to do is \nfind and beat you up and fine you. It says if you will ask the \nquestions, if you are serious about safety, if you want to help, we are \ngoing to help.\n  I hope you will support me on this allocation of money to \nconsultation as well as an increase in enforcement.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me point out to all of my colleagues \nthat I think the approach we want to take here if we want to have more \nfunding for consultation is to just simply advance that by the $9 \nmillion. But the last thing in the world I want to do is take resources \naway from enforcement, which is the backbone of worker safety. That is \nreally a flaw of this amendment introduced by my colleague from \nWyoming.\n  As a matter of fact, at our March 4 hearing, a majority of witnesses \nwere asked why more small businesses do not take advantage of free \nconsultation services available in all 50 States. The majority of the \nwitnesses said--this is not a direct quote, but I will paraphrase--that \nmany small businesses don't think they will get inspected, so it is not \neconomical for them to take advantage of these consultations. They feel \nno need to. The two are interrelated. When businesses really worry \nabout this and know that in fact there are some enforcement laws we can \nimplement, then they are more likely to go to a consultative service.\n  Again, I really do not understand. It is a little bit similar to the \namendment we just had where, on the one hand, you say you have more \nmoney for the community health centers and you will take it out of \nNLRB, which has everything to do with workers' rights to organize, and \nmaking sure equally that people who are fired are going to be able to \nhave their day in court and make their appeal, and there isn't going to \nbe a long delay. In that case, justice delayed is justice denied.\n  In this case we have an amendment introduced by my colleague from \nWyoming that basically takes resources away from enforcement. Standards \nand regulations are no more than suggestions. They don't mean anything \nfor working people in this country if there is not sufficient \nenforcement to back them up. Let me repeat that we can have standards \nand regulations but it is empty, it doesn't mean anything to someone if \nthey can't be backed up through enforcement.\n  Even with the additions to the President's budget request, OSHA's \nFederal enforcement funding will fall $3 million below the level it was \nin 1995. By contrast, during the same period, 1995 to\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\n2000, OSHA's State consultation program has grown from $31.5 million to \n$40.9 million, an increase of 30 percent.\n  So I question the priorities of this amendment. The very area where \nwe have not kept up and have not made adequate investment in inspection \nis the very area from which my colleague from Wyoming takes funds and \nputs them into the consultation program where we have been making the \ninvestment.\n  Of the 12,500 most dangerous workplaces in the Nation, OSHA is able \nto inspect only about 3,000 a year. The other 9,500 will go uninspected \nunless there is a fatality or catastrophic accident. We need more \nenforcement resources, not less. I will repeat, we need more \nenforcement resources, not less.\n  If my colleagues think about the number of people who are killed at \nthe workplace because of an unsafe workplace and the number of people \nwho work with carcinogenic substances which take years off their life \nor the number of workers who go deaf or suffer other disabling injuries \nbecause of an unsafe workplace, I find it almost impossible to believe \nthey are going to take funding away from enforcement.\n\n  I hope I don't get myself in trouble for saying this, but this is in \nsome ways a class issue. This is in many ways a class issue. Actually, \nwe are not talking about us and we are probably not talking about most \nof our sons and daughters. But we are talking about blue-collar \nworkers. We are talking about working-class people. The whole idea of \nOSHA and the whole idea of NIOSH was to make sure that we followed \nthrough on our commitment for a safe workplace. The way to make sure \nthat happens is to make sure we have the enforcement resources--not to \nhave less.\n  Let me point out that in 1995 and 1996, when OSHA's inspection \nactivity declined dramatically, so did requests for consultation \nservices. Business for private safety consultants also fell and even \nvendor sales of safety and health equipment declined as well.\n  I go back again to our hearing that we had March 4. My colleague from \nWyoming conducted that hearing where the majority of witnesses said one \nof the reasons small businesses don't take advantage of the free \nconsultation services is because small businesses don't think they will \nget inspected.\n  As I hear my colleague speak about inspection, I hear him making the \nargument that it takes too long. In fact, I agree with him. But if my \ncolleagues are worried about the delay in inspection, the last thing \nthey want to do is cut the budget that deals with inspection. That is \nillogical. If colleagues are worried about the delay, the last thing in \nthe world they want to do is reduce enforcement resources.\n  I point out to my colleagues this is an important vote. Think about \nthe people you represent in your States: 55 percent of all OSHA \ninspections are in construction, which continues to be extremely \ndangerous. In 1998, 1,171 construction workers died on the job. \nConstruction workers are about 6 percent of the workforce, but they \ncomprise about 19 percent of workplace deaths. If we think that is too \nmany workers dying on the job, and if the evidence is overwhelming \nthere are still too many unsafe workplaces, and if Members are \nconcerned about workplace safety, then I do not believe Senators can \nvote to reduce the resources for OSHA inspectors.\n  Again, I say to both of my colleagues, including my colleague from \nArkansas, I don't know why we make this a zero sum game. Why don't we \nsay, yes, let's do even better for consultation.\n  The second-degree amendment I will introduce will say we don't cut \nenforcement. I don't think we should. I think that just means we will \nhave fewer inspectors, less inspections, and more workers will die. I \ndon't think we should do that. What we could do is maintain the funding \nfor the inspection, which is so key to worker safety, and add the \nadditional money, forward fund the additional money or advance fund the \nadditional money, it is only $9 million, for consultation. Why continue \nto play off one good idea versus another or help some business or some \nworkers over here but end up hurting other workers over here?\n  I don't understand the premise of this amendment. I think it is \nflawed. I think enforcement is the backbone of worker safety, and this \namendment which takes resources away from enforcement also means there \nwill be less safety for workers. That is why I am opposed to this \namendment. That is why I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry as to how many more speakers the \nSenator anticipates on his side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think Senator Kennedy may want to \nspeak. I am not sure that we will have anyone else. I don't know that \nwe will need to spend a lot more time. I think the Senator will be back \nsoon. I have not heard from other Senators.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would it be in order to entertain a \nrequest for a consent agreement? Talk to your colleagues to see if we \ncould fix a time. We have a great number of other amendments pending. \nWe want to move to the Graham of Florida amendment, Senator Dodd has an \namendment, and we have amendments here. If we could make an agreement \nto 30 more minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to do so; I will let the Senator know.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Enzi amendment. \nI compliment the Senator. He has been a tireless worker and leader in \nthe area of OSHA reform. I think on both sides of the aisle no one \nwould dispute Senator Enzi has been the foremost student of OSHA, the \nway it works, where its failings are. The legislation he has brought \nforward and his efforts to reform this agency deserve the praise and \nthe appreciation of the American people. I appreciate very much his \nwillingness to offer this amendment.\n  I think a few things need to be clarified. It does not cut \nenforcement. The Senator from Minnesota said this cuts enforcement. No, \nit doesn't. It takes the $33 million increased spending and says half \nof that will be used for compliance. Over last year's level, there is \nno cut in what will be available for enforcement. In fact, half of the \n$33 million increase will continue to go into the enforcement area.\n  The Senator from Minnesota said the amendment was flawed. It is not \nthis amendment that is flawed. It is the ``find and fine'' approach of \nOSHA that is flawed and that needs reform. This is a small step, but a \nsignificant step that the Senator from Wyoming has offered that will \nhelp move away from the ``find and fine'' approach, the enforcement-\nonly approach, the punitive approach to a program and a system that \nwill assist small businesspeople who want to do the right thing, who \nwant to have a healthy workplace, who want a safe workplace and want to \ncomply with OSHA but they need help. Anybody who has ever worked with \nOSHA, anyone who has ever looked at the OSHA regulation book, knows a \nsmall businessman, if he is to comply, needs assistance. So I think \nthis is a very well thought out and a very important amendment.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota, as so many others do, likes to put \neverything in terms of class warfare. This is not a class issue. It is \nnot in any way an inference that blue-collar workers should not have \nprotection and should not be assured they are going to work in a \nhealthy workplace and a safe workplace. It is a difference on what is \nthe best approach, on how we best achieve that common goal. It is not a \nclass issue. It is not a class warfare issue, as some would like to \nmake it.\n  OSHA itself has estimated that 95 percent of small businesses--95 \npercent of the workplace, employers--want to comply, that they are good \nactors who want to be in compliance. It is among those 95 percent so \nmany accidents are happening and that is where this kind of amendment \nincreasing employer assistance is going to help. It is going to assist \nthat small businessperson who wants to comply with OSHA but needs help \nin doing so. It is going to assure them that they are going to have the \nresources to be good actors and to have a safe workplace.\n  I do not know what the experience of the Senator from Minnesota has \nbeen, or that of others who may be voting on this, but I do know my \nexperience. I was a small businessperson. I know it is \nunconstitutional, but I almost wish it were a requirement, before \nserving in the Senate, to be an employer; that you had to deal with \nFederal agencies\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nand you had to deal with this Tax Code and you had to deal with the \nregulatory agencies like OSHA. My brother and I owned a radio station \nand we did just that.\n  From my experience, let me tell you, we wanted to comply with every \nOSHA rule, all 1,275 pages. We wanted to comply. But we were a small \nbusiness that had just a handful of employees, less than a dozen. \nFrankly, we did not understand. We understood radio, but we did not \nunderstand every minute, highly technical safety regulation that OSHA \nput forward. That is where this amendment would help. It doesn't cut \nOSHA's funding; it just says let's put half of the increase into \ncompliance, into consultation service for small businesspeople.\n  It is hard for me to imagine why anybody would oppose this. The \nSenator from Wyoming has hit upon something. It is very logical. It is \nvery much common sense. The American people out there understand this \namendment. Those who may have the opportunity to see this debate and \nhear this debate, they will understand the difficulty that good actors, \npeople who want to be in compliance, law-abiding businesspeople have in \ncomplying with an OSHA regulation book over 1,200 pages long.\n  We are not saying decrease enforcement. But I will tell you this: \nOSHA could send an army, we could quadruple the enforcement budget, let \nOSHA send an army of inspectors out across this country; they still \ncould not get into every workplace in the country. That is simply the \nwrong approach if we want a safe workplace. The right approach is to \nput more into consultation services, work with the 95 percent of \nbusinesspeople who want to have a good workplace, assist them in \nensuring they have it, and we will do more to save lives than under the \n``find and fine,'' punitive, enforcement-oriented approach that OSHA \nhas had in the past.\n  Again, I commend Senator Enzi for remarkable leadership, leadership \nthat has been praised on both sides of the aisle in his tireless \nefforts to improve the way OSHA operates. I commend him and am glad to \nbe supportive of his amendment today.\n\n  I have a chart I will just point to briefly. It shows 61.5 percent of \nthe current budget is going to enforcement; less than a quarter of \ntheir budget going to compliance assistance. Senator Enzi has taken the \napproach that at least half of what we are putting into OSHA's budget \nought to go into assistance, not taking a hammer and beating up on the \nsmall businessperson who is trying to comply with OSHA's thousands of \nregulations.\n  Once again, I am glad to be a supporter of this amendment and ask my \ncolleagues to support Senator Enzi and his continued efforts to make \nOSHA a better agency and to make the workplace in this country a safer \nplace for American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, first of all, acknowledge the strong \ninterest that my friend and colleague from Wyoming has in the whole \narea of OSHA. He spends a great deal of time on this issue. Although I \nhave areas of difference with him, he is someone who has involved \nhimself in this issue to a very significant extent. We certainly take \nnote of his longstanding and continuing and ongoing interest in trying \nto make the workplace safer.\n  Having said that, I do hope his position will not be sustained on \nthis particular issue this afternoon. I hope eventually we will have \nthe opportunity to support the Wellstone amendment that, instead of \ntaking the money from inspections for consultation, would just add \nadditional funding for consultations rather than denying the money for \ninspections.\n  The way that would ordinarily be done is Senator Enzi would have \noffered his amendment to transfer, and then Senator Wellstone would \nhave come on and offered a second-degree amendment and said: All right, \nlet us have the increased money from forward funding for the $9 million \nfor compliance. We would have gone to the Senate, I think, with the \nsupport of the Senator from Wyoming. I think we would have resolved \nthis issue and we would be further down the road in moving ahead on the \nwhole question of the appropriation.\n  But we will go through, I guess, the vote on Coverdell, which is \nbasically a repeat of the Enzi amendment. The Senator is entitled to \noffer that, to effectively cut off, at least at this time, the \nWellstone amendment. Then we will have to come back in on top of that, \nafter the Senate makes a resolution of that particular question.\n  Just to put the facts straight, there are very few of us--I do not \nknow any of us--who do not believe there should be an expansion of \nboth: Consultation, and I think there has to be a very extensive \ninspection program. They go hand in hand. Why do we say they go hand in \nhand? We have some very direct and powerful evidence. In 1995 and 1996, \nwhen the Congress cut dramatically the funding for inspections, then \nthe number of consultations went down correspondingly, dramatically. \nThe reason for that has been very clear from the record. If there is a \nreduction in inspections, and there is a sense the companies are not \ngoing to be inspected, there is less of an incentive to move ahead with \nconsultations.\n  So these have gone hand in hand. What the Senator from Wyoming wants \nto do is put a greater emphasis on consultation and reduce the number \nof inspections. I do not think that is wise, given the fact that we \nhave seen the dramatic increase in the workforce. We have 15 million \nmore people working now than we had 6 years ago, as we saw, as Mr. \nRalph Nader, interestingly, reminded us last Labor Day, indicating that \nand indicting the OSHA department for not having enough inspections in \norder to provide the kinds of protections for an expanded workforce.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, he wants to reduce \nthem further. It will be about a 10-percent reduction in the number of \ninspections. We have about 88,000 or so inspections. This would amount \nto about a 10-percent reduction in the total number of inspections, \nwhich is not insignificant.\n  It is particularly important in the areas of the construction trades, \nas my friend and colleague has pointed out, the Senator from Minnesota. \nEven though those in construction are only about 6 percent of the \nworkforce, we find close to 20 percent of all the deaths in the \nworkplace are in construction. This is a dangerous, dangerous industry \nto work in. We are fortunate in this country to have dramatic \nescalations of construction projects. We have them in our own city of \nBoston, and we have them all over this country, dramatic escalation in \nconstruction. We find these attendant accidents which happen, and also \ndeaths which occur as well.\n  So if we look at the history, we find very important and powerful \nevidence.\n  We can represent what we think will happen. We can say what we would \nlike to happen. But the fact is, in this particular situation, we know \non the basis of evidence what does happen, and that is, reduction in \ninspections is reduction in consultations.\n  With all respect to my friend from Wyoming, if we want to see an \nexpansion of the consultations, we ought to increase the number of \ninspections instead of reducing them. But that is not where we are this \nafternoon.\n  Finally, the administration and the Congress have seen a significant \nincrease in consultations over the last 4 years, about a 30-percent \nincrease. There has been important work done in the area of \nconsultation. We certainly support--I do--that program and think it is \nvery important.\n  It is interesting that the association which represents those who are \ninvolved in consultation is resisting this amendment, and the reason \nthey are resisting this amendment is for the reason I have identified. \nThey understand with the reduction of inspections, there is going to be \na reduction in consultations.\n  One would think they would say: Wow, amen, let's get behind them; \nthey are going to put more money into consultations and, therefore, we \nare going to get more of it.\n  But no, they do not. That ought to say something to us because they \nunderstand as well.\n  As I mentioned, I have great respect and affection for my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, particularly in this area of OSHA, but in this \nvery important area where we are talking about people's lives, what is \nthe real purpose of this? The real purpose is the protection of \nworkers' lives.\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\n  We have seen since the time OSHA has gone into effect a dramatic \nreduction--50-, 60-percent reduction--in the loss of lives on the \nconstruction site. OSHA is faced with additional problems of \noccupational health. It is faced with additional issues with these new \ntoxic substances and a wide range of challenges for the new workplace \nthey are trying to deal with and that also pose a significant and \nserious threat to workers. What we are basically saying with OSHA is \nthat we in the United States want to make sure we are going to have as \nsafe a workplace as possible for working men and women.\n  We believe with the increased funding provided for OSHA in this \nappropriations, as compared to the undermining of OSHA, as we saw in \nthe House Appropriations Committee, we will meet that responsibility \nand OSHA can meet it.\n  Let us not put at risk what is tried and tested policy conclusions: \nWe have strong inspections and strong consultations. That works. That \nis the position Senator Wellstone and I and others support.\n  I hope as a result of these votes that is where we will come out; \nthat we will come out so there will be a modest increase which the good \nSenator has mentioned in terms of consultation; that we will come out \nand add those additional funds for the outyears but not take away from \nthe extremely important inspection.\n  Finally, we can pass various pieces of legislation, but unless we are \ngoing to have enforcement, a right without a remedy does not go very \nfar. That is true in just about every area of public policy. We learn \nthat every single day. What we need to have is accountability. We hear \na great deal of talk about accountability. This is accountability. The \nquestion of inspections is a part of accountability to protect workers. \nIf we cut off and reduce inspections, we are denying the important \naccountability that is necessary to protect workers in this country, \nand that is an important and serious mistake.\n\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of my \ncolleagues. I appreciate the comments they have made. We all have a \ntremendous interest in seeing there are safer workplaces, and there is \na long way to go on that yet. But what we are having a little trouble \nagreeing on is the mechanism for getting there. There are some \nphilosophical differences on how to go about safety.\n  I do not think they are across that big of a chasm, but if we had the \nopportunity to spend some time to sit down and talk about them, we \ncould come up with some things that will help the safety of the \nworkplace in this country. We can throw out all the misconceptions and \nprevious solutions and work from there. That is not what is happening. \nWhat is happening is this appropriations bill.\n  We mentioned a record of safety and how it has been increasing. I \nhave been very curious about that record of safety because a lot of \npeople said when OSHA went into effect, there was a huge jump in safety \nin this country and it has been continuing; since OSHA went into \neffect, there has been a decrease in the number of deaths and accidents \nin this country.\n  I went back another 20 years beyond that and looked at the number of \naccidents in this country. Business had been bringing that down before \nOSHA went into effect. They were doing that because they knew if they \nwere going to have a good business, they had to take care of the \nemployee. There has been an ever-increasing awareness of that, and \nthere has been an ever-increasing improvement in that.\n  My colleagues from across the aisle say consultation and enforcement \nhave to go hand in hand. Yes, they do have to go hand in hand, and I am \nnot suggesting any other thing. I am saying that half the money we are \nputting in increases ought to go for the other hand of the hand in \nhand. We ought to do 50 percent for each. We are already doing a whole \nlot more enforcement than we are consultation. I am not trying to even \nthat up. I am trying to take part of what we are doing this year and \nputting it in there.\n\n  They say: Whoa, rather than do that, take another $33 million and \nstick it in there and that will show a real commitment to safety. Let \nme tell you what that would show. It would show my stupidity on \nmanagement. We are doing a drastic increase on that budget. We are \nexpecting them to take a huge increase of funds, find the people, train \nthe people and put them out there doing enforcement.\n  I have faith in the people who are in that Department, and I believe \nthey can do that, but they have a better chance not only of being able \nto train the people but also to get effective use out of them by \nputting half the money into consultation so half the people being \ntrained are going to go out there and answer questions.\n  They are going to be the good guys. They are going to be the ones who \nsay: I know you do not understand these 1,200 pages, but just let me go \nthrough your business, show you what is wrong and, by golly, you fix \nit. If you fix it, you have no problem. If you don't fix it, my buddy \nover here is going to be on your tail; this other 50 percent of the \nmoney is going to be on you.\n  There is a limit to how much increase you can do in a given year.\n  There is room for training improvement. We have looked at what kind \nof training there is. I have also looked at the number of inspections \nthat are being done by the people who are there. I am not sure there is \nenough management over the inspections that are being done.\n  My colleague from Minnesota mentioned that out of those very bad \nemployers, they were only able to inspect 3,000. That is terrible. That \nis rotten. That is not the way it is supposed to happen.\n  We have 2,500 Federal inspectors. They are not doing the State-plan \nStates. They are only doing the Federal inspections. If they did one \nmore inspection a year, they would double the number of inspections on \nthose bad businesses. But we are not going to have that if we just \nthrow a whole bunch more people into the mix. They are not going to be \ncapable of going out and looking at the bad employers and finding those \nbad problems.\n  It takes more than a few months to train the people, and you cannot \ndo it if you have thousands coming into the workforce at one time.\n  There have to be some limits. This is a reasonable approach to being \nsure there is an increase in enforcement, and it is accompanied by an \nincrease in consultation.\n  If you look at the numbers of people who are waiting out there in \nnon-State plan States--the State-plan States are doing pretty good with \nthis, the ones that have said they will do the work themselves. They \nare doing pretty good. The non-State-plan States are having a terrible \ntime getting to the backlog on consultations. So we need some \nconsultation money.\n  I have a bill that may be the wrong approach to doing safety. I put a \nlot of hours into it. I sat down with everybody individually, and I \ntalked to them about it. It is the SAFE Act, and it calls for hiring \nsome private consultation. I have run into opposition on that. What I \nhave heard in the way of opposition is: You cannot let the businesses \nhire people to do inspections. Even though those inspections would \nresult in things being found, things stopped, things improved, you \ncannot do it that way. It has to be done federally or that there be \nsome kind of a mechanism for the Federal Government to have the \ninspectors involved.\n  So I have listened. I have said OK. Under this program, the Federal \nGovernment hires the inspectors, the Federal Government hires the \nconsultation people; it is the Federal Government that is coming in to \ndo these consultations--totally independent, totally under the \ndirection of OSHA.\n  I have been trying to listen to what is being said on all of this. \nThis is one of the solutions that can be provided. I hope you will \nsupport increasing the funds to OSHA. I know that is a tough stand for \na lot of people over here, but I want you to do that. I want you to \nincrease the amount of money that is going to the enforcement of OSHA, \nbut at the same time what I want you to do is take half of that money \nand assure that it is going to consultation.\n  As I said before, there is no way we can assure that it is going to \nconsultation. Once it gets in that department budget, even though it is \nunder a line item, there is not much of a way, even with oversight, to \nsee if those people\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\nwho are supposed to be under consultation are doing any enforcement, \nand vice versa.\n  So it is a statement that we are making that, yes, consultation ought \nto go hand in hand with enforcement. It is a statement. How they use \nthat budget, we will never know. Maybe we will know through increased \nenforcement. Maybe we will know with a decrease in the amount of \nwaiting time people have to have for these inspections.\n  But we have a chance to do the right thing and to do it in a \nresponsible manner that can be handled, giving the increases and making \nsure that to the small businessman out there who wants to understand \nthose 1,275 pages as they apply to his business--and it isn't optional \nfor him to do that; it is mandatory he do that--we are saying we are \ngoing to reach out and give you a little bit of a hand. We are going to \ncome into your business. We are going to show you what is wrong, and \nyou have to clean it up because we are hiring more enforcement people \nwho are going to be here to check on you if you do not.\n  That is all we are asking. I think it is a reasonable amendment. I \nwas hoping that it would be accepted. I am still hoping it will be \naccepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nis going to try to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Let me, in 2 minutes, summarize. I appreciate the amendment by my \ncolleagues in Wyoming and Georgia. I think this is an unfortunate \ntradeoff. I think it is a profound mistake. I think enforcement is the \nbackbone of worker safety.\n  The second-degree amendment we will offer later on would essentially \nsay: We can do better for consultative services, and we can advance \nsome funds there, but we are certainly not going to take it out of \nenforcement.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts has spoken about this at great \nlength; I have as well. I will not recite the statistics again as to \nthe number of unsafe workplaces and the need for strong inspection. I \nsimply say that the promise of OSHA--not yet realized--is we are going \nto make a commitment to working people, and we are going to make a \ncommitment that people have a safe workplace.\n  We are not doing as well as we should. We should do much better. But \nI think it would be a serious mistake for Democrats or Republicans to \nvote to reduce enforcement. That is a huge mistake. For all who care \nabout worker safety, do not vote to reduce enforcement, to reduce \ninspection. The laws and the rules and regulations do not mean a thing \nunless we have the enforcement. That is why I think this amendment is \nflawed. That is why I hope it will be voted down.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Just a few comments about the merits of the pending \namendment; then I will move on to a unanimous-consent request.\n  I believe that in the bill, as it is currently drafted, there is an \nappropriate balance between consultation and enforcement. I agree with \nthe Senator from Wyoming that this consultation is very important, and \nthere are many places where consultation will work. I think there are \nsome areas where enforcement is necessary.\n  I saw in my line of work as district attorney of Philadelphia, under \nsomewhat different circumstances, what enforcement does and what \ndeterrence does and what the prospects of penalties may do.\n  We have crafted this bill as carefully as we can. I think it has \nabout the right mix, although I welcome the suggestions from the \nSenator from Wyoming and the spirited debate which we have had.\n  As I take a look at the figures, in the period from 1995 to 1999, the \nenforcement funding falls $3 million this year below the 1995 level; \n$145 million to $142 million.\n  By contrast, in the same period, fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year \n2000, OSHA's consultation program has grown from $31.5 million to \nalmost $41 million; an increase of about 30 percent.\n  Even at the level that we have here, there are 7 million workplaces \nin the United States but only about 2,300 OSHA inspectors. Of the \n12,500 most dangerous workplaces in the Nation, OSHA is able to inspect \nonly about 3,000 a year; so 9,500 will not be inspected. The \nenforcement shows that there is an average decline of some 22 percent \nin the 3 years following inspections.\n  So when I take a look at the entire picture, I think we have it about \nright in the current bill.\n  Therefore, I move to table the second-degree amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now going to propound a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on the pending matter.\n  I have been asked to pause for a minute so that other Senators may \nconsider the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  What we propose to do by way of schedule today to move ahead is to \nset the vote aside, then move to an amendment by Senator Graham of \nFlorida. I hope we can work out a time agreement on that which is not \nyet agreed to. Then we would go to an amendment by Senator Dodd for 30 \nminutes, equally divided, and then come back, perhaps, to Senator \nGregg, and then move to an amendment which may be contentious on \nergonomics, to be offered by Senators Bond and Nickles. We would plan \nto have the votes before the ergonomics amendment, which may take some \nconsiderable time and move into the evening.\n  We are still working as fast as we can through a long list of \namendments to try to see when we can bring this bill to a conclusion at \nthe earliest moment.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Minnesota if he is prepared for me \nto propound the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, we are \nlooking at it right now. If we can have another moment, we will be \nready to respond.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent that a vote occur on or in \nrelation to the pending second-degree amendment after 15 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided in the usual form, and if a motion to \ntable is made and defeated, then the Senate immediately proceed to a \nvote on the pending second-degree amendment.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the second-\ndegree amendment, only if agreed to, Senator Wellstone be recognized to \noffer a second-degree amendment under the same terms as outlined above.\n  Finally, I ask consent that following the disposition of the first \nsecond-degree amendment, if tabled, the first-degree amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  I further ask consent that if the second second-degree amendment is \noffered, following its disposition, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nfirst-degree amendment, as amended, if amended, without any intervening \naction, motion, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that is miraculous. I hardly understand much of \nwhat I just read, although it was carefully drafted and I am sure will \nprovide a roadmap to the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. I inquire of Senator Graham if \nhe will be prepared to enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of moving \nforward. This amendment is going to raise some very fundamental issues \nnot only for a major social program but also for the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and the States and the relationship \nbetween the appropriations process and the committees that have \njurisdiction for authorization and the administration of the mandatory \nspending program.\n  I do not believe at this time I can indicate how long it will take to \nfully articulate those issues to have the kind of debate which this \namendment clearly justifies.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Might I suggest an hour for the Senator's position and a\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\nhalf hour for this side or perhaps even an hour and a half for the \nSenator's position and a half hour for this side. I am anxious to try \nto get some parameters so we know what to do with the remainder of the \namendments and voting.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest, in deference to the effective use of time, it \nwould be preferable if we got started with this amendment and then saw, \nas we were into it, what might be a reasonable time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent to yield back the time on \nthe Enzi amendment and ask that the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1821\n\n     (Purpose: To restore funding for social services block grants)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1821 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1821.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n\n                      social services block grant\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \n     the amount appropriated under this title for making grants \n     pursuant to section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1397a) shall be increased to $2,380,000,000: Provided, \n     That (1) $1,330,000,000 of which shall become available on \n     October 1, 2000, and (2) notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this title, the amount specified for allocation under \n     section 2003(c) of such Act for fiscal year 2000 shall be \n     $2,380,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, in which I am joined by \nSenators Wellstone, Rockefeller, and Dodd, will have the effect of \nreversing a decision made by the appropriations subcommittee to cut by \nmore than 50 percent the funding in title 20 of the Social Security Act \nfor social services block grants.\n  This amendment will restore the program to the level that was \nauthorized by the Finance Committee, which is $2.38 billion. This \nprogram, title 20 of Social Security, allocates funds to the States in \nblock grant form, allowing them to provide services to vulnerable, low-\nincome children and elderly, disabled people. The purpose of this \nprogram is to assist in maintaining the well-being of those Americans \nwho, but for these types of services, might become direct, individual \nrecipients of Social Security funds, whether they fell into such \nbecause of a disability, because of their circumstances in terms of \nlosing the support of an adult, or because of the aging process.\n  I can tell the Senate, as a former Governor of Florida, the State \nwhich has the highest percentage of persons over 65 in the Nation, and \nnow, as a member of the Finance Committee, which has responsibility for \nthe authorization of this program, I am aware of the positive \ncontribution this program has made to the well-being of millions of \nAmericans and to the fiscal well-being of the Social Security program. \nI am particularly concerned about the draconian cuts that have been \nmade and the fact that they have been made with almost no discussion or \nattention to the very serious policy implications.\n  My Finance Committee colleagues and I, joined by colleagues from the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, have agreed that this program should be \nfunded at the level of $2.38 billion for the fiscal year 2000. In fact, \nthe two committees of responsibility, the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, made a commitment to the States \nthat the social services block grant would be guaranteed at the level \nof $2.38 billion until welfare reform is reauthorized in the year 2002.\n  However, the Senate appropriators, rather than simply appropriating \nthe statutory funding level for the fiscal year 2000 at $2.38 billion, \nhave slashed the social services block grant to $1.05 billion for the \nfiscal year 2000. This harsh, unauthorized reduction would be on top of \na 15-percent reduction made to title 20 in the 1996 welfare law.\n  These enormous reductions will have adverse consequences for \nsubstantial numbers of frail elderly persons, disabled individuals, and \nchildren and their families. In my State of Florida, critical programs \nwill be at serious risk if these cuts are made.\n  For example, these reductions will affect services that protect \nchildren from child abuse and that enable poor elderly and disabled \npersons to remain in their homes rather than being placed prematurely \nin nursing homes or other institutions.\n  Our State was one of the first to start a program called Community \nCare for the elderly, begun over 20 years ago. It had as its objective \nto allow older Americans to live the life they wanted to live, a life \nof maximum independence in their homes, in their communities, not to be \nforced prematurely into an institution. That program was funded both by \nState funds and by the use of some of these social service block grant \nprograms. That program has had not only enormous positive benefits in \nterms of the quality of life of the beneficiaries--and, I might say, \nhas now become a program that has been identified for substantial \nexpansion by our current Governor, Governor Bush--but it also has been \na program that has saved both Medicare and Medicaid substantial funds \nby maintaining the best possible state of health for many frail elderly \nand avoiding the extreme costs that are entailed when an individual has \nto be placed in a nursing home.\n  We heard at a luncheon earlier today from a program that has shown \ngreat promise in terms of providing a successful educational \nenvironment for our youngest students. One of the primary keystones of \nthat success is appropriate early intervention with children before \nthey become public school students, while they are still in the infant \nand toddler ages, if they have physical or other disabilities, to begin \nto deal with them at the earliest stages, to give them an appropriate \nlearning environment in preschool.\n  Again, those are precisely the programs that are funded through title \n20 of the Social Security Act. Those are precisely the programs that \nare going to be eviscerated if we adopt this budget with this over 50-\npercent cut.\n  To add to all of that, I direct the attention of the Senate to page \n212 of the conference report which has been issued on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. In that conference report, there is an explanation \nof why this cut is being recommended. The report states:\n\n       The committee recommends an appropriations of $1.50 billion \n     for the Social Services Block Grant. The recommendation is \n     $1.330 billion below the budget request (read the \n     recommendation of the House Ways and Means Committee and the \n     Senate Finance Committee) and $859 million below the 1999 \n     enacted level. The committee has reduced funding for the \n     block grant because of extremely tight budget constraints.\n\n  I would like for the Presiding Officer and my colleagues to listen to \nthis particular part.\n\n       The committee believes that the States can supplement the \n     block grant account with funds received through the recent \n     settlements with the tobacco companies.\n\n  So the subcommittee's rationale for this particular reduction is that \nthe States can now be directed to use their tobacco settlement money in \norder to fund what previously had been a partnership of Federal-State \nfunds for the frail elderly, for the disabled, and for children and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I fervently object to this outrageous, irresponsible \nand, I would say, nonsensical rationale.\n  As you will recall, this spring we had a fervent debate about the \nquestion of whether the Federal Government should reach in and mandate \nhow all or a portion of the States' tobacco settlements should be \nspent. We fought that out for weeks in the Senate.\n  I thought after a series of rejections of exactly this proposition \nthat the States could now with some comfort step back and say the \nFederal Government has decided, properly so, that we were the entities \nwhich secured these tobacco settlements; that the Federal Government \nwould be saying we have the respect of the States that they have the \ngood judgment to decide what is in the best interests of their citizens \nin the methods of spending these tobacco settlement funds; that the \nStates could breathe easy; that they no longer\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\nwere faced with the threat that the Federal Government would want to \nplay big father and tell them how to spend their money.\n  It was only in March of this year that the Senate overwhelmingly by a \nmargin of approximately 71 to 29 defeated an amendment that would have \nrequired the States to spend part of their tobacco settlement according \nto a Federal list of priorities. In June, the entire Congress voted for \nthe Federal Government to stand back, to keep its hands off the tobacco \nsettlement, which the States had with such effort and commitment \nachieved; that the Federal Government was saying to the State: We \nrespect you, and we put our confidence in your decisions as to how to \nspend this money.\n  Now we have a few months later this language saying that it is one of \nthe most important social programs we in Washington are going to \neffectively, by withdrawing Federal funds, direct how the States are \ngoing to spend their tobacco settlement.\n  It is outrageous.\n  The commitment that we made for hands off was a binding commitment, \njust as our commitment to fund the title XX program that we made to the \nStates to fund it at its current level to the year 2002 in order to \nplay a role in the successful completion of the welfare-to-work law was \nalso a binding commitment, commitments that we are now about to breach.\n\n  Today, many of the same individuals who voted to allow the States to \nuse these funds as they saw most appropriate for their citizens are \nabout to tell the States that they need to reallocate tobacco \nsettlement dollars in order to pick up the Federal social services \nblock grant which we are going to slash by over 50 percent. That is \nblatant hypocrisy.\n  The argument that the tobacco funds should be used to fill a $1.33 \nbillion cut in title XX is quite simply--no pun intended--a smoke-and-\nmirrors tactic that does not address the issue at hand. Senate \nappropriators have no valid argument in defense of their drastic cuts \nin this critical program.\n  Have no doubt that the ultimate loser in this exercise is the child--\nthe child who is currently receiving child care in a title XX funded \ncenter. The loser is that other American who has sought refuge from \nabuse through adult protective services, the disabled woman who \nreceives treatment through a title XX funded center. Perhaps the reason \nour appropriators believe that they can get away with this raid on the \nsocial services block grant is that the American people are unclear \nabout the services that this program provides.\n  So I would like to take this opportunity to enlighten my Senate \ncolleagues and the American people on what are the programs funded \nunder title XX of the Social Security Act.\n  The social services block grant was established in 1975. So it is now \nabout to celebrate its 25th year of an important part of the safety net \nthat helps those persons who might otherwise have to rely on expanded \nSocial Security funds.\n  It provides States with funds to address the social service needs as \nthe States determine to be of the greatest priority. States have broad \nflexibility in determining which services to provide, who should \ndeliver services, and which families and individuals to serve.\n  I know our Presiding Officer had a distinguished career of service in \nhis State before being elected to the Senate. So he has no doubt dealt \nwith some of the programs that are funded under title XX of the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  Adoption, case management, congregate meals, counseling services, \nadult day care, day care for children, education and training services, \nemployment services, foster care services, health-related services, \nhome-based services, home-delivered meals, housing services, \nindependent living services for youth, legal services, child and adult \nprotective services, recreation services, residential treatment, \nspecial services for youth at risk, and the disabled--these are some of \nthe services that are provided under title XX.\n  As you can see, many of the SSBG-funded services focus on children \nand youth.\n  In fiscal year 1996, some 15 percent of the SSBG funds supported \nprograms providing child care for low-income children. An additional 21 \npercent was spent on services to protect children from abuse and \nprovide foster care for children.\n  SSBG funds programs for nearly half a million people with mental \nretardation and other physical and mental disability, including \ntransportation, adult day care, early intervention, crisis \nintervention, respite care, employment, and independent living \nservices. These services help such individuals remain at home and out \nof expensive and often inappropriate institutions. These services also \nhelp people with disabilities to work, to the extent it is possible for \nthem to do so.\n\n  These programs drew the support of the House Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee, the two committees with \nresponsibility for Social Security, to support the level of funding \nwhich is in the amendment currently pending.\n  For those who have suggested this more than 50-percent slash in this \nprogram, what is it they know about this program that the House Ways \nand Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee did not know or \ndid not take into proper account? What we should be doing is not \nslashing this program but, if anything, we should be increasing this \nfunding in order to assist particularly in this important time of \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  It should be noted that the Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \nbill appears to reduce the percentage of a State's Federal TANF block \ngrant, another of the programs that will be critical to the transfer \nfrom welfare to work, will reduce the percentage of a State's Federal \nTANF block grant that can be transferred to the social services block \ngrant from 10 percent to 4.25 percent for fiscal year 2000. Not only \nare the States facing a draconian reduction in the social services \nblock grant but also a limit in the flexibility of those funds. The \n4.25-percent ceiling further limits States' abilities to compensate for \nthe impact of the overall social services block grant funding.\n  One might ask, should the States also use tobacco money to fill the \nhole for this further cut, as well? Should the States perhaps be called \nupon to use tobacco funds to supplement all Federal funds for social \nprograms?\n  It is critical we keep the national commitments to the most \nvulnerable members of our society. That commitment cannot be fulfilled \nby slashing title 20 funds by over 50 percent. The President has said \nhe would veto this bill in its current form. He cited the deep cuts in \ntitle 20 as a key reason for doing so. I applaud the President if it \nwere to be necessary--and I hope desperately it will not be necessary--\nto exercise that veto because of these unwise cuts in title 20 and the \nattempt to direct the manner in which the States will spend their \ntobacco settlement funds.\n  There has been a cascade of opposition to this recommendation. The \nNational Governors' Association, the National Council of State \nLegislatures, and the National Association of Counties have spoken out \nagainst this cut. They are joined by over 600 Federal, State, and local \ngroups that understand the importance of these title 20 programs.\n  I ask immediately after my remarks a series of letters from groups \nacross America be printed in the Record expressing their objection to \nthis proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the social services block grant cut of the \nmagnitude reflected in this bill would substantially reduce a State's \nability to provide services to vulnerable children, elderly, and \ndisabled people. Because of the dimensions of such a cut, as well as \nthe fact that most 1999 State legislative sessions have already \nadjourned, most States would not be able to offset this loss with \nadditional State funds, tobacco or otherwise. That is the real point of \nthis debate. This debate is not about tobacco money nor is it about \nwhat States do with their dollars. This debate is about the cutting of \na program that was designed to help the most vulnerable Americans to \nlive better lives and the devastating impact such a cut will have on \ntheir lives and our communities.\n  As I come to a close, a word of caution: The raiding of title 20 \nprograms\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\ncould serve as an example of what will happen when a program is block \ngranted. In the eleventh hour of last year's budget debate, a budget \nbind had developed and the means of escaping from that bind was to use \ntitle XX funds, if you will believe it, to fund road and highway \nspending. Today we are again sacrificing the same social services block \ngrant on the altar of budgetary expediency.\n  This year it is not highway funds but let's tell the States how to \nspend their tobacco settlement. These experiences should serve as a big \nred flag as we structure our social services funding. Thus far, we seem \nwilling to use Meals on Wheels' funds to continue the illusion we are \nnot breaking the budget caps. Will we ever fund the census from moneys \nfrom our children's educational future? If the answer to this question \nis yes, can similar cuts to Social Security and Medicare and other \nsocial programs critical to the well-being of millions of Americans be \nfar behind?\n  The implications of this action this afternoon are ominous. They are \nodious. We have the opportunity to avoid them.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Intergovernmental Relations,\n\n                                Milwaukee, WI, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of \n     Milwaukee County to express our strong support for your \n     amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill to restore \n     funding to the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX). \n     Funding the Title XX program at its authorized level of $2.38 \n     billion is critically important to Milwaukee County.\n       In addition, Milwaukee County urges you to retain current \n     law provisions that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent \n     of their TANF block grants into Title XX.\n       As you know, the SSBG program has been cut three times in \n     the past three years, totaling a half a billion dollars in \n     funding. With current funding down to $1.9 billion for FY \n     1999, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in funding of over \n     $7.6 million for this year, with the state's counties bearing \n     the brunt of these significant cuts.\n       In Wisconsin, it is the state's counties that provide \n     critical social services to vulnerable populations such as \n     supportive home care and community living and support \n     services for elderly and disabled adults and children. \n     Milwaukee County also utilizes SSBG dollars to provide a wide \n     range of other services, including drug and alcohol abuse \n     treatment, temporary shelter service for homeless families, \n     and outpatient treatment for individuals with mental health \n     issues.\n       In addition, Wisconsin is currently transferring the full \n     10 percent of its TANF block grant, nearly $32 million, to \n     fund Title XX services. If the current 10 percent \n     transferability level is reduced to the proposed 4.25 \n     percent, Wisconsin would lose the ability to transfer over \n     $18 million in TANF funds.\n       Again, Milwaukee County strongly supports your efforts to \n     restore full funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for \n     your active support of Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Joe Krahn,\n\n                                                  Milwaukee County\n     Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Wisconsin Counties Association,\n\n                                   Monona, WI, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     Wisconsin Counties Association (WCA) to express our strong \n     support for your amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations \n     bill to restore funding to the Social Services Block Grant \n     (Title XX). Funding the Title XX program at its authorized \n     level of $2.38 billion is critically important to Wisconsin's \n     counties.\n       In addition, WCA urges you to retain current law provisions \n     that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent of their TANF \n     block grants into Title XX.\n       As you know, the SSBG program has been cut three times in \n     the past three years, totaling a half a billion dollars in \n     funding. With current funding down to $1.9 billion for FY \n     1999, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in funding of over \n     $7.6 million for this year, with the state's counties bearing \n     the brunt of these significant cuts.\n       In Wisconsin, it is the state's counties that provide \n     critical social services to vulnerable populations such as \n     supportive home care and community living and support \n     services for elderly and disabled adults and children. \n     Wisconsin's counties also utilize SSBG dollars to provide a \n     wide range of other services, including drug and alcohol \n     abuse treatment, temporary shelter service for homeless \n     families, and child abuse prevention and intervention \n     services.\n       In addition, Wisconsin is currently transferring the full \n     10 percent of its TANF block grant, nearly $32 million, to \n     fund Title XX services. If the current 10 percent \n     transferability level is reduced to the proposed 4.25 \n     percent, Wisconsin would lose the ability to transfer over \n     $18 million in TANF funds.\n       Again, WCA strongly supports your efforts to restore full \n     funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for your active \n     support of Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Krahn,\n     WCA Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: The Board of Directors of Generations \n     United urge you to fund Title XX, the Social Services Block \n     Grant (SSBG) at its present entitlement level of $2.38 \n     billion included in the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Act of 1996.\n       We are pleased that the Clinton Administration has \n     requested restoration of this program to the fully authorized \n     level for the next fiscal year. We believe that this proposed \n     funding level is a formal recognition by the administration \n     of the importance of this block grant and we hope you will \n     endorse this recommendation. We do however continue to have \n     concerns about reducing the states ability to transfer funds \n     from TANF into Title XX to no more than 4.25 percent. We \n     would like to ensure that state flexibility remains.\n       SSBG is an important source of intergenerational support \n     providing flexible federal dollars that helps states respond \n     to their most pressing human service needs. SSBG has a proven \n     record of addressing dependent care needs across the \n     generations. Essential programs supported by SSBG include:\n\n\n                              for children\n\n       Services that support the success of the Adoption and Safe \n     Families Act. For example, in 1997, States reported using 2.2 \n     percent of SSBG funds for adoption foster care and child \n     protection services.\n       SSBG is also an important source of support for Child Care.\n\n\n                              older adults\n\n       SSBG are essential for keeping older adults independent and \n     out of institutions.\n       In 1997, an estimated 318 million was used for adult day \n     care and home-based services.\n       Forty-five states reported using the funds to provide home-\n     based services to the elderly, 38 for elderly case management \n     and 46 for child protection.\n       Generations United is the only national organization that \n     promotes intergenerational policies, programs, and \n     strategies. We represent more than 100 national organizations \n     and millions of individuals who support reciprocity between \n     the generations and the social compact that calls for using \n     the strengths of one generation to meet the needs of the \n     other. We believe a health society should not have to choose \n     between its most vulnerable members--children, youth and the \n     elderly--but instead should support the basic needs of each \n     generation.\n       We urge you to fund Title XX, the Social Service Block \n     Grant at its fully authorized level of 2.38 billion.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Board of Generations United.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Network for Youth,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The National Network for Youth is a 24 year-\n     old non-profit membership-based organization committed to \n     advancing its mission to ensure that young people can be safe \n     and grow up to lead healthy and productive lives. \n     Representing hundreds of non-profit, community-based youth-\n     serving organizations, youth workers and young people from \n     around the nation, the National Network for Youth urges \n     Congress to support the amendment offered by Senators Graham, \n     Wellstone, and Rockfeller to restore funding for the Social \n     Services Block Grant so states can continue to provide \n     children and youth in high-risk situations and their families \n     the services they need.\n       Established under Title XX of the Social Security Act, the \n     Social Services Block Grant provides funding critical to \n     states' ability to offer services to vulnerable children, \n     youth and families. In 1997, 5% of the funding available was \n     designated for vulnerable youth. Over 200,000 youth received \n     SSBG services including temporary housing, residential \n     treatment, counseling, therapy, support and training to live \n     independently, vocational training, and case management. \n     Without the support of state and local services, vulnerable \n     youth have a high risk of homelessness, teen pregnancy, \n     poverty, and entering the criminal justice system.\n       The homeless youth population is estimated to be \n     approximately 300,000 young people each year. Physical and \n     sexual abuse and neglect are among the key causal factors for \n     runaway behavior. States and local governments have the \n     primary responsibility for protecting children from abuse and \n     neglect, and preventing youth at high risk from entering the \n     criminal justice system. In Fiscal Year 1997 more than 2.3 \n     million children were protected from abuse and neglect \n     through services funded by the Social Security Block Grant, \n     supplementing other federal programs offering aid to state \n     and local programs protecting children and youth.\n       Funding for the Social Security Block Grant was reduced \n     from $2.8 billion in 1995 to $2.38 billion in 1996. The \n     Social Security Block Grant has since faced repeated cuts and \n     is currently funded at $1.9 billion. Additional funding cuts \n     to the Social Services\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\n     Block Grant could weaken those services critical to the aid \n     of vulnerable youth and other at-risk populations. The \n     National Network for Youth urges Congress to support the \n     amendment offered by Sens. Graham, Wellstone, and Rockefeller \n     to restore funding for the Social Security Block Grant in \n     FY2000.\n           Sincerely,\n     Della M. Hughes,\n       Executive Director.\n     Miriam A. Rollin,\n       Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  California State\n\n\n                                      Association of Counties,\n\n                               Sacramento, CA, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     California State Association of Counties (CSAC) to express \n     our strong support for your amendment to the Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations bill to restore funding to the Social Services \n     Block Grant (Title XX). Funding the Title XX program at its \n     authorized level of $2.38 billion is critically important to \n     California's counties.\n       In addition, CSAC urges you to retain current law \n     provisions that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent of \n     their TANF block grants into Title XX.\n       The SSBG is a major source of human service funding for \n     California, and repeated federal cuts will impair services \n     for vulnerable populations. Our state is one of the largest \n     recipients of SSBG funds, and due to last year's $471 million \n     reduction in the block grant, California lost over $56 \n     million in funding. Two of the major services California \n     funds with SSBG are In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) at \n     $116.2 million, and Development Disability Services for kids \n     in CWS at $111 million.\n       The SSBG is a cost-effective program that has been slashed \n     by close to one billion dollars over the past five years. The \n     SSBG funds services that allow people to remain in their \n     homes, a much more desirable solution than the costly \n     alternative of institutionalization. According to HHS data, \n     in FY 1997 the SSBG funded home-based services that allowed \n     over 60,000 elderly Californians to remain in the community. \n     Overall, the SSBG funded services for 1,665,349 Californians, \n     including 191,000 disabled and 87,195 elderly that same year. \n     In addition, in 1998, California transferred $183 million \n     from TANF to the SSBG to fund child care services.\n       Again, CSAC strong supports your efforts to restore full \n     funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for your active \n     support to Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Krahn,\n     CSAC Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Humane Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am contacting you to commend your \n     amendment to fund Title XX, the Social Service Block Grant at \n     its present entitlement level of $2.38 billion for the FY \n     2000 budget. Title XX is one of the few programs available to \n     support lower-income working families. This block grant has \n     also been a significant funding source for programs that \n     protect abused and neglected children.\n       Founded in 1877, the American Humane Association (AHA) is a \n     nationwide association of child welfare professionals, public \n     and private social services, medical and mental health \n     professional, as well as educators, researchers, judicial and \n     law enforcement professionals and child advocates. AHA's \n     Children's Division continues to be a voice dedicated to the \n     protection of children.\n       AHA strongly believes that Title XX deserves to be placed \n     high on the list of priorities. This block grant allows \n     states the flexibility to provide much needed services for \n     vulnerable children and families in near crisis situations \n     and has helped support reforms in state foster care systems.\n       AHA is pleased that the Clinton administration has \n     requested restoration of this vital program to the full \n     entitlement level for the next fiscal year. We believe that \n     this proposed funding level is a formal recognition by the \n     Administration of the vital importance of this block grant \n     and we hope you will endorse this recommendation. We do, \n     however, continue to hold great concerns with regard to the \n     administration's proposal to reduce the states' ability to \n     transfer funds from TANF into Title XX to no more than 4.25 \n     percent. We would like to work closely with you, as well as \n     the Administration, to ensure that state flexibility is \n     retained.\n       By helping to keep people in the community, the Social \n     Services Block Grant actually saves the federal government \n     and the nation's taxpayers the cost of expensive \n     institutional care. Therefore, we strongly urge you to fund \n     the Social Services block Grant at its fully authorized level \n     of $2.38 billion.\n       Thank you for your hard work and attention to this issue. \n     If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate \n     to contact us at (202) 543-7780.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Adele Douglass,\n                                   Director, Washington DC Office.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1886 To Amendment No. 1821\n\n     (Purpose: To restore funding for social services block grants)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the \namendment currently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1886 to amendment No. 1821.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the \n     amount appropriated under this title for making grants \n     pursuant to section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1397a) shall be increased to $2,380,000,000: Provided, \n     That (1) $1,330,000,000 of which shall become available on \n     October 1, 2000, and (2) notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this title, the amount specified for allocation under \n     section 2003(c) of such Act for fiscal year 2001 shall be \n     $3,030,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nfollow the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to the arguments by the \nSenator from Florida I can understand his interest in adding funds to \nwhat the committee mark is. I have no disagreement with the importance \nof the funds which are at issue.\n  I am constrained to oppose the amendment because in constructing this \noverall bill for $91.7 billion, in collaboration with the ranking \nDemocrat on the subcommittee, we have juggled some 300 programs. If we \nare going to add a very substantial amount of additional funding to \neducation, which we have some $2.3 billion over last year, and if we \nare to add $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and to \nhave an initiative against juvenile violence, it is a matter of the \nallocation of priorities.\n  The comment has been made about the use of the tobacco funds. Those \nare very substantial sums of money, some $203 billion over a number of \nyears.\n  I fought on the Senate floor to try to bring some of those tobacco \nfunds to the Federal Government so we would have more moneys available. \nIt is an obvious suggestion, when the States are the recipients of so \nmuch of that funding, that some of it be used where other Federal funds \nhad been made available. This is another illustration, along with the \nrequest for additional funds for after school, $200 million more, or \nfor class size, for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--all of \nthose are items which, under normal circumstances, I would say are very \ngood programs, they are very good approaches, we would like to see \nthem. But when it comes to assessing priorities, it is my sense, after \nworking through very carefully with staff and then with the Democratic \nstaff, the full subcommittee and the full committee, that this is an \nappropriate assessment of priorities.\n  Therefore, even though I have sympathy for what the Senator from \nFlorida has had to say and think these are good programs, on a priority \nbasis I have to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Graham, on his amendment.\n  I want to respond to my colleague from Pennsylvania. I will start out \nwith Minnesota, and then I will go to the country at large. Actually, \nin Minnesota, for reasons I will explain, these social service programs \nand funding are passed directly to counties. The State cannot replace \nthe money with tobacco money or anything else, and certainly not for \nnext year, which is a bonding legislature. But above and beyond that, \nin any case, the tobacco money has already been spent for other \nprograms.\n  The point is, we do not know what will happen. This is what my \ncolleague concluded. We do not know what will happen with these \nprograms that are so important to poor people, to vulnerable people, \nelderly people, people with disabilities. To cut the social service \nprograms by 50 percent and then say\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nStates have tobacco money so we will count on them to do it is an \nabandonment of our commitment. It is an abandonment of our commitment.\n  What we have done is cut the social services block grant program by \nmore than half. What my colleague from Florida has done--and I am \npleased to join him in this amendment--is to restore the funding to the \nfull formula amount of $2.38 billion. We are talking about programs \nthat are so important to the lives of the most vulnerable citizens in \nour country: The elderly, the very young, the poor, and the disabled.\n  The question is, What is this SSBG fund? Are we talking about \nsomething important?\n  Yes, we are talking about something important, if you think adoption \nservices, congregate meals, counseling services, child abuse and \nneglect services, day care, education and training services, employment \nservices, family planning services, foster care services, home-\ndelivered meals, housing services, independent and transitional living \nservices, legal services, pregnancy and parenting services, residential \ntreatment services, services for at-risk youth, and special services \nfor families for the disabled and transportation services are \nimportant. If we think these services are important, then how in the \nworld can we cut this funding by 50 percent?\n  I respect my colleague from Pennsylvania. He has done the very best, \ngiven the budget caps under which he has worked. But I do not believe a \ngood argument against the amendment we have introduced is: Well, there \nis tobacco money out there and the States can use that money.\n  Some States do not have that money to use. Some States can't use that \nmoney. In any case, whatever happened to our commitment at the Federal \nlevel to try to fund some services that would help the most vulnerable \ncitizens in our country? That is my question.\n  Let me talk a little about some of these programs and then go further \nwith the argument I want to make. Let me take Meals on Wheels. Why do \nwe not think about this in personal terms? I think, I say to Senator \nGraham, we are going to get support for this amendment. I believe we \ncan pass this amendment. Are Senators going to vote to cut funding for \nthe Meals on Wheels program? That is a program for people, many of them \nelderly, many of them disabled. Both my parents, for example, had \nParkinson's disease. They might not even be able to get to congregate \ndining, which is a great program. They might not even be able to get \ninto town; they cannot drive. Quite often there is not the \ntransportation. In Minnesota it is cold; it is wintry weather. Maybe \nduring the winter they cannot get out and freely move around. So you \nhave the Meals on Wheels program where you deliver a hot lunch, a \nnutritious meal, to elderly citizens. And we are going to cut this \nprogram?\n  Let me repeat that. We are going to cut this program? We can do \nbetter. We can do much better.\n  Talk about independent and transitional living services; here we have \nsome services--I will talk about this in some detail--that would enable \nan elderly person or someone with a disability to live at home in as \nnear normal circumstances as possible, with dignity. It is a range of \nsupport services. It might be nursing services, community health \noutreach services, making sure those people are able, with a little \nhelp, to stay at home. We are going to cut this program, potentially by \nhalf? We are going to cut services that enable people to live at home \nwith dignity as opposed to being put into a nursing home? We cannot do \nthat. We cannot do that.\n  According to the Title XX Coalition, in fiscal year 1997 more than \n1.1 million elderly people and over 740,000 people with disabilities \nbenefited from the social services program. State and local prevention \nand treatment services reached over 2.3 million children and their \nfamilies. I thought we cared so much about the elderly. I thought we \ncared so much about the children. I thought we cared so much about \nmaking sure at least there is an investment in some resources that will \nenable people with disabilities to live lives with independence and \ndignity. That is what the disabilities movement is all about. We cannot \nsay that if we cut these services, if we cut these programs by over 50 \npercent.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, SSBG funds are used, in some counties, \nto augment child care for single women and their families. We talk \nabout the importance of moving from welfare to work, but if a mother \nworks and cannot find child care or cannot afford child care, how is \nshe going to do it? Or if you have working poor people and they work 52 \nweeks a year and they work 40 hours a week and one of them is working \nor both of them are working, affordable child care is a hugely \nimportant issue for them. There are not Senators in this Chamber who \nwould not want to make sure their children were able to get good child \ncare. And we are cutting into services for child care?\n  Many Minnesota counties use SSBG money for home care services for the \nelderly. We are talking about funds to pay for a care giver to go to a \nvulnerable elderly person's home and help them with ``home chore \nservices,'' such as taking their medicine on time and in the right \ndoses, keeping their homes clean and safe, helping people take a bath, \nmaking sure there is food in the refrigerator.\n  I am sorry, I am not going to get worked up, but I do not understand \nhow in the world we can justify cutting those services for elderly \npeople. I do not understand that. That is exactly what we went through \nwith my mother and father in Northfield, MN. That is exactly the \nstruggle we had in trying to help them stay at home. We did all we \ncould among Sheila, myself, and our children.\n  Sometimes one needs some help. At the county level, if there is a \npublic health outreach program, somebody can help elderly people to \nmake sure they take their drugs, to make sure they take the right \ndosage, to help someone like my dad who had Parkinson's disease and his \nbody shook and my mother was not able to help him take a bath, to help \npeople live at home, help people keep their independence. This is mean-\nspirited to cut these programs.\n  We cannot say: Well, but there is the tobacco money and States can \nuse tobacco money. We do not know whether all States can. We do not \nknow whether all States will and, in any case, this is a commitment \nthat we have made in the Senate. We are a national community. Can we \nnot as a national community, represented by the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, at least make a commitment to fund these services \nthat are so important for vulnerable people?\n  I was speaking with Marien Brandt, the human services director in \nSibley County, MN, a rural county, who told me her county spends SSBG \nfunds primarily to serve vulnerable populations who are not eligible \nfor assistance under other funding programs. She suggested that many of \nthe people her agency serves would be forced into institutionalized \ncare without SSBG funds.\n  She gave me the example of the child who might have to go into an \nout-of-home placement if her agency becomes unable to provide \ncounseling services that help the child's parent learn to adequately \ncare for and protect that child.\n  The vulnerable adults they help with SSBG money tend to be elderly \npeople, seniors, disabled people who get home health care services, \npeople they help stay at home, the very people about whom I talked.\n  If we are talking also about counseling services for parents and for \nchildren at risk, what in the world are we doing cutting those \nservices? Marien told me that in Sibley County, SSBG money is used \nespecially in the rural areas to fund transportation for the elderly \nand the disabled so they can go to the doctor, so they can buy \ngroceries, so they are simply not isolated.\n  Let me point out what we are doing. All too often we say SSBG and \npeople do not know what we are talking about. And we throw the money \naround: increase $1.2 billion, subtract $1.3 billion. I will translate \nit into personal services. Here is an example of one of many counties--\nI could take hours on this--where we use this money to provide \ntransportation. Sometimes it is not the big buses. Sometimes it is \nsmaller, a dial-a-bus so an elderly person can go to the doctor, people \ncan go to the grocery store, they can go to congregate dining, they\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\ncan go places and they are not isolated. What in the world are we doing \ncutting this funding by 50 percent?\n  This SSBG money, I say to my colleague from Florida, is used to fund \nservices for people who otherwise would fall through the cracks. This \nmoney is used to provide services for the most vulnerable citizens in \nour country.\n  I do not understand exactly--I understand what my colleague from \nPennsylvania said. He cares a lot about these budgets as they affect \npeople. But I really do not know how we got to the point where we cut \nthese social service programs by 50 percent. I do not understand that. \nI am afraid one of the things I think happens is that quite often, when \nwe work under these caps--I do not know if my colleague from Florida \nwill be angry with me for saying this, so therefore maybe I will not, \nnow that I think about it.\n  We put ourselves into fictional politics. These caps do not work, and \neverybody seems to be locked in with these caps. We are engaged in \nmutual deception. Nobody wants to talk about breaking the caps. That is \nnot what this amendment does, although advance funding, whatever, we \nall know we need to spend more.\n  In my opinion, this amendment goes to the heart of what this debate \nis all about. We ought not, I say to the Presiding Officer--a good \nSenator--to be cutting these kinds of programs. These programs are for \nthe most vulnerable citizens in our country. We ought not to be cutting \nprograms that enable someone to get Meals on Wheels, that enable \nsomeone to go to congregate dining, that provide home health care \nservices so people can stay at home rather than being \ninstitutionalized, that provide child care, help for families so they \ncan afford child care. We ought not to be cutting these kinds of \nservices by 50 percent. I fear one of the reasons we end up doing it is \nthat these are the citizens who do not have the clout. It is just too \neasy to make cuts based upon the path of least political resistance. It \nis just too easy to cut services for the very poor and the most \nvulnerable. This is wrong.\n  This amendment goes to the heart and soul, I hope, of the Senate.\n  I will not go over reports from many counties, but I want to talk \nbriefly about how my own State is going to be impacted.\n  Minnesota communities currently receive $41.6 million annually. If \nthese proposed cuts are enacted, Minnesota is going to lose $23.2 \nmillion in funding. We will receive only $18.3 million in fiscal year \n2000.\n  We are unique, I will concede that point, because by law the SSBG \nfunds bypass the Governor and flow directly to the local level. The \nState cannot touch the money. We cannot add or subtract funds from the \nblock grant.\n  Minnesota law further requires local level programs to run balanced \nbooks, which means they cannot carry any budget surplus from one year \nto the next. What this means, if these cuts to the SSBG go through, the \nState will not be able to offset any of the lost funds with funds from \nother sources. The local level programs will have no budget surpluses \nto fall back on, and these Federal level program cuts will be reflected \nimmediately in local level cuts; in other words, right there in the \ncounties where the people live. It would mean substantial reductions or \nperhaps even the elimination of local Minnesota programs.\n\n  So when I come to the floor and speak about this with some sense of \nurgency, it is because we could lose senior congregate dining. We could \nlose Meals on Wheels. We could lose a host of other local community-\nbased programs that are so important to our citizens.\n  It would also mean cuts in health and substance abuse programs. \nMinnesota is one of only seven States in the country that relies more \nheavily on title XX grants than its SAMHSA grant to fund mental health \nservices. We are going to see draconian cuts in mental health services \nas well.\n  Furthermore, next year, in my State it will be a ``bonding \nlegislature,'' one in which they will not be able to consider policy \nissues. So the Minnesota Legislature is not going to be able--I think \nmy colleague from Florida was alluding to this in other States--to take \nup any legislation to change the law governing the flow of SSBG funds \nin 2001.\n  I will tell you, I give the example of Minnesota because this is one \nhugely important issue in my State. But I also want to say to my \ncolleagues that Senator Graham has done a good job of talking about how \nthis is going to affect all of the States. In a report that was put out \nyesterday, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained that if \nthe Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill becomes law, SSBG funding will \nhave been cut 87 percent since 1977 in inflation-adjusted terms--87 \npercent. An SSBG cut of the magnitude proposed in this bill will \nsubstantially reduce our State's ability to provide services to \nvulnerable children, to elderly, and disabled people.\n  This amendment, that I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Graham, is \nan effort to say to the Senate that we have to do the right thing and \nthat we must restore full funding for the title XX social services \nblock grant program.\n  I will wait to hear if there is debate on the other side. I have many \nmore examples to present from many counties in my State, both rural and \nurban. But I will repeat it one more time. As far as I am concerned, \nthe fundamental core question for us to address, the issue for us to \ndebate, is whether or not we in the Senate want to cut the social \nservices programs that are so important to the most vulnerable citizens \nin our States--important to elderly people so they can have \ntransportation and not be so isolated; important to people like my \nparents, who are no longer alive, so someone can come to their \napartment and help them live at home when they have a disabling \ndisease; important to a family where the single parent is working and \nshe wants to make sure there is affordable child care; important to the \nperson with disabilities so he or she can live at home with dignity; \nimportant for people who are not well enough and cannot even physically \nbe able to go to congregate dining, who need Meals on Wheels, so \nsomeone can come and deliver them a nutritious meal.\n  By the way, the Meals on Wheels program is inadequately funded right \nnow. We cannot cut these critically important programs and services \nthat make life better for vulnerable citizens in our country. We cannot \ndo this.\n  The States have a tremendous amount of leeway in how they use their \nSSBG funds, and this is one program in which they are able to try to \ndevelop innovative and creative programs to help the poor and needy \n(people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty line are eligible \nfor SSBG funds). Title XX only specifies that the money be used to help \npeople achieve and maintain economic self-support and self-sufficiency \nto prevent, reduce, or eliminate dependency. The law also allows the \nmoney to be used for services that prevent or remedy neglect and abuse, \nand to prevent or reduce unnecessary institutional care by providing \ncommunity-based or home-based non-institutional care. States use this \nmoney to care for people who would otherwise slip through the cracks; \nthese funds are critical for the well-being of the most vulnerable \npeople among us--the elderly and the very young, the poor, and the \ndisabled. These are people who most need our help, and we should not be \nslashing the very money that is most likely to serve them.\n  Title XX of the Social Security Act specifies that $2.38 billion is \nto be provided to the States for fiscal year 2000. The Senate Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, though, slashes funding for this block grant to \nonly $1.05 billion. This cut comes on top of a 15 percent cut to the \nblock grant made as part of the 1996 welfare reform law, a cut that the \nstates reluctantly accepted only with a commitment from Congress that \nwe would provide stable funding for the block grant in the future. I am \npretty sure that a 50-percent cut doesn't qualify as stable funding by \nanyone's definition.\n  And what kind of a message do we send to the States when we talk \nabout cutting block grant funds? Congress sold welfare reform to the \nstates on the promise that they would have the flexibility to \nadminister their own social service programs. But as the National \nConference of State Legislatures point out, ``these cuts [to the SSBG] \nwould set the precedent that the federal government is reticent to \nstand by its decision to grant flexibility to states in\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nadministering social programs.'' SSBG funds are used by the states to \nprovide services for needy individuals and families not eligible for \nTANF, and to reduce federal Medicaid payments by helping vulnerable \nelderly and disabled live in their homes rather than in institutions. \nStates also use SSBG funds for child care services and other supports \nfor families moving from welfare to work. When Congress proposes \nslashing these funds, we send a clear, and I believe extremely \ndamaging, message to the States. I think we are telling them not to \ninvest in these kinds of social support programs, because they just \ncan't count on the money being there.\n  But let's just say for a minute that we do go back on our word and \nbreak our commitment to the States--so what? What exactly does SSBG \nfund? Anything important?\n  Only if you think adoption services, congregate meals, counseling \nservices, child abuse and neglect services, day care, education and \ntraining services, employment services, family planning services, \nfoster care services, home delivered meals, housing services, \nindependent and transitional living services, legal services, pregnancy \nand parenting services, residential treatment services, services for \nat-risk youth and families, special services for the disabled, and \ntransportation services are important. All of these programs are \nfunded, in part at least, through the SSBG.\n  According to the Title XX Coalition, in fiscal year 1997, more than \n1.1 million elderly people and over 740,000 people with disabilities \nbenefited from SSBG. State and local prevention and treatment services \nreached over 2.3 million children and their families. The SSBG also \nreached 1.5 million individuals and families by supporting their \nphysical and mental well-being, and by helping them overcome barriers \nto employment and economic self-sufficiency. And child care-related \nservices were provided to over 2.3 million children through SSBG.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, SSBG funds are used in some counties \nto augment child care for low-income single women and families. Even \nwith these additional funds, there are currently huge waiting lists for \nsubsidized day care in most counties. If we further cut the title XX \nfunds, these county level programs are going to have to reduce or \neliminate services that they provide. And when a single mom who has \njust gotten off welfare and is trying to make ends meet while she \nstarts working at her new job, loses the subsidized day care that she \ncounts on, what do you think is going to happen? Which do you think is \nmore likely--that she'll be able to afford to pay for day care herself, \nor that she'll be forced to go back onto welfare?\n\n  Many Minnesota counties use SSBG money for home care services for the \nelderly. These counties use SSBG funds to pay for a care giver to go \ninto a vulnerable elderly person's home and help them with basic ``home \nchore'' services like taking their medicine on time and in the right \ndoses, keeping their home clean and safe, taking a bath, or making sure \nthere is food in the refrigerator. These are simple, basic services, \nbut they often mean the difference between allowing someone to stay in \ntheir own home or being forced into an institution. If SSBG funds are \ncut, vulnerable elderly are likely to lose home care services like a \nvisiting nurse or case management person, which might then force them \ninto a nursing home or an assisted living situation that would, in the \nend, cost much more money.\n  I was speaking with Marien Brandt, the Human Services Director in \nSibley County, Minnesota who told me that her county spends SSBG funds \nprimarily to serve vulnerable populations who aren't eligible for \nassistance under other funding programs, and she suggested that many of \nthe people her agency serves would be forced into institutionalized \ncare without SSBG funds. Marien gave me the example of the child who \nmight have to go into an out-of-home placement if her agency becomes \nunable to provide counseling services that help the child's parent \nlearn to adequately care for and protect that child. The vulnerable \nadults they help with SSBG money tend to be elderly people, seniors or \ndisabled people, who get home care services--someone to come in to help \nthem clean their home and maintain a safe environment, bathe, have food \nto eat, to see that they take the right amount of medicine when they \nare supposed to. Oftentimes these people are not eligible for medical \nassistance, so there is not another source of funding available to them \nwhen they are living in the community. What will happen if SSBG funds \nare cut is that they will wind up having to go into a nursing home in \norder to qualify for funds to pay for their care.\n  Marien told me that in Sibley County, SSBG money is also used, \nespecially in rural areas, to fund transportation for elderly and \ndisabled, so they can access services like doctors, getting groceries, \nand just simply so they are not so isolated in their home (a ride to \nthe senior center, perhaps). There is no other funding source that will \npay for this. For disabled people who are just over eligibility \nguidelines for medical assistance, SSBG money is used to help meet \ntheir needs--managing medication, transportation, and community based \nservices like training and counseling.\n  The way Marien explained it to me, her county basically counts on \nSSBG money to pay for services for people who otherwise fall through \nthe cracks. They count on this money to provide simple, basic services \nthat keep the most vulnerable among us in their homes and out of much \nmore costly institutions.\n  Sue Beck, the Director of Human Services in Crow Wing County, \nMinnesota told me a similar story. She explained that her county also \ncounts on SSBG funds to make sure that vulnerable populations, the \nelderly, the disabled, children, and poor people, have the services \nthey need to live economically secure, self-sufficient lives. Over the \npast several years, due to SSBG cuts that have already been imposed, \nher county has had to cut back services in transportation and ``chore \nservices''--for disabled and elderly people who need just a little bit \nof help--things like help shoveling snow or grocery shopping. They use \nSSBG money currently to augment their employability budget--to provide \nsupported employment, and community based employment for people who \nother wise might not be able to compete successfully in the job market. \nAll of this is at risk when we talk about cutting SSBG in half.\n\n  Dave Haley, from the Ramsey County Department of Human Services also \ntold me about his county spends SSBG money. The first example he gave \nme was that of a typical family of a single-mother who has three young \nchildren. The oldest child, a 7-year-old boy, has missed a significant \nnumber of school days. The mother is experiencing problems with \nchemical dependency and involved in a violent relationship with her \nboyfriend. The mother cannot make sure that the child gets up every day \non time, and is promptly fed and dressed for school. The family does \nnot have a car or other personal means of transportation. Through \nprograms partially funded with SSBG money, the County is able to \nprovide support to the mother to resolve her chemical dependency \nproblems and domestic abuse. Services ensure that the seven-year-old is \nattending school on a regular basis and the boy is beginning to make \nacademic progress.\n  There are over 2,000 young children in Ramsey County currently in \nthis situation. Ramsey County and local school districts have been able \nto develop a very active program to address these educational neglect \nissues and insure that children attend school on a consistent basis. \nThey will be forced to scale back this effort, though, if SSBG funds \nare cut by more than 50 percent.\n  Another example that Dave gave me is that of a 30 year-old woman that \nis living in her own apartment in her home community. Thirty years ago, \na similar individual with moderate mental health needs would have been \nplaced in a state hospital miles from their family home. Over the last \nthree decades, needed supports have been developed, including programs \nto monitor and assist individuals in managing their medications, \nchecking on their money management and assisting when necessary with \nproper budgeting, teaching needed independent living skills, and \nemployment support to maintain their current job. Without periodic \nweekly checks, the individual would have great difficulty managing \ntheir daily life, and might be forced\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\ninto an institutionalized living situation.\n  The system that has developed over the last three decades has not \nonly improved the lives of hundreds of people in Ramsey County, it has \nalso enabled the state and federal government to save hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on more expensive institutional care.\n  Currently, Ramsey County receives $5 million in SSBG funding. If this \nwere reduced by half, it would affect far more than what I have briefly \nmentioned. SSBG money also supports chemical dependency prevention \nefforts, homemaker and other support services for seniors to prevent \nnursing home placement, and support efforts for families with a child \nwith developmental disabilities to enable the family to stay together \nand avoid or delay out of home placement, to name only a few. If these \nfunds are not restored, all of these programs, and all of the people \nthey serve, will suffer.\n  So you tell me, which of these programs deserves to go, because \nsomething is going to have to if this provision passes. Who do you \nthink we should turn away? Maybe low-income families with children? Or \nperhaps the elderly or disabled? What difference does it make if \nsomeone goes to bed hungry, or homeless, or just plain afraid that they \nwon't make it through tomorrow? We have a budget cap to maintain, after \nall. And that is what this Congress has defined as really important \nhere, right? Not helping our constituents, or keeping our commitments \nto the States, because I certainly don't see how anyone in Congress \ncould argue differently when I see an effort like this to eliminate \none-half of the SSBG funding.\n\n  In my own State of Minnesota, these cuts will have an immediate and \ndeeply felt effect. Minnesota communities currently receive $41.6 \nmillion annually. If the proposed cuts are enacted, Minnesota will lose \n$23.2 million in funding, receiving only $18.3 million in FY 2000.\n  Minnesota is unique among all the states, though, because, by law, \nSSBG funds by-pass the governor and flow directly to the local level. \nThe state cannot touch the money--they can neither add nor subtract \nfunds from the block grant. Minnesota law further requires local levels \nprograms to run balanced books. Which means that they cannot carry any \nbudget surplus from one year to the next. So what that means is that if \nthese cuts to the SSBG go through, the state will not be able to help \noffset any of the lost funds with funds from other sources, the local \nlevel programs will have no budget surpluses to fall back on, and these \nfederal level cuts will be reflected immediately at the local level in \nprogram cuts. It would mean substantial reductions, or perhaps even the \nelimination of local Minnesota programs like senior congregate dining, \nMeals on Wheels, and a host of other local community based programs. It \nwould also mean cuts in health and substance abuse programs, as \nMinnesota is one of only seven states in the country that relies more \nheavily on its Title XX grant than its SAMHSA grant to fund mental \nhealth services. Furthermore, because next year will be a ``bonding \nlegislature,'' one in which they will not be considering policy issues, \nthe Minnesota legislature will not be able to take up legislation to \nchange the law governing the flow of SSBG funds until 2001.\n  So some of my colleagues may be saying to themselves, well that's \nunfortunate for Minnesota, but in my home state we'll be able to \nsupplement the cuts with other money--maybe the money we got from the \ntobacco settlement, or perhaps we will just transfer money from our \nTANF surplus. First, let's talk about the tobacco settlements: in some \nstates, anti-smoking and other health needs will receive first priority \nfor use of the settlement funds, not unanticipated reductions in SSBG \nfunds. Also, some states have already enacted legislation committing \nthe tobacco funds for other purposes. Okay, well, then if not the \ntobacco settlement funds, then maybe the TANF surplus funds. But right \nnow, seven states--Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, \nMissouri, Nevada, Oregon--currently have no unobligated TANF funds. And \nif the House gets its way, 3 billion dollars in TANF surpluses will be \nrescinded from the states. This will leave another 12 states--Alabama, \nConnecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New \nHampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah, and Vermont--who if they \nused every single cent of their remaining TANF surplus still won't have \nenough money to cover the lost SSBG funds. That's a total of 19 States, \nmore than a third of all states, that won't have the social service \nfunds available to offset the SSBG funding cuts proposed in this bill.\n  I have here a letter from a group called ``Fight Crime, Invest in \nKids,'' which is an organization made up of over 500 police chiefs, \nsheriffs, prosecutors, victims of violence, and violence prevention \nscholars, written in support of this amendment. They write to explain \nthat recent cuts in SSBG have short changed child care, child abuse \nprevention, removal and placement of abused children, drug treatment, \nand other critical crime prevention investments.\n  As they point out in this letter, one of the Government's most \nfundamental responsibilities is to protect the public safety. To meet \nthat responsibility, Congress must close the crime-prevention gap--the \ngaping shortfall we ought to be making to help our Nation's children \nget the right start.\n  The Graham-Wellstone amendment to restore funding to the SSBG would \nprovide over $591 million to protect children from abuse and neglect. \nSince abused and neglected children are almost twice as likely to \nbecome chronic offenders, it is clear that these services can have an \nimportant crime prevention impact. The amendment would also provide \n$300 million to support child care in 47 states. A study by the High \nScope Foundation showed that quality child care can dramatically reduce \nthe chances of children becoming criminals. It is clear that we must \ncontinue to provide the funds for these programs, and we can only do \nthat by restoring the title XX grant to its full formula amount.\n  In a report they put out yesterday, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities explained that if the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nbecomes law, SSBG funding will have been cut by 87 percent since 1977 \nin inflation-adjusted terms. An SSBG cut of the magnitude proposed in \nthis Senate bill will substantially reduce the States' ability to \nprovide services to vulnerable children, elderly, and disabled people. \nPlease, do the right thing and restore the SSBG money by supporting the \nGraham-Wellstone amendment to restore full funding for the Title XX \nSocial Services Block Grant.\n  If the Senate does not support this Graham amendment, then, in my \nview, the Senate does not have a soul. If the Senate does not support \nthis Graham amendment, then, in my honest to God opinion, the Senate \ndoes not have a soul.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am ready to make a motion, if the other side does \nnot wish to use the remainder of their time. If there is something \nfurther they have to say, I do not want to cut that off.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are not \noperating under a time agreement, so there is not a clock ticking on \nthis issue.\n  I see one of the cosponsors of the amendment, the Senator from \nConnecticut, is on the floor. I do not know if he desires to speak on \nthis issue or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I am very impressed with \nthe level of my colleagues' debate. I commend my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, and my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, for articulating what I think the rationale and support for \nthis amendment means to make a huge difference in our States and \nlocalities and to underserved Americans.\n  I have an amendment that I will be offering shortly on behalf of \nSenator Jeffords and myself, Senator Snowe, and others, on child care. \nI am prepared to offer that, but I do not want to in any way cut into \nthe debate of my colleague from Florida or others who may want to \ncontinue with regard to his particular amendment.\n  Again, I commend him for it. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of it. \nI\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nthink it makes a significant contribution. I point out, in my State \nalone--I represent the most affluent State in America, something of \nwhich I am proud. I also tell you I am not so proud of the fact that \nthe largest increase in child poverty in the country occurred in my \nState over the last several years--a 60-percent increase in child \npoverty.\n  So here is a small State, Connecticut, with 3.5 million people, \nenjoying unprecedented prosperity. Yet in the midst of this small \nState, we are also finding an unprecedented hardship on the part of a \nlot of people, particularly young people. One out of every five \nchildren in my State is growing up in poverty.\n  What the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Minnesota have \noffered is some relief for people in that category, to see to it that \nthey might also enjoy the prosperity of our country.\n\n  Meals on Wheels, adult day care, foster care--there is a wide variety \nof other issues. But as my colleagues know, I have tried to focus my \nattention, over the years, particularly on children and their needs; \nand hence the amendment I will offer with Senator Jeffords in a moment \non child care and afterschool care.\n  But I realize this amendment being offered by the Senator from \nFlorida covers more than just children. For example, it covers adult \nday care. Three generations living under the same roof--we find that a \nmore frequent occurrence in our society. The wonderful advances in \nmedicine allow people to live longer, more fruitful lives, but it also \ncreates generational burdens in many ways.\n  So this is not an unreasonable request for a nation of almost 280 \nmillion people to see to it that those who are the least well off--\ncarrying some of the most significant burdens--can also share in the \nprosperity we are enjoying. That is what I think we would all like to \nthink of when we talk about America: a nation where there is equal \nopportunity.\n  What this amendment does is create opportunity. It does not guarantee \nsuccess, but it gives people a chance to maximize their potential. For \nthose reasons, I strongly urge the adoption of the amendment, and again \nI am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to reserve time to close. If there are any \nspeakers in opposition to the amendment, I would defer to them and then \nI would like to close.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are prepared to move to the close on \nbehalf of the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The arguments in favor of this amendment are numerous. \nThe Federal Government made a commitment to the States as part of the \nwelfare-to-work legislation that it would maintain funding for this \nprogram at the level of $2.38 billion each year. That commitment was \nmade out of a recognition of the importance of the programs funded \nthrough title XX of the Social Security Act toward achieving the \nresults, the goals of welfare to work. We are about to breach that \ncommitment--not just to breach it, we are about to obliterate that \ncommitment.\n  Second, the proposal directs the States to spend a portion of their \ntobacco settlement to replace these Federal funds, the funds we have \ncommitted to make available to the States.\n  We have voted in this Senate on numerous occasions, by margins of 70 \nto 30 or more, against that specific proposition, against the attempt \nof the Federal Government to play big father and direct the States as \nto how they should use their tobacco settlement money. Now, having \nbeaten back the efforts at the front door, we see this effort coming in \nthrough the back door saying: Well, we are not going to tell you that \nyou have to spend your money. We are just going to cut over half of a \ncritical Federal partnership program with the States, a program we \ncommitted to as part of the States entering into the Welfare-to-Work \nProgram. We are just going to suggest. And, by the way, you ought to \nspend your tobacco money to fund it. Outrageous.\n  Third, this is not just a matter of what is in our heart; this is \nalso what is in our mind. The reason Congress adopted this program in \n1975--which, if I recall, was under the administration of President \nFord--was the recognition that expenditure of Federal funds on programs \nthat kept older Americans out of nursing homes, expenditure of Federal \nfunds on programs that alleviated the suffering and the potential for \nfurther suffering of the disabled, saved the Federal Government money, \nprograms that kept families together, that helped children in need, \nsaved the Federal Government money. With almost no consideration, we \nare about to turn the clock back on this accomplishment of President \nFord and 25 years of demonstrated success of this program in both \nhelping people and saving the Federal Government money.\n  Most important, we are about to pick out the most vulnerable people \namong us and say: It is upon your back that we are going to attempt to \nreduce the imbalance in our budget accounts. We are going to turn to \nthe weakest to say: You should carry the fullest load.\n  I don't want to just speak these closing remarks in my words. I will \nuse the words of a few of the many organizations across America which, \nin the short period of time since the alert went out that this \nridiculous action was even being considered by the most deliberative \nbody in the world, have responded with their assessment of what this \nwould mean. Let me mention a few of them.\n  The National Governors' Association had this to say:\n\n       Over the past few years, the [social services block grant] \n     has taken more than its share of cuts in federal funding. As \n     part of the 1996 welfare reform deal, Congress made a \n     commitment to Governors that the SSBG would be level funded \n     at $2.38 billion each year.\n\n  Congress made a commitment to the States that this funding would be \nmaintained. Now we are about to cut that funding by more than 50 \npercent, according to the National Governors' Association.\n  The Fight Crime Invest in Kids Coalition, an organization that \nrepresents over 500 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, victims of \nviolence, leaders of police organizations and violence prevention \nscholars, had this to say about this proposal:\n\n       The Graham-Wellstone amendment to restore funding of $2.38 \n     billion for the Title XX Social Services Block Grant would:\n       Provide over $591 million to protect children from abuse \n     and neglect. Since abused and neglected children are almost \n     twice as likely to become chronic offenders, it is clear \n     these services can have an important crime prevention impact.\n       Provide $300 million to support child care in 47 States. \n     The High/Scope Foundation study showed that quality child \n     care can dramatically reduce the chances of children becoming \n     criminals.\n\n  That is what 500 chiefs of police and sheriffs and other leaders in \nthe criminal justice community have said about the importance of this \namendment.\n  Catholic Charities USA said this in its letter:\n\n       Cutting funds to services that keep people independent and \n     in their communities is short sighted and will lead to \n     unnecessary suffering and increases in other federal \n     programs.\n\n  This is what the Girl Scouts said about this proposal:\n\n       The further cuts to this program which have been proposed \n     by the Senate will no doubt negatively impact our \n     communities, most of which are already struggling with \n     limited resources for much needed services.\n\n  Finally, the National Conference of State Legislatures in their \nletter stated:\n\n       The current proposal in the Senate Labor, Health and Human \n     Services and Education appropriations legislation will \n     jeopardize services to the elderly, disabled and children and \n     families. It also represents a retreat from Federal \n     commitments made during the enactment of welfare reform \n     legislation.\n\n  For all of those reasons, as well as the fact that Senators Kennedy \nand Cleland have asked to be added as additional cosponsors to this \namendment, I urge my colleagues to step back from the precipice of \nirresponsibility and repudiation of commitment, to step back from the \ncliff that would have us, through the back door of this ill-considered \nproposal, breach our commitments to the States to keep our hands off \ntheir State-won tobacco settlement, and particularly so we can look in \nthe eyes of the American people who would\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\nbe most affected by this--the children, the disabled, and the frail \nelderly--and say: You are not the forgotten Americans.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my displeasure at the \nsevere reduction this year's Labor-Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill includes for the Social Services Block Grant. This \nprogram was established under Title XX of the Social Security Act to \nhelp people who are least able to help themselves; the elderly, the \ndisabled, and children of low income families. The money is put to good \nuse in some two dozen areas such as foster care services, day care, \nintervention and prevention for at-risk families, and special services \nfor the disabled. The Labor-HHS Subcommittee has produced a bill that \ncuts SSBG funds from $1.9 billion to $1 billion. Just short of cutting \nit in half. The committee report cites tight budget constraints and \nsuggests that states can make up the difference with proceeds from the \ntobacco settlement. Mr. President, money from the tobacco settlement \nshould be used for anti-smoking programs and other health programs. The \nbasis of that litigation was that smoking caused health problems which \nthe states had paid for. So health care programs that were deprived of \nfunds in the past should be the beneficiaries of the tobacco money, as \nshould anti-smoking programs. We should not tell the states that we're \npulling the rug out from under the SSBG and it is up to them to make up \nthe difference if they choose to. Some states have already passed \nlegislation that allocates the tobacco money.\n  The Social Services Block Grant program is an entirely egalitarian \nprogram. The formula could scarcely be simpler. The proportion of the \nmoney each state gets is the proportion of the national population it \nhas. New York has seven percent of the population. It gets seven \npercent of the funds. So this draconian cut affects states evenly. \nEveryone should be concerned about it.\n  One further point. This is a block grant. It allows the states to \ndecide how best to spend money on a range of similar needs. The \nalternative would be a handful of categorical programs to which the \nstates would apply individually. From time to time Senate debate \ncenters on the merits of block grants versus categorical programs. \nEducation comes to mind, for example. The opponents of block grants \nfrequently say that once you block grant a group of existing programs, \nit becomes significantly easier to cut their funding. If this $900 \nmillion reduction is allowed to stand, the opponents of block grants \nwill have a shining new example of the damage that can be done to a \nblock grant and the proponents of block grants will have a more \ndifficult time gaining their objectives in the future.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nGraham amendment to restore funding for Title XX, the Social Services \nBlock Grant. This program is critical to the ability of our states to \nmeet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens--children, the elderly \nand the disabled.\n  The present Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill contains a \nprovision to cut funding for the Social Services Block Grant by more \nthan half, from $2.38 billion to $1.05 billion. This program has been \nunder attack for years. In 1996, Title XX was cut by 15%. In 1998, the \nhighway bill used cuts in Title XX to pay for the out years of highway \nspending in 2001. While I understand the importance of roads for \neconomic development, should we pay for it by cutting basic funding for \nneedy children, disabled Americans, or senior citizens?\n  In the last few years this Congress has sent a message to the states. \nWe have said, ``We trust you to know how to take care of your own \npeople. We want to support you, and help you, and at the same time, \ngive you the flexibility to design your own programs.'' This was one of \nthe clear messages of welfare reform.\n  As one of the members on this side of the aisle who voted for the \n1996 welfare law, I have to say that I truly believe that these Title \nXX cuts will weaken welfare efforts in our states. The Social Services \nBlock Grant is used to provide many important support services that \nhelp complement the efforts of welfare reform in helping individuals go \nto work and continue working--education and training services, \nemployment services, transportation, and child care are all among the \nimportant programs supported by this block grant. Indeed, as part of \nthe welfare reform package that I agreed to, we promised the states \nthat we would maintain funding for Title XX at the $2.38 billion level \nuntil reauthorization in 2002. How can we take back that promise now?\n  You know, one of the greatest features of the Social Services Block \nGrant is its flexibility. States, and even communities, can determine \nhow to best serve their poor, their elderly, their children and their \ndisabled citizens. My state provides an excellent example of this. \nWhile nationally states used an average of 14% of the Title XX block \ngrant for foster care program for abused and neglected children, in \nWest Virginia we use over 30% of our block grant for foster care and \n34% for protective services for abused and neglected children. West \nVirginia cannot afford such a drastic cut in Title XX. It will \nundermine our State's commitment to abused and neglected children just \nwhen tough, new federal time lines are being enforced to move more \nchildren from foster care into safe, permanent homes faster.\n  If we cut this funding by more than half, my state will face enormous \nchallenges in its efforts to keep children safe and stable in their \nhomes and communities. This is intolerable.\n  Nationally, 12% of the Title XX block grant is spent on services for \nthe elderly, including protective services for seniors who are victims \nof abuse and neglect. In West Virginia, 10% of our block grant--a \nlittle over $1.6 million--is spent on these services for seniors. This \nnot only provides them with support and protection, it helps them \nremain in their own homes, rather than being placed in nursing homes or \nother institutions.\n  What message are we sending to our poor, elderly neighbors, if we cut \nthese services in half?\n  As a former Governor, I understand why Governors want the flexibility \nof block grants. But the history of Congress is to push for block \ngrants in the name of ``flexibility'' but then to slowly but surely cut \nthe funding of block grants, leaving states and families in the lurch. \nAs a member who cares deeply about poor children, disabled Americans \nand needy families, I am worried about how such cuts will effect the \nsmall communities and our most vulnerable families.\n  We should not cut these vital funds. There is a unique and strong \ncoalition fighting to protect this vital investment ranging from \ngovernment groups like the National Governors Association and National \nAssociation of Counties, to dedicated service providers like Catholic \nCharities and the United Way. If we believe in community programs and \nthe importance of non-profit charities, how can we justify cuts to \nTitle XX which will hinder their partnership projects?\n  The Social Services Block Grant is not just good for people, it is \nalso good policy. It gives the states flexibility. It helps communities \nto be innovative in taking care of their own by supporting local \npartnerships. It makes sense.\n  These funding cuts undermine many of our priorities. We cannot say we \nwant to invest in children and families, then cut the Title XX Social \nServices Block Grant. This is worse than many of the budget gimmicks in \nthis legislation because cutting Title XX hurts vulnerable families in \ncommunities across America. We should not cut this program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to briefly discuss with my colleague, \nSenator Graham, some language that appeared in the Appropriations \nCommittee Report for the fiscal year 2000 Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations bill. Senator Graham, I understand that the Report \nstates, with regard to the funding reduction in Social Services Block \nGrant program, that ``the States can supplement the block grant amount \nfunds received through the recent settlements with tobacco companies.'' \nSenator Graham, I understand you have seen this language?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes I have, and I thank my colleague from Texas. I must \nsay I was very surprised by this report language, particularly \nconsidering the fact that the Senate only this year voted several times \nand decisively to prevent the federal government from seizing the money \nthe States earned as\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\npart of their tobacco settlements. Legislation that you and I offered \nin the Senate passed overwhelmingly, and amendments to that language to \nforce the states to spend their settlement funds according to a \nspecified formula were soundly rejected.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is an excellent point. In fact, I think it \nshould be pointed out for the Record that, on March 18 of this year, \nthe Senate voted 71 to 29 to protect our States' settlement funds by \ndefeating an amendment that would have directed that states spend at \nleast half of their settlements according to whatever specific list of \nprograms the Secretary of Health and Human Services designated during \nany given year. Thus, the Senate rejected the notion that the federal \ngovernment should have an annual veto over more than $140 billion of \nstate funds. I think it is also worth noting that the Hutchison/Graham \nlegislation we introduced this year to protect these state funds from \nfederal seizure had 47 cosponsors, including substantial bipartisan \nsupport. The legislation was signed into law by the President on May \n21, 1999.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that clarification. Our effort \ncertainly struck an unmistakable blow for states' rights, and I am \npleased and proud that our states and others are now free to use their \nfunds for children's health, health research, smoking control, and the \nmany other health, education, and public welfare programs that they are \npursuing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In fact, I would like to point out that, of the \nroughly $1.8 billion that Texas is spending during the present budget \nbiennium, virtually every dollar is going toward health care. For \nexample, the state is allocating over $200 million for a permanent \nendowment for children's cancer research; $200 million for smoking \ncontrol and research activities; $100 million for emergency and trauma \ncare; $180 million to expand health insurance for low income children; \nand over $1 billion in various permanent endowments for many of our \nstate's public and teaching hospitals. I am proud of what Texas is \ndoing, and I am proud that you and I and so many of our colleagues had \nthe courage to stand-up for the right of our states to pursue those \npriorities and programs that best meet the needs of their residents.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague for her statement, and for her \nleadership in this important area.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the gentleman for his leadership as well, and \nI am glad we had the opportunity to clarify the intent and the will of \nthe Senate in this regard. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager, I move to \ntable the amendment by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, and the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which amendment is the Senator referring?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am referring to the amendment by Senator Graham of \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment or the first-\ndegree amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. To clarify the motion, I apologize, I did not realize \nit was a second degree. The motion I have just made would be to the \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous \nconsent that will explain what the remainder of the evening will be. We \nare waiting for the other side to sign off.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside in order for Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut to offer his amendment and that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order to the Dodd amendment prior to a vote on a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will pause for one moment, I think what \nwe are close to doing is having about four votes that would occur at \naround 5:15. So Senators can be on notice. We need to get one more sign \noff on that matter before we officially announce it. But that is the \nintent of the managers of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1813\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for activities carried out under the \n          Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  I call up amendment No. 1813\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. Murray, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1813.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the matter under the heading ``payments to states for \n     the child care and development block grant'' in the matter \n     under the heading ``Administration for Children and \n     Families'' in title II, strike ``$1,182,672,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, \nSenator Levin, and others.\n  Let me begin these remarks by apologizing to my colleagues who, once \nagain, are being asked to vote on a child care amendment. The obvious \nquestion raised is, Why am I voting on this for the third or fourth \ntime? The simple reason is--and I appreciate the votes. We have had \ngood votes in the Senate, and strong bipartisan votes on this issue. \nBut for a variety of reasons, which I will not take the time of this \nbody to go into, the matter has been dropped in conference, or bills \nhave died, or for other reasons. So despite the good and strong and \npositive efforts on behalf of Members of the Senate, we have not been \nable to adopt the language on child care that my colleagues, by \noverwhelming votes, have adopted already in these past 10 months.\n  Again, Senator Jeffords, myself, and Senator Snowe are proposing this \namendment. It is somewhat different than the other ones in this regard \nonly. Earlier, amendments dealing with the child care proposal actually \nhad mandatory spending in them. This is discretionary spending. In \nfact, the amendment I am offering--properly the credit goes to Senator \nChafee of Rhode Island, who has been a champion on child care issues. \nThis amendment is basically the Chafee amendment on child care that we \nthink is deserving of our support on a bipartisan basis.\n  By increasing margins, as I have indicated, this body has supported \nadditional funding for the child care block grant. The first vote we \nhad was 57-43, the second vote was 60-33, and by the third vote it was \nunanimously adopted.\n  I apologize again at the outset for asking my colleagues, once again, \nto cast a child care vote since you think you have done so, and already \nyou have. But basically our opportunity to provide some additional \nfunding is still the same. The arguments have not changed. The bill \nhasn't changed, except this is discretionary and not mandatory, and \nobviously the need across our country has not changed over the last \nnumber of months.\n  I will take a few minutes. We have a very short time agreement on \nthis amendment. We have debated it extensively over the past year. I \ndon't want\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nto take any more of this Chamber's time than is necessary on this \namendment.\n  But the amendment would increase child care assistance to working \nfamilies by doubling the discretionary fund in the child care \ndevelopment block grant from $1 billion to $2 billion.\n  I continue to believe the best place for a child to be is with their \nparents. That is the best place--no question about it. But when both \nparents are working--as many do in this country, trying to put food on \nthe table, a roof over their children's heads--that is difficult. When \nthere is only one parent--regretfully, that happens too often in our \nsociety--you can imagine the burdens on a single parent who has to work \nand also has young children and trying to provide for child care needs.\n  So the reality is that good, affordable child care is a necessity. In \nthe absence of parental care, we try to do the best we can to \napproximate the kind of care that parents would give.\n  That is what this amendment is all about.\n  The child care block grant is almost a decade old. My good friend and \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and I authored the child care block \ngrant almost a decade ago. It won support and the signature of \nPresident Bush who signed the legislation into law, and it has provided \na lot of decent assistance to people over the years.\n\n  It provides direct financial assistance to help families pay for \nchild care and does not dictate where that care must be provided. \nParents across this country can choose a child care center as the child \ncare provider. They can choose a home-based provider, a neighbor, a \nchurch, a relative, or whatever they think is best for that child. We \nleave that entirely up to the parents to make that decision.\n  This block grant is also the largest source of Federal funding for \ncritical afterschool programs.\n  Again, we all appreciate, I think, the growing need for afterschool \ncare.\n  I point out to my colleagues that 30 percent of the child care block \ngrant is used by parents to pay for care to school-age children. That \ntranslates into almost $1 billion a year.\n  That is a major, major source of assistance to parents who worry \nabout who is watching their children after school in State after State \nacross our country.\n  The only downside to this now almost decade-old program is that it \nhas been underfunded because of the lack of resources. The Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act is available only to 1 in 10 eligible \nfamilies in America today.\n  Despite all the efforts over the years--and I appreciate the votes \nand the support we have received--still only one 1 in 10 eligible \nfamilies get any assistance under this program.\n  Because of a lack of resources States have been getting under the \nblock grant--it goes to the States--States have had to severely ration \nchild care assistance to families in need.\n  So what States have done is they create a threshold, a dollar \nthreshold, an income threshold. They say that anybody above that \nthreshold cannot get the child care development block grant assistance. \nThey have lowered the threshold--that is all the time--because the \nscarce dollars mean that they can only provide it to some families.\n  Let me explain what I mean.\n  Two-thirds of all of the States in the United States have cut this \nchild care assistance to families earning under $25,000 a year--two-\nthirds of all the States. Fourteen of those States have cut off all \nassistance to families earning over $20,000 a year, and eight States \neven ration the funds more stringently.\n  In the States of Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa South \nCarolina, and West Virginia, if you are a family earning in excess of \n$17,000, you get no child care assistance.\n  I don't know how a family making $17,000 a year trying to work--this \nis a working family; I am not talking about somebody getting welfare. \nThese are working people. If you are a working mother, and you have a \n$17,000-a-year income, you have two children, you do not have child \ncare. I am sorry. You don't. You may be lucky and have a grandmother, \naunt, or next-door neighbor, and probably juggling it every day. But if \nyou are in those eight States, even in one of those 22 States, and make \n$20,000 or less, I don't know how people do it.\n  That is because we have underfunded for the block grant. I am not \ngoing to be able to take care of everybody. Senator Jeffords, Senator \nSnowe, I, and others who have supported these amendments know we are \nnot going to make a difference for every family. But if we can get a \nlittle more money by doubling this amendment from $1 billion to $2 \nbillion in this discretionary program, maybe these States--we think \nthey will--will raise those threshold levels, and as a result, more \nfamilies in these States will get that kind of good child care \nassistance that they need.\n\n  Let me tell you how bad this problem is. Even with these stringent \nincome eligibility requirements that I have just enumerated, consider \nthe waiting list that exists across America. I will not recite all 50 \nStates.\n  Let me tell you for almost every State that we have, the numbers are \nhigh.\n  In California, there are 200,000 children waiting for a child care \nslot, even with the income levels as low as they are.\n  So even when you have an income level of $17,000 or lower to get \nchild care, or $20,000 or lower, there are 200,000 children in those \nStates whose parents qualify financially. They are earning less than \n$20,000. But because there are so few funds, 200,000 are on a waiting \nlist.\n  Texas, 34,000; Massachusetts, 15,000; Pennsylvania, almost 13,000; \nAlabama, 19,000; Georgia, in excess of 12,000.\n  The list goes on.\n  These are families that are meeting those income criteria. But even \nwith the income criteria, there are not enough dollars to go around to \nprovide child care to these families.\n  There is a waiting list even with these low-income levels.\n  Other States ration their limited child care dollars by paying child \ncare providers poverty level wages.\n  That is hardly the way to ensure good, quality child care. Again, the \nlowest paid teachers in America are child care providers.\n\n  What a great irony. I don't think anyone argues we probably ought to \nhave the best prepared teachers for the most vulnerable of our \nsociety--kids. A case could be made, I suppose, that someone in a \nhigher education institution needed less care. But imagine a 6-month-\nold baby and the person who watches that 6-month-old, 1-year-old child \nis one of the lowest paid workers.\n  I am urging my colleagues to adopt this amendment so we can raise \nsome of the income levels, we can get a few more dollars to the child \ncare providers who are so necessary, and we can also see if we cannot \nhelp our Governors raise some of the income levels.\n  We have voted on this now three times. I am deeply apologetic to my \ncolleagues. I have had unanimous support for this amendment as recently \nas a few months ago. Because of bills dying or being dropped in \nconference, we are back at it again. I apologize for taking the time of \nmy colleagues on this amendment that Senator Jeffords and I have \noffered. We cannot let this issue go away. It is too important to too \nmany families.\n  I thank publicly Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Campbell of \nColorado, Senator Chafee, Senator Collins, Senator DeWine, Senator \nFrist, Senator Hatch, Senator Jeffords, Senator Roberts, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Specter, Senator Warner, and more. I will not read the entire \nlist of Republican colleagues who have been supportive of this \namendment. The Senators have made a difference voting for this. I thank \nthe Senators for their support.\n  The votes I had then were for the mandatory program. This is \ndiscretionary funding. It is substantially different. Some in the past \nmay have said vote for this, it is mandatory; this is a discretionary \nprogram. Obviously, we are dealing with Senator Specter's bill. It is \ndifferent in that regard, probably less of a problem politically for \nsome.\n  I am deeply grateful for the strong bipartisan support and I am \nconfident we will have support again this afternoon on this issue which \nhas developed strong bipartisan interest in this body.\n  My principal cosponsor from Vermont is here. I want to make sure he \nhas some time to talk about this.\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a time agreement \nbe entered into, with 10 additional minutes for the proponents of the \namendment, and 15 minutes for myself and whomever I designate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my good friend from Connecticut. \nWe have been working for years to draw the attention of the public to \nthe essential need that we pay more attention and provide help in the \nchild care area. Each year we get the support of our Members. Each year \nwe have successfully gotten agreements for billions of dollars of the \nbudget, but the time is now to do something real. That is why we are \nhere, to make sure we make a commitment, not only make a commitment but \nprovide the funds to enable our society to be able to take advantage of \nall that can be done to make sure our children have an opportunity to \nparticipate in the best possible way in our society.\n  This amendment will almost double the funds that provide low-income \nworking families with the help they need. The amendment increases \nfunding for the child care and development block grant from about $1.83 \nbillion to $2 billion. This block grant has always been forward funded \nso no offset will be required. States are struggling to meet the \nescalating child care needs of low-income families, and they are \ntransitioning off of welfare. States have already transferred $1.2 \nbillion in TANF funds into the child development block grant; other \nStates use TANF dollars directly to pay for child care costs; while \nstill others have spent all of their TANF funds and have nothing left \nto transfer.\n  Still this is not enough. States have waiting lists for child care \nsubsidies provided under the CCDBG. In addition, many States provide \nsubsidies so low-income families are forced into the cheapest and in \nmany cases the poorest quality child care.\n  There are more than 12 million children under the age of 5, including \nhalf of all infants under 1 year of age, who spend at least part of the \nday being cared for by someone other than their parents. There are \nmillions more school-age children under the age of 12 who are in some \nform of child care at the beginning or end of the school day as well as \nduring school holidays and vacation. More 6-to-12-year-olds who are \nlatchkey kids return home from school to no supervision because parents \nare working and there are few, if any, alternatives.\n  While the supply of child care has increased over the past 10 years, \nthere are still significant shortages for parents in rural areas with \nschool-age children or infants and for lower income families. The cost \nof child care for lower middle-income families can rival the cost of \nhousing and the cost of food. The most critical growth spurt is between \nbirth and 10 years of age, precisely the time when nonparental child \ncare is most frequently utilized.\n  A Time magazine special report on ``How a Child Brain Develops'' from \nFebruary 3, 1997, said it best:\n\n       Good, affordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe \n     benefit for welfare mothers and working parents but essential \n     brain food for the next generation.\n\n  The Senate has voted on and passed similar amendments three times \nthis year. There were two votes on the budget resolution, and a \nmodified version of the amendments was included in the conference \nreport. Again, in July, Senator Dodd and I introduced a similar \namendment through the tax bill which was subsequently dropped in \nconference. Hopefully, this fourth time will be the charm and the \nSenate will pass this amendment and retain it in conference.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment which is so critical \nfor low-income working families and their children.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I thank so many of \nour Republican friends who worked with us on a bipartisan basis. I \nthank the manager, my good friend from Pennsylvania. We have been \ntogether many years. We both first arrived in this Chamber and we \nworked so closely together back 20 years ago, in 1981, on a caucus for \nchildren. It seems like a long time ago. Senator Specter, on numerous \noccasions, has been a real stalwart battler and fighter on behalf of \nthe Child Care Block Grant Program. I am deeply grateful to him for his \nsupport on that.\n  Senator Johnson desires to be added as a cosponsor.\n  I know my colleague from Pennsylvania wants to be heard on this. I \nthank my colleague from Vermont and I thank my colleague from Maine. I \nthank Senator Chafee who has been a champion on this issue.\n  The mandatory bill is gone and we are down to the discretionary bill. \nI apologize, I say to the manager. I know Members think we vote on this \nissue every other day, but each time we have been dropped in conference \ndespite unanimous votes in the Senate on this issue. I hope, as the \nSenator from Vermont has said, the fourth time may be a charm and we \nwill be able to provide some additional funds on a very worthwhile and \nneeded program.\n\n  I, again, thank my colleague for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the discussion of \nthe amendment on the merits, I would like to announce to my colleagues \nwe will shortly begin voting on four stacked votes: the Reid amendment, \nGraham amendment, Dodd amendment, and the Coverdell second-degree \namendment to the Enzi amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent we begin voting on these matters at 5:10.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, it is my \nunderstanding there will be 1 minute on each side to explain the \namendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I incorporate that into the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. And the Reid amendment will be the first amendment we will \nvote on?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Has all time elapsed for Senator Dodd?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Connecticut has 10 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The unanimous consent agreement gave him 10 minutes \ntotal. Since that time, Senator Jeffords has spoken and Senator Dodd \nhas spoken.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague yields, we will yield back whatever time we \nhave. I realize he is trying to move things along.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am trying to find out what is happening with the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont was \ncharged to him, and he yielded back his time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the remaining time between now and 5:10 on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are presently 8 minutes 35 seconds \nremaining for the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And the other time has been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And 10 minutes remaining----\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back all time except 1 minute to sum up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I find it extremely difficult to speak to \nand vote on this amendment because I have supported this amendment on \nso many occasions. Senator Dodd accurately relates, when we were \nelected in 1980, we cochaired the Children's Caucus. Then, in 1987, \nafter we were reelected, we were cosponsors of the first parental leave \nprogram which had just begun. We have been soldiers in the field. I \nhave voted for this amendment again and again and again. But I am \ndeeply concerned if we agree to this amendment at this time and add \nanother $900 million to the current bill of $91.7 billion, we are not \ngoing to have any bill at all. We are not going to get 51 votes in this \nChamber to pass this bill and to go to conference. I say that because \nof the deep-seated concerns which have\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nbeen expressed by so many Senators about where we are.\n  We have a bill at $91.7 billion which is within the budget caps. We \nhave to go to conference with the House. We have to present a bill \nwhich the President will sign. I do not believe we will be able to do \nthat if we add $900 million more.\n  I can count the number of cosponsors which the persuasive Senator \nDodd has. It may be he will have enough sponsors to defeat a tabling \nmotion. I think next Tuesday, when Republican Senators return, on the \nvote on the underlying merits it may be different, although I very much \nwould like to support him. We have been very concerned about children \nin this bill. We increased the child care block grant $182 million for \nfiscal year 2000, which brings it to $1.182 billion. Senator Dodd would \nlike to have it added to $2 billion, and so would I, if I thought we \ncould get that bill passed. This $1.182 billion is in addition to the \nchild care entitlement which was increased $200 million, to $2.367 \nbillion next year. So we have on child care more than $3.5 billion.\n  In addition, States can transfer up to 30 percent, or $4.8 billion, \nof their temporary assistance to needy families, the so-called TANF \nblock grants, to the child care block grant. At the end of the first \nquarter of fiscal year 1999, States had $4.220 billion in unobligated \nTANF balances.\n  So there have been very substantial allocations for children. I might \nsay, this is an especially tough vote for me because earlier today, my \ndaughter-in-law, Tracey Specter, took the lead in establishing a child \ncare center in Philadelphia where she and her husband, my son, Shanin \nSpecter, have made a very generous contribution for child care. I know \nof the importance of child care so working mothers can provide needed \nassistance for their families in an era of two-wage-earner families and \nin an era of single mothers. I know how vital child care is. But this \nis going to be the log that breaks the camel's back. I think the camel \nnow is burdened so that a straw would break the camel's back, but this \nis not a straw, this is a log.\n  I do not know quite where we are going to be when final passage comes \non this bill and we do not have 51 votes. So it is a longstanding \npartnership I have with the Senator from Connecticut, elected on the \nsame day to this body, worked hand in glove, almost as longstanding a \nrelationship as with Senator Jeffords. Usually Senator Jeffords says, \n``Jump,'' and I say, ``How high?'' on matters which he has in mind. But \nit is with the greatest reluctance that I say I cannot support this \namendment, much as I would like to, for the reasons I have given.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator has 3 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me yield a minute or so to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's very gracious comments on this, \nand I appreciate the burden he is under. It is not easy to be the \nchairman of a committee. You have responsibilities to meet and you have \na lot of good requests that come your way.\n  I would make the case to my colleagues, I think there has been a \nstrong indication this is a matter in which we have been able to come \ntogether. We were so divided on so many issues, but on child care we \nfound common ground three times already in the last 7 or 8 months, the \nthree votes that have been cast on this issue. In fact, the previous \nones were on mandatory spending. This one is discretionary, so it ought \nto be somewhat more palatable for people.\n\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania on how \nmuch is already committed. But, of course, I still make the case it \nstill only serves 1 in 10 families--I know he knows--and there are a \nlot of people on waiting lists, thousands in each State, even with the \nincome levels down. As I said, in 8 States it is $17,000 less; in 14 \nStates, it is $20,000 less. I don't know how a family earning $20,000 a \nyear with all the other financial burdens they have also can meet a \nchild care expense they may have.\n  So while I am deeply appreciative of the quandary he is in, I make a \ncase this strengthens the likelihood we might get 51 votes for the \nbill. It is the kind of bipartisan proposal that has enjoyed so much \nsupport. It was unanimously adopted only a few weeks ago, so that it \nmight, in fact, bring some people who would feel otherwise disinclined \nto support the legislation, but doing something, as he properly points \nout, for working families--it is all working folks now--trying to make \nends meet, hold their families together. I know he knows this. I know \nhe cares about it deeply.\n  I hope in the coming minutes before the vote occurs on this, while \npeople may have voted one way on a variety of different bills, on this \none, this amendment, they might say: On this one, we ought to, with \nforward funding, find that extra $900 million so we can make a \ndifference for these families.\n  I am deeply appreciative of his kind words and his continuing efforts \nand fight. I was going to facetiously suggest, since his wonderful \ndaughter-in-law and son went into the business, maybe the chairman \nmight have to recuse himself on the vote since he may be compelled to \nvote to table. I say that only facetiously.\n  I am delighted his daughter-in-law and son have felt the need to be \ninvolved in the issue, and I am not surprised, knowing the Senator and \nhis spouse, that their children would want to carry on this terrific \ntradition they have started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for those generous \ncomments. He is almost pervasive enough to get me to change my mind, \nbut passage of this bill is more important.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the first rollcall \nvote, which is 15 minutes in accordance with our practice, with a 5-\nminute leeway, that the subsequent votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with great reluctance, I move to table \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1820\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to table the Reid amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if Members of the Senate have enjoyed and \nappreciated ``Prairie Home Companion,'' the great work of Ken Burns' \n``Civil War,'' ``Baseball''--and now he is doing a new one on Susan B. \nAnthony and Liz Stanton dealing with the women's movement--and if they \nhave enjoyed with their children ``Sesame Street,'' which is Big Bird \nand Elmo, then every person in the Senate should support my amendment.\n  We want to keep public broadcasting public and not commercial \nbroadcasting. We do not want it, like most everything else in America, \nto be commercialized. Our children and the rest of America at least \ndeserve this much from their Congress.\n  This amendment cries out for support. This is an education and labor \nbill, and I underline education. There is nothing more important as it \nrelates to education than having a sound public broadcasting function \nof our Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with reluctance, again, that I am \ncompelled to oppose the Reid amendment. I like public broadcasting, but \nthis bill has been crafted with some 300 programs. Public broadcasting \nis getting a $10 million increase. This is in the face of some very \nsubstantial problems which were raised with public broadcasting on the \nsale of lists to political organizations. Public broadcasting is very \nimportant, and with tight budget constraints, I think $350 million is \nan adequate allocation.\n  I must say, as the Senator from Nevada mentioned ``Sesame Street,'' \nagain, it is a family matter. My three granddaughters are mad about \n``Sesame Street.'' On goes the television, and their behavior is a \nmodel.\n  This budget can only stretch so far. It is crafted for more than 300 \nprograms. The better course is to take the\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\n$10 million increase, and $350 million is sufficient.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is there a tabling motion pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1820. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack), the Senator from Rhodes Island \n(Mr. Chafee), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine), and the Senator from \nWyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      {Rollcall Vote No. 301 Leg.}\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Chafee\n     DeWine\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Thomas\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to table the Graham amendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our staff tells me that we now have 62 \namendments pending to this bill. That means we are going to be here an \nawful long time on this bill. I think I am going to request that the \nleader initiate a weekend session if we are going to get this bill \npassed.\n  We had this bill out of committee with the hopes that we could get it \npassed today at the end of the fiscal year so we could once again get \nback to the habit of passing all the bills in the Senate that come from \nthe Appropriations Committee by the end of the fiscal year at least.\n  I hope Senators will tell us seriously how many of these amendments \nthey intend to call up. There are 41 on that side of the aisle and 21 \non this side of the aisle. Most of them are riders, and if you put them \non the bill, we will drop them in conference anyway. Beyond that, those \namendments that take money, you have to take money from some other \nSenator to get them passed.\n  Let's not play games with this bill. It is the last bill. It is the \nbiggest bill. This is the largest bill. Two-thirds of this bill is not \neven subject to our control. Two-thirds of the bill is entitlements. I \nhope we will start watching those entitlement bills and understand it \nis a very hard bill to put together.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nIowa for their handling of the bill. But I plead with you to tell us \nwhich of these amendments you really want to call up.\n  I see my good friend from Nevada. He doesn't have on the right tie \ntoday. But he is a man who believes, as I do, that bills should move \nforward as rapidly as we can move them. I hope I have his help in \nurging Senators to tell us which of these amendments you really want \nconsidered by the Senate and give us a time agreement on them so we \nknow how long it will take before we finish this bill.\n  Does the Senator wish the floor?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska that the \nmanagers of the bill on our side have suggested maybe we should drop \nyour amendments and our amendments. Would the Senator be willing to do \nthat?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to move to table them all and go to \nconference tonight.\n  Mr. REID. That is something we were talking about over here.\n  I say to the chairman of the full committee that we have already \nlooked at these amendments. A number of Members on this side are \nwaiting to see what amendments are being offered on the other side. \nThere are a couple of amendments that are going to cause this bill a \nreally slow ride through these Halls. One is on ergonomics, which is a \nreal problem; we have a dozen or so Senators who want to speak in \nrelation to that amendment.\n  So I think a lot depends on what amendments are offered on the \nmajority side to see how we can weed out some of these amendments over \nhere.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Parliamentarian to look at all \nof the amendments and see which of them are subject to rule XVI. I \nintend to raise rule XVI against any amendment I can raise it against.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1821\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are talking about one of those \nentitlement issues Senator Stevens just described.\n  The Finance Committee of the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee \nof the House established the funding level for title XX of the SSBG of \ntheir bill at $2.38 billion. The appropriators have reduced that amount \nto $1.50 billion, a cut of over 50 percent. This violates a commitment \nthe Congress made with the Governors in 1996 as part of the welfare-to-\nwork legislation. Therefore, the Governors are opposing the position \nthe committee has taken.\n  This is a backdoor violation of the commitment that 71 Senators made \nwhen we voted against having the Federal Government direct how the \nStates' tobacco settlement was spent.\n  Why is this? Because the way in which the subcommittee recommends we \nmake up this difference is to direct the States to use their tobacco \nmoney to fill this gap. Seventy-one Members of the Senate--48 \nRepublicans and 23 Democrats--voted in March of this year to do exactly \nthe opposite of what we are now being asked to do.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of honor of the Senate and our \ncommitment to our partners in the Federal system, the States.\n  I urge that this motion to table be defeated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as much as I have always favored the \nsocial services block grant program, the funding level in this bill is \nestablished as a matter of priority.\n  If we want to add to education $2.3 billion, significant additions to \nthe National Institutes of Health, and crafting some 300 programs, this \nis the level which is appropriate. The States can transfer up to 5 \npercent of their temporary assistance to needy families in this program \nthrough these block grants, which amounts to $16.5 billion. Mr. \nPresident, $825 million are available there.\n  At the close of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 States had \n$4.22 billion, so it can be made up. People may not want to consider \nthe tobacco funds, but the States have about $203 billion which has \nbeen given to them, where the argument was it should have come to the \nFederal Government to support these block grant programs.\n  If we are to pass this bill, if we are to get 51 votes, $91.7 \nbillion, we can't add additional funds with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). All time has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to table the amendment No. 1821. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain),\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nChafee), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 302 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Chafee\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Thomas\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that the underlying amendment, as \namended, be voice voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to dispose of this matter now.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is 2 minutes equally divided \non the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think I had asked for the yeas and nays \non the underlying amendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A sufficient second has not been obtained. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is there are now 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Dodd amendment.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that this \namendment violates the Budget Act in that it exceeds the 302(b) \nallocations of the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is against the Dodd \namendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Dodd amendment would increase the amount under this \nchild care development block grant. This bill is at its ceiling now. \nThere is no additional money. I was told at first that it was written \nso it would apply to 2001. That is not the case.\n  The amendment is not subject to amendment, as I understand it, under \nthe procedure we are under right now and cannot be cured, and I make \nthe point of order that it violates the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the rule, the point of order is not in \norder until the time is expired--the motion to table has been made--and \nbeen disposed of. The regular order calls for 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. When I came in, I understood one \nof the sponsors had urged the adoption of this amendment; isn't that \nso?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table and \nthat takes priority over the point of order. The point of order will be \nin order when the debate on the motion to table has expired and the \nvote has taken place.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, this is an amendment we have voted \non--this is the fourth time in the last 7 months. I thank my colleagues \nfor the bipartisan support that the Dodd-Jeffords-Snowe and others \namendment has been given. Unfortunately, it has been dropped in \nconference in the past so it has not been adopted.\n  It was adopted unanimously by this body only a few weeks ago. Prior \nto that, it was a 66-33 vote. Unlike the previous votes, this is \ndiscretionary funding, not mandatory funding. It tries to deal with the \nissue of child care, something about which we all care.\n  We now know today that 1 in 10 families is struggling to make ends \nmeet. They are the poorest families in America and are working every \nday and not on public assistance. Today, in 25 States, if you earn more \nthan $20,000, you do not qualify for child care assistance.\n  I don't know how a family of four, earning $20,000 a year, with young \nchildren--where the parents are working, where they need to place these \nchildren in a safe place during the day--can afford that without some \nhelp.\n  For 10 years now, since Senator Hatch and I sponsored the child care \ndevelopment block grant that was adopted, this Congress has supported a \nchild care program.\n  Today, we want to serve more than just the 1 in 10 that is being \nserved. This amendment does that. My colleagues have voted for it in \nthe past. I urge my colleagues to do so again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in order to save time, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor, \nunder the regular order, for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We will be voting on the motion to table. At that point, \nthe point of order will lie. All we are going to do is cost every \nSenator 15 or 20 minutes. It will not change anything.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, there is obviously a different vote \ncount on the tabling motion than there is on a point of order. I would \nargue the point of order, but I am hoping----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reluctantly, I am opposed to the \namendment, which would add some $900 million to this bill. There have \nbeen substantial increases on child care and on child care entitlement. \nIf we have $900 million added to this bill--which is now at $91.7 \nbillion--it is the log that breaks the camel's back. I think it is a \nvery good program, but in establishing priorities, we have already \nallocated very substantial funds to this line. Therefore, I am opposed \nto the amendment and I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed just 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to correct my statement. This does amend a \nsection in this bill, which is advance funding, and it is, therefore, \nnot subject to the point of order I would have made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is on agreeing to the motion\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nto table amendment No. 1813. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

May I inquire, when will it \nbe in order for me to make my points of order against those amendments \nthat violate rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments would have to be pending before \nthe point of order would be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will leave on the desk a list of the \namendments that have been found to violate rule XVI.\n  May I make a further parliamentary inquiry. Under the new rule XVI, \nthe Parliamentarian's rule cannot be waived; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no provision to waive rule XVI.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to leave this on my desk and ask Members to \nsee if their amendments are within this category. If they wish to \nwithdraw them, of course, I will not make a motion to table them. I \nthink that would be the easiest way to dispose of them--to have Members \nwithdraw their amendments. But I do intend to make a point of order \nunder rule XVI against some 23 amendments before the evening is over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on this amendment on which we are about to \nvote, we have given an increase to OSHA for the work they do. What I am \nasking is that we continue to recognize there are parts of those that \ngo in hand in hand. One of the parts is enforcement. The other is \nconsultation.\n  There are 1,275 pages of OSHA that every business has to follow. They \nneed the consultation to be able to wade through that. They need \nsomebody they can ask to be able to get answers.\n  I have taken the increase in OSHA and given some recognition that \nconsultation ought to be a part of that. Consultation will help. I \ndon't know that they will spend it that way. We don't have any really \ngood oversight to see that. But it is the trend we have to follow. \nSixty-six percent of their money goes to enforcement and 30 percent \ngoes to consultation. I am asking you to split this money in \nrecognition between the two so that kind of an emphasis will continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the bill in its present form has \nthe appropriate balance between conciliation and enforcement. In the \nlast 5 years, enforcement has declined $3 million, from $145 million to \n$142 million; conciliation has grown from $3l.5 million to almost $41 \nmillion, an increase of 30 percent.\n  I think the bill as written is proper. I might add that it does not \nunduly prejudice the case on the merits, and if the Enzi amendment is \nnot tabled under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator Wellstone has \nleave to file a second-degree amendment with 15 minutes to argue it, to \nbe followed by another rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table amendment No. 1885. On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Mack), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 304 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\n\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Chafee\n     Kennedy\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Thomas\n  The motion to table was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent I be notified if any \nof those amendments on the list at the desk are called up.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, would the \nchairman mind if somebody else initiated the point of order? He would \nnot have to be here if somebody else did it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure the distinguished whip that I will be here. But \nin the event I am not here, I have not asked that I be the one to have \nthe exclusive right to make a point of order. I only asked I be \nnotified if it is called up. In effect, I am serving notice if you call \nup that amendment, I will make the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, what is the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is the Senator be notified if any \nof those amendments are called up that violate rule XVI.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't mind that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the Enzi \namendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1885) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for the information of my colleague, I \nwas so overwhelmed with this past vote, I was so moved by this past \nvote to give me an opportunity to speak even more on the floor of the \nSenate, that I am now going to vitiate that part of the unanimous \nconsent agreement to have a vote on this second-degree amendment so \ncolleagues could leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1846) was agreed to.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin for their dedicated work on this legislation which \nprovides federal funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices (HHS), and Education. This appropriations bill provides \nfunding for many critical programs directly helping American families \nand providing important assistance to our most important resource, our \nchildren.\n  One of the most important components in this bill is its vital \nsupport for education. We owe it to each and every child to ensure that \nthey have access to a high quality education. This is why I am pleased \nthat this bill increases funding for Department of Education to almost \n$38 billion, including nearly $6 billion for educating children with \nspecial needs and $5.2 billion for the Head Start program.\n  I am also pleased to note that this bill prohibits federally funded \nnational education standards. It continues to be my strong belief that \nour nation must have higher learning expectations for our children but \nacademic standards must be controlled by state and local authorities, \nnot the bureaucrats in Washington.\n  This bill contains important resources for helping make college and \ncontinuing education more affordable for all Americans. Under this \nbill, the maximum loan amount for post-secondary education would be the \nhighest level in the program's history--$3,325 per student. In \naddition, this legislation provides $1.4 billion for higher education \nopportunities, including $180 million for GEAR UP which assists under-\nprivileged children and $5 million to provide access to affordable \nchild care for parents struggling to complete their college education \nwhile raising their children.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill provides significant funding \nfor medical research at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, $17.6 \nbillion, which is an increase of $2 billion from last year. I am sure \nthat my colleagues share my support for this 13 percent increase in \nfunding for vital research which could lead to important scientific \nbreakthroughs which will improve the health of our citizens. Finally, I \nam encouraged to note that this bill took an important step towards \nmeeting the needs of over 7,000 children and families whose lives have \nbeen devastated by hemophilia-related AIDS, by beginning to fund the \nRicky Ray Act as authorized by Congress last year.\n  Furthermore, I was pleased to learn that the sections allocating \nfunding for Labor, HHS and Education were free of direct earmarks, set \nasides or unauthorized appropriations. However, my initial enthusiasm \nwas dampened somewhat upon reviewing the report language. While the \nCommittee made a concerted effort to not include any specific \nearmarking in those Departments' budgets, the report contains an \nexorbitant amount of directive language that is clearly intended \nto have the same effect as an earmark. By this, I mean the use of words \nlike ``encourage'', ``urge'', and ``recommend'' in connection with \nreferences to particular institutions, projects, or proposals that the \nCommittee would obviously like the relevant agencies to fund.\n\n  These are not direct earmarks, but I am sure the programs which the \nCommittee ``encourages'' or ``urges'' the agencies to support will \nreceive special consideration. While the Committee avoided providing a \nline item for funding specific projects, it stated its strong \npreference for the funding or continued funding of many specific \nprojects which would clearly bypass the competitive funding process.\n  I will highlight a few examples of report language that contain a \nmultitude of expressions of support, short of earmarks, for particular \nprojects. These include:\n  The Committee urges the Department of Labor to give full and fair \nconsideration to funding requests submitted by the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania to retrain incumbent workers.\n  The Committee encourages the Department of Labor to support \nagricultural training for dislocated sugarcane workers in Hawaii.\n  The Committee recommends continued support by the Department of Labor \nfor the Alaska Federation of Natives Foundation to develop and train \nAlaska native workers for year-round employment within the petroleum \nindustry.\n  The Committee encourages the agency to contribute technical \nassistance to the University of Nevada at Reno and Las Vegas toward the \nestablishment of educational channels for a school of pharmacy.\n  The Committee stated its awareness of the San Bernardino County \nMedical Center proposal to create a ``hospital without walls.'' In \naddition, the Committee notes that the Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is \nproposing the creation and implementation of a Northern California \nTelemedicine Network.\n  The Committee is aware of a proposal by the Montana State University-\nBillings to develop in collaboration with\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nmedical facilities in the area a telemedicine program to provide \npreventive medicine and support services to the large elderly \npopulation in Billings and eastern Montana.\n  The Committee continues to be supportive of the work being conducted \nby the Low Country Health Care Systems.\n  The Committee encourages priority be given to the University of \nHawaii at Hilo Native Language College when allocating funds for native \nHawaiian education.\n  The Committee is concerned about the absence of technology \nintegration in the north central communities of Pennsylvania. The \ncommittee notes the efforts of the Lock Haven University of \nPennsylvania for its development of two regional networks to link these \nrural communities.\n  Mr. President, I could continue listing the specific projects, which \nthe report highlights and for which the Committee provides \nencouragement for continued or new funding, but I will not waste the \nSenate's valuable time. Due to its length, the list I compiled of \nobjectionable provisions included in the Senate report cannot be \nprinted in the Record. This list will be available on my Senate \nwebsite.\n  It is simply inappropriate that the committee is attempting to \ninfluence the open, competitive funding process, thereby limiting the \nfunds available to workers, schools, hospitals, and communities around \nthe country which are not fortunate enough to live in a State with a \nSenator on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a very important \nsubject. I am referring to teen smoking.\n  Currently, teen smoking rates are far too high and they continue to \nrise. Since I left the Missouri Governor's office, teen smoking in \nMissouri has increased from 32.6% to 40.3%--almost a 24% increase! In \nfact, today, Missouri ranks sixth in the nation in teen smoking.\n  While there is disagreement in this body on where teen smoking \npolicies should be set--at the federal or state level--we all agree \nthat it must be addressed.\n  Seven years ago, in an attempt to tackle this problem, the United \nStates Congress passed what is now known as the Synar Amendment. This \namendment required the states to meet specified targets in reducing \nteen access to cigarettes. It did not tell the States how to meet the \ntargets but just that they had to meet them.\n  I believe, as I argued during the debate on the Federal tobacco tax \nlegislation, that States are in the best position to tackle the serious \nproblem of teen smoking. Governors, state legislatures, mayors, and \ncity councils know how to target their programs. They know how to \ntailor educational programs for the local schools and communities. They \nhave better access to convenience store owners and other retail \nestablishments where teens buy cigarettes.\n  With that in mind, I am deeply troubled about our current situation.\n  Mr. President. Today, there are seven states and the District of \nColumbia who failed to meet their targets to reduce teen access to \ncigarettes. They have failed the state's teens and their parents. In \naddition, since their failure triggered a cut in federal block grant \nfunds of 40%, they have failed those who need treatment for drug abuse \nand addiction under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA).\n  I guess we could be optimists and focus on the fact that 43 states \ndid meet their targets. Forty-three states that made it a priority to \ncut teen smoking have succeeded. Forty-three states worked with local \ncommunities and found a way to reduce teen smoking. Therefore, 86% of \nthe states met their goals--shouldn't we be pleased by that?\n  Unfortunately I cannot be an optimist today. For one of those seven \nstates who failed to meet the target was the State of Missouri. This is \nan important issue to me. As Governor of the State of Missouri, I \nsigned the law that now makes it illegal to sell minors tobacco.\n  Under the federal law, the State of Missouri had to make sure that no \nmore than 28% of teens who attempted to purchase cigarettes were \nsuccessful. That seems reasonable--however, the actual success rate was \n33%. That means that in one out of every three minors attempting to buy \ncigarettes was successful. One out of Three!\n  Due to this failure, the State of Missouri is set to lose $9.6 \nmillion to be used for drug addiction treatment. That is $9.6 million \nto be used to help drug addicted pregnant women, to reduce teen drug \nuse, and to provide treatment to those whose lives have been destroyed \nby a lifetime of drug use.\n  In this discussion, it is important to recognize that we have given \nthe states the tools they need to fight teen smoking. We rejected the \nmammoth--bureaucracy and tax laden--tobacco bill. I led the fight \nagainst that bill. By defeating that bill, we made sure the tobacco \nmoney went to the states for tobacco prevention programs--and was not \nwasted on federal bureaucracy--on the 17 new boards, commissions, and \nagencies established in the bill.\n  By defeating that bill, the states got the money rather than \nWashington. In fact, by killing that bill the State of Missouri \nreceived $6.7 billion from the tobacco settlement. That money is more \nthan a third more resources than they would have received under the \nfederal legislation. In addition to money, the states won clear limits \nfrom the tobacco companies on marketing techniques aimed at young \npeople.\n  With this Settlement in mind, it is even more disappointing that \ntoday we are left with this tough choice. We either respect the federal \nlaw and penalize those who are in need of drug treatment programs--or \nwe bail out these states who have failed our nation's teens.\n  In trying to determine the best course of action, we listened to the \nexperts. Barry McCaffrey, the President's Drug Czar, stated that by \nwithholding these funds ``. . . some heroin addicts might be forced \nback on the streets to return to a criminal life.'' He says: ``[w]e \nagree that the carrot-and-stick approach of the law can serve a purpose \nof pushing compliance, but we must not throw the baby out with the \nbathwater by increasing drug addiction and crime.'' It is a tough \nchoice, but we must protect Americans from the scourge of drug use.\n  In addition, I can't let those in the State of Missouri suffer due to \nthe State's ineffective enforcement program. I am pleased to have \nworked with Senator Bond, the Senior Senator from Missouri, and other \nmembers whose states did not meet their targets in finding a solution \nto this problem.\n  There is no question that the agreement does not contain everything I \nbelieve it should--such as creating penalties for teens who purchase, \nuse and possess cigarettes. I continue to believe that if we really \nwant to reduce youth smoking, we must place some responsibility on \nteens.\n  However, I am relieved we have found a solution. These states will be \nforced to devote new money to anti-teen smoking programs. Based on that \ncommitment, they will receive their SAMHSA money.\n  I hope we do not find ourselves in this same position next year. This \nshould be a wake up call to these states to step up their enforcement \nand pass tough teen smoking laws. The increase in teen smoking rates is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will be doing wrapup momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will withhold.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to notify the Members that there will be some \nmore time taken on the bill itself, but that will be the final recorded \nvote for tonight, the last vote for tonight. There will be at least one \nvote tomorrow. I am still working on both sides to make a final \ndetermination on Monday. It is anticipated we will have at least one \nvote, maybe more, on Monday. But we have not locked that in yet. We \nwill notify you of that officially tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Collins be recognized at 9 a.m. on \nFriday to call up her amendment, No. 1824, there be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form, and a vote to occur \nimmediately on conclusion or yielding back of time and no second-degree \namendments in order. That would mean the vote tomorrow would be at \n9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. The next vote will occur at 9:30 in the morning.\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11681-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11681-S11720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n         RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000 --Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, ``Prairie Home Companion'': My wife and I \nhave enjoyed many Sunday afternoons listening to this great program on \npublic radio. It lasts 2 hours; there is music, comedy, drama. It is a \ngreat program. It comes on public radio.\n  On public television, we all watched the series on the Civil War. I \ndon't know if there was a more dramatic, a more effective presentation \nof history ever made on public broadcasting than of the Civil War.\n  It was tremendous.\n  Then several years later, the same person who produced the Civil War \nseries produced a magnificent series on baseball, the history of \nbaseball. It had pictures we had never seen, stories we had never \nheard, all on public broadcasting, all without any type of commercial \ninterruption of any kind.\n  I watched on public broadcasting, public television, a presentation \nabout the city of New York. I have been to the city of New York \nnumerous times. Never did I see New York as it was shown in that \nprogram. I saw parts of New York I would never, ever be able to see. I \nunderstand New York better than I would have ever been able to \nunderstand New York as a result of that program on public television.\n  I am a fan of public broadcasting. I think America is a fan of public \nbroadcasting. We can look back to the mid-1990s when Newt Gingrich took \ncontrol of the House of Representatives and publicly proposed cutting \nall public broadcasting funds.\n  There has been an effort by public broadcasters to do all kinds of \nthings to be able to meet the demands of their viewers. One of the \nthings they have done--there is report language in this bill that I \nthink is important, and that is to stand up and say what they have done \nas far as selling lists of their subscribers is wrong. We have public \nbroadcasting selling lists to Democratic organizations; we have public \nbroadcasting selling lists to Republican organizations. They were put \nup to bid, in effect, and that is wrong. The report that accompanies \nthis bill says, in very strong terms, that was wrong.\n  It was wrong. I acknowledge that without any question. But we have to \ndecide whether we want to have a public broadcasting system or not have \na public broadcasting system. Either we fund the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting so they can exist or we decide to end it. I prefer the \nformer. I prefer that we fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nI suggest we increase funding as indicated in this amendment, this \nyear, by $125 million.\n\n  I think it is important we talk about public broadcasting, what it \ndoes for this Nation. As long as the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting is leery of Congress cutting their funds--and certainly \nthey should be--I suspect they will begin to sound more and more like \nprivate broadcasting stations.\n  There was one article in the Washington Post, written by a man named \nFrank Ahrens, in which there was substantial research about what has \nhappened to public broadcasting. We find there has been a 700-percent \nincrease in corporate funding over just the past few years, since \nCongressman Gingrich got involved in this. It is not just listeners who \nare noticing the change. Private stations, which are not tax exempt as \nare these public broadcasters, are voicing their concern about an \nincreasingly uneven playing field--as well they should.\n  Why do they do that? They do it because corporate support has shifted \nradically in the past several years. In fact, at WAMU, which is a \nstation here in Washington, the broadcasts of which we hear all over \nthe country, the station president said it has gone up significantly. \nThat is an understatement.\n  Bob Edwards, for those of us who listen to public broadcasting--and I \nlisten to it in the morning more than any other time; I listen to the \nmorning edition--he is even more blunt. Bob Edwards says:\n\n       Underwriting has kept us alive.\n       It has cut into our air time. If you have to read a 30-\n     second underwriter credit, that's less news you can do.\n\n  That is an understatement. There is much less news that is done. \nUnderwriting spots sound like commercials, a trend that troubles \nlisteners, and recent surveys show this.\n  As this article indicates, the public is getting upset about this. In \nBoston, a radio station called WBUR has aggressively pursued corporate \nunderwriting, as many stations around America have--in fact, they have \nall done this. It lists 315 corporate sponsors on its web site--1 radio \nstation.\n  The corporations love to advertise on public radio. They believe \ndemographically they have an audience that listens to their messages, \nunderstands their messages; many times they are well-educated, upper-\nmiddle-class listeners who have expensive tastes and, some say, the \nmoney to indulge them. Moreover, they trust public radio much more than \nlisteners trust, perhaps, commercial radio.\n  We know on WAMU and other public radio stations, the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute, the lobbying arm for the atomic power industry, has done a \nlot of advertising. This comes not from the Senator from Nevada but \nfrom this article from the Washington Post. With its ads, the Nuclear \nEnergy Institute says, by using their slogan, ``Nuclear technology \ncontributes to life in many ways you probably never thought of.''\n  This upset listeners. There was a lot of complaining. As Bob Edwards, \nthe host of the program indicated, there was an e-mail campaign \nsuggesting NPR was in the pocket of the nuclear industry. I personally \ndo not think they are. But when this advertising takes place, people do \nnot have to stretch really far to come to that conclusion.\n\n  The same radio station, WAMU, decided several years ago they were \ngoing to do a show sponsored by the National Agricultural Chemical \nAssociation which advertised its products as safe. People complained \nbecause some people do not like these chemicals that are put on crops. \nCalls came in suggesting the radio station was in the pocket of this \nchemical company. That is really not true, but people can draw that \nconclusion because of the advertising that takes place on public radio.\n  Still, public radio managers are concerned and they are inventing all \nkinds of ways to get around FCC rules. They are creating promotions \nwith adjectives and lengthy explanations: ``the blue-chip company,'' \n``18 million customers worldwide,'' and ``converting natural gas to \nsulfur-free synthetic fuels.'' These are some of the catchwords they \nare using to try to get around some of the FCC rules.\n  In this Congress, earlier this year, Congressman Markey from \nMassachusetts and Congressman Tauzin from Louisiana drafted a bill that \nwould tighten the FCC rules and also increase spending by as much as 60 \npercent for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. They were--I \nshould not say forced; they decided on their own, I am sure, but as a \nresult of all the publicity that was engendered as a result of learning \nthese public broadcasting organizations were selling their subscribers' \nlists, they backed off this legislation. They said they were going to \ngo forward with it soon. There is a sentiment all over America that we \nhave to have either public broadcasting or commercial broadcasting. \nThis mix is not working because the mix is coming out as commercial \nbroadcasting.\n  It is not just lawmakers and listeners who are concerned and taking \nnote of this advertising policy, but commercial radio stations are \nconcerned. Public broadcasting is tax free. Commercial broadcasters \nbelieve it is unfair that public stations can air essentially the same \nadvertising they do and not have to pay the same taxes. They are \ncompeting in a way that is unfair to commercial broadcasters. ``It's \nnot an even playing field,'' says Jim Farley, the vice president for \nnews at WTOP here in Washington.\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\n  I listen to WTOP. It is a great news station. I think if we are going \nto have public broadcasting, it should be public broadcasting. People \nshould not have to guess whether or not it is a commercial station or \nit is public broadcasting. I agree with Jim Farley. It is not an even \nplaying field.\n  The increased presence of corporate underwriters has led some \nlisteners and even those within public radio to fear underwriters might \ninfluence the news coverage in segments they sponsor. There are not \nmany other conclusions you can reach if, in fact, you are advertising \nsome commercial product.\n  The reason people can come to that conclusion without a lot of \nstretch is, for example, ``Marketplace,'' which is a public radio \nprogram, aired stories about General Electric being indicted for price \nfixing but ignored a 1990 boycott of the company by the people who \nobjected to its participation in the nuclear weapons industry.\n  Why did some people come to that conclusion? Because General Electric \nprovides more than 25 percent of the funding for this program. There \nwas no other conclusion one could reach. The show's general manager now \ncalls the fact they did not run stories about this boycott a lapse, a \nmistake. I submit, we should not have these problems with public \nbroadcasting.\n  My amendment simply says if we are going to have public broadcasting, \nwe should have public broadcasting. Even though this money I am \nsuggesting we vote for is not enough to solve all the problems, it is a \nstep in the right direction and will take some of the pressure off \npublic broadcasting.\n  This is money well spent. It is important we in America feel good \nabout our public broadcasting. I submit that programs such as ``Prairie \nHome Companion,'' the series on the Civil War and baseball and New York \nand a multitude of other programs we have all enjoyed should continue \nwithout commercial interruption.\n  I believe we should adequately fund this organization. Whether it is \nadequate funding or not is something we can all debate, but it is at \nleast a step in the direction of giving public broadcasting a shot in \nthe arm, funding which has been taken from them as a result of the \nactivities of Congress since 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order prior to the vote on or in relation to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered and argued \nby the Senator from Nevada because the subcommittee worked out a very \ncarefully crafted set of priorities, joined in by the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, my distinguished ranking member. In structuring a \nbill of $91.7 billion, we had to take into account many programs, some \n300 programs. There is difficulty in having this bill accepted with 51 \nvotes considering the expenditures involved.\n  We have given priority to items such as education where the bill is \n$500 million in excess of the President's request. We have given \npriority to programs for the National Institutes of Health and raised \n$2 billion. We have had to cut some programs which I, frankly, did not \nlike to see cut. But we have established the priorities.\n  With respect to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, we have \nincreased their funding by $10 million, from $340 million to $350 \nmillion. This year's allocation of $340 million was an increase from \n$300 million the year before and an increase from $250 million the year \nbefore that. It is true that back in 1992, the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting had an allocation of $327 million and it has gradually \nbeen built up. I have been supportive of public broadcasting. The \nquestion is on priorities, and it is my judgment that in a tight fiscal \nyear with tight budget constraints that we have been reasonably \ngenerous with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  On another matter I think ought to be commented upon, although it is \nnot the reason for opposing the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, \nis the finding by the inspector general of the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting that 53 of the 591 public broadcasting grantees exchanged \ndonor lists with or rented them to political organizations, which is a \nmatter of some consequence. Earlier this year, the Boston Globe \nreported that the local public television station in Boston, WGBH, \nexchanged its donor list with the Democratic Party. There were other \nmedia reports about exchanges involving public broadcasting with WNET \nin New York, WETA in Washington, DC, and WHYY in Philadelphia.\n  Steps have been taken by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \nstop that practice, but I do think it is a factor which ought to be in \nthe public record and ought to be commented upon at this time.\n  It would be a curious reward if, in the face of a problem this year \nof this magnitude, we had a proportionately large increase in the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. These factors were considered very \ncarefully when our bill was crafted. I do listen to public broadcasting \nmyself, and I do concur with Senator Reid that it is a very useful \ninstrumentality, given the considerations on commercial broadcasting. \nBut we have gone about as far as we can go in allocating a $10 million \nincrease which brings the corporation up to $350 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill and the Senator \nfrom Iowa have done a good job in constructing this $91.7 billion bill, \nand they have included things regarding health and education. There is \nnothing more educational for the American public than to do a good job \nfor public broadcasting.\n  As I said earlier, the sales of the donor lists were brought about \nbecause of the financial pressure on these institutions. I do not \ncondone that, and I agree with the language of the report which does \nnot condone that.\n  I suggest this is money well spent out of $91.7 billion. This money \nis a mere pittance and it would be very important to spend to help the \nAmerican public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the actual vote on this amendment not \ntake place until there is an agreement between the two leaders as to \nwhen it should take place.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for that observation. It \nis my hope we can stack the votes until late this afternoon. We find \nthat the votes set for 15 minutes with a 5-minute leeway go much \nlonger. We have an amendment lined up by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson, to start in 10 minutes, and behind that--in sequencing we \nhave had two amendments from that side of the aisle, so we are looking \nfor another Republican amendment behind Senator Hutchinson. Then we \nwill have Senator Graham of Florida.\n  We wish to move this bill expeditiously giving ample time with time \nagreements. So we will be looking to stack the votes very late this \nafternoon. Then we have lined up an amendment on ergonomics to come \nlate this afternoon. It is anticipated there will be considerable \ndebate on that. But we want to move through the ``meat'' of the day, so \nto speak, getting as much done as we can. So I concur with what Senator \nReid has had to say about stacking the votes later.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I also say, while we are waiting for Senator Hutchinson to \ncome to the floor, that we have the 2 o'clock cutoff for the submission \nof amendments. We hope Members will come forward with amendments as \nquickly as possible, recognizing we are trying to move this bill along \nas quickly as we can. So we hope everyone, especially the staffs who \nare listening, will take that into consideration, as I am sure they \nare--that consideration will be given to the submission of amendments, \nworking under the time constraints we have.\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while not an enormous matter, while we \nare waiting for the next amendment to be offered, the issue has arisen \nas to whether the lists were made available to which political parties. \nI have been furnished, by staff, with a response by the inspector \ngeneral of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to Congressman \nDingell's questions in the House of Representatives.\n  This is one question:\n\n       When stations made donor lists available to Democratic \n     organizations either directly or through list brokers/\n     managers, were the lists made available to Republican \n     organizations as well?\n\n  Answer by the inspector general, as represented to me here:\n\n       Although, none of the identified exchanges or rentals of \n     donor names from public broadcasting stations involved \n     Republican organizations, we could not conclude that such \n     names were not available to them. In this regard, we found no \n     indications or evidence that Republican organizations had \n     ever sought or been turned down for names requested from \n     public broadcasting stations. In addition in visiting two \n     stations, we were advised that when they learned that names \n     were being exchanged with or rented to Democratic \n     organizations, they had proposed exchanges with Republican \n     organizations to their direct mail consultant or list broker. \n     These stations were later advised that such exchanges were \n     turned down.\n\n  I think it advisable, having read from part of these responses, that \nthe full text of the responses to Congressman Dingell's questions be \nprinted in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe responses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Corporation for Public     Broadcasting,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1999.\n     Hon. John D. Dingell,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Commerce, Room 2125, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Dingell: The Office of Inspector General \n     appreciates the opportunity to clarify any questions Congress \n     has resulting from our recent report on Public Broadcasting \n     Stations exchange or rental of membership/donor names with \n     political organizations. We have accordingly prepared \n     Attachment 1 which contains the office's conclusions \n     regarding the questions raised in your September 20, 1999 \n     letter.\n       If your staff wishes to discuss these matters further, \n     please have them contact me at (202) 879-9660.\n           Sincerely\n                                                  Kenneth A. Konz,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Attachment 1\n\n\n              Responses to Congressman Dingell's Questions\n\n       1. Is there any evidence to suggest that any donor list \n     transactions between stations and Democratic organizations \n     were politically motivated?\n       No. Stations across the country universally denied that any \n     decisions to exchange donor lists or rent names to any \n     outside organization were politically motivated. \n     Additionally, top management officials were not aware that \n     such exchanges were being made. Instead, such exchanges seem \n     to grow from the need to utilize direct mail solicitation as \n     a basis for raising membership revenue for the station. \n     Because dealing with political organizations was such a minor \n     part of their direct mail solicitation process, we concluded \n     that political motivations were not considered.\n       2. When stations made donor lists available to Democratic \n     organizations either directly or through list brokers/\n     managers, were the lists made available to Republican \n     organizations as well?\n       Although none of the identified exchanges or rentals of \n     donor names from public broadcasting stations involved \n     Republican organizations, we could not conclude that such \n     names were not available to them. In this regard, we found no \n     indications or evidence that Republican organizations had \n     ever sought or been turned down for names requested from \n     public broadcasting stations. In addition in visiting two \n     stations, we were advised that when they learned that names \n     were being exchanged with or rented to Democratic \n     organizations, they had proposed exchanges with Republican \n     organizations to their direct mail consultant or list broker. \n     These stations were later advised that such exchanges were \n     turned down.\n       3. Were any contacts with political organizations initiated \n     directly by station representatives? What role did list \n     brokers/managers play in these transactions?\n       Based on the responses we got to the survey and our visits \n     to stations, we found that all arrangements with political \n     organizations were made by direct mail consultants or list \n     brokers. Generally, such consultants developed plans for \n     direct mail campaigns. Given the number of  solicitations \n     planned, the consultant proposed various lists from which \n     names could be exchanged or acquired based on the \n     demographics of the target audience and success in using, \n     such lists in previous direct mail solicitations. The \n     stations simply saw the names of the proposed lists and \n     were given the opportunity to eliminate those \n     organizations they did not want to exchange with. \n     Therefore, they usually went along with the lists \n     recommended. In cases where political organizations \n     desired exchanges, they would go to the list broker who \n     (in some cases) had authority to exchange names or who, if \n     they did not have authority, would get back to the \n     stations to obtain authorization or rejection.\n       4. Is there any evidence of a station, or list broker/\n     manager acting on behalf of a station, refusing a request for \n     a list exchange or rental from either a Republican \n     organization or a list broker/manager known to be acting on \n     behalf of a Republican organization?\n       We saw no indication that exchanges or rentals from \n     Republican organizations were turned down. On the other hand, \n     we saw some exchanges with Democratic organizations were \n     turned down because the stations had a policy of not \n     exchanging with political organizations.\n       As a general rule, we saw stations looking for names for \n     use in direct mail solicitations. In this regard, in \n     reviewing acquisition of names, stations obtained names not \n     only from apparent Democratic organizations, but also from \n     apparent Republican organizations. For the stations we \n     visited, more than one third of the stations got significant \n     portions (20 percent or more) of such names from apparent \n     Republican organizations. Thus, we have no basis to conclude \n     that exchanges sought by Republican organizations would have \n     received any different consideration from those sought by \n     Democratic ones.\n       5. In your judgment, did any station violate any Federal of \n     State law or regulation in conducting these donor list \n     transactions?\n       Our office did not find clear evidence of any violation of \n     Federal or State laws or regulations. CPB has the authority \n     for making grants to public broadcasters under section 396 of \n     the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. In examining the \n     provisions of the Act, as well as CPB grant terms and \n     conditions in affect at the time of grant award, we noted \n     that no specific restrictions existed related to direct mail \n     solicitations and the exchange of membership/donor lists with \n     other organizations. Since we were unable to find evidence \n     showing political motivation to support particular parties or \n     candidates, we did not identify any violations of existing \n     CPB statutes or regulations.\n       Our office is not an expert in all the Federal or State \n     laws or regulations which might govern the exchange of rental \n     of membership/donor lists. we have in this instance heard \n     that questions have been raised regarding the possibility \n     that stations may have violated provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Service (IRS) requirements concerning non profit \n     organizations. We understand the IRS was looking into the \n     situation. They would be the appropriate organization to \n     indicate whether there were any violations to that law.\n       6. How did stations benefit from list exchanges or rentals \n     with political organizations?\n       In our opinion, stations did not obtain any extraordinary \n     benefit from exchanges or rentals with political \n     organizations. While on one hand the stations did get names \n     from such organizations, they paid for them just like other \n     exchanges with or rentals from non profit organizations or \n     even commercial entities. In both cases, the cost of direct \n     mail solicitations was reduced when names were acquired \n     through exchanges, rather than rentals.\n       In evaluating benefits to the station, we noted that \n     successful lists only averaged one contribution or membership \n     for every 100 direct mail solicitations (1 percent). \n     Furthermore, only a small proportion of the names used in \n     direct mail solicitations were derived from political \n     organizations. For the stations we visited names from \n     apparently political organizations, ranged from only .3 \n     percent to 6.4 percent of the names acquired for direct mail \n     solicitations. Thus, we concluded that involvement with \n     political organizations in this process did not provide \n     material benefits to public broadcasting stations.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator would withhold.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not want to get into a ``who did this; \nwho did not do that.'' I acknowledge, selling the lists was wrong. The \nfact is, though, that PBS stations made these lists available to both \nparties. Without getting too partisan, we know the Bush family has made \ntheir lists available to groups, also. These groups include the\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n\nCitizens for a Sound Economy and the Heritage Foundation. These are \ncertainly if not Republican organizations, I would clearly say, \nRepublican-leaning organizations.\n  I also think it is important to note we are talking about the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting. And the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting has a policy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are not on the Senator's time now. We are waiting \nfor Senator Hutchinson to come. I got the floor on my own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a time agreement on the amendment. \nThere is a current time agreement. If the Senator wishes to----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield time from my side to the Senator from Nevada.\n  I ask the Senator, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. REID. Just a few minutes, a couple minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Two minutes. We only have about 4 minutes left. If you \ntake 2 minutes, I will have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 6 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Take 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting now \nhas a policy. We do not need to talk about what has gone on before. We \nall recognize it was wrong and is wrong.\n  I again state I approve wholeheartedly with the language in the \nreport that was submitted by the manager and the ranking member of this \nbill and which I understand had the full committee chairman's undying \nsupport; that is, the Senator from Alaska was also upset about the \ntrading of lists, which we all agree is wrong.\n  I support the present policy. If you want to sell your list to a \npolitical party, you are not going to get any funding from the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the Senate floor we do not frequently \nhave the quality of evidence which assures authenticity, unlike a \ncourtroom where you have to have witnesses who saw, observed, or \ndocumentation which is authenticated.\n  I have marveled, from time to time, during my tenure in the Senate \nhow many representations of fact are made which have no authentication. \nWe had a little time left over from the debate, so the Senator from \nNevada and I have talked a little bit about these lists being made \navailable to political parties.\n  You have the inspector general's report which will be made a part of \nthe Record which says what it says. I have already stated that. I am \nnot going to repeat it. But what we say on this Senate floor is viewed \nby a lot of people. I am sure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nwill be looking very closely at what Senator Reid and I have had to \nsay. And other public institutions will be on notice, as well, that \nwhen there is public money involved, it is a public trust and not to be \npartisan for either Democrats or Republicans, and that we will take a \nlook at it.\n\n  Again, I repeat that, notwithstanding this concern, we did not seek \nto have that influence our determination as to what the funding should \nbe. We added $10 million. We know the problem has been rectified, but \nwe want the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and everyone else, to \nbe on notice that the Congress will not tolerate partisanship or \npolitical activity of either party with public money, which is a \nFederal trust.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be postponed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the hour of 12:30 has arrived. We expect \nthe offerer of the next amendment to be here within a very short period \nof time. In the interim, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment, the next amendment will be \noffered in the queue by the Senator from Arkansas. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be awarded one hour of debate, equally \ndivided, with no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Hlavacek, \na fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of this appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. A unanimous consent \nwas asked. Was there approval that there be a time limit on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The time limit is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour of debate equally divided with no \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1812\n\n              (Purpose: To transfer amounts appropriated.)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), for himself, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Allard, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1812.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n\n         transfer of funds for the consolidated health centers\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $25,472,000 of the amounts appropriated for the National \n     Labor Relations Board under this Act shall be transferred and \n     utilized to carry out projects for the consolidated health \n     centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 254b).\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators DeWine, Allard, Thomas, Crapo, and Helms as cosponsors of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nto the appropriations bill on Labor-HHS. I think it is one that should \nbe easy for Members to support. Let me very basically explain it, and \nthen I will go into more detail.\n  This would shift $25.472 million from the National Labor Relations \nBoard to the Consolidated Health Centers Program. The $25.472 million \nis the increase in spending that has been added to the budget of the \nNLRB. I will explain this in further detail, but this would take that \nexpense and shift it to what is a critical program for underserved \nareas in health care in this country.\n  The NLRB requested an increase of $25.472 million in funding for the \nfiscal year 2000. Their argument is they need that increase in funding \nto reduce their backlog in cases. However, when one looks at the \nsituation at the NLRB and looks at their own statistics provided by the \nNational Labor Relations Board, justification for an increase is simply \nnot there.\n  In its annual report, the NLRB stated the number of cases that were \npending before the NLRB declined from 37,249 in fiscal year 1997 to \n34,664 in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\n1998. The NLRB further reported the number of cases the NLRB is \nreceiving declined from 39,618 in fiscal year 1997 to 36,657 in fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  From their own statistics, it is clear that the National Labor \nRelations Board can fulfill its statutory mandate to administer the \nNational Labor Relations Acts without the better than $25 million \nincrease in funding. In fact, the NLRB did not receive an increase last \nyear and was not only able to fulfill their mandate but achieved these \nresults which I have cited in seeing a decrease in the number of cases.\n  How is that possible? When adjusted for inflation, from 1980 to 1998, \nwhile the NLRB budget declined by 21 percent, the number of charges \nreceived and processed has declined by 31 percent. While the NLRB can \nrightly say they have had a declining budget, if you look at the number \nof charges they have received and processed, it has had an even more \ndramatic decline.\n  In his statement before the House Subcommittee on Labor-HHS, on March \n25, the NLRB general counsel, Fred Feinstein, stated that the NLRB has \nadopted a program called Impact Analysis through which the NLRB has \nmoved beyond the first-in-first-out approach in an effort to assure \nthat the cases it gets to first are those that are central to its core \nmission.\n  He further stated that the Impact Analysis Program has allowed the \nNLRB to assure that its backlog consists of lower priority cases. Not \nonly has the backlog decreased but the cases that are in their own \nsystem are not of a lower priority.\n  The NLRB estimates that of the 35,000 total charges filed each year, \nonly approximately one-third--or 10,500--are found to have merit. The \nNLRB further estimates that of the 10,500 charges each year that are \nfound to be meritorious, 86 percent--or 9,030--are settled.\n  Therefore, the NLRB adjudicates only approximately 4 percent--or \n1,470--of the charges it receives each year. So over 35,000 total \ncharges, less than 4 percent, or about 4 percent, are ever adjudicated. \nSo from the NLRB's own numbers, only 10,500 of the 35,000 charges have \nmerit and 65 percent of all unfair labor practice charges are dismissed \nor withdrawn.\n\n  Let me reiterate. Sixty-five percent of all unfair labor charges are \ndismissed or withdrawn because they are found to be without merit.\n  Where does that leave us as a body? How do we justify funding their \nrequest at better than a $25 million increase at a time that the number \nof cases is decreasing and the number of adjudications is down 40 \npercent? How do we justify that?\n  I know. I simply can't justify that. I think many of my colleagues \nwill agree.\n  If a society can be judged by how it treats its less fortunate, if a \nsociety is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, then we \nmust and the NLRB must make better use of resources and decide that we \nwill tip the scales this time in favor of individuals, particularly \nchildren, who need health care.\n  That is why my amendment will shift $25.472 million from the NLRB to \nthe Consolidated Health Centers. It is not a cut in NLRB funding but a \nshifting of what would have been an increase in their funding to a \ncritically urgent program, the Consolidated Health Centers.\n  The Consolidated Health Centers Program is a Federal grant program \nfunded under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act to provide \nfor primary care health services in medically underserved areas \nthroughout the United States.\n  I suspect that the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Kansas, \nknows well about these kinds of underserved areas. In my home State of \nArkansas--we have many in the Mississippi Delta region--they are \ndesperately in need of these kinds of community health clinics. \nSpecifically, this program makes grants to public and nonprofit private \nentities for the development and operation of community, migrant, and \nhomeless health centers.\n  Key to the mission of the Consolidated Health Centers Program is its \nrecognition of the contours of our country and its diverse geography. \nHealth care is needed in areas where economic, geographic, and cultural \nbarriers limit access to primary health care for a substantial portion \nof the population. It might surprise a lot of folks, but today one-\nfifth of Americans live in rural areas. And many are in desperate need \nof health care.\n  I grew up in a little town of 894. It is now up to 1,300. It is in a \nrural part of Arkansas. I wouldn't trade that place for growing up for \nany place in the world. But I know that while we have serenity, we have \nlow crime--we had wide open spaces to run on the farm, and it was a \nwonderful place to grow up--there are also a lot of amenities most \npeople take for granted which we didn't have. Whether it is in Kansas \nor Arkansas or Iowa, people living in those rural areas may be willing \nfor the benefits they receive not to have the metro system, not to have \na nice theater, not have the grand malls, and some of the things we \nenjoy so much in the Nation's Capital.\n  However, the tragedy is not only do they give up those amenities but \ntoo often in Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, across the Mississippi Delta and \nother rural areas, they also give up opportunities because of the \neconomic deprivation of some of the areas that have good quality health \ncare. Indeed, some don't have adequate health care facilities at all, \nwhile we take for granted such areas as the Pentagon City Mall, Tysons \nCorner, full service hospitals, dental centers, podiatrists, \nchiropractors, virtually a doctor for every part of your body.\n  But that does not happen in the Mississippi Delta, rural Kansas, or \nIowa. These health centers provide access to basic yet essential health \nservices, including preventive health and dental services, acute and \nchronic care services, appropriate hospitalization, and specialty \nreferrals. These centers are the safety net providers for those who \nfall through the cracks in our current health insurance marketplace. We \nmay fight and we may argue on the floor of this Senate as to what we \nshould do about managed care reform, what we should do about providing \nhealth care for those uninsured, but we don't need to argue about the \nneed to increase funding for these vital community health centers. They \nare the ultimate safety net in our society.\n  Health centers provide health care to people regardless of their \nability to pay. By law they serve anyone who walks in through their \ndoors--rich or poor, insured or not. Of the clients received by \ncommunity health centers, 44 percent are children, 66 percent have \nincomes below poverty level. That is the issue before the Senate in \nthis amendment: Are we going to fund more bureaucracy at the NLRB at a \ntime they have a declining number of cases or are we going to shift the \nincrease for small rural communities desperately in need of greater \nhealth care? In Arkansas alone, 41 health centers currently serve \n80,000 Arkansans. Once again, 44 percent are children and two-thirds \nhave incomes below the poverty level.\n  Last month, during our August recess, I had the opportunity to visit \n13 counties in the delta region. They are the poorest of the poor. They \ndon't need a handout, but they need a helping hand, especially in the \narea of health care. I recently visited a new health clinic in Parkin, \nAR, made possible through a grant in this program, Consolidated Health \nCenters Program. I commend all the dedicated public servants and health \ncare professionals at the Parkin Medical Clinic and all of the health \ncenters in Arkansas for the invaluable contributions they make to their \ncommunities and commitment to improving public health.\n  At a time when the number of uninsured in our country is over 40 \nmillion and growing, the community health centers play a pivotal role \nin providing care to those who need it most, the uninsured. By spending \n$25 million more for the health centers, we will enable them to serve \n83,000 more people. That won't cover the expected need, but it is a \nstep in the right direction. They say they need $264 million more to \nmaintain current levels of coverage and care. Last year, we increased \nfunding by $100 million for the health centers. Senator Specter--and I \napplaud his efforts in this appropriations bill--increases funding for \nthe health centers by $99 million in addition. That is a good start, \nbut they say in order to maintain current service they need $264 \nmillion.\n  I believe this is a good investment and it is an easy choice. The \nchoice is funding more bureaucracy at the NLRB\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\nat a time caseload is falling or shifting that increase to the \ncommunities, to the deprived and neglected communities of this country \nin which there is a high percentage of uninsured and a high percentage \nof children who don't have access to health care. We can help that \nsituation and provide tens of thousands of people health care by the \nsimple passage of this amendment.\n\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 17 minutes 51 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent, without it being taken off of the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object. If the Senator wants to speak, why not have the \nSenator yield time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming whatever time he desires.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Arkansas. I am Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on \nEmployment, Safety and Training. I have worked closely with Senator \nHutchinson to assure small businesses are treated fairly by the NLRB. I \nhave numbers as well that show there is difficulty with that.\n  I held a hearing in July that clearly illustrated how small business \nowners that win against the NLRB on an action against the employer get \nleft with thousands of dollars of legal bills. Aggressive actions \ncontinue to be brought against the small business owners with no relief \nin sight. That has to be solved.\n  Regarding this movement for community health centers, regardless of \nhow much it takes to take care of the present situation, Wyoming \ndoesn't have a community health center. We have a need for it equally. \nI hope that is included in the suggestions for where this money will be \ngoing. I understand the need to raise enough funds to be able to \nsupport the current efforts.\n  I ask people to take a look at the record of the hearings we held on \nthis subject of the National Labor Relations Board and the unfairness \nwith which they have treated some of the employers, the huge bills \nemployers have been left with, in spite of some of them representing \nthemselves before the committee. Such practices are wrong and need to \nbe stopped.\n  We shouldn't have additional funds for a function that is actually \ndecreasing the load. We also find there is a decrease in cases going \nbefore those people.\n  Earlier this year at a field hearing about the National Labor \nRelation Board's treatment of small businesses by the safety \nsubcommittee, a small business employer named Randall Truckenbrodt \ntestifies that in one year alone, over 36 unfair labor practice charges \nwere filed against his company. After a prolonged legal battle, Randall \nwon all 36 charges. The cost of defending himself, however, totaled a \nwhopping $80,000, a sum which he testified, ``could have been triple \nhad I not represented myself.'' As a former small business owner, I \nshudder to think that such a practice could ever occur--much less to a \nsmall business--and I am dumbstruck by reports that what happened to \nRandall happens all the time. Such practices are more than wrong, they \nshould be stopped. I support this amendment, which would allow NLRB to \nfocus on their existing responsibilities and not allow additional funds \nfor random, meritless claims brought against small businesses by the \nNLRB--an intimidating bureaucracy that can sometimes strong-arm the \nlittle guy who doesn't have the resources to defend himself.\n  I have great concerns over the actions of the NLRB against small \nbusinesses, and before we give it 25 million additional dollars, I \nthink we need to get to the bottom of NLRB's treatment of these \nsmallest of businesses. I support Senator Hutchinson's amendment which \nwould transfer the $25.7 million increase for the National Labor \nRelations Board to Consolidated Health Centers under the Public Health \nService Act.\n  Community health centers play a vital role in providing primary care \nservices to underserved areas. The Labor HHS bill provides a $99 \nmillion increase for CHCs--Consolidated Community Health Centers \nProgram--for poor, rural areas. HRSA, however, testified and requested \n$264 million just to maintain levels of coverage and care.\n  Health centers serve over 10 million people nationwide, over 4 \nmillion of which are uninsured. By spending $25 million more for health \ncenters, health centers estimate that they will be able to serve over \n83,000 more people.\n  Bottom line, this amendment will bring better health care to millions \nof Americans, rather than harming more small businesses by allowing the \nNLRB to run wild in filing meritless claims against them, and therefore \nI rise to strongly support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when this bill was crafted with some 300 \nitems, great care was exercised on the establishment of priorities. \nThat is always a difficult matter. Where is the $1.800 trillion in \nFederal money to be spent? We have a bill of $91.7 billion. We have had \na series of amendments to change the allocations and assessments of \npriorities which the ranking member and I came to initially with staff, \nand then the subcommittee and then the full committee.\n  I am inclined to agree with my colleague from Arkansas about the \ndesirability of having more money in the consolidated health centers. \nHe came from a small town, as he recited, of several hundred that has \ngrown to more than 1,000. The town where I went to high school was a \nbig city by comparison. It had several thousand people. Russell, KS, \nhas now 4,998 people. It used to have 5,000 until Dole and I left town.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Arkansas has had to say about the \nvirtues of living in a small town. I have appreciated the virtues of \nliving in a small town even more since I moved to a big city. I knew \nRussell, KS, was a great place to live, but after I moved to \nPhiladelphia I concluded Russell, KS, was a greater place to live.\n  When the Senator from Arkansas talks about smalltown life and the \nneed for health centers, he is right. They are needed not only in \nArkansas but in Pennsylvania, in Kansas, and everywhere.\n  When we made the allocations, as has already been noted by the \nSenator from Arkansas, we paid a very substantial increase to \nconsolidated health centers. Consolidated health centers were a little \nover $900 million and we added $99.3 million to bring them to $1.24 \nbillion. That is, I am advised, $79 million over the President's \nrequest.\n  But, even so, when the Senator from Arkansas says he would like to \nhave more money, I would not disagree with him. But then it is a \nquestion of establishing priorities, as to what we do. I listened \nclosely to the statistics which were cited by the Senator from Arkansas \non the decrease in the backlog. But even after the backlog has \ndecreased--and I am searching for those exact statistics myself--there \nstill is an enormous backlog which is pending before the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  When the Senator from Arkansas makes a comment about the board \nestablishing priorities, I think that is to the board's credit. They \nare not going to be able to take all the cases, so they ought to \nestablish priorities. I hope their priorities are not subject to as \nmuch challenge as mine are on the floor. I am not really too serious \nabout that, there haven't been too many challenges. But then the day is \nnot over yet, either. We are waiting for all the amendments to be filed \nby 2 o'clock this afternoon.\n  But I compliment the National Labor Relations Board for establishing \npriorities, to take up the most important cases first. The fact that \nthere are a great many unmeritorious claims filed is not surprising. \nThere are sometimes unmeritorious amendments filed--not this one. But \nthere are lots of cases filed in court or any adjudicatory process \nwhere there are unmeritorious matters. But I do not think that can be \nthe basis of judgment. My analysis of the caseload of the National \nLabor Relations Board, and I am going to put these figures into shape \nduring the\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\ncourse of this debate, to be specific and put them into the \nCongressional Record, is that this funding is needed.\n  The National Labor Relations Board, by word of just a little \nexplanation for those who may be watching on C-SPAN2, is a board \ncreated to take into consideration complaints, either by labor or by \nmanagement, as to what is happening in a labor practice and to identify \nunfair labor practices and to produce labor peace by having an \nadministrative remedy which would stop people from going into court.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak who are waiting now, but I \nthink a careful analysis of the backlog, of the procedures of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, and the entire picture, will show that \nthis kind of increase is warranted and certainly in consideration of \nthe significant increase accorded to the consolidated health centers, \nwhich I have already noted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would my colleague from Iowa like?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask my colleague from Iowa a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not have the floor yet.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is a question pending of the Senator from Iowa, \nhow much time does he want?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I leave the floor, might I ask \nmy colleagues from Iowa and Pennsylvania a question? I want to know the \nparliamentary situation. Do we have an agreement for no second-degree \namendments and this would only be debated for an hour? Could I get some \ninformation about this?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond to the question, I was off the floor \nfor a moment, actually, in the lunchroom. I came back to the floor. A \nunanimous consent request had been propounded for an hour time \nagreement, equally divided, with no second-degree amendments. It was \nlater determined that was not really acceptable to the Democratic side \nof the aisle. I said to the Senator from Iowa, when I came back in: If \nit causes you heartburn, we will eliminate it.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the part as to ``no second-degree \namendments'' be rescinded, but the time as to 1 hour equally divided \nremain in effect.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could make it clear to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, if there is an objection--I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I think his unanimous consent request is very much in the \nspirit of fairness.\n\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if that is not \nacceptable, kind of sneaking a unanimous consent request in--this is a \nvery important amendment. There ought to be second-degree amendments on \nevery single amendment introduced to this bill forthwith with no time \nagreement if we are going to play that way. That is just not \nacceptable. We need much more time and we certainly should have the \nright to second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized. I think \nhe was yielded time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I assume I have some of my 5 minutes left--I hope?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I say I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He is a true gentleman, I think, in the spirit of comity \non the Senate floor, to recognize the unanimous consent request that \nwas proffered earlier was not acceptable to this side. I bear some \nresponsibility for that. I was engaged in a conversation with my staff \nand did not even hear the unanimous consent request propounded, so I \nbear some responsibility for that.\n  As I said, in the spirit of comity and the smooth functioning of the \nSenate, my friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, came back on the floor and said he would move to vitiate \nthat unanimous consent agreement, which he did, I think, again, in the \ntrue spirit of comity and smooth functioning of the Senate. That then \nwas objected to, I guess, by the Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield the floor back to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I heard there was a problem--we work \ntogether on too many matters over too long a period of time. If it was \ninadvertently entered into, we are prepared not to hold anybody to it. \nWe have a lot of work to do. If we did not have a lot of work to do, we \nstill would not hold them to it if it was inadvertently entered into.\n  I have just discussed that with my colleague from Arkansas. I think \nwe can work this out in the course of the next few minutes, if the \nSenator from Iowa will take his 5 minutes to argue on the merits.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I can have another 5 minutes to talk about the \namendment itself?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I allocate 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment propounded by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas really would harm the NLRB \ndrastically. The Senator from Arkansas said the caseload had gone down. \nThat is true, the caseload did go down, I assume because we increased \nsome of the funding and they were able to, then, hire some more staff \nand decrease the caseload.\n  If now, however, we cut the funding, they are going to have to \nrelease those people and fire people who were hired; therefore we will \nbe right back where we started from.\n  We keep hearing about the backlog. What is the backlog? The NLRB, at \nthe end of last fiscal year, had 6,198 cases pending at the end of the \nlast fiscal year. I understand some of those were reduced last year, \nbut we are still in the neighborhood of about a 5,500-case backlog. So \nI do not know how the Senator from Arkansas can argue we are making \ngreat progress. We are making a little bit of progress. But to take the \n$25 million out of the NLRB would put us right back where we were \nbefore, and you would see the backlog start going back up again. That \nmay not be his intention, but that is exactly what would happen.\n  At this funding level, the staffing, I am told, would have to be \nreduced by at least 100 people below the current level. That would be \nabout a 5-percent reduction. Again, that would mean the backlogs would \ncontinue to go up. The time to process the claims would grow \nsignificantly, and that would hurt not just the employees but also the \nemployers. Both sides are harmed when they get this kind of backlog at \nthe NLRB. Again, they are most effective when they can get at this in a \nhurry. Workers who are fired for union organizing must sometimes wait \nweeks or months for cases to be processed. Then when the remedy does \ncome through it is too late. People have to move on with their lives. \nThey have found other jobs, they get the remedy, but it is too late to \nmake any kind of difference at all.\n  Employers are hurt because a delay causes back pay to add up until \nthe case is resolved. This creates uncertainty. It destabilizes the \nworkplace. I have had employers who have contacted my office and said: \nCan't you do something about NLRB? There is a case pending. It is \ncausing us a lot of headaches. So it is not just labor, but it is also \nmanagement that is hurt when you have this kind of backlog.\n  If this amendment goes through the funding level right now would put \nus, as I understand it, below the 1993 inflation-adjusted level for the \nNLRB. During that period of time, the number of cases has gone up. So \nyou can see the number of cases has gone up. We took a little bit out \nlast year because of some additional staffing we gave them. This budget \ncut would put us back where we were in 1993.\n  Of course, not only would the present backlog of cases take more \ntime, we could see actually more cases piling up behind the ones that \nare there.\n  Again, there is some thought that the NLRB is a kind of a prolabor \norganization. The NLRB is effective because it is a nonmanagement, \nnonlabor, independent board. It promotes stable and productive labor \nrelations. If they are not able to do their job, our whole society \nbreaks down.\n  Let me get to the point. The Senator from Arkansas wants to take $25 \nmillion out of this and put it into community health centers. I take a \nback seat to no one in supporting community\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\nhealth centers--consolidated health centers I guess they are now \ncalled--and have worked over the years with Senator Specter, as a \nmatter of fact, to increase funding for our community health centers. \nThey do a great job. In many cases, they are really the only source for \na lot of low-income people who have no health care insurance.\n  We worked very hard--Senator Specter, I, and our staffs--to get a \n$100 million increase. We are up to slightly over $1 billion now for \ncommunity health centers, and they need the money. But I do not think \nthey need the money at the expense of taking it out of the NLRB. We \ngave them a $100 million increase. I believe this will be more than \nsufficient to help get new community health centers started next year \nand to adequately fund the ones in existence.\n  While I support community health centers, this is not the way to get \nmoney for them, by taking it out of the NLRB and taking it out of the \nmore rapid resolution of the backlog of cases. Many times, the workers \nwho are waiting to get a case heard are the same ones who are low \nincome and need to have their cases resolved so they can get on with \ntheir jobs and their lives.\n  I yield back whatever remaining time I have.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick \nThompson from the HELP Committee staff and Mark Battaglini, who is a \nfellow, be granted the privilege of the floor during the debate on S. \n1650, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the numbers \nused a minute ago in talking about the number of cases filed and the \nnumber of cases disposed of in this seemingly inverted pyramid of \nbacklog of cases. It did not happen that way.\n  In 1997, there were 37,000 cases pending. In 1998, there were 34,000 \ncases pending. That is a decrease in the number of cases pending. That \nis not the same as the number of cases filed. There were 39,000 cases \nfiled in 1997; there were 36,000 cases filed in 1998. Both of those \nnumbers show a decrease in cases--a decrease in the number that were \npending and a decrease in the number that were filed. The Senator from \nIowa mentioned there was a decrease in the backlog, that they were \nworking that down.\n  Let me tell you how part of that backlog happens. In my previous \nlife, before I came to the Senate, I was an accountant. One of the \npeople I did accounting for received one of these notices of audit from \nthe National Labor Relations Board. They came in--it was about 10 days \nwork for me--and they looked over all of the accounts and decided at \nthe conclusion of that time verbally, not in writing, that there was no \nviolation. We said: Great; we will wait for your letter. It is \nmy understanding they are still waiting for that letter.\n\n  As far as they know, that is still a case pending. All of the work \nwas done, a decision was rendered verbally, and that ought to dispose \nof it. I know for that year it was still a case pending. For an \nemployer, sometimes this gray cloud hangs over, even after they have \nbeen assured there is no problem. That shows up in these statistics of \nthe backlog.\n  The other number presented, the number they worked, actually \nincreased; the number pending evidently was not pending in the next \nyear. So they were working a full 37,000 cases in 1997, plus a few more \nto work that backlog down.\n  This agency has been working the cases. They have been eliminating \nextra cases, some of which I do not think should have been part of the \nbacklog anyway. Now we are talking about significantly increasing the \namount of dollars. There would be an appropriate time to do that.\n  One of the things we talked about in a hearing in the subcommittee \nwas the legal fees these businesses have to put up when cases are \nbrought, and the cases, in some instances, are frivolous. At any rate, \nthe decision ought to be on whether the small business wins or not, and \nif they win, they ought to get back the costs they have expended on \nthis.\n  Part of the testimony in that hearing was from some other employers \nwho would never take a case to the NLRB because they know it is going \nto be more expensive to fight it than to pay it. That is not the way \nthe American Government is supposed to work. Businesses are not \nsupposed to live in fear of expensive litigation by their Federal \nGovernment with their tax money.\n  Perhaps an increase ought to accompany making a change where there is \nsome reimbursement for these small business employers who win--only \nwhen they win. But there could be a degree of fairness built in this at \nthe same time there is an increase. Until that happens, the community \nhealth centers are the place to put the money.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first I will speak to procedure and \nthen to substance.\n  I apologize to my friend from Arkansas, for whom I have a lot of \nrespect even though we do not agree on all issues. I used the words \n``sneak through,'' and I should not have said that. He is above board, \nand I know that. However, I do want to make it clear, my very good \nfriend, Senator Harkin, was talking to someone when that happened and \ntherefore was not fully aware of this agreement.\n  The fact is, on our side we believe this goes against our \nunderstanding of the way we operate. There was no intention of going \nforward with a unanimous consent agreement that would limit this to 1 \nhour with no second-degree amendments.\n  I say one more time, I certainly hope my colleague from Arkansas will \nunderstand that. I hope he will understand this is above and beyond the \ndebate. We can always debate issues. This is generating a lot of anger \nand indignation.\n  For my own part, I am committed to doing a second-degree amendment on \nevery amendment that comes to the floor forthwith, with no time limit \nat all, because I believe this should not have gone this way as a \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The reason I feel strongly about the procedure is because of the \nsubstance of what this is about. To me, it is a matter of justice \ndelayed is justice denied. I tell you, what is real important in our \ncountry is that people have the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively, to earn a decent living, to give their children the care \nthey know they need and deserve.\n  Frankly, we ought to be doing much more by way of labor law reform. \nBut when you cut into the NLRB's budget, and you are going to reduce \nstaff by an additional 100 women and men, the only thing you are doing \nis you are making it impossible for many working people to have \njustice.\n  I do not even know the figures because I came rushing to the floor \nwhen I heard about this, but there are well over 10,000 people who are \nillegally fired. And quite often----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Is the Senator aware that the amendment does not cut \nthe budget for the NLRB, that it only flat-lines, it only eliminates \nthe increase in funding at a time when only 4 percent are being \nadjudicated and the number of cases is falling?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I am well aware \nthat it flat-lines, but it is similar to what we talk about with the \nveterans' health care budget. When you flat-line, and you do not take \ninto account additional inflation, then basically the effect of it is a \nreduction.\n  My understanding is that you have a reduction of about 5 percent. If \nthat is the effect, and if we cut into the man and woman power \nrequirements of the\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nNational Labor Relations Board, I am unalterably opposed to this \nbecause working people in this country have a right to be able to make \nan appeal. It should not be profitable for companies to illegally fire \npeople. It should not be easy for companies to break the law. When we \ntry to go after the NLRB, what we are doing is going after the rights \nof working people.\n  So I say to my colleagues, an awful lot is at stake here. The \nNational Labor Relations Board is all about a framework of laws we have \nset up in our country. It is all about making sure working people have \ncertain rights. I think this amendment guts some of those rights by \nbasically stripping away some of our enforcement power.\n  So I say to my colleague on the other side of the aisle that I do not \naccept this choice he presents to us. I think my colleague from Iowa \nprobably will be talking about what he has heard from the community \nhealth care clinics. But to pit one group of low-income citizens \nagainst another group of low- and moderate-income people, working-\nincome people, I think is simply outrageous.\n  Knowing the people I have met who work at the community health care \nclinics, I doubt the people who work at our community health care \nclinics are interested in some additional funding for them if that \nmeans taking away from the rights of working people. We are basically \ntalking about the same group of citizens--hard working, not necessarily \nmaking a lot of money, hoping that they will get a fair shake, hoping \nthat they will get decent health care, or hoping that their rights will \nbe respected.\n  I again say to my colleagues that when you flat-line the budget, you \neffectively cut the budget. You cut into the NLRB's capacity and \nability to represent working people. There will be more and more and \nmore delay. As my colleague from Pennsylvania said, justice delayed is \njustice denied. That is what this amendment is--it is a justice \ndelayed/justice denied amendment as it affects working people in this \ncountry.\n\n  Therefore, I would like to have the opportunity--we would like to \nhave the opportunity to offer a second-degree amendment. I hope my \ncolleague from Arkansas will reconsider, given the fact that there is, \nat best, confusion about what happened; and we are hoping we can go on \ntogether in good faith. If not, I say, one more time, that for my own \npart, I will just offer second-degree amendments to every single \namendment offered on the other side of the aisle, with no time limit \nwhatsoever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator from Pennsylvania have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could have 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I hope I can have the attention of Senators and the Senator from \nArkansas, the proponent of the amendment.\n  I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health \nCenters on the phone. They said to me that I could say the following \nthings publicly:\n  No. 1, they did not ask for nor seek this amendment.\n  No. 2, they are quite happy with the Specter-Harkin increases that \ncame in the appropriations bill and hope that we can keep it in \nconference--which I publicly assure them and others that we will do \neverything we can to keep the $100 million increase.\n  And, No. 3, while they appreciate the intention of the Senator from \nArkansas to get more funding for community health centers, they do not \nwant it to happen at the expense of the NLRB.\n  So I just spoke with the National Association of Community Health \nCenters. I wanted to make that point; that they would not want this to \nhappen at the expense of the NLRB.\n  I yield back my time, I guess.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I might just respond to the Senator from Iowa.\n  I do not know who he spoke to at the health centers. I suppose \nwhoever it was is a spokesman for all of them. But the ones I would \nlike to speak for are the 83,000 people who could be served if this \namendment were adopted. The $25 million, it is estimated, would allow \nthese health centers to be able to serve 83,000 more people. Those are \nthe ones I am concerned about. I am not so much concerned about whoever \nin Washington, DC, decided that the NLRB needed a big increase.\n  The fact is, the NLRB has said with this increased funding they will \nhire 122 more people, and they will buy an $11 million computer system. \nSo I would say to the Senator from Minnesota, that is the issue. Do you \nwant an $11 million computer system for the NLRB and 122 more employees \nor do you want to help 83,000 more people to get health care in the \ndelta and the poor areas of this country who are currently not \nreceiving it?\n  It is a pretty simple issue. We can try to cloud it with \nparliamentary questions. We can try to cloud it with questions about a \nUC that was adopted. But there is a very fundamental question in which \nI believe very strongly.\n  I oftentimes hear the Senator from Minnesota speak with great passion \nand the Senator from Iowa speak with great passion as to how they are \nprepared to create a problem in the Senate in order to further their \ngoals. I admire them. I respect them for their commitment.\n  I just say, I have a deep belief about those who are being served by \nthese community health centers. I have visited them. I see the good \nwork they do. I see the fact that poor people can walk in and not have \nto worry about presenting an insurance policy in order to get help. I \nknow the value of helping those little children in the delta when they \nget preventive health care services now and what that is going to save \nus down the line, not only in terms of our budget but in terms of the \nquality of life that they are going to be able to live.\n  Once again, I reiterate the numbers concerning the NLRB. We have \nseen, over the last 25 years, their budget cut by 21 percent, while the \ncaseloads have dropped 31 percent. This isn't a new thing. Last year, \nwe flat-lined their budget, and the result was they had fewer cases \nfiled and a smaller backlog with a flat-line budget.\n  I think anybody who will listen to the arguments and look at the \nnumbers will have a difficult time accepting the logic that they need \nto hire 122 more people and buy an $11 million computer system, having \na $25 million increase in their budget at a time we could be helping \npoor people get health care around this country.\n  So it is a very clear question. I think clouding it is not the answer \nas to how we resolve it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think we have just reached an agreement informally, \nwhich I would like to propound now as a unanimous consent request.\n  The earlier unanimous consent request prohibiting a second-degree \namendment is vitiated. We will now proceed to have the Senator from \nArkansas offer a second-degree amendment to his first-degree amendment. \nWe will have 30 minutes of debate.\n  It has now been reduced to writing. I will begin again. I ask \nunanimous consent that the previous consent agreement relating to the \npending Hutchinson amendment be vitiated. I ask consent that prior to a \nmotion to table the second-degree amendment to be presented forthwith \nby the Senator from Arkansas, the time be limited to 30 minutes equally \ndivided, and following the disposition of the Hutchinson second-degree \namendment, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reserving the right to object--and I don't intend to \nobject--should the motion on my second degree be a motion to table and \nthe\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\ntabling motion failed, would my second degree still be the pending \nbusiness? I need an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If it fails, then Senator Wellstone will be recognized \nfor offering a second degree.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Should the motion to table fail, I would assume by \nvoice vote my second-degree amendment would be adopted, and then at \nthat point Senator Wellstone would be recognized to offer a second \ndegree. Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could not hear all of this.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. My question is, at the end of the 30 minutes of \ndebate on my second-degree amendment, should there be a motion to table \nmy second degree, and if the motion to table were to fail, my \nassumption is that we would at that point adopt my second degree by \nvoice vote, at which point Senator Wellstone would be recognized to \noffer his second degree. I just wanted that clarified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Reserving the right to object, a question to the \nmanager: Wasn't there a time limit agreed to, if there is a Wellstone \nsecond degree. I thought we were at 30 or 45 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Minnesota be willing to stipulate \nnow to a time agreement, if he is to offer a second-degree amendment, \nsay, to 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say, in good faith, that I am \nnot going to make it open-ended. I am now waiting word from other \noffices as to who will be down here, so I can't agree to a time limit, \nalthough I don't intend to extend it for hours. I have to wait and see \nhow many people want to speak. For right now, I think we should leave \nit as it was and hope my colleagues will trust me that I am not trying \nto drag it on and on. I can't agree to that right now.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a question to the Senator from \nMinnesota, it is your anticipation that it would be relevant to the \nfirst degree?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No objection to the unanimous-consent agreement which we \nhave propounded with modifications.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1834 To Amendment No. 1812\n\n              (Purpose: To transfer amounts appropriated)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1834 to amendment No. 1812.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n\n             ``of funds for the consolidated health centers\n\n       ``Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $25,471,000 of the amounts appropriated for the National \n     Labor Relations Board under this Act shall be transferred and \n     utilized to carry out projects for the consolidated health \n     centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 254b).''\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, under the UC, it is my understanding \nthat there is no time limit currently on the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes under the unanimous \nconsent, equally divided on the Senator's second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is fine.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me a couple \nminutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't mean to take any more time of the Senator from \nArkansas. I can't help poking a little bit at him before the vote.\n  It is interesting that the Senator from Arkansas is trying to take \n$25 million out of the NLRB for the community health centers. Why \ndidn't the Senator from Arkansas try to take $25 million out of the \ndefense appropriations to help the community health centers? Why didn't \nhe try to take $25 million out of energy and water or all the other 12 \nappropriations bills that came down here? Why go after the NLRB?\n  As I pointed out, I just spoke with the Association of Community \nHealth Centers. They said that while they appreciate his intentions of \ngiving them more money, they don't want to do it at the expense of the \nNLRB. I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, my staff talked to the community \nhealth centers, and they clarified that they do not oppose this \namendment. In fact, while they may have concerns about how they are \ngetting involved in a political fight before the Senate that may affect \ntheir relationship with the appropriators, in fact I think they would \nvery much welcome the additional $25 million for health care in rural \nareas. That is where their heart is. They want to help people. They are \nnot going to turn away $25 million to help.\n  The Senator from Iowa is concerned about why I didn't take this from \nthe Department of Defense bill or shift it from something else, and why \nwe chose the NLRB. I think I made that case very convincingly. They \nhave done an excellent job. They ought to be commended for their \npriorities and their impact analysis system by which the most critical \ncases are taken first.\n  They have seen a decrease in the backlog. They have seen a decrease \nin the number of cases being filed--all the time not seeing an increase \nin their budget. To increase it by $25 million so they can buy an $11 \nmillion computer and hire 122 more people at a time when there are tens \nof thousands of people in the poor areas of this country being left \nuninsured and without access to basic health care, I think, is a pretty \neasy call.\n  While I think I can make a strong case for why we need to increase \ndefense spending, when we have treatment goals failing in virtually \nevery branch of the military, with the exception of the Marines, and \nwhen we see tens of thousands of our men and women in uniform on food \nstamps, I can tell you why I didn't take it from defense. But the more \nimportant question is why NLRB? Because it is a Washington bureaucracy \nthat is going to get bigger under that plan to buy a computer and hire \n122 more people at a time when they have seen a decrease in the \nworkload. That is why. It is very simple.\n  I know there is a need in the community health centers, and I want to \nhelp them. This is a little bit of help. It is enough help to provide \nhealth care for an additional 83,000 people nationwide. And some of \nthose folks are going to be in the delta of Arkansas.\n  This is not a difficult amendment to vote for. It is a pretty easy \ncase. I have had to come down and defend a lot of amendments on this \nfloor, but I don't think I have ever had one that I felt more strongly \nabout personally or for which it was easier to make the case.\n  The budget for the NLRB has been cut over the years. From 1980 to \n1998--over that 18-year period--their budget declined 21 percent. That \nsounds pretty bad until you realize the number of charges received and \nprocessed declined 10 percent more than that--31 percent.\n  To stand on the floor of the Senate and say we are disenfranchising, \nthat we are denying justice by not increasing by $25 million the budget \nfor a Washington bureaucracy, I am sorry; I don't think that sells. And \nI don't think it is too convincing to those who are going to be denied \nhealth care by the defeat of this amendment.\n  They have done a good job in reducing the backlog. They have done a \ngood job in seeing a fewer number of charges. And they have done so \nwith lower budgets over the last 18 years. It doesn't make any sense \nnow to increase it dramatically by $25 million so they can hire 122 \nmore people and buy an $11 million computer system.\n  I suggest that money would be better used by people in the poor \ncommunities, in the rural areas of this country, to ensure that they \ncan walk in--44 percent of them are children--and not have to worry \nabout presenting insurance documentation when they go\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\ninto these health centers; that they can get treatment. Eighty-three \nthousand more people would be served. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commented earlier that I would defer to \nthe statistics. I am about to put a detailed chart into the Record. It \nis true that the backlog went down from about 6,200 to about 5,500 \nbecause we added $10 million to the budget. We are now proposing to add \napproximately $24 million to the budget, which will buy a computer, \nwhich is not inexpensive. Computers are expensive. That will enable the \nNLRB to move part way into the latter part of the 20th century, if not \nthe 21st century.\n  The projection is that the backlog would then be reduced to about \n1,960 cases. If this is not done, there are many employees who are now \nat the NLRB who would be lost. I think it is plain that for the NLRB to \nkeep up with the backlog and do its job, they need these additional \nemployees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     MAJOR WORKLOAD AND OUTPUT DATA\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          FY 1998    FY 1999    FY 2000\n                                           actual    estimate   request\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1) Regional Offices:\n  Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Cases:\n    Situations Pending Preliminary           7,434      6,198      5,487\n     Investigation at Start of Year....\n    Case Intake During Year............  \\1\\ 30,42     30,200     32,000\n                                                 2\n    Consolidation of Dispositions......  \\1\\ 2,327      2,880      2,880\n    Total ULP Proceedings..............     29,331     29,831     32,647\n    Situations Pending Preliminary           6,198      5,487      1,960\n     Investigation at End of Year......\n  Representation Cases:\n    Case Intake During Year............  \\1\\ 6,215      6,179      6,179\n    Dispositions.......................      3,091      3,012      3,218\n    Regional Directors Decisions.......        769        704        722\n(2) Administrative Law Judges:\n  Hearings Pending at Start of Year....      1,210      1,106      1,046\n  Hearings Closed......................        444        521        573\n  Hearings Pending at End of Year......      1,106      1,046        958\n  Adjustments After Hearings Closed....          0          1          1\n  Decisions Pending at Start of Year...        216        134        120\n  Decisions Issued.....................        528        538        590\n  Decisions Pending at End of Year.....        134        120        107\n(3) Board Adjudication:\n  Contested Board Decisions Issued.....        426        532        556\n  Representation Election Cases:\n    Decisions Issued...................        275        237        248\n    Objection Rulings..................        214        171        187\n(4) General Counsel--Washington:\n  Advice Pending at Start of Year......         58        129        172\n  Advice Cases Received During Year....        762        716        760\n  Advice Disposed......................        691        673        785\n  Advice Pending at End of Year........        129        172        147\n  Appeals Pending at Start of Year.....        980        910      1,077\n  Appeals Received During Year.........      3,316      3,313      3,401\n  Appeals Disposed.....................      3,386      3,146      3,828\n  Appeals Pending at End of Year.......        910      1,077        650\n  Enforcement Cases Received During            271        287        304\n   Year................................\n  Enforcement Briefs Filed.............        145        152        161\n  Enforcement Cases Dropped or Settled.         63         64         68\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Actual figures for FY 1998 are preliminary and still being\n  reconciled.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had announced earlier my hope to stack \nthe votes. But in light of the procedural context that we are in now, I \nam advised that there will not be an agreement to set this amendment \naside. It is my hope that we can vote as promptly as possible.\n  I move to table the Hutchinson second-degree amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his \namendment.\n  I have followed the activities of the NLRB for many years--since I \ncame to the Senate, in fact. It is certainly not clear to me that this \nagency needs a $25 million increase over last year's level--\nparticularly when the subcommittee was forced to be so frugal with a \nnumber of other high priority programs.\n  I support the reallocation of these funds to the Consolidated Health \nServices account for the Community Health Centers. We have long worried \nabout access to primary health care for low-income families. This \namendment is a way that we can provide such care for 83,000 more \nAmericans.\n  The Senator from Iowa said that he was told the association \nrepresenting community health centers did not request this amendment. I \ncam appreciate the rationale of the association. They, of course, \nrecognize the hard work done by the subcommittee in putting together \nthis bill and wish to support that by taking a neutral position on the \nHutchinson amendment.\n  However, let's put the amendment in perspective. The NLRB is getting \na $25 million increase--an unprecedented increase--over 10 percent. \nThere has been no justification offered for this increase. The caseload \nhas consistently declined over the decade.\n  Now, the appropriations committee has provided an increase for the \ncommunity health centers of $99.3 million. This is badly needed, \ncomparison with the NLRB notwithstanding.\n  The additional funds provided by the Hutchinson amendment would \npermit health centers to serve 83,000 more people. That is the most \nimportant point, to me.\n  Mr. President, let's compare: $25 million for 122 more federal \nemployees and new computers versus health care for 83,000 Americans. \nThis is a no brainer for me.\n  I hope it is for my colleagues as well. I urge Senators to support \nthe Hutchinson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there still time remaining on the \nHutchinson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that time is allocated to each side, if I might yield \nto the chairman of the subcommittee at this point, I don't want to \ndelay the proceedings, if he wants to move to a vote. It is my \nunderstanding there is time remaining on the debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as manager of the bill, I do wish to move \nto a vote. I would be delighted to hear how much time the Senator from \nIllinois wants, to hear his closing argument, and then to proceed to a \nvote on the tabling motion.\n  How much time would he like?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes would be more than enough.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree. There is another unanimous consent agreement on \ntop of that. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nIllinois speaks for up to 10 minutes, we move to a vote on the tabling \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. With 2 minutes for Senator Hutchinson to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  This is a difficult choice which is offered to us by the Senator from \nArkansas in terms of transferring money because hardly any Member of \nthe Senate will argue that community health centers should have more \nresources. We opened a new one in my hometown. It is very important in \nmany rural areas. In smalltown America, these community health centers \nprovide health care that is not otherwise available. So in that regard \nI applaud his effort. I only take exception to his source.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has been a pain in the side of big \nbusiness for over 60 years because it is a mechanism for dealing with \ndisputes between employers and employees and employees and labor \nunions.\n  There has been an effort by those who cannot repeal the law creating \nthis agency to reduce the resources of the agency and make the delays \nin the backlog so insufferable that the agency virtually was stopped in \nits tracks. Not that many years ago there was a hard freeze on this \nagency which resulted in slowing down the process for years.\n  As I travel around the State of Illinois, and I listen to my \ncolleagues from other parts of the Nation, I find that if you are \ntrying to organize a plant, for example, to bring in a labor union, and \nthere is some dispute about whether both sides are following the law, \nit is almost impossible to turn to the NLRB and expect a timely \ndecision on violations of the law. As a consequence, the whole effort \nof collective bargaining, which has been a recognized legal right in \nthis country for decades, is jeopardized because of efforts to strangle \nthis agency.\n  This is not a voluntary reduction in NLRB funds. This is an effort to \nstop its mission. Frankly, I think that is a serious mistake because we \nunderstand as well that some of the rights that are protected by the \nNational Labor Relations Board were rights that were fought for over \nthe years by many people who gave their blood and their lives to make \ncertain that the concept principle of collective bargaining would be \nrecognized.\n  Listen to this about the agency backlog currently facing the NLRB. \nDespite\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\nthe agency's success in screening out tens of thousands of public \ninquiries and voluntarily resolving the vast majority of its \nrepresentation in unfair labor practice, backlogs continue to grow with \nno concomitant increases in staffing.\n  I salute the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and his counterpart on the Democratic side, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. They have recognized it and put $25 million into the NLRB.\n  When you look to where this money is being spent, it is for things \nthat are absolutely essential--training the people who work there, the \nattorneys, the hearing officers, and the like to make sure people get a \nfair chance and their day in court.\n  The Senator from Arkansas closes out that possibility. He takes the \n$25 million away.\n  Some of the funds here are used to modernize computer equipment to \ndeal with the Y2K problem. The Senator from Arkansas, by cutting $25 \nmillion, makes that more difficult to achieve. A lot of the money is \nused for basic administration of the agency, relocating people where \nthey are needed, where the workload is growing. The Senator from \nArkansas steps in the path of that. I suggest to those listening to the \ndebate on this amendment, don't just dwell on where the money is going. \nLook to the source of the money.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania very eloquently has presented the fact \nthat the backlogs are still a problem and, if we adopt the approach of \nthe Senator from Arkansas, we are going to be, if not turning out the \nlights, dimming the lights in a very important agency where justice is \npart of the agenda; in fact, it is the reason for the existence of the \nagency.\n  Looking at what the NLRB has accomplished in a very short period of \ntime, one understands why they need to be in business and fully \nstaffed. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board cases resulted \nin reinstatement offers to 4,500 American employees who alleged \nunlawful firing or layoff. They also had cases that resulted in back \npay and other monetary recovery to more than 24,000 American workers \ntotaling more than $92 million. They also held nearly 3,800 \nrepresentation elections affecting a quarter million American workers.\n  What the Senator from Arkansas does with his amendment is restrict \nthe power of this agency to do its job, to say to America's workers \nfrom one coast to the other, they are not going to be able to call this \nagency and expect it to be there and be responsive.\n  If you decide in a democratic election by majority vote at your \nbusiness to bargain collectively and to seek representation of a union, \nthe Senator from Arkansas makes sure your telephone call goes \nunanswered at NLRB when you need a helping hand to resolve a dispute \nbetween employer and employee. If you are someone fired and fired \nillegally or unlawfully, who turns to the Federal legal network, the \nNational Labor Relations Board, and says, I was discriminated against, \nI was unlawfully fired, the Senator from Arkansas makes certain your \ntelephone call is not likely to be answered.\n  Mr. President, $25 million is taken out of the agency, including \nmoney for computer modernization. On the whole question of whether or \nnot you are going to have union representation in a free and democratic \nprocess and whether you have the National Labor Relations Board to make \nsure both sides follow the rules, the Senator from Arkansas, with his \namendment, takes the $25 million out of this agency which is necessary \nfor them to keep up with their workload.\n  I say those who oppose the National Labor Relations Board and want to \nclose it down should do it in a clean vote. Put your amendment on the \nfloor to close it down, have it up or down, and decide whether American \nworkers will have this forum for protection or not. But to bleed off \nfrom this agency $25 million they need to protect workers across the \nUnited States in the name of helping community health centers is a \ntactic that should be exposed for what it is. It is an effort to take \naway from a very important agency the resources they need to respond to \nthe requests of American workers across the Nation.\n  I might add for those who think this is another labor amendment or \nantilabor amendment, those who dispute the treatment under their labor \nagreements, employees who believe labor organizations are not treating \nthem fairly, have the National Labor Relations Board to turn to as \nwell; it is not just the private sector companies.\n  American workers' rights are at stake here. This is not just a \nquestion of health care in rural areas, which I support; it is a \nquestion of whether or not we will protect the hard-fought-for rights \nof American workers across the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, to table this motion, to stand by this \nsubcommittee, and make sure the National Labor Relations Board has the \nresources it needs to do the job that is very important to American \nworkers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I regret that the Senator from \nIllinois implies that I deny the employees of this country their right \nunder the National Labor Relations Act. I certainly would not imply by \nhis position that he supports denying 83,000 Americans health care \nserved under the $25 million added to the budget of the health centers. \nI wouldn't make such a suggestion. I regret he made such a suggestion \nbefore the Senate.\n  If we were denying justice for employees, I would not offer this \namendment. The reality is, we are not cutting a dime from the NLRB. We \nare only eliminating the $25 million increase so they can hire 122 more \nemployees and a computer system at a time when the caseload is \ndecreasing. Mr. President, a 31-percent decrease in caseload I don't \nthink justifies a $25 million increase in funding.\n  It is not hard to understand. Make that case to the American people. \nI will go out and say this is what we should do, flat-line their budget \nat a time they have decreasing workload and put more money into \ncommunity health centers. That is what this amendment does.\n  If Members want to vote against community health centers and vote for \nmore bureaucracy, Members have their opportunity. I want to serve those \n83,000 people who will receive health care because of this $25 million \ninfusion into this very worthwhile program. It is bureaucrats at the \nNLRB--122 more employees--or serving people who need health care, \nprimarily children.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the children of this country, not the \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under a previous order, the question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1834. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I ask unanimous consent to have a technical correction from \nwhat the legislative service drafters had, to change ``line 18'' to \n``line 14.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to object until I look at the change in \nthe language.\n  The wrong page number. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today as Americans head off to work, 17 of \nthem will die and 18,600 of them will be injured on the job. All of us \non the Labor Committee have worked very hard to make sure those numbers \ncome down--not go up. We do not want an increase; we want a dramatic \ndecrease in deaths. We want a dramatic decrease in the number who are \ninjured. I repeat: 17 working Americans will not be returning home \ntonight because they will die on the job.\n  As chairman of the Worker Safety Subcommittee, I feel responsible to \nthose families for making sure we are doing all we can to prevent those \nhorrible accidents from occurring in the first place. I feel \nresponsible for finding solutions that will help protect more workers \nfrom harm.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, is the \nGovernment agency responsible for regulating safety laws in America. \nThe way OSHA is supposed to work is that it should be providing helpful \nassistance to the overwhelming number of employers who are actively \npursuing safer workplaces. And I can tell you that according to OSHA:\n\n       . . . 95 percent of the employers do their level best to \n     try to voluntarily comply with OSHA.\n\n  ``Voluntarily comply with OSHA''--that was stated by Frank Strasheim, \nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary of OSHA.\n  Simultaneously, OSHA should be effectively targeting those employers \nwho are willfully disregarding safety laws. They should be inspecting \nthem. They should be fining them. And they should follow up to ensure \nthe bad practices are stopped before accidents occur.\n  But everyone knows that is not what is actually happening. What is \nhappening is that OSHA lumps all employers together--both the good and \nthe bad--treats them the same, and tries to inspect and fine them all, \nno matter how small or ridiculous the violation. Meanwhile, serious and \npotentially deadly practices go uninspected and unstopped. The result \nis disastrous and, unfortunately, often fatal.\n  I am not trying to decrease any funding for OSHA. What this amendment \ndoes is shift the emphasis so that there is some money being spent on \nconsultation. We have had a lot of hearings. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion. We have said that prevention is where we want to be, \nprevention of an accident, not persecution after a death. That is not \nhow this is supposed to work.\n\n  As reported in the Associated Press, three-quarters of the worksites \nin the United States that had serious accidents in 1994 and 1995 had \nnever been inspected by OSHA during this decade. The report also showed \nthat even OSHA officials acknowledge that their inspectors do not get \nto a lion's share of lethal sites until after accidents occur because \nit takes OSHA, according to the AFL-CIO, over 167 years to reach every \nworksite in this country. We want them to be able to serve everyone, \nbut 167 years? That means the budget would have to be increased 167 \ntimes to do that. The fact is that OSHA neither helps those good-faith \nemployers who want to achieve compliance with the safety laws, nor \neffectively deters bad employers from breaking the law.\n  How long does it take to get an inspection? That varies quite a bit \nby State. Those that are State plan States get a little bit more \nfrequent visits than those that are not State plan States. So the \nFederal ones, some of them, it will be more than 200 years that they \nhave the odds of not getting an inspection.\n  This point is so important, I will say again, because it takes OSHA \nover 167 years to reach every worksite in this country. The fact is \nthat OSHA neither helps those good-faith employers who want to achieve \ncompliance with safety laws, nor effectively deters bad employers from \nbreaking the law. OSHA's response has been to ask Congress for more and \nmore enforcement dollars. I say that response is no response. I say \nthat response only begs the question. Using OSHA's framework, the \nscenario would be as follows: Since it takes 167 years for OSHA to \ninvestigate every worksite in the country, we would need to increase \nOSHA's enforcement budget 167 times in order for OSHA to inspect every \nworksite every year. It doesn't take as long when they are doing \nconsultation, and it reduces accidents.\n  Increasing it 167 times would be a reckless, unrealistic suggestion \nthat doesn't even get to the heart of the problem. That is not even the \nworst part. The worst part is what OSHA's response for more enforcement \ndollars\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\nsays to those 95 percent of employers who are doing their level best to \ncomply. It says: Hey, Mr. Good-Faith Employer, we know you are trying \nto comply, but you are out of luck because even if you are trying to be \nsafe, if you don't know what you are doing, or if you make a wrong \ninterpretation of the statute, we are going to fine you. We are going \nto fine you big.\n  Here are the facts: Employers have to read through, try to understand \nand interpret, and implement over 1,200 pages of highly technical \nsafety regulations--1,200 pages. That is what I have right here. Do you \nknow how big numbers like that are in Washington? I want to make this \nclear as possible so I brought a little show and tell.\n  Before I do that, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1885 To Amendment No. 1846\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify provisions relating to expenditures by the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration by authorizing 50 percent \nof the amount appropriated that is in excess of the amount appropriated \n    for such purpose for fiscal year 1999 to be used for compliance \n  assistance and 50 percent of such amount for enforcement and other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment and \nsend it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1885 to amendment No. 1846.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following: \n     ``That of the amount appropriated under this heading that is \n     in excess of the amount appropriated for such purposes for \n     fiscal year 1999, $16,883,000 shall be used to carry out the \n     activities described in paragraph (1) and $16,883,000 shall \n     be used to carry out paragraphs (2) through (6);''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was mentioning these regulations, these \n1,200 pages of regulations. That is what we expect the businessman to \nknow, understand, and implement. Just imagine, Dodd's Bootery in \nLaramie or Corral West Ranchware in Cheyenne or Bubba's Barbeque in \nJackson. They are supposed to have understood all five of these huge \nvolumes. There are more pages in these OSHA regulations than ``Gone \nwith the Wind'' or ``The Canterbury Tales'' or even the Old Testament \nand the New Testament combined. Adding insult to injury, in many cases \nOSHA's regulations are so complicated and so complex that even if you \nread through it all, deciding one correct interpretation of a rule is \nnearly impossible.\n  Take OSHA's draft safety and health rule, for example. This is the \ndraft one. This is one I have a lot of concern about. What this draft \nrule would require is for almost all employers, regardless of their \nsize or type, to put in place a written safety plan. Now, I am in favor \nof safety plans. I know that safety plans make a difference in safety \nin the workplace. I have watched that. But this is a draft rule. It \nsounds right. This is not only mandatory, but the elements of the rule \nare completely subjective to human nature.\n  For example, the rule requires the program, and I quote, to be \n``appropriate'' to conditions in the workplace and an employer to \nevaluate the effectiveness of the program. He is supposed to evaluate \nthe effectiveness as often as necessary, and where appropriate, to \ninitiate corrective action. So I throw out this question to the Senate: \nHow often is as often as necessary? Is it once a month? Once a week? \nEvery day? I can envision 1,000 different responses from 1,000 \ndifferent angles. So how on Earth do we expect small businesses to \ncope, not only with reading these five volumes but also to understand \nwhat is meant by them, how OSHA would interpret them, and then to draw \nup a safety plan?\n  That, however, is exactly what the draft rule expects every small \nbusiness in this country to do. The safety subcommittee, which I chair, \nhas had two hearings examining the effects of OSHA. The first was a \nhearing to highlight how so many good-faith employers want safe \nworkplaces but are drowning in these 1,200 pages of highly technical \nsafety regulations. Every single one of the employers who came to the \nhearing agreed that they were left to their own to comply with every \none of the thousands of rules without helpful assistance from OSHA.\n  The second hearing we held was about the flip side of that coin, how \nOSHA is not deterring the bad employers from willfully violating safety \nlaws either. The subcommittee heard from family members who lost loved \nones in workplace accidents and how OSHA neither helped prevent those \naccidents from occurring nor adequately responded after the accidents \ntook place.\n  To those people who have told me that the new OSHA is on the right \ntrack and that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' I ask them to read \nthrough our hearing transcript and see if it will change their minds. \nSince I don't have much time, I would like to tell my colleagues about \none of the witnesses who testified before our subcommittee whose name \nis Ron Hayes.\n  In 1993, Ron and his family didn't know much about OSHA and were not \nall that active in the worker safety scene. But in 1993, Ron's 19-year-\nold son, Patrick, was killed at his job in a grain elevator in Florida \nafter being pulled under the grain and suffocated. Losing his son \nchanged Ron's entire life. Since that time, Ron has worked day in and \nday out to get answers about how to make employees safer and healthier.\n\n  Ron and his wife, Dot, struggled to understand why more hadn't been \ndone on behalf of their son and what could be done in the future to \nchange the tide of workers' injuries and deaths.\n  Ron and Dot founded Families In Grief Holding Together, called FIGHT. \nIt is a project to help other families enact changes in the arena of \nworkplace safety and to work through grief. Ron Hayes is one of the \nmost courageous and honest people I have ever met in my life, not to \nmention the fact that he has become one of the most proficient OSHA \nexperts in the country. His story continues to inspire me and push me \nforward.\n  Reading an excerpt from Ron's testimony:\n\n       Each year over 10,000 people are killed on the job. In \n     1993, one of those who died was our beloved son, Patrick \n     Hayes. I did not come here today to rebuke or chastise \n     anyone. I am simply here to plead--no, to beg you great \n     statesmen to work together to come up with positive solutions \n     for a better agency. No one wants to get rid of OSHA, we just \n     want the agency to do its job, protect workers, help train \n     and support business. I ask you great statesmen to lay down \n     your party affiliations and work toward a common goal.\n       I often wonder why the good businesses in our country \n     continue to stay safe. Sometimes they are at a disadvantage \n     by their own good deeds. These good businesses build into \n     their product or bids safety measures and are sometimes \n     undercut or underbid by other uncaring business owners, so \n     under our present OSHA system, where is their benefit? The \n     bad companies know OSHA is ineffective and because of the \n     length of time it will take OSHA to inspect every work site \n     or get around to inspecting them, the odds are on their side \n     and even if caught, they know OSHA will not do much.\n       OSHA's reactive enforcement methodology has not and is not \n     working. Letting OSHA continue in this manner and giving them \n     more and more money each year for enforcement and getting \n     less and less each year is just crazy. Someone has to take a \n     stand and make some hard decisions for our very future.\n\n  Ron's strong, unwavering stand is that OSHA consultation, rather than \nreactive ``find and fine'' enforcement, is the answer that will save \nworkers like Patrick from being killed on the job.\n  I agree with Ron. That is why I am here today with this amendment.\n  The amendment isn't to decrease the enforcement of OSHA. The \namendment is to make sure there is an increase in consultation, an \nincrease in the people who go to the places to look for the problem, \ninterpret the problem, suggest the solution, and also make it a bigger \npenalty if they come back later and it hasn't been solved.\n  My amendment is simple. It puts half of the $33 million increase into \nOSHA's budget, into a consultation group program that helps employers \nknow how to comply. The other half is still an increase directed \ntowards OSHA enforcement.\n  What is OSHA consultation? OSHA consultation is the effective \nalternative to OSHA enforcement. It is what is currently working well \nand is highly praised by employees and employers. It is praised by the \nagency,\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nand it has been praised by this Congress.\n  It allows employers to call OSHA and ask them to come in and help \nthem read through the five volumes of OSHA regulations to see what \napplies to them and how to turn the regulations into tangible safety \nsolutions. It allows employers to ask questions, to get help from the \ninside, and partner with the agency, all without threat of fines or \ncitations. It makes it a little safer for them to ask OSHA questions. \nThat can be as intimidating as it would be for a person to ask the IRS \nquestions. But the consultation function gives them that opportunity. \nThey are expected to fix what is found.\n  Consultation works. The fact is that you cannot force an employer to \ncomply with regulations he doesn't understand or does not know how to \nimplement. It doesn't do any good to threaten employers to comply when \nthey do not know how. If an employer isn't getting the help he needs, \nan inspection won't make the difference. The key is helping employers \nto understand what the regulations mean and how they work.\n  Consultation is the answer because it puts the emphasis on \npartnership, cooperation, and information sharing. And if, as OSHA \nestimates, 95 percent of American employers are trying to do the right \nthing, spending money on consultation is money well spent because the \nvast majority of employers will take OSHA's suggestions to heart and \nbecome safer without the threat of fines and coercion.\n  That allows OSHA to concentrate on the bad employers, to put some \nspecial emphasis there, to go after the people who don't make the \ncorrection, the people who aren't interested in safety and are relying \non getting away on that 167-year inspection schedule.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Look at what Vice President \nGore has said about the virtues of consultation:\n\n       No army of federal auditors descends upon American \n     businesses to audit their books; the Government forces them \n     to have the job done themselves. In the same way, no army of \n     OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate America.\n\n  In his Report on Reinventing Government, the Vice President concluded \nthat employers should be encouraged by OSHA to use private safety \nprofessionals as a way to vastly improve the health and safety of \nAmerican workers ``without bankrupting the federal treasury.'' Such an \napproach would ``ensure that all workplaces are regularly inspected, \nwithout hiring thousands of new employees.'' By establishing incentives \ndesigned to encourage workplaces to comply, ``[w]orksites with good \nhealth, safety, and compliance records would be allowed to report less \nfrequently to the Labor Department, to undergo fewer audits, and to \nsubmit to less paperwork.'' He concluded by saying that ``No army of \nfederal auditors descends upon American businesses to audit their \nbooks; the government forces them to have the job done themselves. In \nthe same way, no army of OSHA inspectors need descend upon corporate \nAmerica.''\n  I agree with the Vice President's praise for consultation. This \namendment simply puts the money where our mouths are.\n  A few final remarks to remind everyone what a balanced approach this \namendment really is. Does this amendment tie OSHA's hands on the \nenforcement front? No. It gives OSHA a 50 percent increase over its \n1999 budget to use for enforcement. That is a lot of additional people \nto hire and train. Does this amendment strip OSHA's ability to go after \nthat thin layer of bad work sites? No. They have more money to go after \nthose work sites than they did last year. What it does do is help those \n95 percent of employers who OSHA estimates are doing their best to \ncomply with OSHA and to find safety solutions that work.\n  It helps them out, too.\n  This amendment is more of a statement than it is an actual change \nwithin the department. Oversight capability of seeing where the money \nreally winds up is pretty limited, but our ability to assign it there \nin the first place is not.\n  I am pleased that there is an increase in the budget for OSHA. I am \ndisappointed they didn't designate part of that for consultation as \nwell. Beefing up OSHA's proactive consultation approach empowers both \nOSHA and the employer to achieve safer worksites.\n  I have seen these consultation programs work. I have seen people \nclamoring to have the consultation, and I have seen them get in long \nwaiting lines for it. These are the people who want to comply, who \nunderstand that there are 1,200 pages, and who want to do the right \nthing. But there isn't enough consultation money out there to help them \nget the consultation in a timely fashion. All we are doing is saying, \nplease earmark some of that money for consultation; don't put all of it \ninto enforcement and persecution.\n  By voting in favor of this amendment, OSHA's own consultation \nprograms will be extended to even more employers who are seeking safety \nand health solutions. The result will mean vastly improved safety for \nAmerica's worksites.\n  This is something I have been talking about to all of the Members on \nthe committee since I came to Washington. This is an approach that \nneeds to be stated in our appropriations as well. Again, it is not an \nelimination of safety and not an elimination of inspection but a 50-\npercent increase in the money going to enforcement. That is what we \nneed to have. But we also need to be sure the consultation programs are \nimproving and increasing and are more accessible in a timely manner. If \npeople have to wait a year for a consultation, accidents can happen. \nThey are interested in doing it. They are ready to budget the money to \nfix it because if they don't, it doesn't do them any good.\n  This is an amendment that just places some priority. It doesn't say \nall we are going to do is enforce and that all we are going to do is \nfind and beat you up and fine you. It says if you will ask the \nquestions, if you are serious about safety, if you want to help, we are \ngoing to help.\n  I hope you will support me on this allocation of money to \nconsultation as well as an increase in enforcement.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me point out to all of my colleagues \nthat I think the approach we want to take here if we want to have more \nfunding for consultation is to just simply advance that by the $9 \nmillion. But the last thing in the world I want to do is take resources \naway from enforcement, which is the backbone of worker safety. That is \nreally a flaw of this amendment introduced by my colleague from \nWyoming.\n  As a matter of fact, at our March 4 hearing, a majority of witnesses \nwere asked why more small businesses do not take advantage of free \nconsultation services available in all 50 States. The majority of the \nwitnesses said--this is not a direct quote, but I will paraphrase--that \nmany small businesses don't think they will get inspected, so it is not \neconomical for them to take advantage of these consultations. They feel \nno need to. The two are interrelated. When businesses really worry \nabout this and know that in fact there are some enforcement laws we can \nimplement, then they are more likely to go to a consultative service.\n  Again, I really do not understand. It is a little bit similar to the \namendment we just had where, on the one hand, you say you have more \nmoney for the community health centers and you will take it out of \nNLRB, which has everything to do with workers' rights to organize, and \nmaking sure equally that people who are fired are going to be able to \nhave their day in court and make their appeal, and there isn't going to \nbe a long delay. In that case, justice delayed is justice denied.\n  In this case we have an amendment introduced by my colleague from \nWyoming that basically takes resources away from enforcement. Standards \nand regulations are no more than suggestions. They don't mean anything \nfor working people in this country if there is not sufficient \nenforcement to back them up. Let me repeat that we can have standards \nand regulations but it is empty, it doesn't mean anything to someone if \nthey can't be backed up through enforcement.\n  Even with the additions to the President's budget request, OSHA's \nFederal enforcement funding will fall $3 million below the level it was \nin 1995. By contrast, during the same period, 1995 to\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\n2000, OSHA's State consultation program has grown from $31.5 million to \n$40.9 million, an increase of 30 percent.\n  So I question the priorities of this amendment. The very area where \nwe have not kept up and have not made adequate investment in inspection \nis the very area from which my colleague from Wyoming takes funds and \nputs them into the consultation program where we have been making the \ninvestment.\n  Of the 12,500 most dangerous workplaces in the Nation, OSHA is able \nto inspect only about 3,000 a year. The other 9,500 will go uninspected \nunless there is a fatality or catastrophic accident. We need more \nenforcement resources, not less. I will repeat, we need more \nenforcement resources, not less.\n  If my colleagues think about the number of people who are killed at \nthe workplace because of an unsafe workplace and the number of people \nwho work with carcinogenic substances which take years off their life \nor the number of workers who go deaf or suffer other disabling injuries \nbecause of an unsafe workplace, I find it almost impossible to believe \nthey are going to take funding away from enforcement.\n\n  I hope I don't get myself in trouble for saying this, but this is in \nsome ways a class issue. This is in many ways a class issue. Actually, \nwe are not talking about us and we are probably not talking about most \nof our sons and daughters. But we are talking about blue-collar \nworkers. We are talking about working-class people. The whole idea of \nOSHA and the whole idea of NIOSH was to make sure that we followed \nthrough on our commitment for a safe workplace. The way to make sure \nthat happens is to make sure we have the enforcement resources--not to \nhave less.\n  Let me point out that in 1995 and 1996, when OSHA's inspection \nactivity declined dramatically, so did requests for consultation \nservices. Business for private safety consultants also fell and even \nvendor sales of safety and health equipment declined as well.\n  I go back again to our hearing that we had March 4. My colleague from \nWyoming conducted that hearing where the majority of witnesses said one \nof the reasons small businesses don't take advantage of the free \nconsultation services is because small businesses don't think they will \nget inspected.\n  As I hear my colleague speak about inspection, I hear him making the \nargument that it takes too long. In fact, I agree with him. But if my \ncolleagues are worried about the delay in inspection, the last thing \nthey want to do is cut the budget that deals with inspection. That is \nillogical. If colleagues are worried about the delay, the last thing in \nthe world they want to do is reduce enforcement resources.\n  I point out to my colleagues this is an important vote. Think about \nthe people you represent in your States: 55 percent of all OSHA \ninspections are in construction, which continues to be extremely \ndangerous. In 1998, 1,171 construction workers died on the job. \nConstruction workers are about 6 percent of the workforce, but they \ncomprise about 19 percent of workplace deaths. If we think that is too \nmany workers dying on the job, and if the evidence is overwhelming \nthere are still too many unsafe workplaces, and if Members are \nconcerned about workplace safety, then I do not believe Senators can \nvote to reduce the resources for OSHA inspectors.\n  Again, I say to both of my colleagues, including my colleague from \nArkansas, I don't know why we make this a zero sum game. Why don't we \nsay, yes, let's do even better for consultation.\n  The second-degree amendment I will introduce will say we don't cut \nenforcement. I don't think we should. I think that just means we will \nhave fewer inspectors, less inspections, and more workers will die. I \ndon't think we should do that. What we could do is maintain the funding \nfor the inspection, which is so key to worker safety, and add the \nadditional money, forward fund the additional money or advance fund the \nadditional money, it is only $9 million, for consultation. Why continue \nto play off one good idea versus another or help some business or some \nworkers over here but end up hurting other workers over here?\n  I don't understand the premise of this amendment. I think it is \nflawed. I think enforcement is the backbone of worker safety, and this \namendment which takes resources away from enforcement also means there \nwill be less safety for workers. That is why I am opposed to this \namendment. That is why I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry as to how many more speakers the \nSenator anticipates on his side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think Senator Kennedy may want to \nspeak. I am not sure that we will have anyone else. I don't know that \nwe will need to spend a lot more time. I think the Senator will be back \nsoon. I have not heard from other Senators.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, would it be in order to entertain a \nrequest for a consent agreement? Talk to your colleagues to see if we \ncould fix a time. We have a great number of other amendments pending. \nWe want to move to the Graham of Florida amendment, Senator Dodd has an \namendment, and we have amendments here. If we could make an agreement \nto 30 more minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to do so; I will let the Senator know.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Enzi amendment. \nI compliment the Senator. He has been a tireless worker and leader in \nthe area of OSHA reform. I think on both sides of the aisle no one \nwould dispute Senator Enzi has been the foremost student of OSHA, the \nway it works, where its failings are. The legislation he has brought \nforward and his efforts to reform this agency deserve the praise and \nthe appreciation of the American people. I appreciate very much his \nwillingness to offer this amendment.\n  I think a few things need to be clarified. It does not cut \nenforcement. The Senator from Minnesota said this cuts enforcement. No, \nit doesn't. It takes the $33 million increased spending and says half \nof that will be used for compliance. Over last year's level, there is \nno cut in what will be available for enforcement. In fact, half of the \n$33 million increase will continue to go into the enforcement area.\n  The Senator from Minnesota said the amendment was flawed. It is not \nthis amendment that is flawed. It is the ``find and fine'' approach of \nOSHA that is flawed and that needs reform. This is a small step, but a \nsignificant step that the Senator from Wyoming has offered that will \nhelp move away from the ``find and fine'' approach, the enforcement-\nonly approach, the punitive approach to a program and a system that \nwill assist small businesspeople who want to do the right thing, who \nwant to have a healthy workplace, who want a safe workplace and want to \ncomply with OSHA but they need help. Anybody who has ever worked with \nOSHA, anyone who has ever looked at the OSHA regulation book, knows a \nsmall businessman, if he is to comply, needs assistance. So I think \nthis is a very well thought out and a very important amendment.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota, as so many others do, likes to put \neverything in terms of class warfare. This is not a class issue. It is \nnot in any way an inference that blue-collar workers should not have \nprotection and should not be assured they are going to work in a \nhealthy workplace and a safe workplace. It is a difference on what is \nthe best approach, on how we best achieve that common goal. It is not a \nclass issue. It is not a class warfare issue, as some would like to \nmake it.\n  OSHA itself has estimated that 95 percent of small businesses--95 \npercent of the workplace, employers--want to comply, that they are good \nactors who want to be in compliance. It is among those 95 percent so \nmany accidents are happening and that is where this kind of amendment \nincreasing employer assistance is going to help. It is going to assist \nthat small businessperson who wants to comply with OSHA but needs help \nin doing so. It is going to assure them that they are going to have the \nresources to be good actors and to have a safe workplace.\n  I do not know what the experience of the Senator from Minnesota has \nbeen, or that of others who may be voting on this, but I do know my \nexperience. I was a small businessperson. I know it is \nunconstitutional, but I almost wish it were a requirement, before \nserving in the Senate, to be an employer; that you had to deal with \nFederal agencies\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nand you had to deal with this Tax Code and you had to deal with the \nregulatory agencies like OSHA. My brother and I owned a radio station \nand we did just that.\n  From my experience, let me tell you, we wanted to comply with every \nOSHA rule, all 1,275 pages. We wanted to comply. But we were a small \nbusiness that had just a handful of employees, less than a dozen. \nFrankly, we did not understand. We understood radio, but we did not \nunderstand every minute, highly technical safety regulation that OSHA \nput forward. That is where this amendment would help. It doesn't cut \nOSHA's funding; it just says let's put half of the increase into \ncompliance, into consultation service for small businesspeople.\n  It is hard for me to imagine why anybody would oppose this. The \nSenator from Wyoming has hit upon something. It is very logical. It is \nvery much common sense. The American people out there understand this \namendment. Those who may have the opportunity to see this debate and \nhear this debate, they will understand the difficulty that good actors, \npeople who want to be in compliance, law-abiding businesspeople have in \ncomplying with an OSHA regulation book over 1,200 pages long.\n  We are not saying decrease enforcement. But I will tell you this: \nOSHA could send an army, we could quadruple the enforcement budget, let \nOSHA send an army of inspectors out across this country; they still \ncould not get into every workplace in the country. That is simply the \nwrong approach if we want a safe workplace. The right approach is to \nput more into consultation services, work with the 95 percent of \nbusinesspeople who want to have a good workplace, assist them in \nensuring they have it, and we will do more to save lives than under the \n``find and fine,'' punitive, enforcement-oriented approach that OSHA \nhas had in the past.\n  Again, I commend Senator Enzi for remarkable leadership, leadership \nthat has been praised on both sides of the aisle in his tireless \nefforts to improve the way OSHA operates. I commend him and am glad to \nbe supportive of his amendment today.\n\n  I have a chart I will just point to briefly. It shows 61.5 percent of \nthe current budget is going to enforcement; less than a quarter of \ntheir budget going to compliance assistance. Senator Enzi has taken the \napproach that at least half of what we are putting into OSHA's budget \nought to go into assistance, not taking a hammer and beating up on the \nsmall businessperson who is trying to comply with OSHA's thousands of \nregulations.\n  Once again, I am glad to be a supporter of this amendment and ask my \ncolleagues to support Senator Enzi and his continued efforts to make \nOSHA a better agency and to make the workplace in this country a safer \nplace for American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, first of all, acknowledge the strong \ninterest that my friend and colleague from Wyoming has in the whole \narea of OSHA. He spends a great deal of time on this issue. Although I \nhave areas of difference with him, he is someone who has involved \nhimself in this issue to a very significant extent. We certainly take \nnote of his longstanding and continuing and ongoing interest in trying \nto make the workplace safer.\n  Having said that, I do hope his position will not be sustained on \nthis particular issue this afternoon. I hope eventually we will have \nthe opportunity to support the Wellstone amendment that, instead of \ntaking the money from inspections for consultation, would just add \nadditional funding for consultations rather than denying the money for \ninspections.\n  The way that would ordinarily be done is Senator Enzi would have \noffered his amendment to transfer, and then Senator Wellstone would \nhave come on and offered a second-degree amendment and said: All right, \nlet us have the increased money from forward funding for the $9 million \nfor compliance. We would have gone to the Senate, I think, with the \nsupport of the Senator from Wyoming. I think we would have resolved \nthis issue and we would be further down the road in moving ahead on the \nwhole question of the appropriation.\n  But we will go through, I guess, the vote on Coverdell, which is \nbasically a repeat of the Enzi amendment. The Senator is entitled to \noffer that, to effectively cut off, at least at this time, the \nWellstone amendment. Then we will have to come back in on top of that, \nafter the Senate makes a resolution of that particular question.\n  Just to put the facts straight, there are very few of us--I do not \nknow any of us--who do not believe there should be an expansion of \nboth: Consultation, and I think there has to be a very extensive \ninspection program. They go hand in hand. Why do we say they go hand in \nhand? We have some very direct and powerful evidence. In 1995 and 1996, \nwhen the Congress cut dramatically the funding for inspections, then \nthe number of consultations went down correspondingly, dramatically. \nThe reason for that has been very clear from the record. If there is a \nreduction in inspections, and there is a sense the companies are not \ngoing to be inspected, there is less of an incentive to move ahead with \nconsultations.\n  So these have gone hand in hand. What the Senator from Wyoming wants \nto do is put a greater emphasis on consultation and reduce the number \nof inspections. I do not think that is wise, given the fact that we \nhave seen the dramatic increase in the workforce. We have 15 million \nmore people working now than we had 6 years ago, as we saw, as Mr. \nRalph Nader, interestingly, reminded us last Labor Day, indicating that \nand indicting the OSHA department for not having enough inspections in \norder to provide the kinds of protections for an expanded workforce.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, he wants to reduce \nthem further. It will be about a 10-percent reduction in the number of \ninspections. We have about 88,000 or so inspections. This would amount \nto about a 10-percent reduction in the total number of inspections, \nwhich is not insignificant.\n  It is particularly important in the areas of the construction trades, \nas my friend and colleague has pointed out, the Senator from Minnesota. \nEven though those in construction are only about 6 percent of the \nworkforce, we find close to 20 percent of all the deaths in the \nworkplace are in construction. This is a dangerous, dangerous industry \nto work in. We are fortunate in this country to have dramatic \nescalations of construction projects. We have them in our own city of \nBoston, and we have them all over this country, dramatic escalation in \nconstruction. We find these attendant accidents which happen, and also \ndeaths which occur as well.\n  So if we look at the history, we find very important and powerful \nevidence.\n  We can represent what we think will happen. We can say what we would \nlike to happen. But the fact is, in this particular situation, we know \non the basis of evidence what does happen, and that is, reduction in \ninspections is reduction in consultations.\n  With all respect to my friend from Wyoming, if we want to see an \nexpansion of the consultations, we ought to increase the number of \ninspections instead of reducing them. But that is not where we are this \nafternoon.\n  Finally, the administration and the Congress have seen a significant \nincrease in consultations over the last 4 years, about a 30-percent \nincrease. There has been important work done in the area of \nconsultation. We certainly support--I do--that program and think it is \nvery important.\n  It is interesting that the association which represents those who are \ninvolved in consultation is resisting this amendment, and the reason \nthey are resisting this amendment is for the reason I have identified. \nThey understand with the reduction of inspections, there is going to be \na reduction in consultations.\n  One would think they would say: Wow, amen, let's get behind them; \nthey are going to put more money into consultations and, therefore, we \nare going to get more of it.\n  But no, they do not. That ought to say something to us because they \nunderstand as well.\n  As I mentioned, I have great respect and affection for my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, particularly in this area of OSHA, but in this \nvery important area where we are talking about people's lives, what is \nthe real purpose of this? The real purpose is the protection of \nworkers' lives.\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\n  We have seen since the time OSHA has gone into effect a dramatic \nreduction--50-, 60-percent reduction--in the loss of lives on the \nconstruction site. OSHA is faced with additional problems of \noccupational health. It is faced with additional issues with these new \ntoxic substances and a wide range of challenges for the new workplace \nthey are trying to deal with and that also pose a significant and \nserious threat to workers. What we are basically saying with OSHA is \nthat we in the United States want to make sure we are going to have as \nsafe a workplace as possible for working men and women.\n  We believe with the increased funding provided for OSHA in this \nappropriations, as compared to the undermining of OSHA, as we saw in \nthe House Appropriations Committee, we will meet that responsibility \nand OSHA can meet it.\n  Let us not put at risk what is tried and tested policy conclusions: \nWe have strong inspections and strong consultations. That works. That \nis the position Senator Wellstone and I and others support.\n  I hope as a result of these votes that is where we will come out; \nthat we will come out so there will be a modest increase which the good \nSenator has mentioned in terms of consultation; that we will come out \nand add those additional funds for the outyears but not take away from \nthe extremely important inspection.\n  Finally, we can pass various pieces of legislation, but unless we are \ngoing to have enforcement, a right without a remedy does not go very \nfar. That is true in just about every area of public policy. We learn \nthat every single day. What we need to have is accountability. We hear \na great deal of talk about accountability. This is accountability. The \nquestion of inspections is a part of accountability to protect workers. \nIf we cut off and reduce inspections, we are denying the important \naccountability that is necessary to protect workers in this country, \nand that is an important and serious mistake.\n\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of my \ncolleagues. I appreciate the comments they have made. We all have a \ntremendous interest in seeing there are safer workplaces, and there is \na long way to go on that yet. But what we are having a little trouble \nagreeing on is the mechanism for getting there. There are some \nphilosophical differences on how to go about safety.\n  I do not think they are across that big of a chasm, but if we had the \nopportunity to spend some time to sit down and talk about them, we \ncould come up with some things that will help the safety of the \nworkplace in this country. We can throw out all the misconceptions and \nprevious solutions and work from there. That is not what is happening. \nWhat is happening is this appropriations bill.\n  We mentioned a record of safety and how it has been increasing. I \nhave been very curious about that record of safety because a lot of \npeople said when OSHA went into effect, there was a huge jump in safety \nin this country and it has been continuing; since OSHA went into \neffect, there has been a decrease in the number of deaths and accidents \nin this country.\n  I went back another 20 years beyond that and looked at the number of \naccidents in this country. Business had been bringing that down before \nOSHA went into effect. They were doing that because they knew if they \nwere going to have a good business, they had to take care of the \nemployee. There has been an ever-increasing awareness of that, and \nthere has been an ever-increasing improvement in that.\n  My colleagues from across the aisle say consultation and enforcement \nhave to go hand in hand. Yes, they do have to go hand in hand, and I am \nnot suggesting any other thing. I am saying that half the money we are \nputting in increases ought to go for the other hand of the hand in \nhand. We ought to do 50 percent for each. We are already doing a whole \nlot more enforcement than we are consultation. I am not trying to even \nthat up. I am trying to take part of what we are doing this year and \nputting it in there.\n\n  They say: Whoa, rather than do that, take another $33 million and \nstick it in there and that will show a real commitment to safety. Let \nme tell you what that would show. It would show my stupidity on \nmanagement. We are doing a drastic increase on that budget. We are \nexpecting them to take a huge increase of funds, find the people, train \nthe people and put them out there doing enforcement.\n  I have faith in the people who are in that Department, and I believe \nthey can do that, but they have a better chance not only of being able \nto train the people but also to get effective use out of them by \nputting half the money into consultation so half the people being \ntrained are going to go out there and answer questions.\n  They are going to be the good guys. They are going to be the ones who \nsay: I know you do not understand these 1,200 pages, but just let me go \nthrough your business, show you what is wrong and, by golly, you fix \nit. If you fix it, you have no problem. If you don't fix it, my buddy \nover here is going to be on your tail; this other 50 percent of the \nmoney is going to be on you.\n  There is a limit to how much increase you can do in a given year.\n  There is room for training improvement. We have looked at what kind \nof training there is. I have also looked at the number of inspections \nthat are being done by the people who are there. I am not sure there is \nenough management over the inspections that are being done.\n  My colleague from Minnesota mentioned that out of those very bad \nemployers, they were only able to inspect 3,000. That is terrible. That \nis rotten. That is not the way it is supposed to happen.\n  We have 2,500 Federal inspectors. They are not doing the State-plan \nStates. They are only doing the Federal inspections. If they did one \nmore inspection a year, they would double the number of inspections on \nthose bad businesses. But we are not going to have that if we just \nthrow a whole bunch more people into the mix. They are not going to be \ncapable of going out and looking at the bad employers and finding those \nbad problems.\n  It takes more than a few months to train the people, and you cannot \ndo it if you have thousands coming into the workforce at one time.\n  There have to be some limits. This is a reasonable approach to being \nsure there is an increase in enforcement, and it is accompanied by an \nincrease in consultation.\n  If you look at the numbers of people who are waiting out there in \nnon-State plan States--the State-plan States are doing pretty good with \nthis, the ones that have said they will do the work themselves. They \nare doing pretty good. The non-State-plan States are having a terrible \ntime getting to the backlog on consultations. So we need some \nconsultation money.\n  I have a bill that may be the wrong approach to doing safety. I put a \nlot of hours into it. I sat down with everybody individually, and I \ntalked to them about it. It is the SAFE Act, and it calls for hiring \nsome private consultation. I have run into opposition on that. What I \nhave heard in the way of opposition is: You cannot let the businesses \nhire people to do inspections. Even though those inspections would \nresult in things being found, things stopped, things improved, you \ncannot do it that way. It has to be done federally or that there be \nsome kind of a mechanism for the Federal Government to have the \ninspectors involved.\n  So I have listened. I have said OK. Under this program, the Federal \nGovernment hires the inspectors, the Federal Government hires the \nconsultation people; it is the Federal Government that is coming in to \ndo these consultations--totally independent, totally under the \ndirection of OSHA.\n  I have been trying to listen to what is being said on all of this. \nThis is one of the solutions that can be provided. I hope you will \nsupport increasing the funds to OSHA. I know that is a tough stand for \na lot of people over here, but I want you to do that. I want you to \nincrease the amount of money that is going to the enforcement of OSHA, \nbut at the same time what I want you to do is take half of that money \nand assure that it is going to consultation.\n  As I said before, there is no way we can assure that it is going to \nconsultation. Once it gets in that department budget, even though it is \nunder a line item, there is not much of a way, even with oversight, to \nsee if those people\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\nwho are supposed to be under consultation are doing any enforcement, \nand vice versa.\n  So it is a statement that we are making that, yes, consultation ought \nto go hand in hand with enforcement. It is a statement. How they use \nthat budget, we will never know. Maybe we will know through increased \nenforcement. Maybe we will know with a decrease in the amount of \nwaiting time people have to have for these inspections.\n  But we have a chance to do the right thing and to do it in a \nresponsible manner that can be handled, giving the increases and making \nsure that to the small businessman out there who wants to understand \nthose 1,275 pages as they apply to his business--and it isn't optional \nfor him to do that; it is mandatory he do that--we are saying we are \ngoing to reach out and give you a little bit of a hand. We are going to \ncome into your business. We are going to show you what is wrong, and \nyou have to clean it up because we are hiring more enforcement people \nwho are going to be here to check on you if you do not.\n  That is all we are asking. I think it is a reasonable amendment. I \nwas hoping that it would be accepted. I am still hoping it will be \naccepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My understanding is that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nis going to try to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Let me, in 2 minutes, summarize. I appreciate the amendment by my \ncolleagues in Wyoming and Georgia. I think this is an unfortunate \ntradeoff. I think it is a profound mistake. I think enforcement is the \nbackbone of worker safety.\n  The second-degree amendment we will offer later on would essentially \nsay: We can do better for consultative services, and we can advance \nsome funds there, but we are certainly not going to take it out of \nenforcement.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts has spoken about this at great \nlength; I have as well. I will not recite the statistics again as to \nthe number of unsafe workplaces and the need for strong inspection. I \nsimply say that the promise of OSHA--not yet realized--is we are going \nto make a commitment to working people, and we are going to make a \ncommitment that people have a safe workplace.\n  We are not doing as well as we should. We should do much better. But \nI think it would be a serious mistake for Democrats or Republicans to \nvote to reduce enforcement. That is a huge mistake. For all who care \nabout worker safety, do not vote to reduce enforcement, to reduce \ninspection. The laws and the rules and regulations do not mean a thing \nunless we have the enforcement. That is why I think this amendment is \nflawed. That is why I hope it will be voted down.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Just a few comments about the merits of the pending \namendment; then I will move on to a unanimous-consent request.\n  I believe that in the bill, as it is currently drafted, there is an \nappropriate balance between consultation and enforcement. I agree with \nthe Senator from Wyoming that this consultation is very important, and \nthere are many places where consultation will work. I think there are \nsome areas where enforcement is necessary.\n  I saw in my line of work as district attorney of Philadelphia, under \nsomewhat different circumstances, what enforcement does and what \ndeterrence does and what the prospects of penalties may do.\n  We have crafted this bill as carefully as we can. I think it has \nabout the right mix, although I welcome the suggestions from the \nSenator from Wyoming and the spirited debate which we have had.\n  As I take a look at the figures, in the period from 1995 to 1999, the \nenforcement funding falls $3 million this year below the 1995 level; \n$145 million to $142 million.\n  By contrast, in the same period, fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year \n2000, OSHA's consultation program has grown from $31.5 million to \nalmost $41 million; an increase of about 30 percent.\n  Even at the level that we have here, there are 7 million workplaces \nin the United States but only about 2,300 OSHA inspectors. Of the \n12,500 most dangerous workplaces in the Nation, OSHA is able to inspect \nonly about 3,000 a year; so 9,500 will not be inspected. The \nenforcement shows that there is an average decline of some 22 percent \nin the 3 years following inspections.\n  So when I take a look at the entire picture, I think we have it about \nright in the current bill.\n  Therefore, I move to table the second-degree amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am now going to propound a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on the pending matter.\n  I have been asked to pause for a minute so that other Senators may \nconsider the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  What we propose to do by way of schedule today to move ahead is to \nset the vote aside, then move to an amendment by Senator Graham of \nFlorida. I hope we can work out a time agreement on that which is not \nyet agreed to. Then we would go to an amendment by Senator Dodd for 30 \nminutes, equally divided, and then come back, perhaps, to Senator \nGregg, and then move to an amendment which may be contentious on \nergonomics, to be offered by Senators Bond and Nickles. We would plan \nto have the votes before the ergonomics amendment, which may take some \nconsiderable time and move into the evening.\n  We are still working as fast as we can through a long list of \namendments to try to see when we can bring this bill to a conclusion at \nthe earliest moment.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Minnesota if he is prepared for me \nto propound the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, we are \nlooking at it right now. If we can have another moment, we will be \nready to respond.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent that a vote occur on or in \nrelation to the pending second-degree amendment after 15 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided in the usual form, and if a motion to \ntable is made and defeated, then the Senate immediately proceed to a \nvote on the pending second-degree amendment.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the second-\ndegree amendment, only if agreed to, Senator Wellstone be recognized to \noffer a second-degree amendment under the same terms as outlined above.\n  Finally, I ask consent that following the disposition of the first \nsecond-degree amendment, if tabled, the first-degree amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  I further ask consent that if the second second-degree amendment is \noffered, following its disposition, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nfirst-degree amendment, as amended, if amended, without any intervening \naction, motion, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that is miraculous. I hardly understand much of \nwhat I just read, although it was carefully drafted and I am sure will \nprovide a roadmap to the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. I inquire of Senator Graham if \nhe will be prepared to enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of moving \nforward. This amendment is going to raise some very fundamental issues \nnot only for a major social program but also for the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and the States and the relationship \nbetween the appropriations process and the committees that have \njurisdiction for authorization and the administration of the mandatory \nspending program.\n  I do not believe at this time I can indicate how long it will take to \nfully articulate those issues to have the kind of debate which this \namendment clearly justifies.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Might I suggest an hour for the Senator's position and a\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\nhalf hour for this side or perhaps even an hour and a half for the \nSenator's position and a half hour for this side. I am anxious to try \nto get some parameters so we know what to do with the remainder of the \namendments and voting.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I suggest, in deference to the effective use of time, it \nwould be preferable if we got started with this amendment and then saw, \nas we were into it, what might be a reasonable time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent to yield back the time on \nthe Enzi amendment and ask that the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1821\n\n     (Purpose: To restore funding for social services block grants)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1821 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1821.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n\n                      social services block grant\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \n     the amount appropriated under this title for making grants \n     pursuant to section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1397a) shall be increased to $2,380,000,000: Provided, \n     That (1) $1,330,000,000 of which shall become available on \n     October 1, 2000, and (2) notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this title, the amount specified for allocation under \n     section 2003(c) of such Act for fiscal year 2000 shall be \n     $2,380,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, in which I am joined by \nSenators Wellstone, Rockefeller, and Dodd, will have the effect of \nreversing a decision made by the appropriations subcommittee to cut by \nmore than 50 percent the funding in title 20 of the Social Security Act \nfor social services block grants.\n  This amendment will restore the program to the level that was \nauthorized by the Finance Committee, which is $2.38 billion. This \nprogram, title 20 of Social Security, allocates funds to the States in \nblock grant form, allowing them to provide services to vulnerable, low-\nincome children and elderly, disabled people. The purpose of this \nprogram is to assist in maintaining the well-being of those Americans \nwho, but for these types of services, might become direct, individual \nrecipients of Social Security funds, whether they fell into such \nbecause of a disability, because of their circumstances in terms of \nlosing the support of an adult, or because of the aging process.\n  I can tell the Senate, as a former Governor of Florida, the State \nwhich has the highest percentage of persons over 65 in the Nation, and \nnow, as a member of the Finance Committee, which has responsibility for \nthe authorization of this program, I am aware of the positive \ncontribution this program has made to the well-being of millions of \nAmericans and to the fiscal well-being of the Social Security program. \nI am particularly concerned about the draconian cuts that have been \nmade and the fact that they have been made with almost no discussion or \nattention to the very serious policy implications.\n  My Finance Committee colleagues and I, joined by colleagues from the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, have agreed that this program should be \nfunded at the level of $2.38 billion for the fiscal year 2000. In fact, \nthe two committees of responsibility, the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, made a commitment to the States \nthat the social services block grant would be guaranteed at the level \nof $2.38 billion until welfare reform is reauthorized in the year 2002.\n  However, the Senate appropriators, rather than simply appropriating \nthe statutory funding level for the fiscal year 2000 at $2.38 billion, \nhave slashed the social services block grant to $1.05 billion for the \nfiscal year 2000. This harsh, unauthorized reduction would be on top of \na 15-percent reduction made to title 20 in the 1996 welfare law.\n  These enormous reductions will have adverse consequences for \nsubstantial numbers of frail elderly persons, disabled individuals, and \nchildren and their families. In my State of Florida, critical programs \nwill be at serious risk if these cuts are made.\n  For example, these reductions will affect services that protect \nchildren from child abuse and that enable poor elderly and disabled \npersons to remain in their homes rather than being placed prematurely \nin nursing homes or other institutions.\n  Our State was one of the first to start a program called Community \nCare for the elderly, begun over 20 years ago. It had as its objective \nto allow older Americans to live the life they wanted to live, a life \nof maximum independence in their homes, in their communities, not to be \nforced prematurely into an institution. That program was funded both by \nState funds and by the use of some of these social service block grant \nprograms. That program has had not only enormous positive benefits in \nterms of the quality of life of the beneficiaries--and, I might say, \nhas now become a program that has been identified for substantial \nexpansion by our current Governor, Governor Bush--but it also has been \na program that has saved both Medicare and Medicaid substantial funds \nby maintaining the best possible state of health for many frail elderly \nand avoiding the extreme costs that are entailed when an individual has \nto be placed in a nursing home.\n  We heard at a luncheon earlier today from a program that has shown \ngreat promise in terms of providing a successful educational \nenvironment for our youngest students. One of the primary keystones of \nthat success is appropriate early intervention with children before \nthey become public school students, while they are still in the infant \nand toddler ages, if they have physical or other disabilities, to begin \nto deal with them at the earliest stages, to give them an appropriate \nlearning environment in preschool.\n  Again, those are precisely the programs that are funded through title \n20 of the Social Security Act. Those are precisely the programs that \nare going to be eviscerated if we adopt this budget with this over 50-\npercent cut.\n  To add to all of that, I direct the attention of the Senate to page \n212 of the conference report which has been issued on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. In that conference report, there is an explanation \nof why this cut is being recommended. The report states:\n\n       The committee recommends an appropriations of $1.50 billion \n     for the Social Services Block Grant. The recommendation is \n     $1.330 billion below the budget request (read the \n     recommendation of the House Ways and Means Committee and the \n     Senate Finance Committee) and $859 million below the 1999 \n     enacted level. The committee has reduced funding for the \n     block grant because of extremely tight budget constraints.\n\n  I would like for the Presiding Officer and my colleagues to listen to \nthis particular part.\n\n       The committee believes that the States can supplement the \n     block grant account with funds received through the recent \n     settlements with the tobacco companies.\n\n  So the subcommittee's rationale for this particular reduction is that \nthe States can now be directed to use their tobacco settlement money in \norder to fund what previously had been a partnership of Federal-State \nfunds for the frail elderly, for the disabled, and for children and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I fervently object to this outrageous, irresponsible \nand, I would say, nonsensical rationale.\n  As you will recall, this spring we had a fervent debate about the \nquestion of whether the Federal Government should reach in and mandate \nhow all or a portion of the States' tobacco settlements should be \nspent. We fought that out for weeks in the Senate.\n  I thought after a series of rejections of exactly this proposition \nthat the States could now with some comfort step back and say the \nFederal Government has decided, properly so, that we were the entities \nwhich secured these tobacco settlements; that the Federal Government \nwould be saying we have the respect of the States that they have the \ngood judgment to decide what is in the best interests of their citizens \nin the methods of spending these tobacco settlement funds; that the \nStates could breathe easy; that they no longer\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\nwere faced with the threat that the Federal Government would want to \nplay big father and tell them how to spend their money.\n  It was only in March of this year that the Senate overwhelmingly by a \nmargin of approximately 71 to 29 defeated an amendment that would have \nrequired the States to spend part of their tobacco settlement according \nto a Federal list of priorities. In June, the entire Congress voted for \nthe Federal Government to stand back, to keep its hands off the tobacco \nsettlement, which the States had with such effort and commitment \nachieved; that the Federal Government was saying to the State: We \nrespect you, and we put our confidence in your decisions as to how to \nspend this money.\n  Now we have a few months later this language saying that it is one of \nthe most important social programs we in Washington are going to \neffectively, by withdrawing Federal funds, direct how the States are \ngoing to spend their tobacco settlement.\n  It is outrageous.\n  The commitment that we made for hands off was a binding commitment, \njust as our commitment to fund the title XX program that we made to the \nStates to fund it at its current level to the year 2002 in order to \nplay a role in the successful completion of the welfare-to-work law was \nalso a binding commitment, commitments that we are now about to breach.\n\n  Today, many of the same individuals who voted to allow the States to \nuse these funds as they saw most appropriate for their citizens are \nabout to tell the States that they need to reallocate tobacco \nsettlement dollars in order to pick up the Federal social services \nblock grant which we are going to slash by over 50 percent. That is \nblatant hypocrisy.\n  The argument that the tobacco funds should be used to fill a $1.33 \nbillion cut in title XX is quite simply--no pun intended--a smoke-and-\nmirrors tactic that does not address the issue at hand. Senate \nappropriators have no valid argument in defense of their drastic cuts \nin this critical program.\n  Have no doubt that the ultimate loser in this exercise is the child--\nthe child who is currently receiving child care in a title XX funded \ncenter. The loser is that other American who has sought refuge from \nabuse through adult protective services, the disabled woman who \nreceives treatment through a title XX funded center. Perhaps the reason \nour appropriators believe that they can get away with this raid on the \nsocial services block grant is that the American people are unclear \nabout the services that this program provides.\n  So I would like to take this opportunity to enlighten my Senate \ncolleagues and the American people on what are the programs funded \nunder title XX of the Social Security Act.\n  The social services block grant was established in 1975. So it is now \nabout to celebrate its 25th year of an important part of the safety net \nthat helps those persons who might otherwise have to rely on expanded \nSocial Security funds.\n  It provides States with funds to address the social service needs as \nthe States determine to be of the greatest priority. States have broad \nflexibility in determining which services to provide, who should \ndeliver services, and which families and individuals to serve.\n  I know our Presiding Officer had a distinguished career of service in \nhis State before being elected to the Senate. So he has no doubt dealt \nwith some of the programs that are funded under title XX of the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  Adoption, case management, congregate meals, counseling services, \nadult day care, day care for children, education and training services, \nemployment services, foster care services, health-related services, \nhome-based services, home-delivered meals, housing services, \nindependent living services for youth, legal services, child and adult \nprotective services, recreation services, residential treatment, \nspecial services for youth at risk, and the disabled--these are some of \nthe services that are provided under title XX.\n  As you can see, many of the SSBG-funded services focus on children \nand youth.\n  In fiscal year 1996, some 15 percent of the SSBG funds supported \nprograms providing child care for low-income children. An additional 21 \npercent was spent on services to protect children from abuse and \nprovide foster care for children.\n  SSBG funds programs for nearly half a million people with mental \nretardation and other physical and mental disability, including \ntransportation, adult day care, early intervention, crisis \nintervention, respite care, employment, and independent living \nservices. These services help such individuals remain at home and out \nof expensive and often inappropriate institutions. These services also \nhelp people with disabilities to work, to the extent it is possible for \nthem to do so.\n\n  These programs drew the support of the House Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee, the two committees with \nresponsibility for Social Security, to support the level of funding \nwhich is in the amendment currently pending.\n  For those who have suggested this more than 50-percent slash in this \nprogram, what is it they know about this program that the House Ways \nand Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee did not know or \ndid not take into proper account? What we should be doing is not \nslashing this program but, if anything, we should be increasing this \nfunding in order to assist particularly in this important time of \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  It should be noted that the Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \nbill appears to reduce the percentage of a State's Federal TANF block \ngrant, another of the programs that will be critical to the transfer \nfrom welfare to work, will reduce the percentage of a State's Federal \nTANF block grant that can be transferred to the social services block \ngrant from 10 percent to 4.25 percent for fiscal year 2000. Not only \nare the States facing a draconian reduction in the social services \nblock grant but also a limit in the flexibility of those funds. The \n4.25-percent ceiling further limits States' abilities to compensate for \nthe impact of the overall social services block grant funding.\n  One might ask, should the States also use tobacco money to fill the \nhole for this further cut, as well? Should the States perhaps be called \nupon to use tobacco funds to supplement all Federal funds for social \nprograms?\n  It is critical we keep the national commitments to the most \nvulnerable members of our society. That commitment cannot be fulfilled \nby slashing title 20 funds by over 50 percent. The President has said \nhe would veto this bill in its current form. He cited the deep cuts in \ntitle 20 as a key reason for doing so. I applaud the President if it \nwere to be necessary--and I hope desperately it will not be necessary--\nto exercise that veto because of these unwise cuts in title 20 and the \nattempt to direct the manner in which the States will spend their \ntobacco settlement funds.\n  There has been a cascade of opposition to this recommendation. The \nNational Governors' Association, the National Council of State \nLegislatures, and the National Association of Counties have spoken out \nagainst this cut. They are joined by over 600 Federal, State, and local \ngroups that understand the importance of these title 20 programs.\n  I ask immediately after my remarks a series of letters from groups \nacross America be printed in the Record expressing their objection to \nthis proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the social services block grant cut of the \nmagnitude reflected in this bill would substantially reduce a State's \nability to provide services to vulnerable children, elderly, and \ndisabled people. Because of the dimensions of such a cut, as well as \nthe fact that most 1999 State legislative sessions have already \nadjourned, most States would not be able to offset this loss with \nadditional State funds, tobacco or otherwise. That is the real point of \nthis debate. This debate is not about tobacco money nor is it about \nwhat States do with their dollars. This debate is about the cutting of \na program that was designed to help the most vulnerable Americans to \nlive better lives and the devastating impact such a cut will have on \ntheir lives and our communities.\n  As I come to a close, a word of caution: The raiding of title 20 \nprograms\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\ncould serve as an example of what will happen when a program is block \ngranted. In the eleventh hour of last year's budget debate, a budget \nbind had developed and the means of escaping from that bind was to use \ntitle XX funds, if you will believe it, to fund road and highway \nspending. Today we are again sacrificing the same social services block \ngrant on the altar of budgetary expediency.\n  This year it is not highway funds but let's tell the States how to \nspend their tobacco settlement. These experiences should serve as a big \nred flag as we structure our social services funding. Thus far, we seem \nwilling to use Meals on Wheels' funds to continue the illusion we are \nnot breaking the budget caps. Will we ever fund the census from moneys \nfrom our children's educational future? If the answer to this question \nis yes, can similar cuts to Social Security and Medicare and other \nsocial programs critical to the well-being of millions of Americans be \nfar behind?\n  The implications of this action this afternoon are ominous. They are \nodious. We have the opportunity to avoid them.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Intergovernmental Relations,\n\n                                Milwaukee, WI, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of \n     Milwaukee County to express our strong support for your \n     amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill to restore \n     funding to the Social Services Block Grant (Title XX). \n     Funding the Title XX program at its authorized level of $2.38 \n     billion is critically important to Milwaukee County.\n       In addition, Milwaukee County urges you to retain current \n     law provisions that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent \n     of their TANF block grants into Title XX.\n       As you know, the SSBG program has been cut three times in \n     the past three years, totaling a half a billion dollars in \n     funding. With current funding down to $1.9 billion for FY \n     1999, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in funding of over \n     $7.6 million for this year, with the state's counties bearing \n     the brunt of these significant cuts.\n       In Wisconsin, it is the state's counties that provide \n     critical social services to vulnerable populations such as \n     supportive home care and community living and support \n     services for elderly and disabled adults and children. \n     Milwaukee County also utilizes SSBG dollars to provide a wide \n     range of other services, including drug and alcohol abuse \n     treatment, temporary shelter service for homeless families, \n     and outpatient treatment for individuals with mental health \n     issues.\n       In addition, Wisconsin is currently transferring the full \n     10 percent of its TANF block grant, nearly $32 million, to \n     fund Title XX services. If the current 10 percent \n     transferability level is reduced to the proposed 4.25 \n     percent, Wisconsin would lose the ability to transfer over \n     $18 million in TANF funds.\n       Again, Milwaukee County strongly supports your efforts to \n     restore full funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for \n     your active support of Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Joe Krahn,\n\n                                                  Milwaukee County\n     Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Wisconsin Counties Association,\n\n                                   Monona, WI, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     Wisconsin Counties Association (WCA) to express our strong \n     support for your amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations \n     bill to restore funding to the Social Services Block Grant \n     (Title XX). Funding the Title XX program at its authorized \n     level of $2.38 billion is critically important to Wisconsin's \n     counties.\n       In addition, WCA urges you to retain current law provisions \n     that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent of their TANF \n     block grants into Title XX.\n       As you know, the SSBG program has been cut three times in \n     the past three years, totaling a half a billion dollars in \n     funding. With current funding down to $1.9 billion for FY \n     1999, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in funding of over \n     $7.6 million for this year, with the state's counties bearing \n     the brunt of these significant cuts.\n       In Wisconsin, it is the state's counties that provide \n     critical social services to vulnerable populations such as \n     supportive home care and community living and support \n     services for elderly and disabled adults and children. \n     Wisconsin's counties also utilize SSBG dollars to provide a \n     wide range of other services, including drug and alcohol \n     abuse treatment, temporary shelter service for homeless \n     families, and child abuse prevention and intervention \n     services.\n       In addition, Wisconsin is currently transferring the full \n     10 percent of its TANF block grant, nearly $32 million, to \n     fund Title XX services. If the current 10 percent \n     transferability level is reduced to the proposed 4.25 \n     percent, Wisconsin would lose the ability to transfer over \n     $18 million in TANF funds.\n       Again, WCA strongly supports your efforts to restore full \n     funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for your active \n     support of Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Krahn,\n     WCA Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: The Board of Directors of Generations \n     United urge you to fund Title XX, the Social Services Block \n     Grant (SSBG) at its present entitlement level of $2.38 \n     billion included in the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Act of 1996.\n       We are pleased that the Clinton Administration has \n     requested restoration of this program to the fully authorized \n     level for the next fiscal year. We believe that this proposed \n     funding level is a formal recognition by the administration \n     of the importance of this block grant and we hope you will \n     endorse this recommendation. We do however continue to have \n     concerns about reducing the states ability to transfer funds \n     from TANF into Title XX to no more than 4.25 percent. We \n     would like to ensure that state flexibility remains.\n       SSBG is an important source of intergenerational support \n     providing flexible federal dollars that helps states respond \n     to their most pressing human service needs. SSBG has a proven \n     record of addressing dependent care needs across the \n     generations. Essential programs supported by SSBG include:\n\n\n                              for children\n\n       Services that support the success of the Adoption and Safe \n     Families Act. For example, in 1997, States reported using 2.2 \n     percent of SSBG funds for adoption foster care and child \n     protection services.\n       SSBG is also an important source of support for Child Care.\n\n\n                              older adults\n\n       SSBG are essential for keeping older adults independent and \n     out of institutions.\n       In 1997, an estimated 318 million was used for adult day \n     care and home-based services.\n       Forty-five states reported using the funds to provide home-\n     based services to the elderly, 38 for elderly case management \n     and 46 for child protection.\n       Generations United is the only national organization that \n     promotes intergenerational policies, programs, and \n     strategies. We represent more than 100 national organizations \n     and millions of individuals who support reciprocity between \n     the generations and the social compact that calls for using \n     the strengths of one generation to meet the needs of the \n     other. We believe a health society should not have to choose \n     between its most vulnerable members--children, youth and the \n     elderly--but instead should support the basic needs of each \n     generation.\n       We urge you to fund Title XX, the Social Service Block \n     Grant at its fully authorized level of 2.38 billion.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Board of Generations United.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Network for Youth,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: The National Network for Youth is a 24 year-\n     old non-profit membership-based organization committed to \n     advancing its mission to ensure that young people can be safe \n     and grow up to lead healthy and productive lives. \n     Representing hundreds of non-profit, community-based youth-\n     serving organizations, youth workers and young people from \n     around the nation, the National Network for Youth urges \n     Congress to support the amendment offered by Senators Graham, \n     Wellstone, and Rockfeller to restore funding for the Social \n     Services Block Grant so states can continue to provide \n     children and youth in high-risk situations and their families \n     the services they need.\n       Established under Title XX of the Social Security Act, the \n     Social Services Block Grant provides funding critical to \n     states' ability to offer services to vulnerable children, \n     youth and families. In 1997, 5% of the funding available was \n     designated for vulnerable youth. Over 200,000 youth received \n     SSBG services including temporary housing, residential \n     treatment, counseling, therapy, support and training to live \n     independently, vocational training, and case management. \n     Without the support of state and local services, vulnerable \n     youth have a high risk of homelessness, teen pregnancy, \n     poverty, and entering the criminal justice system.\n       The homeless youth population is estimated to be \n     approximately 300,000 young people each year. Physical and \n     sexual abuse and neglect are among the key causal factors for \n     runaway behavior. States and local governments have the \n     primary responsibility for protecting children from abuse and \n     neglect, and preventing youth at high risk from entering the \n     criminal justice system. In Fiscal Year 1997 more than 2.3 \n     million children were protected from abuse and neglect \n     through services funded by the Social Security Block Grant, \n     supplementing other federal programs offering aid to state \n     and local programs protecting children and youth.\n       Funding for the Social Security Block Grant was reduced \n     from $2.8 billion in 1995 to $2.38 billion in 1996. The \n     Social Security Block Grant has since faced repeated cuts and \n     is currently funded at $1.9 billion. Additional funding cuts \n     to the Social Services\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\n     Block Grant could weaken those services critical to the aid \n     of vulnerable youth and other at-risk populations. The \n     National Network for Youth urges Congress to support the \n     amendment offered by Sens. Graham, Wellstone, and Rockefeller \n     to restore funding for the Social Security Block Grant in \n     FY2000.\n           Sincerely,\n     Della M. Hughes,\n       Executive Director.\n     Miriam A. Rollin,\n       Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  California State\n\n\n                                      Association of Counties,\n\n                               Sacramento, CA, September 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     California State Association of Counties (CSAC) to express \n     our strong support for your amendment to the Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations bill to restore funding to the Social Services \n     Block Grant (Title XX). Funding the Title XX program at its \n     authorized level of $2.38 billion is critically important to \n     California's counties.\n       In addition, CSAC urges you to retain current law \n     provisions that allow states to transfer up to 10 percent of \n     their TANF block grants into Title XX.\n       The SSBG is a major source of human service funding for \n     California, and repeated federal cuts will impair services \n     for vulnerable populations. Our state is one of the largest \n     recipients of SSBG funds, and due to last year's $471 million \n     reduction in the block grant, California lost over $56 \n     million in funding. Two of the major services California \n     funds with SSBG are In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) at \n     $116.2 million, and Development Disability Services for kids \n     in CWS at $111 million.\n       The SSBG is a cost-effective program that has been slashed \n     by close to one billion dollars over the past five years. The \n     SSBG funds services that allow people to remain in their \n     homes, a much more desirable solution than the costly \n     alternative of institutionalization. According to HHS data, \n     in FY 1997 the SSBG funded home-based services that allowed \n     over 60,000 elderly Californians to remain in the community. \n     Overall, the SSBG funded services for 1,665,349 Californians, \n     including 191,000 disabled and 87,195 elderly that same year. \n     In addition, in 1998, California transferred $183 million \n     from TANF to the SSBG to fund child care services.\n       Again, CSAC strong supports your efforts to restore full \n     funding for the SSBG. Thank you in advance for your active \n     support to Title XX.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Joe Krahn,\n     CSAC Washington Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Humane Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am contacting you to commend your \n     amendment to fund Title XX, the Social Service Block Grant at \n     its present entitlement level of $2.38 billion for the FY \n     2000 budget. Title XX is one of the few programs available to \n     support lower-income working families. This block grant has \n     also been a significant funding source for programs that \n     protect abused and neglected children.\n       Founded in 1877, the American Humane Association (AHA) is a \n     nationwide association of child welfare professionals, public \n     and private social services, medical and mental health \n     professional, as well as educators, researchers, judicial and \n     law enforcement professionals and child advocates. AHA's \n     Children's Division continues to be a voice dedicated to the \n     protection of children.\n       AHA strongly believes that Title XX deserves to be placed \n     high on the list of priorities. This block grant allows \n     states the flexibility to provide much needed services for \n     vulnerable children and families in near crisis situations \n     and has helped support reforms in state foster care systems.\n       AHA is pleased that the Clinton administration has \n     requested restoration of this vital program to the full \n     entitlement level for the next fiscal year. We believe that \n     this proposed funding level is a formal recognition by the \n     Administration of the vital importance of this block grant \n     and we hope you will endorse this recommendation. We do, \n     however, continue to hold great concerns with regard to the \n     administration's proposal to reduce the states' ability to \n     transfer funds from TANF into Title XX to no more than 4.25 \n     percent. We would like to work closely with you, as well as \n     the Administration, to ensure that state flexibility is \n     retained.\n       By helping to keep people in the community, the Social \n     Services Block Grant actually saves the federal government \n     and the nation's taxpayers the cost of expensive \n     institutional care. Therefore, we strongly urge you to fund \n     the Social Services block Grant at its fully authorized level \n     of $2.38 billion.\n       Thank you for your hard work and attention to this issue. \n     If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate \n     to contact us at (202) 543-7780.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Adele Douglass,\n                                   Director, Washington DC Office.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1886 To Amendment No. 1821\n\n     (Purpose: To restore funding for social services block grants)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the \namendment currently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1886 to amendment No. 1821.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the \n     amount appropriated under this title for making grants \n     pursuant to section 2002 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1397a) shall be increased to $2,380,000,000: Provided, \n     That (1) $1,330,000,000 of which shall become available on \n     October 1, 2000, and (2) notwithstanding any other provision \n     of this title, the amount specified for allocation under \n     section 2003(c) of such Act for fiscal year 2001 shall be \n     $3,030,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nfollow the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to the arguments by the \nSenator from Florida I can understand his interest in adding funds to \nwhat the committee mark is. I have no disagreement with the importance \nof the funds which are at issue.\n  I am constrained to oppose the amendment because in constructing this \noverall bill for $91.7 billion, in collaboration with the ranking \nDemocrat on the subcommittee, we have juggled some 300 programs. If we \nare going to add a very substantial amount of additional funding to \neducation, which we have some $2.3 billion over last year, and if we \nare to add $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and to \nhave an initiative against juvenile violence, it is a matter of the \nallocation of priorities.\n  The comment has been made about the use of the tobacco funds. Those \nare very substantial sums of money, some $203 billion over a number of \nyears.\n  I fought on the Senate floor to try to bring some of those tobacco \nfunds to the Federal Government so we would have more moneys available. \nIt is an obvious suggestion, when the States are the recipients of so \nmuch of that funding, that some of it be used where other Federal funds \nhad been made available. This is another illustration, along with the \nrequest for additional funds for after school, $200 million more, or \nfor class size, for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--all of \nthose are items which, under normal circumstances, I would say are very \ngood programs, they are very good approaches, we would like to see \nthem. But when it comes to assessing priorities, it is my sense, after \nworking through very carefully with staff and then with the Democratic \nstaff, the full subcommittee and the full committee, that this is an \nappropriate assessment of priorities.\n  Therefore, even though I have sympathy for what the Senator from \nFlorida has had to say and think these are good programs, on a priority \nbasis I have to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Graham, on his amendment.\n  I want to respond to my colleague from Pennsylvania. I will start out \nwith Minnesota, and then I will go to the country at large. Actually, \nin Minnesota, for reasons I will explain, these social service programs \nand funding are passed directly to counties. The State cannot replace \nthe money with tobacco money or anything else, and certainly not for \nnext year, which is a bonding legislature. But above and beyond that, \nin any case, the tobacco money has already been spent for other \nprograms.\n  The point is, we do not know what will happen. This is what my \ncolleague concluded. We do not know what will happen with these \nprograms that are so important to poor people, to vulnerable people, \nelderly people, people with disabilities. To cut the social service \nprograms by 50 percent and then say\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nStates have tobacco money so we will count on them to do it is an \nabandonment of our commitment. It is an abandonment of our commitment.\n  What we have done is cut the social services block grant program by \nmore than half. What my colleague from Florida has done--and I am \npleased to join him in this amendment--is to restore the funding to the \nfull formula amount of $2.38 billion. We are talking about programs \nthat are so important to the lives of the most vulnerable citizens in \nour country: The elderly, the very young, the poor, and the disabled.\n  The question is, What is this SSBG fund? Are we talking about \nsomething important?\n  Yes, we are talking about something important, if you think adoption \nservices, congregate meals, counseling services, child abuse and \nneglect services, day care, education and training services, employment \nservices, family planning services, foster care services, home-\ndelivered meals, housing services, independent and transitional living \nservices, legal services, pregnancy and parenting services, residential \ntreatment services, services for at-risk youth, and special services \nfor families for the disabled and transportation services are \nimportant. If we think these services are important, then how in the \nworld can we cut this funding by 50 percent?\n  I respect my colleague from Pennsylvania. He has done the very best, \ngiven the budget caps under which he has worked. But I do not believe a \ngood argument against the amendment we have introduced is: Well, there \nis tobacco money out there and the States can use that money.\n  Some States do not have that money to use. Some States can't use that \nmoney. In any case, whatever happened to our commitment at the Federal \nlevel to try to fund some services that would help the most vulnerable \ncitizens in our country? That is my question.\n  Let me talk a little about some of these programs and then go further \nwith the argument I want to make. Let me take Meals on Wheels. Why do \nwe not think about this in personal terms? I think, I say to Senator \nGraham, we are going to get support for this amendment. I believe we \ncan pass this amendment. Are Senators going to vote to cut funding for \nthe Meals on Wheels program? That is a program for people, many of them \nelderly, many of them disabled. Both my parents, for example, had \nParkinson's disease. They might not even be able to get to congregate \ndining, which is a great program. They might not even be able to get \ninto town; they cannot drive. Quite often there is not the \ntransportation. In Minnesota it is cold; it is wintry weather. Maybe \nduring the winter they cannot get out and freely move around. So you \nhave the Meals on Wheels program where you deliver a hot lunch, a \nnutritious meal, to elderly citizens. And we are going to cut this \nprogram?\n  Let me repeat that. We are going to cut this program? We can do \nbetter. We can do much better.\n  Talk about independent and transitional living services; here we have \nsome services--I will talk about this in some detail--that would enable \nan elderly person or someone with a disability to live at home in as \nnear normal circumstances as possible, with dignity. It is a range of \nsupport services. It might be nursing services, community health \noutreach services, making sure those people are able, with a little \nhelp, to stay at home. We are going to cut this program, potentially by \nhalf? We are going to cut services that enable people to live at home \nwith dignity as opposed to being put into a nursing home? We cannot do \nthat. We cannot do that.\n  According to the Title XX Coalition, in fiscal year 1997 more than \n1.1 million elderly people and over 740,000 people with disabilities \nbenefited from the social services program. State and local prevention \nand treatment services reached over 2.3 million children and their \nfamilies. I thought we cared so much about the elderly. I thought we \ncared so much about the children. I thought we cared so much about \nmaking sure at least there is an investment in some resources that will \nenable people with disabilities to live lives with independence and \ndignity. That is what the disabilities movement is all about. We cannot \nsay that if we cut these services, if we cut these programs by over 50 \npercent.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, SSBG funds are used, in some counties, \nto augment child care for single women and their families. We talk \nabout the importance of moving from welfare to work, but if a mother \nworks and cannot find child care or cannot afford child care, how is \nshe going to do it? Or if you have working poor people and they work 52 \nweeks a year and they work 40 hours a week and one of them is working \nor both of them are working, affordable child care is a hugely \nimportant issue for them. There are not Senators in this Chamber who \nwould not want to make sure their children were able to get good child \ncare. And we are cutting into services for child care?\n  Many Minnesota counties use SSBG money for home care services for the \nelderly. We are talking about funds to pay for a care giver to go to a \nvulnerable elderly person's home and help them with ``home chore \nservices,'' such as taking their medicine on time and in the right \ndoses, keeping their homes clean and safe, helping people take a bath, \nmaking sure there is food in the refrigerator.\n  I am sorry, I am not going to get worked up, but I do not understand \nhow in the world we can justify cutting those services for elderly \npeople. I do not understand that. That is exactly what we went through \nwith my mother and father in Northfield, MN. That is exactly the \nstruggle we had in trying to help them stay at home. We did all we \ncould among Sheila, myself, and our children.\n  Sometimes one needs some help. At the county level, if there is a \npublic health outreach program, somebody can help elderly people to \nmake sure they take their drugs, to make sure they take the right \ndosage, to help someone like my dad who had Parkinson's disease and his \nbody shook and my mother was not able to help him take a bath, to help \npeople live at home, help people keep their independence. This is mean-\nspirited to cut these programs.\n  We cannot say: Well, but there is the tobacco money and States can \nuse tobacco money. We do not know whether all States can. We do not \nknow whether all States will and, in any case, this is a commitment \nthat we have made in the Senate. We are a national community. Can we \nnot as a national community, represented by the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, at least make a commitment to fund these services \nthat are so important for vulnerable people?\n  I was speaking with Marien Brandt, the human services director in \nSibley County, MN, a rural county, who told me her county spends SSBG \nfunds primarily to serve vulnerable populations who are not eligible \nfor assistance under other funding programs. She suggested that many of \nthe people her agency serves would be forced into institutionalized \ncare without SSBG funds.\n  She gave me the example of the child who might have to go into an \nout-of-home placement if her agency becomes unable to provide \ncounseling services that help the child's parent learn to adequately \ncare for and protect that child.\n  The vulnerable adults they help with SSBG money tend to be elderly \npeople, seniors, disabled people who get home health care services, \npeople they help stay at home, the very people about whom I talked.\n  If we are talking also about counseling services for parents and for \nchildren at risk, what in the world are we doing cutting those \nservices? Marien told me that in Sibley County, SSBG money is used \nespecially in the rural areas to fund transportation for the elderly \nand the disabled so they can go to the doctor, so they can buy \ngroceries, so they are simply not isolated.\n  Let me point out what we are doing. All too often we say SSBG and \npeople do not know what we are talking about. And we throw the money \naround: increase $1.2 billion, subtract $1.3 billion. I will translate \nit into personal services. Here is an example of one of many counties--\nI could take hours on this--where we use this money to provide \ntransportation. Sometimes it is not the big buses. Sometimes it is \nsmaller, a dial-a-bus so an elderly person can go to the doctor, people \ncan go to the grocery store, they can go to congregate dining, they\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\ncan go places and they are not isolated. What in the world are we doing \ncutting this funding by 50 percent?\n  This SSBG money, I say to my colleague from Florida, is used to fund \nservices for people who otherwise would fall through the cracks. This \nmoney is used to provide services for the most vulnerable citizens in \nour country.\n  I do not understand exactly--I understand what my colleague from \nPennsylvania said. He cares a lot about these budgets as they affect \npeople. But I really do not know how we got to the point where we cut \nthese social service programs by 50 percent. I do not understand that. \nI am afraid one of the things I think happens is that quite often, when \nwe work under these caps--I do not know if my colleague from Florida \nwill be angry with me for saying this, so therefore maybe I will not, \nnow that I think about it.\n  We put ourselves into fictional politics. These caps do not work, and \neverybody seems to be locked in with these caps. We are engaged in \nmutual deception. Nobody wants to talk about breaking the caps. That is \nnot what this amendment does, although advance funding, whatever, we \nall know we need to spend more.\n  In my opinion, this amendment goes to the heart of what this debate \nis all about. We ought not, I say to the Presiding Officer--a good \nSenator--to be cutting these kinds of programs. These programs are for \nthe most vulnerable citizens in our country. We ought not to be cutting \nprograms that enable someone to get Meals on Wheels, that enable \nsomeone to go to congregate dining, that provide home health care \nservices so people can stay at home rather than being \ninstitutionalized, that provide child care, help for families so they \ncan afford child care. We ought not to be cutting these kinds of \nservices by 50 percent. I fear one of the reasons we end up doing it is \nthat these are the citizens who do not have the clout. It is just too \neasy to make cuts based upon the path of least political resistance. It \nis just too easy to cut services for the very poor and the most \nvulnerable. This is wrong.\n  This amendment goes to the heart and soul, I hope, of the Senate.\n  I will not go over reports from many counties, but I want to talk \nbriefly about how my own State is going to be impacted.\n  Minnesota communities currently receive $41.6 million annually. If \nthese proposed cuts are enacted, Minnesota is going to lose $23.2 \nmillion in funding. We will receive only $18.3 million in fiscal year \n2000.\n  We are unique, I will concede that point, because by law the SSBG \nfunds bypass the Governor and flow directly to the local level. The \nState cannot touch the money. We cannot add or subtract funds from the \nblock grant.\n  Minnesota law further requires local level programs to run balanced \nbooks, which means they cannot carry any budget surplus from one year \nto the next. What this means, if these cuts to the SSBG go through, the \nState will not be able to offset any of the lost funds with funds from \nother sources. The local level programs will have no budget surpluses \nto fall back on, and these Federal level program cuts will be reflected \nimmediately in local level cuts; in other words, right there in the \ncounties where the people live. It would mean substantial reductions or \nperhaps even the elimination of local Minnesota programs.\n\n  So when I come to the floor and speak about this with some sense of \nurgency, it is because we could lose senior congregate dining. We could \nlose Meals on Wheels. We could lose a host of other local community-\nbased programs that are so important to our citizens.\n  It would also mean cuts in health and substance abuse programs. \nMinnesota is one of only seven States in the country that relies more \nheavily on title XX grants than its SAMHSA grant to fund mental health \nservices. We are going to see draconian cuts in mental health services \nas well.\n  Furthermore, next year, in my State it will be a ``bonding \nlegislature,'' one in which they will not be able to consider policy \nissues. So the Minnesota Legislature is not going to be able--I think \nmy colleague from Florida was alluding to this in other States--to take \nup any legislation to change the law governing the flow of SSBG funds \nin 2001.\n  I will tell you, I give the example of Minnesota because this is one \nhugely important issue in my State. But I also want to say to my \ncolleagues that Senator Graham has done a good job of talking about how \nthis is going to affect all of the States. In a report that was put out \nyesterday, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained that if \nthe Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill becomes law, SSBG funding will \nhave been cut 87 percent since 1977 in inflation-adjusted terms--87 \npercent. An SSBG cut of the magnitude proposed in this bill will \nsubstantially reduce our State's ability to provide services to \nvulnerable children, to elderly, and disabled people.\n  This amendment, that I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Graham, is \nan effort to say to the Senate that we have to do the right thing and \nthat we must restore full funding for the title XX social services \nblock grant program.\n  I will wait to hear if there is debate on the other side. I have many \nmore examples to present from many counties in my State, both rural and \nurban. But I will repeat it one more time. As far as I am concerned, \nthe fundamental core question for us to address, the issue for us to \ndebate, is whether or not we in the Senate want to cut the social \nservices programs that are so important to the most vulnerable citizens \nin our States--important to elderly people so they can have \ntransportation and not be so isolated; important to people like my \nparents, who are no longer alive, so someone can come to their \napartment and help them live at home when they have a disabling \ndisease; important to a family where the single parent is working and \nshe wants to make sure there is affordable child care; important to the \nperson with disabilities so he or she can live at home with dignity; \nimportant for people who are not well enough and cannot even physically \nbe able to go to congregate dining, who need Meals on Wheels, so \nsomeone can come and deliver them a nutritious meal.\n  By the way, the Meals on Wheels program is inadequately funded right \nnow. We cannot cut these critically important programs and services \nthat make life better for vulnerable citizens in our country. We cannot \ndo this.\n  The States have a tremendous amount of leeway in how they use their \nSSBG funds, and this is one program in which they are able to try to \ndevelop innovative and creative programs to help the poor and needy \n(people with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty line are eligible \nfor SSBG funds). Title XX only specifies that the money be used to help \npeople achieve and maintain economic self-support and self-sufficiency \nto prevent, reduce, or eliminate dependency. The law also allows the \nmoney to be used for services that prevent or remedy neglect and abuse, \nand to prevent or reduce unnecessary institutional care by providing \ncommunity-based or home-based non-institutional care. States use this \nmoney to care for people who would otherwise slip through the cracks; \nthese funds are critical for the well-being of the most vulnerable \npeople among us--the elderly and the very young, the poor, and the \ndisabled. These are people who most need our help, and we should not be \nslashing the very money that is most likely to serve them.\n  Title XX of the Social Security Act specifies that $2.38 billion is \nto be provided to the States for fiscal year 2000. The Senate Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, though, slashes funding for this block grant to \nonly $1.05 billion. This cut comes on top of a 15 percent cut to the \nblock grant made as part of the 1996 welfare reform law, a cut that the \nstates reluctantly accepted only with a commitment from Congress that \nwe would provide stable funding for the block grant in the future. I am \npretty sure that a 50-percent cut doesn't qualify as stable funding by \nanyone's definition.\n  And what kind of a message do we send to the States when we talk \nabout cutting block grant funds? Congress sold welfare reform to the \nstates on the promise that they would have the flexibility to \nadminister their own social service programs. But as the National \nConference of State Legislatures point out, ``these cuts [to the SSBG] \nwould set the precedent that the federal government is reticent to \nstand by its decision to grant flexibility to states in\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nadministering social programs.'' SSBG funds are used by the states to \nprovide services for needy individuals and families not eligible for \nTANF, and to reduce federal Medicaid payments by helping vulnerable \nelderly and disabled live in their homes rather than in institutions. \nStates also use SSBG funds for child care services and other supports \nfor families moving from welfare to work. When Congress proposes \nslashing these funds, we send a clear, and I believe extremely \ndamaging, message to the States. I think we are telling them not to \ninvest in these kinds of social support programs, because they just \ncan't count on the money being there.\n  But let's just say for a minute that we do go back on our word and \nbreak our commitment to the States--so what? What exactly does SSBG \nfund? Anything important?\n  Only if you think adoption services, congregate meals, counseling \nservices, child abuse and neglect services, day care, education and \ntraining services, employment services, family planning services, \nfoster care services, home delivered meals, housing services, \nindependent and transitional living services, legal services, pregnancy \nand parenting services, residential treatment services, services for \nat-risk youth and families, special services for the disabled, and \ntransportation services are important. All of these programs are \nfunded, in part at least, through the SSBG.\n  According to the Title XX Coalition, in fiscal year 1997, more than \n1.1 million elderly people and over 740,000 people with disabilities \nbenefited from SSBG. State and local prevention and treatment services \nreached over 2.3 million children and their families. The SSBG also \nreached 1.5 million individuals and families by supporting their \nphysical and mental well-being, and by helping them overcome barriers \nto employment and economic self-sufficiency. And child care-related \nservices were provided to over 2.3 million children through SSBG.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, SSBG funds are used in some counties \nto augment child care for low-income single women and families. Even \nwith these additional funds, there are currently huge waiting lists for \nsubsidized day care in most counties. If we further cut the title XX \nfunds, these county level programs are going to have to reduce or \neliminate services that they provide. And when a single mom who has \njust gotten off welfare and is trying to make ends meet while she \nstarts working at her new job, loses the subsidized day care that she \ncounts on, what do you think is going to happen? Which do you think is \nmore likely--that she'll be able to afford to pay for day care herself, \nor that she'll be forced to go back onto welfare?\n\n  Many Minnesota counties use SSBG money for home care services for the \nelderly. These counties use SSBG funds to pay for a care giver to go \ninto a vulnerable elderly person's home and help them with basic ``home \nchore'' services like taking their medicine on time and in the right \ndoses, keeping their home clean and safe, taking a bath, or making sure \nthere is food in the refrigerator. These are simple, basic services, \nbut they often mean the difference between allowing someone to stay in \ntheir own home or being forced into an institution. If SSBG funds are \ncut, vulnerable elderly are likely to lose home care services like a \nvisiting nurse or case management person, which might then force them \ninto a nursing home or an assisted living situation that would, in the \nend, cost much more money.\n  I was speaking with Marien Brandt, the Human Services Director in \nSibley County, Minnesota who told me that her county spends SSBG funds \nprimarily to serve vulnerable populations who aren't eligible for \nassistance under other funding programs, and she suggested that many of \nthe people her agency serves would be forced into institutionalized \ncare without SSBG funds. Marien gave me the example of the child who \nmight have to go into an out-of-home placement if her agency becomes \nunable to provide counseling services that help the child's parent \nlearn to adequately care for and protect that child. The vulnerable \nadults they help with SSBG money tend to be elderly people, seniors or \ndisabled people, who get home care services--someone to come in to help \nthem clean their home and maintain a safe environment, bathe, have food \nto eat, to see that they take the right amount of medicine when they \nare supposed to. Oftentimes these people are not eligible for medical \nassistance, so there is not another source of funding available to them \nwhen they are living in the community. What will happen if SSBG funds \nare cut is that they will wind up having to go into a nursing home in \norder to qualify for funds to pay for their care.\n  Marien told me that in Sibley County, SSBG money is also used, \nespecially in rural areas, to fund transportation for elderly and \ndisabled, so they can access services like doctors, getting groceries, \nand just simply so they are not so isolated in their home (a ride to \nthe senior center, perhaps). There is no other funding source that will \npay for this. For disabled people who are just over eligibility \nguidelines for medical assistance, SSBG money is used to help meet \ntheir needs--managing medication, transportation, and community based \nservices like training and counseling.\n  The way Marien explained it to me, her county basically counts on \nSSBG money to pay for services for people who otherwise fall through \nthe cracks. They count on this money to provide simple, basic services \nthat keep the most vulnerable among us in their homes and out of much \nmore costly institutions.\n  Sue Beck, the Director of Human Services in Crow Wing County, \nMinnesota told me a similar story. She explained that her county also \ncounts on SSBG funds to make sure that vulnerable populations, the \nelderly, the disabled, children, and poor people, have the services \nthey need to live economically secure, self-sufficient lives. Over the \npast several years, due to SSBG cuts that have already been imposed, \nher county has had to cut back services in transportation and ``chore \nservices''--for disabled and elderly people who need just a little bit \nof help--things like help shoveling snow or grocery shopping. They use \nSSBG money currently to augment their employability budget--to provide \nsupported employment, and community based employment for people who \nother wise might not be able to compete successfully in the job market. \nAll of this is at risk when we talk about cutting SSBG in half.\n\n  Dave Haley, from the Ramsey County Department of Human Services also \ntold me about his county spends SSBG money. The first example he gave \nme was that of a typical family of a single-mother who has three young \nchildren. The oldest child, a 7-year-old boy, has missed a significant \nnumber of school days. The mother is experiencing problems with \nchemical dependency and involved in a violent relationship with her \nboyfriend. The mother cannot make sure that the child gets up every day \non time, and is promptly fed and dressed for school. The family does \nnot have a car or other personal means of transportation. Through \nprograms partially funded with SSBG money, the County is able to \nprovide support to the mother to resolve her chemical dependency \nproblems and domestic abuse. Services ensure that the seven-year-old is \nattending school on a regular basis and the boy is beginning to make \nacademic progress.\n  There are over 2,000 young children in Ramsey County currently in \nthis situation. Ramsey County and local school districts have been able \nto develop a very active program to address these educational neglect \nissues and insure that children attend school on a consistent basis. \nThey will be forced to scale back this effort, though, if SSBG funds \nare cut by more than 50 percent.\n  Another example that Dave gave me is that of a 30 year-old woman that \nis living in her own apartment in her home community. Thirty years ago, \na similar individual with moderate mental health needs would have been \nplaced in a state hospital miles from their family home. Over the last \nthree decades, needed supports have been developed, including programs \nto monitor and assist individuals in managing their medications, \nchecking on their money management and assisting when necessary with \nproper budgeting, teaching needed independent living skills, and \nemployment support to maintain their current job. Without periodic \nweekly checks, the individual would have great difficulty managing \ntheir daily life, and might be forced\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\ninto an institutionalized living situation.\n  The system that has developed over the last three decades has not \nonly improved the lives of hundreds of people in Ramsey County, it has \nalso enabled the state and federal government to save hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on more expensive institutional care.\n  Currently, Ramsey County receives $5 million in SSBG funding. If this \nwere reduced by half, it would affect far more than what I have briefly \nmentioned. SSBG money also supports chemical dependency prevention \nefforts, homemaker and other support services for seniors to prevent \nnursing home placement, and support efforts for families with a child \nwith developmental disabilities to enable the family to stay together \nand avoid or delay out of home placement, to name only a few. If these \nfunds are not restored, all of these programs, and all of the people \nthey serve, will suffer.\n  So you tell me, which of these programs deserves to go, because \nsomething is going to have to if this provision passes. Who do you \nthink we should turn away? Maybe low-income families with children? Or \nperhaps the elderly or disabled? What difference does it make if \nsomeone goes to bed hungry, or homeless, or just plain afraid that they \nwon't make it through tomorrow? We have a budget cap to maintain, after \nall. And that is what this Congress has defined as really important \nhere, right? Not helping our constituents, or keeping our commitments \nto the States, because I certainly don't see how anyone in Congress \ncould argue differently when I see an effort like this to eliminate \none-half of the SSBG funding.\n\n  In my own State of Minnesota, these cuts will have an immediate and \ndeeply felt effect. Minnesota communities currently receive $41.6 \nmillion annually. If the proposed cuts are enacted, Minnesota will lose \n$23.2 million in funding, receiving only $18.3 million in FY 2000.\n  Minnesota is unique among all the states, though, because, by law, \nSSBG funds by-pass the governor and flow directly to the local level. \nThe state cannot touch the money--they can neither add nor subtract \nfunds from the block grant. Minnesota law further requires local levels \nprograms to run balanced books. Which means that they cannot carry any \nbudget surplus from one year to the next. So what that means is that if \nthese cuts to the SSBG go through, the state will not be able to help \noffset any of the lost funds with funds from other sources, the local \nlevel programs will have no budget surpluses to fall back on, and these \nfederal level cuts will be reflected immediately at the local level in \nprogram cuts. It would mean substantial reductions, or perhaps even the \nelimination of local Minnesota programs like senior congregate dining, \nMeals on Wheels, and a host of other local community based programs. It \nwould also mean cuts in health and substance abuse programs, as \nMinnesota is one of only seven states in the country that relies more \nheavily on its Title XX grant than its SAMHSA grant to fund mental \nhealth services. Furthermore, because next year will be a ``bonding \nlegislature,'' one in which they will not be considering policy issues, \nthe Minnesota legislature will not be able to take up legislation to \nchange the law governing the flow of SSBG funds until 2001.\n  So some of my colleagues may be saying to themselves, well that's \nunfortunate for Minnesota, but in my home state we'll be able to \nsupplement the cuts with other money--maybe the money we got from the \ntobacco settlement, or perhaps we will just transfer money from our \nTANF surplus. First, let's talk about the tobacco settlements: in some \nstates, anti-smoking and other health needs will receive first priority \nfor use of the settlement funds, not unanticipated reductions in SSBG \nfunds. Also, some states have already enacted legislation committing \nthe tobacco funds for other purposes. Okay, well, then if not the \ntobacco settlement funds, then maybe the TANF surplus funds. But right \nnow, seven states--Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, \nMissouri, Nevada, Oregon--currently have no unobligated TANF funds. And \nif the House gets its way, 3 billion dollars in TANF surpluses will be \nrescinded from the states. This will leave another 12 states--Alabama, \nConnecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New \nHampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah, and Vermont--who if they \nused every single cent of their remaining TANF surplus still won't have \nenough money to cover the lost SSBG funds. That's a total of 19 States, \nmore than a third of all states, that won't have the social service \nfunds available to offset the SSBG funding cuts proposed in this bill.\n  I have here a letter from a group called ``Fight Crime, Invest in \nKids,'' which is an organization made up of over 500 police chiefs, \nsheriffs, prosecutors, victims of violence, and violence prevention \nscholars, written in support of this amendment. They write to explain \nthat recent cuts in SSBG have short changed child care, child abuse \nprevention, removal and placement of abused children, drug treatment, \nand other critical crime prevention investments.\n  As they point out in this letter, one of the Government's most \nfundamental responsibilities is to protect the public safety. To meet \nthat responsibility, Congress must close the crime-prevention gap--the \ngaping shortfall we ought to be making to help our Nation's children \nget the right start.\n  The Graham-Wellstone amendment to restore funding to the SSBG would \nprovide over $591 million to protect children from abuse and neglect. \nSince abused and neglected children are almost twice as likely to \nbecome chronic offenders, it is clear that these services can have an \nimportant crime prevention impact. The amendment would also provide \n$300 million to support child care in 47 states. A study by the High \nScope Foundation showed that quality child care can dramatically reduce \nthe chances of children becoming criminals. It is clear that we must \ncontinue to provide the funds for these programs, and we can only do \nthat by restoring the title XX grant to its full formula amount.\n  In a report they put out yesterday, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities explained that if the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nbecomes law, SSBG funding will have been cut by 87 percent since 1977 \nin inflation-adjusted terms. An SSBG cut of the magnitude proposed in \nthis Senate bill will substantially reduce the States' ability to \nprovide services to vulnerable children, elderly, and disabled people. \nPlease, do the right thing and restore the SSBG money by supporting the \nGraham-Wellstone amendment to restore full funding for the Title XX \nSocial Services Block Grant.\n  If the Senate does not support this Graham amendment, then, in my \nview, the Senate does not have a soul. If the Senate does not support \nthis Graham amendment, then, in my honest to God opinion, the Senate \ndoes not have a soul.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am ready to make a motion, if the other side does \nnot wish to use the remainder of their time. If there is something \nfurther they have to say, I do not want to cut that off.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are not \noperating under a time agreement, so there is not a clock ticking on \nthis issue.\n  I see one of the cosponsors of the amendment, the Senator from \nConnecticut, is on the floor. I do not know if he desires to speak on \nthis issue or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I am very impressed with \nthe level of my colleagues' debate. I commend my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, and my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, for articulating what I think the rationale and support for \nthis amendment means to make a huge difference in our States and \nlocalities and to underserved Americans.\n  I have an amendment that I will be offering shortly on behalf of \nSenator Jeffords and myself, Senator Snowe, and others, on child care. \nI am prepared to offer that, but I do not want to in any way cut into \nthe debate of my colleague from Florida or others who may want to \ncontinue with regard to his particular amendment.\n  Again, I commend him for it. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of it. \nI\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nthink it makes a significant contribution. I point out, in my State \nalone--I represent the most affluent State in America, something of \nwhich I am proud. I also tell you I am not so proud of the fact that \nthe largest increase in child poverty in the country occurred in my \nState over the last several years--a 60-percent increase in child \npoverty.\n  So here is a small State, Connecticut, with 3.5 million people, \nenjoying unprecedented prosperity. Yet in the midst of this small \nState, we are also finding an unprecedented hardship on the part of a \nlot of people, particularly young people. One out of every five \nchildren in my State is growing up in poverty.\n  What the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Minnesota have \noffered is some relief for people in that category, to see to it that \nthey might also enjoy the prosperity of our country.\n\n  Meals on Wheels, adult day care, foster care--there is a wide variety \nof other issues. But as my colleagues know, I have tried to focus my \nattention, over the years, particularly on children and their needs; \nand hence the amendment I will offer with Senator Jeffords in a moment \non child care and afterschool care.\n  But I realize this amendment being offered by the Senator from \nFlorida covers more than just children. For example, it covers adult \nday care. Three generations living under the same roof--we find that a \nmore frequent occurrence in our society. The wonderful advances in \nmedicine allow people to live longer, more fruitful lives, but it also \ncreates generational burdens in many ways.\n  So this is not an unreasonable request for a nation of almost 280 \nmillion people to see to it that those who are the least well off--\ncarrying some of the most significant burdens--can also share in the \nprosperity we are enjoying. That is what I think we would all like to \nthink of when we talk about America: a nation where there is equal \nopportunity.\n  What this amendment does is create opportunity. It does not guarantee \nsuccess, but it gives people a chance to maximize their potential. For \nthose reasons, I strongly urge the adoption of the amendment, and again \nI am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to reserve time to close. If there are any \nspeakers in opposition to the amendment, I would defer to them and then \nI would like to close.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are prepared to move to the close on \nbehalf of the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The arguments in favor of this amendment are numerous. \nThe Federal Government made a commitment to the States as part of the \nwelfare-to-work legislation that it would maintain funding for this \nprogram at the level of $2.38 billion each year. That commitment was \nmade out of a recognition of the importance of the programs funded \nthrough title XX of the Social Security Act toward achieving the \nresults, the goals of welfare to work. We are about to breach that \ncommitment--not just to breach it, we are about to obliterate that \ncommitment.\n  Second, the proposal directs the States to spend a portion of their \ntobacco settlement to replace these Federal funds, the funds we have \ncommitted to make available to the States.\n  We have voted in this Senate on numerous occasions, by margins of 70 \nto 30 or more, against that specific proposition, against the attempt \nof the Federal Government to play big father and direct the States as \nto how they should use their tobacco settlement money. Now, having \nbeaten back the efforts at the front door, we see this effort coming in \nthrough the back door saying: Well, we are not going to tell you that \nyou have to spend your money. We are just going to cut over half of a \ncritical Federal partnership program with the States, a program we \ncommitted to as part of the States entering into the Welfare-to-Work \nProgram. We are just going to suggest. And, by the way, you ought to \nspend your tobacco money to fund it. Outrageous.\n  Third, this is not just a matter of what is in our heart; this is \nalso what is in our mind. The reason Congress adopted this program in \n1975--which, if I recall, was under the administration of President \nFord--was the recognition that expenditure of Federal funds on programs \nthat kept older Americans out of nursing homes, expenditure of Federal \nfunds on programs that alleviated the suffering and the potential for \nfurther suffering of the disabled, saved the Federal Government money, \nprograms that kept families together, that helped children in need, \nsaved the Federal Government money. With almost no consideration, we \nare about to turn the clock back on this accomplishment of President \nFord and 25 years of demonstrated success of this program in both \nhelping people and saving the Federal Government money.\n  Most important, we are about to pick out the most vulnerable people \namong us and say: It is upon your back that we are going to attempt to \nreduce the imbalance in our budget accounts. We are going to turn to \nthe weakest to say: You should carry the fullest load.\n  I don't want to just speak these closing remarks in my words. I will \nuse the words of a few of the many organizations across America which, \nin the short period of time since the alert went out that this \nridiculous action was even being considered by the most deliberative \nbody in the world, have responded with their assessment of what this \nwould mean. Let me mention a few of them.\n  The National Governors' Association had this to say:\n\n       Over the past few years, the [social services block grant] \n     has taken more than its share of cuts in federal funding. As \n     part of the 1996 welfare reform deal, Congress made a \n     commitment to Governors that the SSBG would be level funded \n     at $2.38 billion each year.\n\n  Congress made a commitment to the States that this funding would be \nmaintained. Now we are about to cut that funding by more than 50 \npercent, according to the National Governors' Association.\n  The Fight Crime Invest in Kids Coalition, an organization that \nrepresents over 500 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, victims of \nviolence, leaders of police organizations and violence prevention \nscholars, had this to say about this proposal:\n\n       The Graham-Wellstone amendment to restore funding of $2.38 \n     billion for the Title XX Social Services Block Grant would:\n       Provide over $591 million to protect children from abuse \n     and neglect. Since abused and neglected children are almost \n     twice as likely to become chronic offenders, it is clear \n     these services can have an important crime prevention impact.\n       Provide $300 million to support child care in 47 States. \n     The High/Scope Foundation study showed that quality child \n     care can dramatically reduce the chances of children becoming \n     criminals.\n\n  That is what 500 chiefs of police and sheriffs and other leaders in \nthe criminal justice community have said about the importance of this \namendment.\n  Catholic Charities USA said this in its letter:\n\n       Cutting funds to services that keep people independent and \n     in their communities is short sighted and will lead to \n     unnecessary suffering and increases in other federal \n     programs.\n\n  This is what the Girl Scouts said about this proposal:\n\n       The further cuts to this program which have been proposed \n     by the Senate will no doubt negatively impact our \n     communities, most of which are already struggling with \n     limited resources for much needed services.\n\n  Finally, the National Conference of State Legislatures in their \nletter stated:\n\n       The current proposal in the Senate Labor, Health and Human \n     Services and Education appropriations legislation will \n     jeopardize services to the elderly, disabled and children and \n     families. It also represents a retreat from Federal \n     commitments made during the enactment of welfare reform \n     legislation.\n\n  For all of those reasons, as well as the fact that Senators Kennedy \nand Cleland have asked to be added as additional cosponsors to this \namendment, I urge my colleagues to step back from the precipice of \nirresponsibility and repudiation of commitment, to step back from the \ncliff that would have us, through the back door of this ill-considered \nproposal, breach our commitments to the States to keep our hands off \ntheir State-won tobacco settlement, and particularly so we can look in \nthe eyes of the American people who would\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\nbe most affected by this--the children, the disabled, and the frail \nelderly--and say: You are not the forgotten Americans.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my displeasure at the \nsevere reduction this year's Labor-Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill includes for the Social Services Block Grant. This \nprogram was established under Title XX of the Social Security Act to \nhelp people who are least able to help themselves; the elderly, the \ndisabled, and children of low income families. The money is put to good \nuse in some two dozen areas such as foster care services, day care, \nintervention and prevention for at-risk families, and special services \nfor the disabled. The Labor-HHS Subcommittee has produced a bill that \ncuts SSBG funds from $1.9 billion to $1 billion. Just short of cutting \nit in half. The committee report cites tight budget constraints and \nsuggests that states can make up the difference with proceeds from the \ntobacco settlement. Mr. President, money from the tobacco settlement \nshould be used for anti-smoking programs and other health programs. The \nbasis of that litigation was that smoking caused health problems which \nthe states had paid for. So health care programs that were deprived of \nfunds in the past should be the beneficiaries of the tobacco money, as \nshould anti-smoking programs. We should not tell the states that we're \npulling the rug out from under the SSBG and it is up to them to make up \nthe difference if they choose to. Some states have already passed \nlegislation that allocates the tobacco money.\n  The Social Services Block Grant program is an entirely egalitarian \nprogram. The formula could scarcely be simpler. The proportion of the \nmoney each state gets is the proportion of the national population it \nhas. New York has seven percent of the population. It gets seven \npercent of the funds. So this draconian cut affects states evenly. \nEveryone should be concerned about it.\n  One further point. This is a block grant. It allows the states to \ndecide how best to spend money on a range of similar needs. The \nalternative would be a handful of categorical programs to which the \nstates would apply individually. From time to time Senate debate \ncenters on the merits of block grants versus categorical programs. \nEducation comes to mind, for example. The opponents of block grants \nfrequently say that once you block grant a group of existing programs, \nit becomes significantly easier to cut their funding. If this $900 \nmillion reduction is allowed to stand, the opponents of block grants \nwill have a shining new example of the damage that can be done to a \nblock grant and the proponents of block grants will have a more \ndifficult time gaining their objectives in the future.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nGraham amendment to restore funding for Title XX, the Social Services \nBlock Grant. This program is critical to the ability of our states to \nmeet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens--children, the elderly \nand the disabled.\n  The present Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill contains a \nprovision to cut funding for the Social Services Block Grant by more \nthan half, from $2.38 billion to $1.05 billion. This program has been \nunder attack for years. In 1996, Title XX was cut by 15%. In 1998, the \nhighway bill used cuts in Title XX to pay for the out years of highway \nspending in 2001. While I understand the importance of roads for \neconomic development, should we pay for it by cutting basic funding for \nneedy children, disabled Americans, or senior citizens?\n  In the last few years this Congress has sent a message to the states. \nWe have said, ``We trust you to know how to take care of your own \npeople. We want to support you, and help you, and at the same time, \ngive you the flexibility to design your own programs.'' This was one of \nthe clear messages of welfare reform.\n  As one of the members on this side of the aisle who voted for the \n1996 welfare law, I have to say that I truly believe that these Title \nXX cuts will weaken welfare efforts in our states. The Social Services \nBlock Grant is used to provide many important support services that \nhelp complement the efforts of welfare reform in helping individuals go \nto work and continue working--education and training services, \nemployment services, transportation, and child care are all among the \nimportant programs supported by this block grant. Indeed, as part of \nthe welfare reform package that I agreed to, we promised the states \nthat we would maintain funding for Title XX at the $2.38 billion level \nuntil reauthorization in 2002. How can we take back that promise now?\n  You know, one of the greatest features of the Social Services Block \nGrant is its flexibility. States, and even communities, can determine \nhow to best serve their poor, their elderly, their children and their \ndisabled citizens. My state provides an excellent example of this. \nWhile nationally states used an average of 14% of the Title XX block \ngrant for foster care program for abused and neglected children, in \nWest Virginia we use over 30% of our block grant for foster care and \n34% for protective services for abused and neglected children. West \nVirginia cannot afford such a drastic cut in Title XX. It will \nundermine our State's commitment to abused and neglected children just \nwhen tough, new federal time lines are being enforced to move more \nchildren from foster care into safe, permanent homes faster.\n  If we cut this funding by more than half, my state will face enormous \nchallenges in its efforts to keep children safe and stable in their \nhomes and communities. This is intolerable.\n  Nationally, 12% of the Title XX block grant is spent on services for \nthe elderly, including protective services for seniors who are victims \nof abuse and neglect. In West Virginia, 10% of our block grant--a \nlittle over $1.6 million--is spent on these services for seniors. This \nnot only provides them with support and protection, it helps them \nremain in their own homes, rather than being placed in nursing homes or \nother institutions.\n  What message are we sending to our poor, elderly neighbors, if we cut \nthese services in half?\n  As a former Governor, I understand why Governors want the flexibility \nof block grants. But the history of Congress is to push for block \ngrants in the name of ``flexibility'' but then to slowly but surely cut \nthe funding of block grants, leaving states and families in the lurch. \nAs a member who cares deeply about poor children, disabled Americans \nand needy families, I am worried about how such cuts will effect the \nsmall communities and our most vulnerable families.\n  We should not cut these vital funds. There is a unique and strong \ncoalition fighting to protect this vital investment ranging from \ngovernment groups like the National Governors Association and National \nAssociation of Counties, to dedicated service providers like Catholic \nCharities and the United Way. If we believe in community programs and \nthe importance of non-profit charities, how can we justify cuts to \nTitle XX which will hinder their partnership projects?\n  The Social Services Block Grant is not just good for people, it is \nalso good policy. It gives the states flexibility. It helps communities \nto be innovative in taking care of their own by supporting local \npartnerships. It makes sense.\n  These funding cuts undermine many of our priorities. We cannot say we \nwant to invest in children and families, then cut the Title XX Social \nServices Block Grant. This is worse than many of the budget gimmicks in \nthis legislation because cutting Title XX hurts vulnerable families in \ncommunities across America. We should not cut this program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to briefly discuss with my colleague, \nSenator Graham, some language that appeared in the Appropriations \nCommittee Report for the fiscal year 2000 Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations bill. Senator Graham, I understand that the Report \nstates, with regard to the funding reduction in Social Services Block \nGrant program, that ``the States can supplement the block grant amount \nfunds received through the recent settlements with tobacco companies.'' \nSenator Graham, I understand you have seen this language?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes I have, and I thank my colleague from Texas. I must \nsay I was very surprised by this report language, particularly \nconsidering the fact that the Senate only this year voted several times \nand decisively to prevent the federal government from seizing the money \nthe States earned as\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\npart of their tobacco settlements. Legislation that you and I offered \nin the Senate passed overwhelmingly, and amendments to that language to \nforce the states to spend their settlement funds according to a \nspecified formula were soundly rejected.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is an excellent point. In fact, I think it \nshould be pointed out for the Record that, on March 18 of this year, \nthe Senate voted 71 to 29 to protect our States' settlement funds by \ndefeating an amendment that would have directed that states spend at \nleast half of their settlements according to whatever specific list of \nprograms the Secretary of Health and Human Services designated during \nany given year. Thus, the Senate rejected the notion that the federal \ngovernment should have an annual veto over more than $140 billion of \nstate funds. I think it is also worth noting that the Hutchison/Graham \nlegislation we introduced this year to protect these state funds from \nfederal seizure had 47 cosponsors, including substantial bipartisan \nsupport. The legislation was signed into law by the President on May \n21, 1999.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that clarification. Our effort \ncertainly struck an unmistakable blow for states' rights, and I am \npleased and proud that our states and others are now free to use their \nfunds for children's health, health research, smoking control, and the \nmany other health, education, and public welfare programs that they are \npursuing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In fact, I would like to point out that, of the \nroughly $1.8 billion that Texas is spending during the present budget \nbiennium, virtually every dollar is going toward health care. For \nexample, the state is allocating over $200 million for a permanent \nendowment for children's cancer research; $200 million for smoking \ncontrol and research activities; $100 million for emergency and trauma \ncare; $180 million to expand health insurance for low income children; \nand over $1 billion in various permanent endowments for many of our \nstate's public and teaching hospitals. I am proud of what Texas is \ndoing, and I am proud that you and I and so many of our colleagues had \nthe courage to stand-up for the right of our states to pursue those \npriorities and programs that best meet the needs of their residents.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague for her statement, and for her \nleadership in this important area.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the gentleman for his leadership as well, and \nI am glad we had the opportunity to clarify the intent and the will of \nthe Senate in this regard. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager, I move to \ntable the amendment by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, and the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which amendment is the Senator referring?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am referring to the amendment by Senator Graham of \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment or the first-\ndegree amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. To clarify the motion, I apologize, I did not realize \nit was a second degree. The motion I have just made would be to the \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous \nconsent that will explain what the remainder of the evening will be. We \nare waiting for the other side to sign off.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside in order for Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut to offer his amendment and that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order to the Dodd amendment prior to a vote on a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will pause for one moment, I think what \nwe are close to doing is having about four votes that would occur at \naround 5:15. So Senators can be on notice. We need to get one more sign \noff on that matter before we officially announce it. But that is the \nintent of the managers of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1813\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for activities carried out under the \n          Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  I call up amendment No. 1813\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. Murray, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1813.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the matter under the heading ``payments to states for \n     the child care and development block grant'' in the matter \n     under the heading ``Administration for Children and \n     Families'' in title II, strike ``$1,182,672,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, \nSenator Levin, and others.\n  Let me begin these remarks by apologizing to my colleagues who, once \nagain, are being asked to vote on a child care amendment. The obvious \nquestion raised is, Why am I voting on this for the third or fourth \ntime? The simple reason is--and I appreciate the votes. We have had \ngood votes in the Senate, and strong bipartisan votes on this issue. \nBut for a variety of reasons, which I will not take the time of this \nbody to go into, the matter has been dropped in conference, or bills \nhave died, or for other reasons. So despite the good and strong and \npositive efforts on behalf of Members of the Senate, we have not been \nable to adopt the language on child care that my colleagues, by \noverwhelming votes, have adopted already in these past 10 months.\n  Again, Senator Jeffords, myself, and Senator Snowe are proposing this \namendment. It is somewhat different than the other ones in this regard \nonly. Earlier, amendments dealing with the child care proposal actually \nhad mandatory spending in them. This is discretionary spending. In \nfact, the amendment I am offering--properly the credit goes to Senator \nChafee of Rhode Island, who has been a champion on child care issues. \nThis amendment is basically the Chafee amendment on child care that we \nthink is deserving of our support on a bipartisan basis.\n  By increasing margins, as I have indicated, this body has supported \nadditional funding for the child care block grant. The first vote we \nhad was 57-43, the second vote was 60-33, and by the third vote it was \nunanimously adopted.\n  I apologize again at the outset for asking my colleagues, once again, \nto cast a child care vote since you think you have done so, and already \nyou have. But basically our opportunity to provide some additional \nfunding is still the same. The arguments have not changed. The bill \nhasn't changed, except this is discretionary and not mandatory, and \nobviously the need across our country has not changed over the last \nnumber of months.\n  I will take a few minutes. We have a very short time agreement on \nthis amendment. We have debated it extensively over the past year. I \ndon't want\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nto take any more of this Chamber's time than is necessary on this \namendment.\n  But the amendment would increase child care assistance to working \nfamilies by doubling the discretionary fund in the child care \ndevelopment block grant from $1 billion to $2 billion.\n  I continue to believe the best place for a child to be is with their \nparents. That is the best place--no question about it. But when both \nparents are working--as many do in this country, trying to put food on \nthe table, a roof over their children's heads--that is difficult. When \nthere is only one parent--regretfully, that happens too often in our \nsociety--you can imagine the burdens on a single parent who has to work \nand also has young children and trying to provide for child care needs.\n  So the reality is that good, affordable child care is a necessity. In \nthe absence of parental care, we try to do the best we can to \napproximate the kind of care that parents would give.\n  That is what this amendment is all about.\n  The child care block grant is almost a decade old. My good friend and \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and I authored the child care block \ngrant almost a decade ago. It won support and the signature of \nPresident Bush who signed the legislation into law, and it has provided \na lot of decent assistance to people over the years.\n\n  It provides direct financial assistance to help families pay for \nchild care and does not dictate where that care must be provided. \nParents across this country can choose a child care center as the child \ncare provider. They can choose a home-based provider, a neighbor, a \nchurch, a relative, or whatever they think is best for that child. We \nleave that entirely up to the parents to make that decision.\n  This block grant is also the largest source of Federal funding for \ncritical afterschool programs.\n  Again, we all appreciate, I think, the growing need for afterschool \ncare.\n  I point out to my colleagues that 30 percent of the child care block \ngrant is used by parents to pay for care to school-age children. That \ntranslates into almost $1 billion a year.\n  That is a major, major source of assistance to parents who worry \nabout who is watching their children after school in State after State \nacross our country.\n  The only downside to this now almost decade-old program is that it \nhas been underfunded because of the lack of resources. The Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act is available only to 1 in 10 eligible \nfamilies in America today.\n  Despite all the efforts over the years--and I appreciate the votes \nand the support we have received--still only one 1 in 10 eligible \nfamilies get any assistance under this program.\n  Because of a lack of resources States have been getting under the \nblock grant--it goes to the States--States have had to severely ration \nchild care assistance to families in need.\n  So what States have done is they create a threshold, a dollar \nthreshold, an income threshold. They say that anybody above that \nthreshold cannot get the child care development block grant assistance. \nThey have lowered the threshold--that is all the time--because the \nscarce dollars mean that they can only provide it to some families.\n  Let me explain what I mean.\n  Two-thirds of all of the States in the United States have cut this \nchild care assistance to families earning under $25,000 a year--two-\nthirds of all the States. Fourteen of those States have cut off all \nassistance to families earning over $20,000 a year, and eight States \neven ration the funds more stringently.\n  In the States of Wyoming, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa South \nCarolina, and West Virginia, if you are a family earning in excess of \n$17,000, you get no child care assistance.\n  I don't know how a family making $17,000 a year trying to work--this \nis a working family; I am not talking about somebody getting welfare. \nThese are working people. If you are a working mother, and you have a \n$17,000-a-year income, you have two children, you do not have child \ncare. I am sorry. You don't. You may be lucky and have a grandmother, \naunt, or next-door neighbor, and probably juggling it every day. But if \nyou are in those eight States, even in one of those 22 States, and make \n$20,000 or less, I don't know how people do it.\n  That is because we have underfunded for the block grant. I am not \ngoing to be able to take care of everybody. Senator Jeffords, Senator \nSnowe, I, and others who have supported these amendments know we are \nnot going to make a difference for every family. But if we can get a \nlittle more money by doubling this amendment from $1 billion to $2 \nbillion in this discretionary program, maybe these States--we think \nthey will--will raise those threshold levels, and as a result, more \nfamilies in these States will get that kind of good child care \nassistance that they need.\n\n  Let me tell you how bad this problem is. Even with these stringent \nincome eligibility requirements that I have just enumerated, consider \nthe waiting list that exists across America. I will not recite all 50 \nStates.\n  Let me tell you for almost every State that we have, the numbers are \nhigh.\n  In California, there are 200,000 children waiting for a child care \nslot, even with the income levels as low as they are.\n  So even when you have an income level of $17,000 or lower to get \nchild care, or $20,000 or lower, there are 200,000 children in those \nStates whose parents qualify financially. They are earning less than \n$20,000. But because there are so few funds, 200,000 are on a waiting \nlist.\n  Texas, 34,000; Massachusetts, 15,000; Pennsylvania, almost 13,000; \nAlabama, 19,000; Georgia, in excess of 12,000.\n  The list goes on.\n  These are families that are meeting those income criteria. But even \nwith the income criteria, there are not enough dollars to go around to \nprovide child care to these families.\n  There is a waiting list even with these low-income levels.\n  Other States ration their limited child care dollars by paying child \ncare providers poverty level wages.\n  That is hardly the way to ensure good, quality child care. Again, the \nlowest paid teachers in America are child care providers.\n\n  What a great irony. I don't think anyone argues we probably ought to \nhave the best prepared teachers for the most vulnerable of our \nsociety--kids. A case could be made, I suppose, that someone in a \nhigher education institution needed less care. But imagine a 6-month-\nold baby and the person who watches that 6-month-old, 1-year-old child \nis one of the lowest paid workers.\n  I am urging my colleagues to adopt this amendment so we can raise \nsome of the income levels, we can get a few more dollars to the child \ncare providers who are so necessary, and we can also see if we cannot \nhelp our Governors raise some of the income levels.\n  We have voted on this now three times. I am deeply apologetic to my \ncolleagues. I have had unanimous support for this amendment as recently \nas a few months ago. Because of bills dying or being dropped in \nconference, we are back at it again. I apologize for taking the time of \nmy colleagues on this amendment that Senator Jeffords and I have \noffered. We cannot let this issue go away. It is too important to too \nmany families.\n  I thank publicly Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Campbell of \nColorado, Senator Chafee, Senator Collins, Senator DeWine, Senator \nFrist, Senator Hatch, Senator Jeffords, Senator Roberts, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Specter, Senator Warner, and more. I will not read the entire \nlist of Republican colleagues who have been supportive of this \namendment. The Senators have made a difference voting for this. I thank \nthe Senators for their support.\n  The votes I had then were for the mandatory program. This is \ndiscretionary funding. It is substantially different. Some in the past \nmay have said vote for this, it is mandatory; this is a discretionary \nprogram. Obviously, we are dealing with Senator Specter's bill. It is \ndifferent in that regard, probably less of a problem politically for \nsome.\n  I am deeply grateful for the strong bipartisan support and I am \nconfident we will have support again this afternoon on this issue which \nhas developed strong bipartisan interest in this body.\n  My principal cosponsor from Vermont is here. I want to make sure he \nhas some time to talk about this.\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a time agreement \nbe entered into, with 10 additional minutes for the proponents of the \namendment, and 15 minutes for myself and whomever I designate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my good friend from Connecticut. \nWe have been working for years to draw the attention of the public to \nthe essential need that we pay more attention and provide help in the \nchild care area. Each year we get the support of our Members. Each year \nwe have successfully gotten agreements for billions of dollars of the \nbudget, but the time is now to do something real. That is why we are \nhere, to make sure we make a commitment, not only make a commitment but \nprovide the funds to enable our society to be able to take advantage of \nall that can be done to make sure our children have an opportunity to \nparticipate in the best possible way in our society.\n  This amendment will almost double the funds that provide low-income \nworking families with the help they need. The amendment increases \nfunding for the child care and development block grant from about $1.83 \nbillion to $2 billion. This block grant has always been forward funded \nso no offset will be required. States are struggling to meet the \nescalating child care needs of low-income families, and they are \ntransitioning off of welfare. States have already transferred $1.2 \nbillion in TANF funds into the child development block grant; other \nStates use TANF dollars directly to pay for child care costs; while \nstill others have spent all of their TANF funds and have nothing left \nto transfer.\n  Still this is not enough. States have waiting lists for child care \nsubsidies provided under the CCDBG. In addition, many States provide \nsubsidies so low-income families are forced into the cheapest and in \nmany cases the poorest quality child care.\n  There are more than 12 million children under the age of 5, including \nhalf of all infants under 1 year of age, who spend at least part of the \nday being cared for by someone other than their parents. There are \nmillions more school-age children under the age of 12 who are in some \nform of child care at the beginning or end of the school day as well as \nduring school holidays and vacation. More 6-to-12-year-olds who are \nlatchkey kids return home from school to no supervision because parents \nare working and there are few, if any, alternatives.\n  While the supply of child care has increased over the past 10 years, \nthere are still significant shortages for parents in rural areas with \nschool-age children or infants and for lower income families. The cost \nof child care for lower middle-income families can rival the cost of \nhousing and the cost of food. The most critical growth spurt is between \nbirth and 10 years of age, precisely the time when nonparental child \ncare is most frequently utilized.\n  A Time magazine special report on ``How a Child Brain Develops'' from \nFebruary 3, 1997, said it best:\n\n       Good, affordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe \n     benefit for welfare mothers and working parents but essential \n     brain food for the next generation.\n\n  The Senate has voted on and passed similar amendments three times \nthis year. There were two votes on the budget resolution, and a \nmodified version of the amendments was included in the conference \nreport. Again, in July, Senator Dodd and I introduced a similar \namendment through the tax bill which was subsequently dropped in \nconference. Hopefully, this fourth time will be the charm and the \nSenate will pass this amendment and retain it in conference.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment which is so critical \nfor low-income working families and their children.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I thank so many of \nour Republican friends who worked with us on a bipartisan basis. I \nthank the manager, my good friend from Pennsylvania. We have been \ntogether many years. We both first arrived in this Chamber and we \nworked so closely together back 20 years ago, in 1981, on a caucus for \nchildren. It seems like a long time ago. Senator Specter, on numerous \noccasions, has been a real stalwart battler and fighter on behalf of \nthe Child Care Block Grant Program. I am deeply grateful to him for his \nsupport on that.\n  Senator Johnson desires to be added as a cosponsor.\n  I know my colleague from Pennsylvania wants to be heard on this. I \nthank my colleague from Vermont and I thank my colleague from Maine. I \nthank Senator Chafee who has been a champion on this issue.\n  The mandatory bill is gone and we are down to the discretionary bill. \nI apologize, I say to the manager. I know Members think we vote on this \nissue every other day, but each time we have been dropped in conference \ndespite unanimous votes in the Senate on this issue. I hope, as the \nSenator from Vermont has said, the fourth time may be a charm and we \nwill be able to provide some additional funds on a very worthwhile and \nneeded program.\n\n  I, again, thank my colleague for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the discussion of \nthe amendment on the merits, I would like to announce to my colleagues \nwe will shortly begin voting on four stacked votes: the Reid amendment, \nGraham amendment, Dodd amendment, and the Coverdell second-degree \namendment to the Enzi amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent we begin voting on these matters at 5:10.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, it is my \nunderstanding there will be 1 minute on each side to explain the \namendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I incorporate that into the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. And the Reid amendment will be the first amendment we will \nvote on?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Has all time elapsed for Senator Dodd?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Connecticut has 10 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The unanimous consent agreement gave him 10 minutes \ntotal. Since that time, Senator Jeffords has spoken and Senator Dodd \nhas spoken.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague yields, we will yield back whatever time we \nhave. I realize he is trying to move things along.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am trying to find out what is happening with the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont was \ncharged to him, and he yielded back his time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the remaining time between now and 5:10 on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are presently 8 minutes 35 seconds \nremaining for the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And the other time has been yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And 10 minutes remaining----\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back all time except 1 minute to sum up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I find it extremely difficult to speak to \nand vote on this amendment because I have supported this amendment on \nso many occasions. Senator Dodd accurately relates, when we were \nelected in 1980, we cochaired the Children's Caucus. Then, in 1987, \nafter we were reelected, we were cosponsors of the first parental leave \nprogram which had just begun. We have been soldiers in the field. I \nhave voted for this amendment again and again and again. But I am \ndeeply concerned if we agree to this amendment at this time and add \nanother $900 million to the current bill of $91.7 billion, we are not \ngoing to have any bill at all. We are not going to get 51 votes in this \nChamber to pass this bill and to go to conference. I say that because \nof the deep-seated concerns which have\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nbeen expressed by so many Senators about where we are.\n  We have a bill at $91.7 billion which is within the budget caps. We \nhave to go to conference with the House. We have to present a bill \nwhich the President will sign. I do not believe we will be able to do \nthat if we add $900 million more.\n  I can count the number of cosponsors which the persuasive Senator \nDodd has. It may be he will have enough sponsors to defeat a tabling \nmotion. I think next Tuesday, when Republican Senators return, on the \nvote on the underlying merits it may be different, although I very much \nwould like to support him. We have been very concerned about children \nin this bill. We increased the child care block grant $182 million for \nfiscal year 2000, which brings it to $1.182 billion. Senator Dodd would \nlike to have it added to $2 billion, and so would I, if I thought we \ncould get that bill passed. This $1.182 billion is in addition to the \nchild care entitlement which was increased $200 million, to $2.367 \nbillion next year. So we have on child care more than $3.5 billion.\n  In addition, States can transfer up to 30 percent, or $4.8 billion, \nof their temporary assistance to needy families, the so-called TANF \nblock grants, to the child care block grant. At the end of the first \nquarter of fiscal year 1999, States had $4.220 billion in unobligated \nTANF balances.\n  So there have been very substantial allocations for children. I might \nsay, this is an especially tough vote for me because earlier today, my \ndaughter-in-law, Tracey Specter, took the lead in establishing a child \ncare center in Philadelphia where she and her husband, my son, Shanin \nSpecter, have made a very generous contribution for child care. I know \nof the importance of child care so working mothers can provide needed \nassistance for their families in an era of two-wage-earner families and \nin an era of single mothers. I know how vital child care is. But this \nis going to be the log that breaks the camel's back. I think the camel \nnow is burdened so that a straw would break the camel's back, but this \nis not a straw, this is a log.\n  I do not know quite where we are going to be when final passage comes \non this bill and we do not have 51 votes. So it is a longstanding \npartnership I have with the Senator from Connecticut, elected on the \nsame day to this body, worked hand in glove, almost as longstanding a \nrelationship as with Senator Jeffords. Usually Senator Jeffords says, \n``Jump,'' and I say, ``How high?'' on matters which he has in mind. But \nit is with the greatest reluctance that I say I cannot support this \namendment, much as I would like to, for the reasons I have given.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator has 3 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me yield a minute or so to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's very gracious comments on this, \nand I appreciate the burden he is under. It is not easy to be the \nchairman of a committee. You have responsibilities to meet and you have \na lot of good requests that come your way.\n  I would make the case to my colleagues, I think there has been a \nstrong indication this is a matter in which we have been able to come \ntogether. We were so divided on so many issues, but on child care we \nfound common ground three times already in the last 7 or 8 months, the \nthree votes that have been cast on this issue. In fact, the previous \nones were on mandatory spending. This one is discretionary, so it ought \nto be somewhat more palatable for people.\n\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania on how \nmuch is already committed. But, of course, I still make the case it \nstill only serves 1 in 10 families--I know he knows--and there are a \nlot of people on waiting lists, thousands in each State, even with the \nincome levels down. As I said, in 8 States it is $17,000 less; in 14 \nStates, it is $20,000 less. I don't know how a family earning $20,000 a \nyear with all the other financial burdens they have also can meet a \nchild care expense they may have.\n  So while I am deeply appreciative of the quandary he is in, I make a \ncase this strengthens the likelihood we might get 51 votes for the \nbill. It is the kind of bipartisan proposal that has enjoyed so much \nsupport. It was unanimously adopted only a few weeks ago, so that it \nmight, in fact, bring some people who would feel otherwise disinclined \nto support the legislation, but doing something, as he properly points \nout, for working families--it is all working folks now--trying to make \nends meet, hold their families together. I know he knows this. I know \nhe cares about it deeply.\n  I hope in the coming minutes before the vote occurs on this, while \npeople may have voted one way on a variety of different bills, on this \none, this amendment, they might say: On this one, we ought to, with \nforward funding, find that extra $900 million so we can make a \ndifference for these families.\n  I am deeply appreciative of his kind words and his continuing efforts \nand fight. I was going to facetiously suggest, since his wonderful \ndaughter-in-law and son went into the business, maybe the chairman \nmight have to recuse himself on the vote since he may be compelled to \nvote to table. I say that only facetiously.\n  I am delighted his daughter-in-law and son have felt the need to be \ninvolved in the issue, and I am not surprised, knowing the Senator and \nhis spouse, that their children would want to carry on this terrific \ntradition they have started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for those generous \ncomments. He is almost pervasive enough to get me to change my mind, \nbut passage of this bill is more important.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the first rollcall \nvote, which is 15 minutes in accordance with our practice, with a 5-\nminute leeway, that the subsequent votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with great reluctance, I move to table \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1820\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to table the Reid amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if Members of the Senate have enjoyed and \nappreciated ``Prairie Home Companion,'' the great work of Ken Burns' \n``Civil War,'' ``Baseball''--and now he is doing a new one on Susan B. \nAnthony and Liz Stanton dealing with the women's movement--and if they \nhave enjoyed with their children ``Sesame Street,'' which is Big Bird \nand Elmo, then every person in the Senate should support my amendment.\n  We want to keep public broadcasting public and not commercial \nbroadcasting. We do not want it, like most everything else in America, \nto be commercialized. Our children and the rest of America at least \ndeserve this much from their Congress.\n  This amendment cries out for support. This is an education and labor \nbill, and I underline education. There is nothing more important as it \nrelates to education than having a sound public broadcasting function \nof our Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with reluctance, again, that I am \ncompelled to oppose the Reid amendment. I like public broadcasting, but \nthis bill has been crafted with some 300 programs. Public broadcasting \nis getting a $10 million increase. This is in the face of some very \nsubstantial problems which were raised with public broadcasting on the \nsale of lists to political organizations. Public broadcasting is very \nimportant, and with tight budget constraints, I think $350 million is \nan adequate allocation.\n  I must say, as the Senator from Nevada mentioned ``Sesame Street,'' \nagain, it is a family matter. My three granddaughters are mad about \n``Sesame Street.'' On goes the television, and their behavior is a \nmodel.\n  This budget can only stretch so far. It is crafted for more than 300 \nprograms. The better course is to take the\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\n$10 million increase, and $350 million is sufficient.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is there a tabling motion pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1820. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack), the Senator from Rhodes Island \n(Mr. Chafee), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine), and the Senator from \nWyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      {Rollcall Vote No. 301 Leg.}\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Chafee\n     DeWine\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Thomas\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to table the Graham amendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our staff tells me that we now have 62 \namendments pending to this bill. That means we are going to be here an \nawful long time on this bill. I think I am going to request that the \nleader initiate a weekend session if we are going to get this bill \npassed.\n  We had this bill out of committee with the hopes that we could get it \npassed today at the end of the fiscal year so we could once again get \nback to the habit of passing all the bills in the Senate that come from \nthe Appropriations Committee by the end of the fiscal year at least.\n  I hope Senators will tell us seriously how many of these amendments \nthey intend to call up. There are 41 on that side of the aisle and 21 \non this side of the aisle. Most of them are riders, and if you put them \non the bill, we will drop them in conference anyway. Beyond that, those \namendments that take money, you have to take money from some other \nSenator to get them passed.\n  Let's not play games with this bill. It is the last bill. It is the \nbiggest bill. This is the largest bill. Two-thirds of this bill is not \neven subject to our control. Two-thirds of the bill is entitlements. I \nhope we will start watching those entitlement bills and understand it \nis a very hard bill to put together.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nIowa for their handling of the bill. But I plead with you to tell us \nwhich of these amendments you really want to call up.\n  I see my good friend from Nevada. He doesn't have on the right tie \ntoday. But he is a man who believes, as I do, that bills should move \nforward as rapidly as we can move them. I hope I have his help in \nurging Senators to tell us which of these amendments you really want \nconsidered by the Senate and give us a time agreement on them so we \nknow how long it will take before we finish this bill.\n  Does the Senator wish the floor?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska that the \nmanagers of the bill on our side have suggested maybe we should drop \nyour amendments and our amendments. Would the Senator be willing to do \nthat?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to move to table them all and go to \nconference tonight.\n  Mr. REID. That is something we were talking about over here.\n  I say to the chairman of the full committee that we have already \nlooked at these amendments. A number of Members on this side are \nwaiting to see what amendments are being offered on the other side. \nThere are a couple of amendments that are going to cause this bill a \nreally slow ride through these Halls. One is on ergonomics, which is a \nreal problem; we have a dozen or so Senators who want to speak in \nrelation to that amendment.\n  So I think a lot depends on what amendments are offered on the \nmajority side to see how we can weed out some of these amendments over \nhere.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Parliamentarian to look at all \nof the amendments and see which of them are subject to rule XVI. I \nintend to raise rule XVI against any amendment I can raise it against.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1821\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are talking about one of those \nentitlement issues Senator Stevens just described.\n  The Finance Committee of the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee \nof the House established the funding level for title XX of the SSBG of \ntheir bill at $2.38 billion. The appropriators have reduced that amount \nto $1.50 billion, a cut of over 50 percent. This violates a commitment \nthe Congress made with the Governors in 1996 as part of the welfare-to-\nwork legislation. Therefore, the Governors are opposing the position \nthe committee has taken.\n  This is a backdoor violation of the commitment that 71 Senators made \nwhen we voted against having the Federal Government direct how the \nStates' tobacco settlement was spent.\n  Why is this? Because the way in which the subcommittee recommends we \nmake up this difference is to direct the States to use their tobacco \nmoney to fill this gap. Seventy-one Members of the Senate--48 \nRepublicans and 23 Democrats--voted in March of this year to do exactly \nthe opposite of what we are now being asked to do.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of honor of the Senate and our \ncommitment to our partners in the Federal system, the States.\n  I urge that this motion to table be defeated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as much as I have always favored the \nsocial services block grant program, the funding level in this bill is \nestablished as a matter of priority.\n  If we want to add to education $2.3 billion, significant additions to \nthe National Institutes of Health, and crafting some 300 programs, this \nis the level which is appropriate. The States can transfer up to 5 \npercent of their temporary assistance to needy families in this program \nthrough these block grants, which amounts to $16.5 billion. Mr. \nPresident, $825 million are available there.\n  At the close of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 States had \n$4.22 billion, so it can be made up. People may not want to consider \nthe tobacco funds, but the States have about $203 billion which has \nbeen given to them, where the argument was it should have come to the \nFederal Government to support these block grant programs.\n  If we are to pass this bill, if we are to get 51 votes, $91.7 \nbillion, we can't add additional funds with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). All time has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to table the amendment No. 1821. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain),\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Mack), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nChafee), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 302 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Chafee\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Thomas\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the underlying amendment, as \namended, be voice voted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to dispose of this matter now.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is 2 minutes equally divided \non the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think I had asked for the yeas and nays \non the underlying amendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A sufficient second has not been obtained. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is there are now 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Dodd amendment.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that this \namendment violates the Budget Act in that it exceeds the 302(b) \nallocations of the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is against the Dodd \namendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Dodd amendment would increase the amount under this \nchild care development block grant. This bill is at its ceiling now. \nThere is no additional money. I was told at first that it was written \nso it would apply to 2001. That is not the case.\n  The amendment is not subject to amendment, as I understand it, under \nthe procedure we are under right now and cannot be cured, and I make \nthe point of order that it violates the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the rule, the point of order is not in \norder until the time is expired--the motion to table has been made--and \nbeen disposed of. The regular order calls for 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. When I came in, I understood one \nof the sponsors had urged the adoption of this amendment; isn't that \nso?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table and \nthat takes priority over the point of order. The point of order will be \nin order when the debate on the motion to table has expired and the \nvote has taken place.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, this is an amendment we have voted \non--this is the fourth time in the last 7 months. I thank my colleagues \nfor the bipartisan support that the Dodd-Jeffords-Snowe and others \namendment has been given. Unfortunately, it has been dropped in \nconference in the past so it has not been adopted.\n  It was adopted unanimously by this body only a few weeks ago. Prior \nto that, it was a 66-33 vote. Unlike the previous votes, this is \ndiscretionary funding, not mandatory funding. It tries to deal with the \nissue of child care, something about which we all care.\n  We now know today that 1 in 10 families is struggling to make ends \nmeet. They are the poorest families in America and are working every \nday and not on public assistance. Today, in 25 States, if you earn more \nthan $20,000, you do not qualify for child care assistance.\n  I don't know how a family of four, earning $20,000 a year, with young \nchildren--where the parents are working, where they need to place these \nchildren in a safe place during the day--can afford that without some \nhelp.\n  For 10 years now, since Senator Hatch and I sponsored the child care \ndevelopment block grant that was adopted, this Congress has supported a \nchild care program.\n  Today, we want to serve more than just the 1 in 10 that is being \nserved. This amendment does that. My colleagues have voted for it in \nthe past. I urge my colleagues to do so again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in order to save time, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor, \nunder the regular order, for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We will be voting on the motion to table. At that point, \nthe point of order will lie. All we are going to do is cost every \nSenator 15 or 20 minutes. It will not change anything.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, there is obviously a different vote \ncount on the tabling motion than there is on a point of order. I would \nargue the point of order, but I am hoping----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reluctantly, I am opposed to the \namendment, which would add some $900 million to this bill. There have \nbeen substantial increases on child care and on child care entitlement. \nIf we have $900 million added to this bill--which is now at $91.7 \nbillion--it is the log that breaks the camel's back. I think it is a \nvery good program, but in establishing priorities, we have already \nallocated very substantial funds to this line. Therefore, I am opposed \nto the amendment and I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed just 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to correct my statement. This does amend a \nsection in this bill, which is advance funding, and it is, therefore, \nnot subject to the point of order I would have made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order.\n  The regular order is now on the motion to table the Coverdell \namendment. Two minutes are equally divided. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire. I asked the \nParliamentarian for a list of those amendments that violated rule XVI \nthat have been offered by various tenders. May I inquire, when will it \nbe in order for me to make my points of order against those amendments \nthat violate rule XVI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments would have to be pending before \nthe point of order would be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will leave on the desk a list of the \namendments that have been found to violate rule XVI.\n  May I make a further parliamentary inquiry. Under the new rule XVI, \nthe Parliamentarian's rule cannot be waived; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no provision to waive rule XVI.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to leave this on my desk and ask Members to \nsee if their amendments are within this category. If they wish to \nwithdraw them, of course, I will not make a motion to table them. I \nthink that would be the easiest way to dispose of them--to have Members \nwithdraw their amendments. But I do intend to make a point of order \nunder rule XVI against some 23 amendments before the evening is over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on this amendment on which we are about to \nvote, we have given an increase to OSHA for the work they do. What I am \nasking is that we continue to recognize there are parts of those that \ngo in hand in hand. One of the parts is enforcement. The other is \nconsultation.\n  There are 1,275 pages of OSHA that every business has to follow. They \nneed the consultation to be able to wade through that. They need \nsomebody they can ask to be able to get answers.\n  I have taken the increase in OSHA and given some recognition that \nconsultation ought to be a part of that. Consultation will help. I \ndon't know that they will spend it that way. We don't have any really \ngood oversight to see that. But it is the trend we have to follow. \nSixty-six percent of their money goes to enforcement and 30 percent \ngoes to consultation. I am asking you to split this money in \nrecognition between the two so that kind of an emphasis will continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the bill in its present form has \nthe appropriate balance between conciliation and enforcement. In the \nlast 5 years, enforcement has declined $3 million, from $145 million to \n$142 million; conciliation has grown from $3l.5 million to almost $41 \nmillion, an increase of 30 percent.\n  I think the bill as written is proper. I might add that it does not \nunduly prejudice the case on the merits, and if the Enzi amendment is \nnot tabled under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator Wellstone has \nleave to file a second-degree amendment with 15 minutes to argue it, to \nbe followed by another rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table amendment No. 1885. On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Mack), and the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent I be notified if any \nof those amendments on the list at the desk are called up.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, would the \nchairman mind if somebody else initiated the point of order? He would \nnot have to be here if somebody else did it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assure the distinguished whip that I will be here. But \nin the event I am not here, I have not asked that I be the one to have \nthe exclusive right to make a point of order. I only asked I be \nnotified if it is called up. In effect, I am serving notice if you call \nup that amendment, I will make the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, what is the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is the Senator be notified if any \nof those amendments are called up that violate rule XVI.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't mind that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the Enzi \namendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1885) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for the information of my colleague, I \nwas so overwhelmed with this past vote, I was so moved by this past \nvote to give me an opportunity to speak even more on the floor of the \nSenate, that I am now going to vitiate that part of the unanimous \nconsent agreement to have a vote on this second-degree amendment so \ncolleagues could leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1846) was agreed to.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin for their dedicated work on this legislation which \nprovides federal funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices (HHS), and Education. This appropriations bill provides \nfunding for many critical programs directly helping American families \nand providing important assistance to our most important resource, our \nchildren.\n  One of the most important components in this bill is its vital \nsupport for education. We owe it to each and every child to ensure that \nthey have access to a high quality education. This is why I am pleased \nthat this bill increases funding for Department of Education to almost \n$38 billion, including nearly $6 billion for educating children with \nspecial needs and $5.2 billion for the Head Start program.\n  I am also pleased to note that this bill prohibits federally funded \nnational education standards. It continues to be my strong belief that \nour nation must have higher learning expectations for our children but \nacademic standards must be controlled by state and local authorities, \nnot the bureaucrats in Washington.\n  This bill contains important resources for helping make college and \ncontinuing education more affordable for all Americans. Under this \nbill, the maximum loan amount for post-secondary education would be the \nhighest level in the program's history--$3,325 per student. In \naddition, this legislation provides $1.4 billion for higher education \nopportunities, including $180 million for GEAR UP which assists under-\nprivileged children and $5 million to provide access to affordable \nchild care for parents struggling to complete their college education \nwhile raising their children.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill provides significant funding \nfor medical research at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, $17.6 \nbillion, which is an increase of $2 billion from last year. I am sure \nthat my colleagues share my support for this 13 percent increase in \nfunding for vital research which could lead to important scientific \nbreakthroughs which will improve the health of our citizens. Finally, I \nam encouraged to note that this bill took an important step towards \nmeeting the needs of over 7,000 children and families whose lives have \nbeen devastated by hemophilia-related AIDS, by beginning to fund the \nRicky Ray Act as authorized by Congress last year.\n  Furthermore, I was pleased to learn that the sections allocating \nfunding for Labor, HHS and Education were free of direct earmarks, set \nasides or unauthorized appropriations. However, my initial enthusiasm \nwas dampened somewhat upon reviewing the report language. While the \nCommittee made a concerted effort to not include any specific \nearmarking in those Departments' budgets, the report contains an \nexorbitant amount of directive language that is clearly intended \nto have the same effect as an earmark. By this, I mean the use of words \nlike ``encourage'', ``urge'', and ``recommend'' in connection with \nreferences to particular institutions, projects, or proposals that the \nCommittee would obviously like the relevant agencies to fund.\n\n  These are not direct earmarks, but I am sure the programs which the \nCommittee ``encourages'' or ``urges'' the agencies to support will \nreceive special consideration. While the Committee avoided providing a \nline item for funding specific projects, it stated its strong \npreference for the funding or continued funding of many specific \nprojects which would clearly bypass the competitive funding process.\n  I will highlight a few examples of report language that contain a \nmultitude of expressions of support, short of earmarks, for particular \nprojects. These include:\n  The Committee urges the Department of Labor to give full and fair \nconsideration to funding requests submitted by the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania to retrain incumbent workers.\n  The Committee encourages the Department of Labor to support \nagricultural training for dislocated sugarcane workers in Hawaii.\n  The Committee recommends continued support by the Department of Labor \nfor the Alaska Federation of Natives Foundation to develop and train \nAlaska native workers for year-round employment within the petroleum \nindustry.\n  The Committee encourages the agency to contribute technical \nassistance to the University of Nevada at Reno and Las Vegas toward the \nestablishment of educational channels for a school of pharmacy.\n  The Committee stated its awareness of the San Bernardino County \nMedical Center proposal to create a ``hospital without walls.'' In \naddition, the Committee notes that the Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital is \nproposing the creation and implementation of a Northern California \nTelemedicine Network.\n  The Committee is aware of a proposal by the Montana State University-\nBillings to develop in collaboration with\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nmedical facilities in the area a telemedicine program to provide \npreventive medicine and support services to the large elderly \npopulation in Billings and eastern Montana.\n  The Committee continues to be supportive of the work being conducted \nby the Low Country Health Care Systems.\n  The Committee encourages priority be given to the University of \nHawaii at Hilo Native Language College when allocating funds for native \nHawaiian education.\n  The Committee is concerned about the absence of technology \nintegration in the north central communities of Pennsylvania. The \ncommittee notes the efforts of the Lock Haven University of \nPennsylvania for its development of two regional networks to link these \nrural communities.\n  Mr. President, I could continue listing the specific projects, which \nthe report highlights and for which the Committee provides \nencouragement for continued or new funding, but I will not waste the \nSenate's valuable time. Due to its length, the list I compiled of \nobjectionable provisions included in the Senate report cannot be \nprinted in the Record. This list will be available on my Senate \nwebsite.\n  It is simply inappropriate that the committee is attempting to \ninfluence the open, competitive funding process, thereby limiting the \nfunds available to workers, schools, hospitals, and communities around \nthe country which are not fortunate enough to live in a State with a \nSenator on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a very important \nsubject. I am referring to teen smoking.\n  Currently, teen smoking rates are far too high and they continue to \nrise. Since I left the Missouri Governor's office, teen smoking in \nMissouri has increased from 32.6% to 40.3%--almost a 24% increase! In \nfact, today, Missouri ranks sixth in the nation in teen smoking.\n  While there is disagreement in this body on where teen smoking \npolicies should be set--at the federal or state level--we all agree \nthat it must be addressed.\n  Seven years ago, in an attempt to tackle this problem, the United \nStates Congress passed what is now known as the Synar Amendment. This \namendment required the states to meet specified targets in reducing \nteen access to cigarettes. It did not tell the States how to meet the \ntargets but just that they had to meet them.\n  I believe, as I argued during the debate on the Federal tobacco tax \nlegislation, that States are in the best position to tackle the serious \nproblem of teen smoking. Governors, state legislatures, mayors, and \ncity councils know how to target their programs. They know how to \ntailor educational programs for the local schools and communities. They \nhave better access to convenience store owners and other retail \nestablishments where teens buy cigarettes.\n  With that in mind, I am deeply troubled about our current situation.\n  Mr. President. Today, there are seven states and the District of \nColumbia who failed to meet their targets to reduce teen access to \ncigarettes. They have failed the state's teens and their parents. In \naddition, since their failure triggered a cut in federal block grant \nfunds of 40%, they have failed those who need treatment for drug abuse \nand addiction under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA).\n  I guess we could be optimists and focus on the fact that 43 states \ndid meet their targets. Forty-three states that made it a priority to \ncut teen smoking have succeeded. Forty-three states worked with local \ncommunities and found a way to reduce teen smoking. Therefore, 86% of \nthe states met their goals--shouldn't we be pleased by that?\n  Unfortunately I cannot be an optimist today. For one of those seven \nstates who failed to meet the target was the State of Missouri. This is \nan important issue to me. As Governor of the State of Missouri, I \nsigned the law that now makes it illegal to sell minors tobacco.\n  Under the federal law, the State of Missouri had to make sure that no \nmore than 28% of teens who attempted to purchase cigarettes were \nsuccessful. That seems reasonable--however, the actual success rate was \n33%. That means that in one out of every three minors attempting to buy \ncigarettes was successful. One out of Three!\n  Due to this failure, the State of Missouri is set to lose $9.6 \nmillion to be used for drug addiction treatment. That is $9.6 million \nto be used to help drug addicted pregnant women, to reduce teen drug \nuse, and to provide treatment to those whose lives have been destroyed \nby a lifetime of drug use.\n  In this discussion, it is important to recognize that we have given \nthe states the tools they need to fight teen smoking. We rejected the \nmammoth--bureaucracy and tax laden--tobacco bill. I led the fight \nagainst that bill. By defeating that bill, we made sure the tobacco \nmoney went to the states for tobacco prevention programs--and was not \nwasted on federal bureaucracy--on the 17 new boards, commissions, and \nagencies established in the bill.\n  By defeating that bill, the states got the money rather than \nWashington. In fact, by killing that bill the State of Missouri \nreceived $6.7 billion from the tobacco settlement. That money is more \nthan a third more resources than they would have received under the \nfederal legislation. In addition to money, the states won clear limits \nfrom the tobacco companies on marketing techniques aimed at young \npeople.\n  With this Settlement in mind, it is even more disappointing that \ntoday we are left with this tough choice. We either respect the federal \nlaw and penalize those who are in need of drug treatment programs--or \nwe bail out these states who have failed our nation's teens.\n  In trying to determine the best course of action, we listened to the \nexperts. Barry McCaffrey, the President's Drug Czar, stated that by \nwithholding these funds ``. . . some heroin addicts might be forced \nback on the streets to return to a criminal life.'' He says: ``[w]e \nagree that the carrot-and-stick approach of the law can serve a purpose \nof pushing compliance, but we must not throw the baby out with the \nbathwater by increasing drug addiction and crime.'' It is a tough \nchoice, but we must protect Americans from the scourge of drug use.\n  In addition, I can't let those in the State of Missouri suffer due to \nthe State's ineffective enforcement program. I am pleased to have \nworked with Senator Bond, the Senior Senator from Missouri, and other \nmembers whose states did not meet their targets in finding a solution \nto this problem.\n  There is no question that the agreement does not contain everything I \nbelieve it should--such as creating penalties for teens who purchase, \nuse and possess cigarettes. I continue to believe that if we really \nwant to reduce youth smoking, we must place some responsibility on \nteens.\n  However, I am relieved we have found a solution. These states will be \nforced to devote new money to anti-teen smoking programs. Based on that \ncommitment, they will receive their SAMHSA money.\n  I hope we do not find ourselves in this same position next year. This \nshould be a wake up call to these states to step up their enforcement \nand pass tough teen smoking laws. The increase in teen smoking rates is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will be doing wrapup momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will withhold.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to notify the Members that there will be some \nmore time taken on the bill itself, but that will be the final recorded \nvote for tonight, the last vote for tonight. There will be at least one \nvote tomorrow. I am still working on both sides to make a final \ndetermination on Monday. It is anticipated we will have at least one \nvote, maybe more, on Monday. But we have not locked that in yet. We \nwill notify you of that officially tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Collins be recognized at 9 a.m. on \nFriday to call up her amendment, No. 1824, there be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form, and a vote to occur \nimmediately on conclusion or yielding back of time and no second-degree \namendments in order. That would mean the vote tomorrow would be at \n9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. The next vote will occur at 9:30 in the morning.\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11720-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11720-S11721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 82\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate all who have been involved in \nthis next unanimous consent. A lot of effort has gone into it.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do not intend to object. But I have been \ntrying now for almost 2 years on this very important legislation to \ndeal with a very serious problem my constituents have brought to my \nattention dealing with the loophole-ridden Death On The High Seas Act.\n  We had families at home in Oregon lose loved ones in international \nwaters as a result of a situation where a Korean freighter ran them \nover. I have been repeatedly assured in the Senate Commerce Committee \nthat we would have an opportunity on the floor of the Senate to remedy \nthis great injustice. In fact, Chairman McCain had agreed with me \npreviously to work to reform the Death On The High Seas Act to ensure \nthat victims of maritime accidents would have the same rights as those \nprovided to victims of aviation accidents under the FAA bill.\n  I have been extremely patient with respect to this matter. I have \nindicated on at least two occasions that I would not offer the \namendment. I do not intend to do it now because the FAA legislation is \nof such extraordinary importance. But I want to make it clear to the \nSenate that at the next available opportunity, I am going to do \neverything I can to ensure that these victims of these maritime \ntragedies--tragedies in international waters where very often they are \nrun over by foreign freighters and left at sea languishing for hours \nand hours--actually have a remedy. They do not today. It is a grave \ninjustice.\n  We have discussed this at considerable length in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. In fact, we even made changes in the Death on the High Seas \nAct in the past without addressing this particular issue.\n  I do not intend to hold up the consideration of the FAA legislation \nbecause it is so important, but I want to make it very clear to the \nSenate that at the next available opportunity, we are going to debate \nthis on the floor of the Senate. We are going to have an up-or-down \nvote on it. My colleagues are now aware of that.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I address the distinguished majority \nleader who has been very helpful to the interests of my State given \nthat National Airport and Dulles Airport are undergoing extensive \nmodernization. In the present form of the bill that the leader has \ndesignated, is that issue taken care of? If not, is the opportunity \nopen for the Senator from Virginia and others to address that issue?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield under his \nreservation, first, I thank Senator Wyden for his comments and for the \nrecord he has made and for not objecting. I know this is an important \nissue to him. He could object and bring additional pressure on the \nchairman and the committee. He is on the committee. I know he will \ncontinue to work on it. I know he and Senator McCain will be talking \nabout it on Monday. I thank him for not objecting.\n  With regard to the question of the Senator from Virginia, I believe \nthe issue that is so important to him is addressed in the bill the way \nhe understands it to be. But if it is not or if there is any problem, \nunder this unanimous consent request, relevant amendments on aviation \nwould be in order and any amendment that he or the other Senator from \nVirginia wishes to offer with regard to this matter would be in order \nand would be protected.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished leader. Likewise, \nthe issue of the number of slots has been a moving target. May I \ninquire as to the current specification in the bill and whether or not \nthat could be changed by the proponents of the bill under this UC \nbetween now and the date it is brought up?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator's question, I have \nin my mind the number of slots that are available based on the \ndiscussions he and I have had over about 2 years. I am assuming that is \nwhat is in the bill. I have to check and make sure of the exact number, \nbut whatever it is, if the Senator is not satisfied with that, an \namendment and a debate to change that number would certainly be in \norder.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our leader for the assistance he \nhas given throughout the years to the Commonwealth of Virginia and \nother interested parties with regard to these two airports.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I \nshall not--I do not think I will--as I understand this unanimous \nconsent agreement, this will be the FAA bill with relevant amendments. \nDoes the majority leader intend to bring up the nuclear waste bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to bring up the nuclear waste bill. I think \nthis is a major environmental issue. It is very important to a number \nof States, I believe, including the Senator's State of Minnesota.\n  There has been an indication there may be a desire for a filibuster \nand perhaps the Democrat leadership would not support cloture on this \nvery important issue. If that is the case, then I would not be inclined \nto file cloture on it on Friday, giving us additional time to see if we \ncan work out an agreement or accommodation as to how to bring up that \nvery important issue.\n  I do not know how many States have nuclear waste sitting in open \ncooling pools or how many people have looked at the need to address \nthis problem. I believe a large number of Senators probably as many as \ntwo-thirds or more, believe we need to move this legislation. I want to \nfind a way to do that.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I can do a quick followup, the reason I asked the \nmajority leader was actually less because of the subject matter of that \nbill but the question whether or not he also plans on restricting it to \nrelevant amendments. What I am asking is, when will I have an \nopportunity as a Senator from Minnesota to bring legislation to the \nfloor of the Senate which will alleviate the economic pain and \nsuffering of family farmers? That is what I want to know. Are we going \nto have an opportunity for debate on agriculture policy?\n  Mr. LOTT. We certainly know the Senator from Minnesota has views on \nthat or amendments he wants to offer. One of the things we are planning \non doing, I say to the Senator--and Senator Daschle may want to talk \nabout it--is to bring up the sanctions bill. I do not know whether or \nnot the Senator's amendments will be in order to that. It does relate \nto food and agriculture. He may have something to say or some amendment \nhe wants to offer on that.\n  We have not agreed on a time. You may wind up objecting to it, but I \nthink it is high time we have some debate around here and some thought \nabout how we deal with these unilateral sanctions of countries, how we \nuse food and medicine in that area. We had a vote on it in Agriculture. \nIt is still very controversial. I have indicated it is my intent and it \nis my hope, if we can find a way, to bring that bill to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. With an opportunity for other amendments dealing with \nagriculture.\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe they probably could be offered to that bill. I do \nnot particularly relish the idea, but I think they probably could be.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield? He made \nreference to a couple of matters which ought to be addressed briefly.\n  First, with regard to nuclear waste, I know of nobody on this side of \nthe aisle who wishes to filibuster the bill, and I will be happy to \nclarify that with the majority leader. I think there is an interest, \nhowever, in amending the bill. We would love to have the bill come to \nthe Senate floor under normal Senate order, regular order, and if the \nbill were brought up under regular order, we would be in support of \nmoving the bill and voting in favor of the motion to proceed. I will be \nhappy to work with the majority leader to schedule that, if we could \naccommodate Senators who wish to offer amendments.\n  With regard to the FAA debate, this was one of the more difficult \nagreements. I appreciate the ability of many of our colleagues to allow \nus the opportunity to have this debate on Monday. But I must say that, \nonce again, this is a unanimous consent request to limit debate and \nlimit amendments. We are agreeing to this only because we believe the \nFAA bill is a matter of great national security and of import not only \nfor safety and health of aviation but because we believe we have \nalready taken too long to reauthorize this legislation.\n  So because of the expiration of the authorizing legislation, because \nof the safety and health matters, we share the view that this \nlegislation ought to come up and be debated and that we ought to limit \nourselves to relevant amendments.\n  But again I say that we have not had a bill before the Senate under \nregular Senate order since last May. We have gone through June, July, \nAugust, and now September--4 months--and we are simply saying: Let's \nbring bills to the floor under regular order. Let's have a good debate, \nand let's have amendments offered. I am hopeful that we can work \nthrough the rest of the agenda with that in mind.\n  So we are not going to object to this bill being brought up, again, \nunder abnormal Senate order and rule. But I think there is a growing \nconcern that too many bills are coming to the floor without the \nopportunity for a full debate.\n  So whether it is nuclear waste or whether it is an array of other \nbills that could come to the floor, we are ready to debate them. We are \nready to have a good amount of time dedicated to whatever piece of \nlegislation ought to be considered. But we want the right to offer \namendments. We will forego that right under FAA, but there are not many \nbills that fit into that category, if any, for the rest of the year.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwant to take this moment to thank both the majority leader and the \nminority leader, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from South \nCarolina, for their patience because we did have a problem that \naffected my area that has been worked out.\n  I ask the majority leader one little question. I want to confirm that \nthe language we have talked about seems to meet the agreement of all \nsides. I want to get the attention of the majority leader. I was \nthanking him and the minority leader and others, and I just want to \nclarify the language we have talked about seems to meet the agreement \nof all the major players in solving that problem.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have not had an opportunity to talk personally, directly, \nto the Senator from Arizona, but I am informed by his senior aide that \nhe is committed to living with the language that the Senator from New \nYork is familiar with, and that also the Senator from South Carolina, \nthe ranking Democrat, has indicated he will comply with that. And based \non the assurance I received, then I would work to make sure that \nunderstanding was lived up to. Whether you agree with the final result \nor not, I will make sure that what your understanding is on the part I \nhave been involved in would be honored.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator and thank again the Members of the \nbody for their indulgence on this issue.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Earlier, the majority leader made inquiry about the \nposition on the nuclear waste bill. I want to put the majority leader \non notice the Senators from Nevada are not prepared to surrender any of \nthe procedural rights on this issue. This, as you know, is an issue----\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LOTT. You mean you are not ready to go to final passage on this \nbill at this point?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Mississippi, with his characteristic \ninsight, has hit the nail right on the head.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me assure the Chair and my colleagues that we know the \nvery passionate feelings of the Senator from Nevada. We know he is \ngoing to make them heard, and in every way he can. And he will be \nentitled to all the rules of the Senate in that effort. We understand \nthat and appreciate it.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was \npassed, there was a misinterpretation by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration of this bill--while it should have been revenue \nneutral--to have regular reductions in the amount of reimbursement that \ngoes to hospitals, specifically a 5.7-percent reduction to \nreimbursement that would take place in July of the year 2000. This was \nnot the intent of the Members of the Senate.\n  I have a letter that has 77 signatures on it, including those of each \nSenator who is in the Chamber right now, stating that was not the \nintent. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying that was not \nthe intent so we would not be having that 5.7-percent reduction in July \nof the year 2000.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oklahoma for \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I think it is meritorious. It has \nbeen cleared by the ranking member on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. REID. We have not had a chance to clear this with our leader. I \napologize to the manager of the bill. We have not cleared this with the \nleader, so I can't agree to it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania would \nyield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest to the Senator from Pennsylvania, both Senator \nDaschle and Senator Reid have signed the letter asking for this same \nthing we have in the sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. It is pretty persuasive.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Do you want to check?\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw our objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1816), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. If I could have the floor for a second.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, that was one of the most persuasive \narguments I have heard on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the final order of business this evening \non the pending bill is an amendment to be offered by the Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Brownback, for purposes of 10 minutes of discussion, and \nthen it will be withdrawn. So I leave the floor in the hands of Senator \nBrownback for that 10-minute presentation and withdrawal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nPennsylvania accommodating our desires tonight. The reason we offer \nthis amendment is to discuss it briefly and then withdraw it as being \nsubject to a point of order on this particular bill.\n  I rise to explain the amendment.\n  What this amendment regards is the establishment of a 1-year, \nactually less than 1-year, Senate task force to study the state of \nAmerican society. There has been a lot of discussion going on about \nthis. I want to spend a little bit of time discussing what this is and \nwhat it isn't because I think both are important.\n  We are proposing this task force, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nMoynihan, and myself, the Presiding Officer, a number of others, \nbecause we believe there is a deep and pressing need to examine in a \nmanner that is bipartisan, intellectual, rigorous, dispassionate, and \npublicly accessible, the cultural and social health of our society.\n  It is a simple and undeniable fact that our families and children, \nschools, and communities have been subjected to seismic shifts over the \nlast 30 years. These changes have had consequences--consequences which \ndeeply impact the public, including the formation of public policy, \nwhich deserve a public forum in which to study and address them.\n  First, if we take a quick look at what is happening across America, \nin the last 2 years, we have seen one school shooting after another: \nConyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Richmond, VA; Paducah, KY; Springfield, OR; \nEdinboro, PA; Pearl, MS; and Jonesboro, AR. Unfortunately, the list \ngoes tragically on. We just wonder where next.\n  There are other warning signs. The number and percentages of the \nchildren who live in broken homes continues to increase, regrettably. \nReports of domestic abuse and child abuse are at shocking levels.\n  One of our colleagues and cosponsors of this bill, Senator Moynihan, \nonce coined a memorable phrase. He talked about our society in terms of \n``defining deviancy down.'' What he meant--and, Senator Moynihan, \ncorrect me, if I am incorrect--is that when behavior that was once \nconsidered deviant or outrageous becomes more ordinary and commonplace, \nsocieties tend to redefine deviancy.\n\n  This is such a classic and clear example. For example, in 1929, four \ngangsters killed seven unarmed bootleggers. The slaughter was \nconsidered so horrific that the event was dubbed the ``St. Valentine's \nDay Massacre.'' Remember that one? It was 1929; seven unarmed \nbootleggers were slaughtered. It was so horrifying it got its own name, \nshows, everything, and made news around the world. It so shocked and \nhorrified the Nation that it has become a well-known historical event. \nIt is even in most encyclopedias--seven people, 1929.\n  In sharp contrast, let's look to just 2 weeks ago, when a gunman \nstrode into a church in Fort Worth, TX, puffing a cigarette, and \nslaughtered six defenseless people, including several children, before \nturning the gun on himself--just as many people, one less, killed in \nthat Fort Worth church as in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Yet that \nstory, so far from making it into an encyclopedia, didn't even get a \nheadline in the Washington Post. Why? Why is it that we no longer \nconsider outrageous what is truly outrageous? Perhaps it has become too \ncommonplace. It has become common on our streets and airwaves. It is \nboth the reality in which many live, and it makes up the entertainment \ninto which many escape.\n  Over the past 30 years, there are many ways we have made progress as \na country and as a people. Our economy has grown tremendously. \nTechnological advances have been unprecedented. New doors of \nopportunity have been opened to people previously denied access. The \nopportunities available to women and minorities have increased, and \nthey need to increase even further. But in the midst of unprecedented \nprosperity, there is a widespread belief that we live in a mean society \nwhere families are breaking down, children are more prone to crime, \nviolence, alienation, drug use and suicide, and our civic fabric is \nfraying. In fact, not only does the United States lead the world in \nmaterial wealth, it also leads the industrialized world in rates of \nmurder, violent juvenile crime, abortion, divorce, cocaine consumption, \npornography production, and consumption of pornography. These facts \nhave not been lost on the American people--far from it. Poll after poll \nshows they recognize it.\n  I draw the attention of the body to some of the polls that have \nrecently come out. Here is one: What poses the greatest threat to the \nUnited States? You can look through here: recession at 30-plus percent; \ndecline of moral values, much higher; military, don't know. That was \nOctober 30 of last year.\n  Here is one from May 3 of this year: Where does the country face the \nmost serious problems today? Moral values area, 56 percent; next \nclosest, environment at 12 percent. Fifty-six percent of the public \nconsidering that. That was by a different research group than did the \nlast one.\n  Here is one done by the Princeton Survey Research Group, July 22 of \nthis year: What priority should be given to dealing with the moral \nbreakdown of the United States? Fifty-five percent say top priority \nshould be given.\n  My only point in showing these polls is that this is something the \nAmerican public considers important, indeed, vital for us to be \nconsidering. We need to address it in this body. This is not to say \nthat all societal changes have been negative. Far from it.\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\n  As I noted earlier, there are many causes for hope, even celebration. \nBut there are causes for concern taking place as well. Even where our \nchallenges remain stark, I am personally optimistic. I believe for \nevery problem in America, there is a solution already in place, usually \nby an individual or family or community with the heart to make it \nhappen.\n  I hope this task force will encourage the replication of those \nsolutions, but first and foremost, my hope is that by working together \nwe can begin to better understand where we are as a society and where \nwe are headed.\n  Senator Moynihan, again, made a point that I think is true: You can't \nchange a problem until you can figure out how to measure it. You need \nto be able to measure to know when you are making progress on what is \nhappening. That is the stage at which we find ourselves. We know \nsomething is happening in our society, but we don't know yet how to \naccurately measure it. We are still struggling with asking the right \nquestions.\n  My hope and intention is that this task force would begin the \nimportant and necessary work of measuring these issues and asking the \nright questions.\n  I want to talk about some of the specifics of the task force, what it \nis and what it isn't.\n  There have been a lot of rumors spreading around about this. First, \nthis task force will conduct the important business of investigating \nand analyzing and examining the state of our culture the causes and \nconsequences of our societal difficulties, and possible solutions. It \nwill hold hearings on such topics as civic participation, the state of \nthe family structure, the impact of popular culture on young people, \nthe causes of youth violence, and innovative and effective initiatives \nthat have reduced various social problems that we have.\n  It will look at these issues in a holistic and a broad manner and--\nlet me emphasize this--a bipartisan manner. It will not hold \nlegislative jurisdiction. It will not report out or mark up \nlegislation. It will not intrude on people's personal lives or seek to \nimpose a set of values on anyone. It aims to achieve a better \ndescription of what is going on in our society, not a prescription of \nmorals. It seeks to inform and investigate, rather than to legislate.\n  I know there were concerns among some of my colleagues about \nprovisions regarding subpoena power. Let me assure all of them, those \nhave been taken out. This endeavor will be a task force of concerned \nMembers working together to get a better sense of the condition of our \nsociety. The task force is bipartisan in purpose, process, and \nstructure, as bipartisan as possible. It is composed of eight members: \nfour Republicans, four Democrats. You can't get much more bipartisan \nthan that.\n  Together, I hope we can take a good look at what is going on in our \nsociety, at the state of the cultural environment in which we currently \nreside. While these are not legislative issues, they are important \npublic issues with profound consequences, both in terms of public \npolicy and in our daily lives.\n  This is an important task. I look forward to the counsel and support \nof my colleagues in getting to this important work. We have tried to \nbend over backwards to work in a bipartisan way to get this moving \nforward. We are still working to get this pulled together. I hope my \ncolleagues will continue to talk with us about this, about how we can \ndo this and how we can work together to address this very important \nproblem.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1833, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, as I stated at the outset, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania noted, I realize this will be subjected to a point of \norder. I wanted to bring it up and discuss it.\n  With this discussion, I withdraw my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 1833) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Maj. Gen. \nBruce Scott, who will soon depart his position as Chief of Army \nLegislative Liaison to assume command of the United States Army \nSecurity Assistance Command in Alexandria, VA.\n  I imagine that the impression most people have of someone who is a \ngeneral is that of an officer who is in charge of troops, such as a \nperson leading an Infantry division. Few realize that there are more \ngenerals who are administrators than troop leaders, and probably even \nfewer realize one of the most critical jobs any general in the United \nStates Army could hold as far as preparing that service to protect the \npeople, borders, and interests of the nation is the position which \nGeneral Scott has held for the past two years. Though he might not have \nbeen wearing BDU's or eating MRE's for the past twenty-four months, \nGeneral Scott has had the extremely important responsibility of serving \nas the head of liaison efforts between the Congress and the Army. In \nthat role, he has led the efforts to make sure that our soldiers have \nthe resources they require to accomplish their mission and dominate any \nbattlefield, anytime, anywhere.\n  General Scott is well qualified to represent the Army to the \nLegislative Branch. Every position he has held since beginning his Army \ncareer in 1968 as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy at West \nPoint has given him a unique insight into what it is like to be a \nsoldier at every level of the service. Thanks to his assignments to \nInfantry and Armored divisions, he understands what is involved in \nserving in a combat arms unit; as a result of his service as a \nCommanding General and Division Engineer, he understands what general \nofficers require to do their jobs; a veteran of the White House Fellows \nprogram, he was exposed at an early stage to the relationship between \nthe legislative and executive branches of government, as well as to the \nnotion of civilian control of the military; and as a former Deputy \nDirector of Strategy, Plans and Policy, Office of the Deputy Chief of \nStaff for Operations and plans, he has an appreciation of the \nstrategic, or ``bigger'', picture. All in all, General Scott came to \nthis job with the credentials and experience that was required of him\n  During his command as the Chief of Army Legislative Liaison, General \nScott put his rich background to work for him and the Army, working \nhard to represent the interests of the service to the Senate and House \nof Representatives, as well as working to make sure that the Army was \nresponsive to our requests and interests. Over the past two-years, \nGeneral Scott helped to shepherd through the Congress major initiatives \non Army modernization and digitization. He has been a forceful and \neffective advocate for the Army's ``Force XXI'' and its ``Force After \nNext''; and, during my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, we worked together to build even stronger ties between the \nArmy and the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I have always believed that hard work will be rewarded, and after \nwhat I am certain at times was an agonizing, if not occasionally \nexasperating, experience of working with Congress, General Scott will \nsoon take the reins of the United States Army Security Assistance \nCommand. This is an important assignment, especially in this day and \nage when building or re-reinforcing coalitions and friendships with \nother nations is as important to the security of the United States as \nmaintaining a well equipped, well trained fighting force. In his new \njob, General Scott will in many ways be carrying out the duties of an \nambassador, he will certainly be making an important contribution to \nthe diplomatic efforts of\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nthe United States as he will be required to work with approximately 120 \ndifferent nations and multinational organizations in promoting \ninternational security by assuring our allies have access to modern and \neffective equipment and systems. I have every confidence that he will \ndischarge the duties of his new job with the same ability, dedication, \nand professionalism as he has done throughout his career, and \nespecially as he did as Chief of Army Legislative Liaison.\n  I am certain that my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and throughout the Senate join me in applauding the work of \nGeneral Scott and in thanking him for his tireless efforts in working \nwith us for the benefit of our Army and soldiers. I look forward to \ncontinuing to monitor the career of General Scott, and I predict that \nhe will continue to achieve great things for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11725-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to require country of origin labeling of peanuts and \npeanut products and to establish penalties for violations of the \nlabeling requirements; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                    the Peanut Labeling Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am coming to the floor today to \nintroduce the Peanut Labeling Act of 1999. This bill will require \ncountry of origin labeling for all peanut and peanut products sold in \nthe United States; specifically\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nit will require that consumers be notified whether the peanuts are \ngrown in the United States or in another country. The main purpose of \nthis bill is to provide American consumers with information about where \nthe peanuts they purchase are grown. This bill will allow consumers to \nmake informed food choices and support American farmers. And, with the \nlabeling requirement, should a health concern be raised about a \nspecific country's products, such as the Mexican strawberry scare we \nwitnessed a few year's back, consumers would have the information they \nneed to make their own choices about the products they buy at the \nmarket.\n  Family farmers in America are facing dire circumstances. Farmers' \nability to grow and sell their products have been severely affected by \nbad weather conditions, poor market prices, and trade restrictions. \nThis bill allows consumers to help American farmers in the best way \nthat they can--with their food dollar. Consumers are provided with \ninformation about the country of origin of a wide range of products, \nincluding clothes, appliances and automobiles. It only seems \nappropriate and fair that consumers should receive the same information \nabout agricultural products, specifically peanuts. In fact, because \nconsumers purchase agricultural products, including peanuts, based on \nthe quality and safety of these items for their families, it seems even \nmore important to provide them with this basic information.\n  By providing country of origin labels, consumers can determine if \npeanuts are from a country that has had pesticide or other problems \nwhich may be harmful to their health. This is true particularly during \na period when food imports are increasing, and will continue to \nincrease in the wake of new trade agreements such as the WTO and GATT. \nAs I previously mentioned, recent outbreaks linked to strawberries in \nMexico, and European beef related to ``mad cow disease'' have raised \nthe public's awareness of imported foods and their potential health \nimpacts. Consumers should not have to wait for the same thing to happen \nwith peanuts before they have the information they need to make wise \nfood choices. With the labeling requirement, should such an outbreak \noccur, consumers would have the information to not only avoid harmful \nproducts, but to continue to purchase unaffected ones.\n  The growth of biotechnology in the food arena necessitates more \ninformation in the marketplace. Research is being conducted today on \nnew peanut varieties. These research efforts include seeds that might \ndeter peanut allergies, tolerate more drought, and be more resistant to \ndisease. As various countries use differing technologies, consumers \nneed to be made aware of the source of the product they are purchasing. \nGAO recently pointed out that FDA only inspected 1.7 percent of 2.7 \nmillion shipments of fruit, vegetables, seafood and processed foods \nunder its jurisdiction. Inspections for peanuts can be assumed to be in \nthis range or less. This lack of inspection does not provide consumers \nof these products with a great deal of assurance.\n  Another purpose of this bill is to provide consumers with the ability \nto gain benefit from the investments of their hard earned taxes paid to \nthe U.S. government. The federal government spends a large sum of money \non peanut research infrastructure that is by far the most advanced in \nthe world. This research not only increases the productivity of peanut \ngrowers, but provides growers with vital information about best \nmanagement practices, including pesticide and water usage. It assists \ngrowers in their efforts to more effectively and efficiently grow a \nmore superior and safer product for American consumers. Consumers \nshould be able to receive a return on this investment by being able to \npurchase U.S. peanuts.\n  Polls have shown that consumers in America want to know the origin of \nthe products they buy. And, contrary to the arguments given by \nopponents of labeling measures that such requirements would drive \nprices up, consumers have indicated that they would be willing to pay \nextra for easy access to such information. I believe that this is a \npro-consumer bill that will have wide support.\n  I am also very pleased that peanut growers in America strongly \nsupport my proposal. I have endorsement letters for my bill from the \nGeorgia Peanut Commission, the National Peanut Growers Group, the \nSouthern Peanut Farmers Federation, the Alabama Peanut Producers \nAssociation, and the Florida Peanut Producers Association.\n  In conclusion, as my colleagues know, we live in a global economy \nwhich creates an international marketplace for our food products. I \nstrongly believe that by providing country of origin labeling for \nagricultural products, such as peanuts, we not only provide consumers \nwith information they need to make informed choices about the quality \nof food being served to their family but we also allow American farmers \nto showcase the time and effort they put into producing the safest and \nfinest food products in the world. I believe this bill represents these \nprinciples and I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Origin labeling of peanuts \n     and peanut products is extremely important to our peanut \n     industry in Georgia. It will not only benefit our Georgia \n     growers, but it will be an asset for growers across our \n     nation.\n       Requiring an origin of label allows our consumers the \n     choice to buy American products. Because our quality and \n     safety standards are among the best, our peanuts and peanut \n     products should be labeled in order to differentiate from \n     other foreign products. The consumer should have information \n     that allows them to discern which peanut and peanut product \n     is best for them.\n       We support and appreciate your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Billy Griggs,\n                              Chairman, Georgia Peanut Commission.\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                National Peanut Growers Group,\n\n                                   Gorman, TX, September 22, 1999.\n     Hon.

We believe origin \n     labeling of peanuts and peanut products is vital to our \n     industry's survival. Because our quality and safety standards \n     are the best in the world, our peanuts and peanut products \n     should be labeled in order to differentiate from other \n     foreign products. The consumer should have information that \n     allows them to discern which peanut and peanut product is \n     best for them.\n       Thank you for your support. We appreciate your efforts to \n     strengthen our peanut industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Wilbur Gamble,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Southern Peanut\n\n\n                                           Farmers Federation,\n\n                                               September 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: The Southern Peanut Farmers \n     Federation, an alliance of Alabama Peanut Producers \n     Association, Georgia Peanut Commission, and Florida Peanut \n     Producers Association, strongly supports the ``Peanut \n     Labeling Act of 1999.'' We appreciate the opportunity to \n     review the bill, and we believe its enactment will strengthen \n     our peanut industry.\n       This bill is very important to us for several reasons. \n     First, we believe that like most products made in America, \n     peanuts and peanut products should have a label of origin. \n     Secondly, we believe that by giving American consumers this \n     information, it allows them to buy American products. The \n     numbers of imported peanuts and peanut products continue to \n     rise each year. We believe that by labeling our products, our \n     growers will have a tool that keeps them at a level playing \n     field with the competition. The American consumer will want \n     to purchase products of high quality and that meets stringent \n     safety standards.\n       The labeling of peanuts and peanut products would alleviate \n     the numbers of peanuts and peanut products coming into the \n     country illegally. Many products are imported into our \n     country without trade restrictions, due to NAFTA, and sold to \n     our American consumer. Yet, some of those peanut products \n     originated from our domestic growers. With a labeling \n     requirement, we would be able to identify whether our \n     exported products are returned to our domestic market. \n     Alleviating this problem would keep our peanut market from \n     being saturated.\n       The ``Peanut Labeling Act'' is a tremendous step in the \n     right direction for our industry. It is a vital tool that \n     will allow our industry to compete in the future as our \n     country's trade policy is expanded.\n           Sincerely,\n     Billy Griggs,\n       Georgia Peanut Commission.\n     Carl Sanders,\n       Florida Peanut Producers Association.\n     Gregg Hall,\n       Alabama Peanut Producers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Florida Peanut\n\n\n                                        Producers Association,\n\n                                 Marianna, FL, September 21, 1999.\n     Hon.

Mr. Bob Redding of the \n     Redding Firm in Washington has kept our board informed on the \n     language and movement of this bill. We feel strongly that a \n     Peanut Labeling Bill will once again give the American peanut \n     farmer the edge to compete with imported competition. We are \n     convinced the safety and quality of American grown will \n     always be the choice of our consumers, if given a choice by \n     origin labeling.\n       We appreciate your efforts concerning this issue, as well \n     as your over-all interest in Southern agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n     Greg Hall,\n       President.\n     Jeff Crawford, Jr.,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Alabama Peanut\n\n\n                                        Producers Association,\n\n                                   Dothan, AL, September 22, 1999.\n     To: Senator Max Cleland.\n     From: H. Randall Griggs.\n       On behalf of the peanut producers in Alabama, we appreciate \n     your efforts to introduce labeling legislation pertaining to \n     peanuts and peanut products. As the marketplace becomes more \n     globalized, the U.S. industry should be allowed to \n     differentiate itself from other origins. Also, consumers \n     should have the information necessary to choose and know \n     where their food products originate.\n       Again, we support and appreciate your efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1671. A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                 Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 1999\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senate is again considering \ncampaign finance reform. The problem is that almost every Senator has a \ndifferent definition of--and goal for--reform. Today I am introducing \nthe ``Campaign Finance Integrity Act.'' I believe this bill can \nactually be agreed upon by a majority of this body that would want to \nensure that we improve the campaign finance system (a nearly \nuniversally acknowledged goal) without being unconstitutional and \nattempting measures that fly in the face of the First Amendment.\n  Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire \nfor healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict, \nand that you can't have both. But fortunately for those of us who \nbelieve in the First Amendment rights of all American citizens, the \nfounding fathers and the Supreme Court are on our side. They believe, \nand I believe, that we can have both.\n  I would hope that celebrating the value of the First Amendment on the \nfloor of the United States Senate is preaching to the choir, as the \nexpression goes, but let me go ahead and do it anyway. Thomas Jefferson \nrepeatedly stated the importance of the First Amendment and how it \nallows the people and the press the right to speak their minds freely. \nJefferson clearly described its significance back in 1798 with, ``One \nof the amendments to the Constitution * * * expressly declares that \n`Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of \nspeech or of the press,' thereby guarding in the same sentence and \nunder the same words, the freedom of religion, speech, and of the \npress; insomuch that whatever violates either throws down the sanctuary \nwhich covers the others.'' Again in 1808, he stated that ``The liberty \nof speaking and writing guards our other liberties.'' And in 1823, \nJefferson stated, ``The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when \npermitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be \nsubmitted to.'' Jefferson knew and believed that if we begin \nrestricting what people say, how they say it, and how much they can \nsay, then we deny the first and fundamental freedom given to all \nCitizens.\n  The Supreme Court has also been very clear in its rulings concerning \ncampaign finance and the First Amendment. Since the post-Watergate \nchanges to the campaign finance system began, 24 Congressional actions \nhave been declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the \nFirst Amendment. Out of those nine, 4 dealt directly with campaign \nfinance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that \npolitical spending is equal to political speech.\n  In the now famous decision, or infamous to some, Buckley vs. Valeo, \nthe Court states that, ``The First Amendment denies government the \npower to determine that spending to promote one's political views is \nwasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our \nConstitution it is not the government but the people--individually as \ncitizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political \ncommittees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of \ndebate on public issues in a political campaign.''\n\n  Simply stated, the government cannot ration or regulate political \nspeech of an American through campaign spending limits any more than it \ncan tell the local newspaper how many papers it can print or what it \ncan print. This reinforces Jefferson's statement that to impede one of \nthese rights is to impede all First Amendment rights.\n  Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills believe \nthat if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force giveaways of \npublic and private resources then all will be fine with the campaign \nfinance system. The Supreme Court agrees and is again very clear in its \nintent on campaign spending. The Buckley decision says, ``. . . the \nmere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nitself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity \nof campaign spending. . . .''\n  Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how \ngreat or small the means. The ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' \nto the ``expensive modes of communication'' are both indispensable \ninstruments of effective political speech. We should not force one \nsector to freely distribute our political ideas just because it is more \nexpensive than all the other sectors. So no matter how objectionable \nthe cost of campaigns are, the Supreme Court has stated that this is \nnot reason enough to restrict the speech of candidates or any other \ngroups involved in political speech.\n  We need a campaign finance bill that does not violate the First \nAmendment, while providing important provisions to open the campaign \nfinances of candidates up to the scrutiny of the American people. I \nbelieve the Campaign Finance Integrity Act does that.\n  My bill would:\n  Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their \ncontributions from individuals in the state or district in which they \nare running.\n  Equalize contributions from individuals and political action \ncommittees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1000 to $2500 \nand reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to $2500.\n  Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation.\n  Reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing \npolitical party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal \ncontribution of a candidate above $5000.\n  Require corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, \nvoluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiative fees or \npayment as a condition of employment for political activity, and \nrequires annual full disclosure of those activities to members and \nshareholders.\n  Prohibit depositing an individual contribution by a campaign unless \nthe individual's profession and employer are reported.\n  Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports \nby computers and other emerging technologies and to make that \ninformation accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours \nof receipt.\n  Ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings.\n  This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate \nback into his district or state to raise money from individual \ncontributions. It has some of the most open, full and timely disclosure \nrequirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the \nbest disinfectant.\n  The right of political parties, groups and individuals to say what \nthey want in a political campaign is preserved by the right of the \npublic to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is \nalso recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own \ndecisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely \ninformation.\n  Many of the proponents of other campaign finance bills try to reduce \nthe influence of interests by suppressing their speech. I believe the \nbest ways to reduce the special interests influence is to suppress and \nreduce the size of government. If the government rids itself of special \ninterest funding and corporate subsidies, then there would be less \nreason for influence-buying donations.\n  Objecting to the popular quest of the moment is very difficult for \nany politician, but turning your back on the First Amendment is more \ndifficult for me. I want campaign finance reform but not at the expense \nof the First Amendment. My legislation does this. Not everyone will \nagree with the Campaign Finance Integrity Act, and many of us still \ndisagree on this issue, but the First Amendment is the reason we can \ndisagree and it must be honored here rather than just the \nCourts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1673. A bill to amend titles 10 and 18, United States Code, to \nprotect unborn victims of violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 unborn victims of violence act of 1999\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on behalf of \nunborn children who are the victims of violence. I am here to be their \nvoice; I am here to fight for their rights.\n  We live in a violent world, Mr. President. Sadly, sometimes--perhaps \nmore often than we realize--even unborn babies are the targets, \nintended or otherwise, of violent acts. I'll give you some disturbing \nexamples.\n  In 1996, Airman, Gregory Robbins, and his family were stationed in my \nhome state of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. At \nthat time, Mrs. Robbins was more than eight months pregnant with a \ndaughter they named Jasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, \nAirman Robbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt (to reduce the chance that \nhe would inflict visible injuries) and savagely beat his wife by \nstriking her repeatedly about the head and abdomen. Fortunately, Mrs. \nRobbins survived the violent assault. Tragically, however, her uterus \nruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal \ncavity, causing Jasmine's death.\n  Air Force prosecutors sought to prosecute the Airman for Jasmine's \ndeath, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor the Federal \ncode makes criminal such an act which results in the death or injury of \nan unborn child. The only available federal offense was for the assault \non the mother. This was a case in which the only available federal \npenalty did not fit the crime. So prosecutors bootstrapped the Ohio \nfetal homicide law to convict Mr. Robbins of Jasmine's death. This case \ncurrently is pending appeal, and we do hope that justice will prevail.\n  Mr. President, if it weren't for the Ohio law that is already in \nplace, there would have been no opportunity to prosecute and punish \nAirman Robbins for the assault against Baby Jasmine. We need a federal \nremedy to avoid having to bootstrap state laws and to provide recourse \nwhen a violent act occurs during the commission of a federal crime--\nespecially in cases when the state in which the crime occurs does not \nhave a fetal protection law in place. A federal remedy will ensure that \ncrimes against unborn victims are punished.\n  There are other sickening examples of violence against innocent \nunborn children, Mr. President. An incident occurred in Arkansas just a \nfew short weeks ago. Nearly nine months pregnant, Shawana Pace of \nLittle Rock was days away from giving birth. She was thrilled about her \npregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, however, did not share her joy \nand enthusiasm. In fact, Eric Bullock wanted the baby to die. So, he \nhired three thugs to beat Shawana so badly that she would lose the \nunborn baby.\n  During the vicious assault against mother and child, one of the hired \nhitmen allegedly said: ``Your baby is going to die tonight.'' Shawana's \nbaby did die that night. She named the baby Heaven. Mr. President, I am \nsaddened and sickened by the sheer inhumanity and brutality of this act \nof violence.\n\n  Fortunately, the State of Arkansas, like Ohio, passed a fetal \nprotection law, which allows Arkansas prosecutors to charge defendants \nwith murder for the death of a fetus. Under previous law, such \nattackers could be charged only with crimes against the pregnant woman. \nAs in the case of Baby Jasmine's death in Ohio, but for the Arkansas \nstate law, there would be no remedy--no punishment--for Baby Heaven's \nbrutal murder. The only charge would be assault against the mother.\n  In the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings--here too--\nfederal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with the murders \nof or injuries to the mothers--but not to their unborn babies. Again, \nfederal law currently only criminalizes crimes against born humans. \nThere are no federal provisions for the unborn.\n  This is wrong.\n  It is wrong that our federal government does absolutely nothing to \ncriminalize violent acts against unborn children. We must correct this \nloophole in our law, for it allows criminals to get away with violent \nacts--and sometimes even murder.\n  We, as a civilized society, should not--with good conscience--stand \nfor that.\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\n  So, today, I am introducing legislation, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Tim Hutchinson and Senator Abraham, to provide \njustice for America's unborn victims of violence. Our bill, the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act, would hold criminals liable for conduct that \nharms or kills an unborn child. It would make it a separate crime under \nthe Federal code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to kill or \ninjure an unborn child during the commission of certain existing \nfederal crimes.\n  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act would create a separate offense \nfor unborn children--it would acknowledge them as individual victims. \nOur bill would no longer allow violent acts against unborn babies to be \nconsidered victimless crimes. At least twenty-four (24) states already \nhave criminalized harm to unborn victims, and another seven (7) states \ncriminalize the termination of pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, in November of 1996, a baby, just three months from \nfull-term, was killed in Ohio as a result of road rage. An angry driver \nforced a pregnant mother's car to crash into a flatbed truck. Because \nthe Ohio Revised Code imposes criminal liability for any violent \nconduct which terminates a pregnancy of a child in utero, prosecutors \nsuccessfully tried and convicted the driver for recklessly causing the \nbaby's death. Our bill would make an act of violence like this a \nfederal crime. It would be a simple step, but one with a dramatic \neffect.\n  Mr. President, we purposely have drafted this legislation very \nnarrowly. For example, it would not permit the prosecution for any \nabortion to which a woman consented. It would not permit the \nprosecution of a woman for any action (legal or illegal) in regard to \nher unborn child. This legislation would not permit the prosecution for \nharm caused to the mother or unborn child in the course of medical \ntreatment. And, the bill would not allow for the imposition of the \ndeath penalty under this Act.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we wrap the arms of justice around \nunborn children and protect them against criminal assailants. Those who \nviolently attack unborn babies are criminals. The federal penalty \nshould fit the crime. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this legislation. We have an obligation to our unborn \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S 1674.

A bill to improve accountability for schools and local \neducational agencies under part A of title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 school improvement accountability act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last week I introduced two \neducation bills related to raising standards and ensuring \naccountability for the teachers in our schools. Today, I am pleased to \nintroduce three bills that relate to raising standards and ensuring \naccountability for the performance of our schools--the Small, Safe \nSchools Act, the National Dropout Prevention Act and the School \nImprovement Accountability Act. Next week, I will introduce two bills \nwhich relate to raising standards and ensuring accountability for \nstudent achievement. All of these bills, which I hope to incorporate \ninto the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nform the foundation for a comprehensive plan to improve the quality of \nour public education system. The three bills that I am introducing \ntoday focus on improving school performance.\n  The Small, Safe Schools Act would help to ensure that children have a \nsense of belonging in their school by providing incentives for the \nconstruction of smaller schools and providing resources to create \nsmaller learning communities in existing larger schools. In this way, \nwe can create school environments that keep our children safe and make \nit easier for them to meet high standards for achievement. Research \ndemonstrates that small schools outperform large schools on every \nmeasure of school success.\n  In the wake of the tragedy at Columbine High School, one of the most \nimportant concerns regarding school quality is school safety. Issues of \nschool safety can be effectively addressed by creating smaller schools \nor smaller learning communities within larger schools. Behavorial \nproblems, including truancy, classroom disruption, vandalism, \naggressive behavior, theft, substance abuse and gang participation are \nall more common in larger schools. Teachers in small schools learn of \ndisagreements between students and can resolve problems before problems \nbecome severe. Based on studies of high school violence, researchers \nhave concluded that the first step in ending school violence must be to \nbreak through the impersonal atmosphere of large high schools by \ncreating smaller communities of learning within larger structures, \nwhere teachers and students can come to know each other well.\n  School size also can have a critical impact on learning. Small school \nsize improves students grades and test scores. This impact is even \ngreater for ethnic minority and low income students. Small \ninstitutional size has been found to be one of the most important \nfactors in creating positive educational outcomes. Studies on school \ndropout rates show a decrease in the rates as schools get smaller. \nStudents and staff at smaller schools have a stronger sense of personal \nefficacy, and students take more of the responsibility for their own \nlearning, which includes more individualized and experimental learning \nrelevant to the world outside of school.\n  Small schools can be created cost effectively. Larger schools can be \nmore expensive because their sheer size requires more administrative \nsupport. More importantly, additional bureaucracy translates into less \nflexibility and innovation. In addition, because small schools have \nhigher graduation rates, costs per graduate are lower than costs per \ngraduate in large schools.\n  The Small, Safe Schools Act would establish three programs designed \nto promote and support smaller schools and smaller learning communities \nwithin large schools. Schools or LEAs could apply for funds to help \ndevelop smaller learning communities within larger schools. The bill \nalso authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to LEAs \nand schools seeking to create smaller learning communities. In \naddition, the bill would provide funding for construction and \nrenovation of schools designed to accommodate no more than 350 students \nin an elementary school, 400 students in a middle school, and 800 \nstudents in a high school.\n  On behalf of myself and Senator Reid, I also offer the National \nDropout Prevention Act, which is a bill designed to reduce the dropout \nrate in our nation's schools. While much progress has been made in \nencouraging more students to complete high school, the nation remains \nfar from its goal of a 90 percent graduation rate for students by 2000. \nIn fact, none of the states with large and diverse student populations \nhave yet come close to this goal, and dropout rates approaching 50 \npercent are commonplace in some of the most disadvantaged communities \nduring the period from ninth grade to senior year. The bill is based on \nmany of the findings of the National Hispanic Dropout Project, a group \nof nationally recognized experts assembled during 1996-97 to help find \nsolutions to the high dropout rate among Hispanic and other at-risk \nstudents. In addition to widespread misconceptions about why so many \nstudents drop out of school and lack of familiarity with proven dropout \nprevention programs, one of the main factors contributing to the lack \nof progress in this area is that there is currently no concerted \nfederal effort to provide or coordinate effective and proven dropout \nprevention programs for at-risk children. In fact, there is currently \nno federal agency or office that is responsible for the multitude of \nprograms that include dropout prevention as a component.\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\n  The Act makes lowering the dropout rate a national priority. Efforts \nto prevent students from dropping out would be coordinated on the \nnation level by an Office of Dropout Prevention and Program Completion \nin the Department of Education. The Office would disseminate best \npractices and models for effective dropout programs through a national \nclearinghouse and provide support and recognition to schools engaged in \ndropout prevention efforts. In addition, this bill provides funds to \npay the startup and implementation costs of effective, sustainable, \ncoordinated, and whole school dropout prevention programs. Funds could \nbe used to implement comprehensive school-wide reforms, create \nalternative school programs or smaller learning communities. Grant \nrecipients could contract with community-based organizations to assist \nin implementing necessary services.\n  The School Improvement Accountability Act, the third bill I am \nintroducing today, sets more rigorous standards for States and LEAs \nreceiving Title I funds by strengthening the accountability provisions \nin Title I. The Title I program provides supplemental services to \ndisadvantaged students and schools with high concentrations of \ndisadvantaged students. These students and these schools are often \nshort-changed by our educational system. The bill seeks to ensure that \nall schools are often short-changed by our educational system. The bill \nseeks to ensure that all schools receiving Title I funding achieve \nrealistic goals for student achievement and that all students reach \nthose goals, narrowing existing achievement gaps. Recipients will be \nrequired to set goals for student achievement which will result in all \nstudents (in Title I schools) passing state tests at a ``proficiency'' \nstandard within 10 years of reauthorization. The bill also requires \nStates, LEAs and schools to focus on elimination of the achievement gap \nbetween LEP, disabled & low-income students and other students and to \nensure inclusion of all students in state assessments.\n  The bill also modifies the corrective action section of the bill, \nwhich is the section that is triggered when schools identified as being \nin need of improvement, have not made sufficient gains towards the \ngoals set out in the schools Title I plan. The School Improvement \nAccountability act would require schools failing to meet standards must \ntake one of three actions affecting personnel and/or management of the \nschools: (1) decreasing decision-making authority at the school level; \n(2) reconstituting the school staff; or (3) eliminating the use of \nnoncredentialed staff. Students in failing schools also would have a \nright to transfer to a school which is not failing.\n  In order to ensure equal educational opportunities for all our \nchildren, we must ensure that schools are safe, welcoming places. We \nalso must ensure that students in danger of dropping out of school are \nnot lost, but instead graduate high school with the skills that they \nneed to be productive members of our society. We must provide special \nsupport to students with greater obstacles to learning, such as \ndisadvantaged students, students whose first language is not English, \nand disabled students. We must ensure that schools serving these \nstudents can provide high quality educational programs and that those \nschools are held accountable for the success of all students. The bills \nI offer today will do much to achieve these goals.

Mr. President, today I am joined with Senator Hagel \nin introducing a bill to allow States and schools districts to switch \nTitle I of the Elementary and Secondary Education from a school-based \nto a child-based program.\n\n  We will soon take up the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. The centerpiece of which is Title I which was \ncreated in 1965 to provide extra educational assistance to low-income \nstudents. Since its inception, Title I has grown into the largest \nfederal education program for elementary and secondary school students \nwith funding, in this year alone, at $7.7 billion.\n  Unfortunately, after more than 30 years and expenditures of $118 \nbillion, national evaluations indicate that Title I has failed to \nachieve its primary aim of reducing the achievement gap between \nadvantaged and disadvantaged students.\n  Reading scores in 1998 showed that only 6 States made progress in \nnarrowing the gap between White and African American students and just \n3 made progress narrowing the gap between White and Hispanic students. \nWhile the gap actually grew in 16 States. In math, nine year olds in \nhigh poverty schools remain 2 grade levels behind students in low-\npoverty schools.\n  In reading, nine year old students in high poverty schools remain 3 \nto 4 grade levels behind students in low poverty schools. Seventy \npercent of children in high poverty schools score below even the most \nbasic level of reading. Two out of every three African American and \nHispanic 4th graders can barely read.\n  It is time to take a fresh look at this important program to ensure \nthat our neediest students are receiving the services they need. We \nmust provide enough flexibility in Title I for students to receive high \nquality supplemental educational services, wherever those services are \noffered.\n  In order to enable needy students to access high quality supplemental \nservices, States and school districts should be given the opportunity \nto transform Title I from a school-based program to a child-centered \nprogram. Which is exactly what my bill does. Let me explain.\n  Currently, Title I dollars are sent to States, then distributed to \nschool districts, and ultimately to schools--this is known as a school-\nbased program. Aid goes to the school, rather than directly to the \neligible child.\n  This process of sending dollars to districts and schools rather than \nstudents has a serious unintended consequence--millions of eligible \nchildren never receive the educational services promised to them by \nthis program.\n  To make matters worse, even schools which have been identified by \ntheir States and communities as chronic poor performers continue to \nreceive Title I dollars, despite that fact that well over one-third of \neligible children (about 4 million children) receive no services.\n  Today, 4 million children generate Title I revenue for their school \ndistrict, but never receive Title I services; despite the fact that the \nschool district received federal funds to provide supplemental \neducational services to those very children.\n  We should not continue the practice of sustaining failed schools at \nthe expense of our nation's children.\n  The very serious problem of under serving our neediest students can \nbe alleviated by giving States and school districts the ability to \nfocus their efforts by directly serving Title I eligible students \nthrough a child-centered program.\n  This bill permits interested States and school districts to use Title \nI dollars to create a child-centered program.\n  Here is how it would work. Interested states and school districts \ncould use their Title I dollars to establish a per pupil amount for \neach eligible child--any child between the ages of 5-17 from a family \nat or below the poverty line. The per pupil amount would then follow \nthe child to the school they attend. The per pupil amount would be used \nto provide supplemental educational (``add-on'' or ``extra'') services \nto meet the individual educational needs of children participating in \nthe program.\n  Since some schools continue to fail to provide high quality \neducational services to their neediest students, students could use \ntheir per-pupil amount to receive supplemental educational (``add-on'') \nservices from either their school or a tutorial assistance provider, be \nthat a Sylvan learning center, a charter school or a private school. \nThe idea behind this provision is to allow parents to use their per-\npupil amount to purchase extra tutorial assistance for before or after \nschool.\n  There are numerous benefits to turning Title I into a child-centered \nprogram. It increases the number of disadvantaged children served by \nTitle I. It ensures that federal dollars generated by a particular \nstudent actually\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\nbenefit that student. It rewards good schools and penalizes failing \nschools, as children would have the option to go the schools that best \nmeet their needs and take their Title I money with them. A child-\ncentered program decreases the practice of financially rewarding \nschools that consistently fail to provide a high quality education to \ntheir students. And, it ensures that students who are stuck in a bad \nschool have access to educational services outside the school, by \npermitting parents to use their child's per-pupil allotment for \ntutorial assistance.\n  In short, this bill creates a much-needed market for change in that \nit gives families the ability to take their federal dollars out of a \nschool that is not using them effectively and purchase services \nsomewhere else. Families are empowered and schools are compelled to \nimprove in order to keep their students.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. Turning Title I into a \nchild-centered program puts Title I back on the right track, focusing \non what is best for the child first and foremost.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TARIFFS AND ON SPECIAL, \n      MULTIPLE, AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXATION OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Baucus) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               S. Res. 58\n\n       Whereas electronic commerce is not bound by geography and \n     its borders are not easily discernible;\n       Whereas transmissions over the Internet are made through \n     packet-switching, making it impossible to determine with any \n     degree of certainty the precise geographic route or endpoints \n     of specific Internet transmissions and infeasible to separate \n     interstate from interstate, and domestic from foreign, \n     Internet transmissions;\n       Whereas inconsistent and inadministrable taxes imposed on \n     Internet activity by subnational and national governments \n     threaten not only to subject consumers, businesses and other \n     users engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to multiple, \n     confusing and burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the \n     growth and continued technological maturation of the Internet \n     itself;\n       Whereas the complexity of the issue of domestic taxation of \n     electronic commerce is compounded when considered at the \n     global level of almost 200 separate national governments;\n       Whereas the First Annual Report of the United States \n     Government Working Group on Electronic Commerce found that \n     fewer than 10 million people worldwide were using the \n     Internet in 1995, that more than 140 million people worldwide \n     were using the Internet in 1998 and that more than one \n     billion people worldwide will be using the Internet in the \n     first decade of the next Century;\n       Whereas information technology industries have accounted \n     for more than one-third of real growth in United States Gross \n     Domestic Product over the past 3 years;\n       Whereas information technology industries employ more than \n     seven million people in the United States, and by 2006, more \n     than one-half of the United States workforce is expected to \n     be employed in industries that are either major producers or \n     intensive users of information technology products and \n     services;\n       Whereas electronic commerce among businesses worldwide is \n     expected to grow from $43 billion in 1998 to more than $1.3 \n     trillion by 2003, and electronic retail sales to consumers \n     worldwide are expected to grow from $8 billion in 1998 to \n     more than $108 billion by 2003;\n       Whereas the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 enacted a \n     policy of technological neutrality and non-discrimination \n     toward taxation of electronic commerce, and stated that \n     United States policy should be to seek bilateral, regional \n     and multilateral agreements to remove barriers to global \n     electronic commerce;\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization, at its May 1998 \n     Ministerial Conference, adopted a declaration that all 132 \n     member countries ``will continue their current practice of \n     not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions'';\n       Whereas the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development and industry groups issued a joint declaration at \n     its October 1998 Ministerial meeting on Global Electronic \n     Commerce supporting the principles of technological \n     neutrality and non-discrimination and opposing discriminatory \n     taxation imposed on the Internet and electronic commerce;\n       Whereas the Committee on Fiscal Affairs of the Organization \n     for Economic Cooperation and Development has stated that \n     neutrality, efficiency, certainty and simplicity, \n     effectiveness and fairness, and flexibility are the broad \n     taxation principles that should be applied to electronic \n     commerce;\n       Whereas the United States has issued joint statements on \n     electronic commerce with Australia, the European Union, \n     France, Ireland, Japan, and Korea providing that any taxation \n     of electronic commerce should be neutral and \n     nondiscriminatory; and\n       Whereas a July 1999 United Nations Report on Human \n     Development urged world governments to impose ``bit taxes'' \n     on electronic transmissions; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) urges the President to seek a global consensus \n     supporting--\n       (A) a permanent international moratorium on tariffs on \n     electronic commerce; and\n       (B) an international ban on special, multiple, and \n     discriminatory taxation of electronic commerce and the \n     Internet;\n       (2) urges the President to instruct the United States \n     delegation to the November 1999 World Trade Organization \n     ministerial in Seattle to seek to make permanent and binding \n     the moratorium on tariffs on electronic transmissions adopted \n     by the World Trade Organization in May 1998;\n       (3) urges the President to seek adoption by the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and \n     implementation by the group's 29 member countries of an \n     international ban on special, multiple, or discriminatory \n     taxation of electronic commerce and the Internet; and\n       (4) urges the President to oppose any proposal by any \n     country, the United Nations, or any other multilateral \n     organization to establish a bit tax on electronic \n     transmissions.\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Leahy and Baucus to introduce today a resolution calling for \nan international ban on tariffs and on special, multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and the Internet. \nRepresentative Cox, with whom I have collaborated in the past on \nInternet-related matters, is introducing a companion resolution in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The resolution urges the President to seek a global consensus \nsupporting a permanent international moratorium on tariffs on \nelectronic commerce, and an international ban on special, multiple, and \ndiscriminatory taxation of electronic commerce and the Internet. The \nresolution urges the President to pursue the ban on tariffs through the \nWorld Trade Organization--particularly at the WTO Ministerial meeting \nthat will be held in Seattle this November, and to pursue the \nmoratorium on discriminatory, special, and multiple taxes on global e-\ncommerce through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment. These positions reinforce the efforts of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative at the WTO and of the U.S. negotiators at the OECD.\n  In the Internet Tax Freedom Act, enacted during the last Congress, we \nchallenged the concept of 30,000 U.S. tax jurisdictions swamping online \nconsumers and entrepreneurs with a crazy quilt of discriminatory taxes. \nBut this problem is small potatoes compared to the prospect of \nthousands of additional discriminatory tax regimes Americans might face \nin nearly 200 countries around the world.\n  We are not going to sit by while the booming, global e-market becomes \na\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\ntasty feast for overly hungry tax collectors from Bonn to Beijing and \nManila to Milan.\n  The same questions we dealt with in the United States become vastly \nmore complex at the international level. For example, during the course \nof the debate about the Internet Tax Freedom Act last year, I asked \nwhat happens when Aunt Millie in Iowa uses America Online in Virginia \nto order Harry and David's pears from Medford, Oregon, pays for them \nwith a bankcard in California and ships them to her old friend in \nFlorida?\n  In the global arena, we have to ask what happens when a tax collector \nin Germany tries to collect a Value Added Tax on a U.S. e-entrepreneur \nfrom Coos Bay, Oregon with no physical presence in Europe? This is a \nvery real threat because not long ago, the tax chief of a key European \nnation called trade over the Internet ``a threat to all government tax \nrevenue--a very serious threat.''\n  In addition, we have heard about the possibility of discriminatory \nbit taxes, which are taxes levied on the volume of e-mail that passes \nover the Net. And we have recently learned that the European Union is \ndiscussing something known as ``blocking and takedown.'' This is not a \nrugby term, but if established, it would allow the EU to bar the use of \nan American entrepreneur's website in Europe if he or she was unwilling \nto participate in an EU tax registration scheme.\n  Moreover, some countries are blurring the line between services and \nproducts in an effort to impose still more special, targeted tariffs \nand taxes on global e-commerce. At present, some digital delivery--for \nexample, downloading a CD or software program--is not taxed, but \nthere's considerable support for turning this service into a product \nthat could be the subject of discriminatory taxes.\n  Developing fair ground rules for the global digital economy is not a \njob for the faint hearted. That is why strong U.S. leadership is \nimperative in key multinational groups that are beginning to consider \nhow to update old laws and regulations to apply in the global \nelectronic marketplace.\n  That is the point of the resolution we are introducing today. Again, \nthe resolution does two things: it urges the President to seek a global \nconsensus supporting a global moratorium on tariffs on electronic \ncommerce at the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle, and \nsecond, it urges the President to seek through the OECD a global \nmoratorium on discriminatory, multiple and special taxes on electronic \ncommerce and the Internet.\n  This resolution builds upon the good work we accomplished in the 1998 \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. It is time to take the effort to stop \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce to the international level. \nI urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the resolution.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden \nin support of this resolution to urge the United States to seek a \nglobal consensus supporting a moratorium on tariffs and discriminatory \ntaxation of electronic commerce. I thank Senator Wyden and Congressman \nCox for their leadership in keeping the Internet free of discriminatory \ntaxes in the United States and around the world.\n  The Internet allows businesses to sell their goods all over the world \nin the blink of an eye. This unique power also presents a unique \nchallenge. That challenge facing the United States and the world is \ndeveloping tax policies to nurture this exciting new market. That is \nwhy I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution to urge the President to \nseek a global moratorium on discriminatory taxes and tariffs on \nelectronic commerce.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home \nstate of Vermont. Today hundreds of Vermont businesses are doing \nbusiness on the Internet, ranging from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company \nto Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream. \nThese Vermont businesses are of all sizes and customer bases, from Main \nStreet merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of ex-hippies \nwho sell great ice cream. But what Vermont online sellers do have in \ncommon is the fact that Internet commerce lets them erase the \ngeographic barriers that historically have limited our access to \nmarkets where our products can thrive. Cyberselling is paying off for \nVermont and the rest of the United States.\n  As electronic commerce continues to grow, the United States must take \nthe lead in fostering sound international tax policies. The United \nStates was the incubator of the Internet, and the world closely watches \nthe Internet policies that we debate and propose. Our leadership is \ncritical to the continued growth of commerce on the Internet. Our \nresolution advances the leadership role of the United States by urging \nthe administration to secure a global moratorium on discriminatory e-\ncommerce taxes.\n  With more than 190 nations around the world able to levy \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, we need this resolution to \ncontribute to the stability necessary for electronic commerce to \nflourish. We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet; if \nsales taxes and other taxes would apply to traditional sales and \nservices, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under our \nresolution. But our resolution would urge a global ban on any taxes \napplied only to Internet sales in a discriminatory manner. Let's not \nallow the future of electronic commerce--with its great potential to \nexpand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be crushed by the \nweight of multiple international taxation.\n  Today, there are more than 700,000 businesses selling their sales and \nservices on the World Wide Web around the world. Estimates predict that \nthe number of e-business Web sites will top 1 million by 2003.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE TO RAISE THE \n                   AWARENESS OF THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF DIABETES \n                   AND TO SUPPORT INCREASED FUNDS FOR DIABETES \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that \n     affects people of every age, race, income level, and \n     nationality.\n       (2) Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes, and \n     millions more are at risk of developing the disease.\n       (3) The number of Americans with diabetes has increased \n     nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years, leading the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention to call it the ``epidemic \n     of our time''.\n       (4) In 1999, approximately 800,000 people will be diagnosed \n     with diabetes, and diabetes will contribute to almost 200,000 \n     deaths, making diabetes the sixth leading cause of death due \n     to disease in the United States.\n       (5) Diabetes costs our nation an estimated $105,000,000,000 \n     each year.\n       (6) More than 1 out of every 10 United States health care \n     dollars, and about 1 out of every 4 Medicare dollars, is \n     spent on the care of people with diabetes.\n       (7) More than $40,000,000,000 a year in tax dollars are \n     spent treating people with diabetes through Medicare, \n     Medicaid, veterans benefits, Federal employee health \n     benefits, and other Federal health programs.\n       (8) Diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed, and an estimated \n     5,400,000 Americans have the disease but do not know it.\n       (9) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, \n     blindness in adults, and amputations.\n       (10) Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease, \n     stroke, and birth defects, and\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\n     shortens average life expectancy by up to 15 years.\n       (11) An estimated 1,000,000 Americans have Type 1 diabetes, \n     formerly known as juvenile diabetes, and 15,200,000 Americans \n     have Type 2 diabetes, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (12) Of Americans aged 65 years or older, 18.4 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (13) Of Americans aged 20 years or older, 8.2 percent have \n     diabetes.\n       (14) Hispanic, African, Asian, and Native Americans suffer \n     from diabetes at rates much higher than the general \n     population, including children as young as 8 years-old, who \n     are now being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, formerly known \n     as adult-onset diabetes.\n       (15) In 1999, there is no method to prevent or cure \n     diabetes, and available treatments have only limited success \n     in controlling diabetes devastating consequences.\n       (16) Reducing the tremendous health and human burdens of \n     diabetes and its enormous economic toll depend on identifying \n     the factors responsible for the disease and developing new \n     methods for treatment and prevention.\n       (17) Improvements in technology and the general growth in \n     scientific knowledge have created unprecedented opportunities \n     for advances that might lead to better treatments, \n     prevention, and ultimately a cure.\n       (18) After extensive review and deliberations, the \n     congressionally established and National Institutes of \n     Health-selected Diabetes Research Working Group has found \n     that ``many scientific opportunities are not being pursued \n     due to insufficient funding, lack of appropriate mechanisms, \n     and a shortage of trained researchers''.\n       (19) The Diabetes Research Working Group has developed a \n     comprehensive plan for National Institutes of Health-funded \n     diabetes research, and has recommended a funding level of \n     $827,000,000 for diabetes research at the National Institutes \n     of Health in fiscal year 2000.\n       (20) The Senate as an institution, and Members of Congress \n     as individuals, are in unique positions to support the fight \n     against diabetes and to raise awareness about the need for \n     increased funding for research and for early diagnosis and \n     treatment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about the importance of the \n     early detection, and proper treatment of, diabetes; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for screening and treating \n     diabetes;\n       (2) the National Institutes of Health, within their \n     existing funding levels, should increase research funding, as \n     recommended by the congressionally established and National \n     Institutes of Health-selected Diabetes Research Working \n     Group, so that the causes of, and improved treatments and \n     cure for, diabetes may be discovered;\n       (3) all Americans should take an active role to fight \n     diabetes by using all the means available to them, including \n     watching for the symptoms of diabetes, which include frequent \n     urination, unusual thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight \n     loss, extreme fatigue, and irritability; and\n       (4) national organizations, community organizations, and \n     health care providers should endeavor to promote awareness of \n     diabetes and its complications, and should encourage early \n     detection of diabetes through regular screenings, education, \n     and by providing information, support, and access to \n     services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BOND AMENDMENT NO. 1825\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BOND submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, S. 1650, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Department of Labor, through the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (referred to in this section \n     as ``OSHA'') plans to propose regulations during 1999 to \n     regulate ergonomics in the workplace. A draft of OSHA's \n     ergonomics regulation became available on February 19, 1999.\n       (2) A July 1997 report by the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health that reviewed epidemiological \n     studies that have been conducted of ``work related \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and \n     low back'' showed that there is insufficient evidence to \n     assess the level of risk to workers from repetitive motions. \n     Such evidence would be necessary to write an efficient and \n     effective regulation.\n       (3) An August 1998 workshop on ``work related \n     musculoskeletal injuries'' held by the National Academy of \n     Sciences reviewed existing research on musculoskeletal \n     disorders. The workshop showed that there is insufficient \n     evidence to assess the level of risk to workers from \n     repetitive motions.\n       (4) In October 1998, Congress and the President agreed that \n     the National Academy of Sciences should conduct a \n     comprehensive study of the medical and scientific evidence \n     regarding musculoskeletal disorders. The study is intended to \n     evaluate the basic questions about diagnosis and causes of \n     such disorders.\n       (5) To complete that study, Public Law 105-277 appropriated \n     $890,000 for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a \n     peer-reviewed scientific study of the available evidence \n     examining a cause and effect relationship between repetitive \n     tasks in the workplace and musculoskeletal disorders or \n     repetitive stress injuries.\n       (6) The National Academy of Sciences currently estimates \n     that this study will be completed late in 2000 or early in \n     2001.\n       (7) Given the uncertainty and dispute about these basic \n     questions, and Congress' intention that they be addressed in \n     a comprehensive study by the National Academy of Sciences, it \n     is premature for OSHA to propose a regulation on ergonomics \n     as being necessary or appropriate to improve workers' health \n     and safety until such study is completed.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available in this \n     Act may be used by the Secretary of Labor or the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration to promulgate or issue, or \n     to continue the rulemaking process of promulgating or \n     issuing, any standard or regulation regarding ergonomics \n     prior to September 29, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LEVIN AMENDMENT NO. 1826\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEVIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 1650, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life threatening safety code violations, and 12,000,000 \n     children attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct affect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (6) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (8) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology,\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (10) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (11) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should provide at least $3,700,000,000 in \n     Federal resources to help communities leverage funds to \n     modernize public school facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        ENZI AMENDMENT NO. 1846\n\n  Mr. ENZI proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1650, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 13, line 14, insert after ``1970;'' the following: \n     ``Provided, That of the amount appropriated under this \n     heading that is in excess of the amount appropriated for such \n     purposes for fiscal year 1999, $16,883,500 shall be used to \n     carry out the activities described in paragraph (1) and \n     $16,883,500 shall be used to carry out paragraphs (2) through \n     (6);''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DeWINE AMENDMENT NO. 1847\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 1650, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC \n                   EDUCATION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Recent scientific evidence demonstrates that enhancing \n     children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual \n     development before the age of six results in tremendous \n     benefits throughout life.\n       (2) Successful schools are led by well-trained, highly \n     qualified principals, but many principals do not get the \n     training that the principals need in management skills to \n     ensure their school provides an excellent education for every \n     child.\n       (3) Good teachers are a crucial catalyst to quality \n     education, but one in four new teachers do not meet state \n     certification requirements; each year more than 50,000 under-\n     prepared teachers enter the classroom; and 12 percent of new \n     teachers have had no teacher training at all.\n       (4) Public school choice is a driving force behind reform \n     and is vital to increasing accountability and improving low-\n     performing schools.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the federal government should support state and local \n     educational agencies engaged in comprehensive reform of their \n     public education system and that any education reform should \n     include at least the following principals:\n       (A) that every child should begin school ready to learn by \n     providing the resources to expand existing programs, such as \n     Even Start and Head Start;\n       (B) that training and development for principals and \n     teachers should be a priority;\n       (C) that public school choice should be encouraged to \n     increase options for students; and\n       (D) that support should be given to communities to develop \n     additional counseling opportunities for at-risk students.\n       (E) School boards, administrators, principals, parents, \n     teachers, and students must be accountable for the success of \n     the public education system and corrective action in \n     underachieving schools must be taken.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              BINGAMAN (AND HUTCHISON) AMENDMENT NO. 1883\n\n  (Ordfered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 1650, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Rear Admiral Bob Chamberlin, on his \nretirement from the United States Navy after 33 years of distinguished \nand dedicated service to the nation.\n  Rear Admiral Chamberlin is a native of Massachusetts. He graduated \nfrom high school in Westwood and went on to earn his bachelor's degree \nat the University of Wisconsin, where he distinguished himself as a \nfirst-tier ROTC graduate. Shortly after receiving his commission in \n1966, he was assigned to the U.S.S. Hisseem in Pearl Harbor. From there \nhe went on to serve in Vietnam, gaining the respect of all who shared \nduty with him and earning numerous decorations and awards, including \nthe Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, the Vietnamese Medal of \nHonor First Class, and the Combat Action Ribbon.\n  Following his Vietnam tour, he came home to Massachusetts and earned \nan MBA degree from Harvard. He went on to serve in a variety of supply \nand financial management assignments, ashore and afloat. He was soon \nregarded by his superiors as a tireless and innovative logistician. Ten \nyears after attending the Naval Supply Corps School in Athens, Georgia, \nhe returned to the school as an instructor and course developer.\n  In 1987, after serving as director of stock control at the Aviation \nSupply Office in Philadelphia and as supply officer on the U.S.S. \nNimetz, he was promoted to captain and was assigned to the Naval Supply \nSystems Command in Washington, D.C., where he served as the project \nofficer on a major supply-system modernization initiative. Later, he \nwas appointed to be the Command's vice commander.\n  In July 1993, he was promoted to rear admiral, and for the past two \nyears, he has served as the principal deputy director of the Defense \nLogistics Agency--America's combat support agency. His vision and \nleadership have been vital to the agency's award-winning business-\nprocess initiatives to ensure that the nation's armed forces receive \nthe supplies and equipment they need, and in a way that offers the best \npossible return to the American taxpayer.\n  Admiral Chamberlin has been in the forefront of the ongoing advances \nin military logistics. His exemplary military career comes to a close \nthis month, but his contributions and achievements will continue to be \nfelt throughout the Navy and the Department of Defense.\n  Bob Chamberlin has served his country with great ability, valor, \nloyalty, and integrity. On the occasion of his retirement from the \nUnited States Navy, I commend him for his outstanding service. He is \nMassachusetts'\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\nfinest, and I wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11752-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VIRGINIA ANNE HOLSFORD\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, tomorrow a good friend of mine is \nretiring after 24 years of faithful and exemplary service as primary \nassistant for two federal judges in my state. Virginia Anne Holtsford \nserved first as secretary and primary assistant to Judge Orma Smith, \nwho was United States District Judge for the Northern District of \nMississippi. Upon his death she became the secretary and primary \nassistant to United States Fifth Circuit Appeals Court Judge E. Grady \nJolly of Jackson, Mississippi. She has been with Judge Jolly from his \nfirst day on the bench, more than seventeen year ago. She is retiring \nto move back to her hometown of Iuka, Mississippi, to be with her \nmother.\n  This is how Judge Jolly described Ms. Holtsford to me: ``Anne \nHoltsford has a very special way of dealing with folks that has \nendeared her to hundreds of people who transact business with the \nfederal courts in Mississippi and, indeed, throughout the Fifth \nCircuit. I believe there is no more popular and better-liked secretary \nin the Fifth Circuit.''\n  All of us who have had the good fortune to know Anne Holtsford \nappreciate her dedicated, friendly and professional service. We will \nmiss her very much, but certainly she deserves a wonderful retirement.\n  I join all of her many friends in commending her for a job well done \nand wishing her much happiness in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11752-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11752-S11753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMBASSADOR VANDEN HEUVEL'S TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KENNEDY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nHonorable Edward Kennedy, who received the Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nFreedom Medal in early May of this year. I ask that Ambassador William \nJ. vanden Heuvel's remarks honoring Senator Kennedy be printed in the \nRecord following this statement.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n           The Four Freedoms: A Gateway to the New Millennium\n\n  An Address by William J. vanden Heuvel, President of the Franklin & \n     Eleanor Roosevelt Institute--Hyde Park, New York--May 7, 1999\n\n       Today, midst the renewal of life that Spring represents, we \n     come to the valley of the Hudson River that Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt loved so very much. The President parents and four \n     children of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt are buried in this \n     country churchyard. We remember that three sovereigns of the \n     Netherlands--Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix came to this \n     church to worship accompanied by it Senior Warden who was \n     also the President of the United States. We welcome the \n     Queen's High Commissioner. Wim van Gelder, and the delegation \n     from Zeeland where the Roosevelt Study Center has established \n     itself as a pre-eminent place of study of the American \n     presidency.\n       Winston Churchill described Franklin Roosevelt as the \n     greatest man he had ever known. President Roosevelt's life, \n     Churchill said, ``must be regarded as one of the commanding \n     events in human destiny.'' We listen once more to the words \n     the President spoke to the Congress on January 6, 1941, as he \n     defined the fundamental charter of democracy: [The voice of \n     President Roosevelt as he spoke to the Congress of the United \n     States on January 6, 1941]\n       ``In the future days, which we seek to make secure we look \n     forward to a world founded upon four essential freedoms. The \n     first is Freedom of Speech and Expression--everywhere in the \n     world. The second is Freedom of every person to worship God \n     in his own way--everywhere in the world. The third is Freedom \n     from Want--which, translated into world terms, means economic \n     understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy \n     peacetime life for its inhabitants--everywhere in the world. \n     The fourth is Freedom from Fear--which, translated into world \n     terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a \n     point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will \n     be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression \n     against any neighbor--anywhere in the world.''\n     Freedom of Speech and Expression\n     Freedom of Worship\n     Freedom from Want\n     Freedom from Fear\n       For ourselves, for our nations, for our world. Those are \n     the reasons why we fought the most terrible war in human \n     history--to secure those freedoms for our children and \n     generations to come, to make possible for them the well-\n     ordered society that only Democracy can assure, a community \n     established by the consent of the governed, where the rule of \n     law prevails, where freedom means respect for each other, and \n     where fairness and decency and tolerance are the cherished \n     values, where government protects the powerless while \n     encouraging everyone to nourish the spirit and substance of \n     our land.\n       Franklin Roosevelt was the voice of the people of the \n     United States during the most difficult crises of the \n     century. He led America out of the despair of the Great \n     Depression. He led us to victory in the Great War. Four times \n     he was elected President of the United States. By temperament \n     and talent, by energy and instinct, Franklin Roosevelt came \n     to the presidency, ready for the challenges that confronted \n     him. He was a breath of fresh air in our political life--so \n     vital, so confident and optimistic, so warm and good humored. \n     He was a man of incomparable personal courage. At the age of \n     39, he was stricken with infantile paralysis. He would never \n     walk or stand again unassisted. We can feel the pain of his \n     struggle--learning to move again, to stand, to rely upon the \n     physical support of others--never giving into despair, to \n     self-pity, to discouragement. Just twelve years after he was \n     stricken, he was elected President of a country itself \n     paralyzed by the most fearful economic depression of its \n     history. He lifted America from its knees and led us to our \n     fateful rendezvous with history. The majesty of that triumph \n     can never be dimmed.\n       He transformed our government into an active instrument of \n     social justice. He made America the arsenal of democracy. He \n     was Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military force in \n     history. He crafted the victorious alliance that won the war. \n     He was the father of the nuclear age. He inspired and guided \n     the blueprint for the world that was to follow. The vision of \n     the United Nations, the commitment to collective security, \n     the determination to end colonialism, the opportunity of \n     peace and prosperity for all people--everywhere in the world. \n     Such was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt.\n       President Roosevelt spoke in simple terms that everyone \n     understood. Civilization needs a police force, he said, just \n     as every one of our communities look to their local police \n     for security and protection against the lawless. Adolf Hitler \n     and his Nazi hoodlums brought the world to the precipice of \n     destruction. Franklin Roosevelt was the first among the \n     world's leaders to denounce and confront the savagery of the \n     Nazis. The tin horn dictators who trample democratic values \n     today when they carry out ethnic cleansing and murder \n     innocent people, destroying their children and their hopes, \n     are in the same gangster tradition. It is Franklin \n     Roosevelt's legacy to nullify their power by collective \n     action. If the freedoms, which are the essence of \n     civilization, are only rhetoric unworthy of defense and \n     sacrifice, they will not prosper. They will perish.\n       The America that President Roosevelt left us was prepared \n     for the challenge of the New Frontier. Despite the trouble \n     and turbulence of the 20th century, there is much of which we \n     can be proud. We have a nation based upon the consent of the \n     governed. We must cause it once again to be respectful of the \n     opinions of Mankind. We have amassed wealth that has never \n     been equaled. We have brought together all of the world's \n     races and creeds and shown that we can live together in peace \n     and common purpose. We have spent our treasure and spilled \n     our blood to prevent tyrants from destroying the \n     possibilities of freedom and liberty.\n       Neither President Roosevelt nor we who share his vision are \n     projecting a Utopia, a place liberated of all human trouble, \n     where no one shall want for anything. No, the Four Freedoms \n     are not a vision of a distant millennium, but rather the \n     basis of a world attainable in our own time and generation.\n       It is the purpose of this day to honor five laureates whose \n     lives and achievements give us hope that our cherished \n     freedoms will endure as our Republic will endure.\n       It is my privilege and honor to bestow the Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt Four Freedoms Medals.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Award of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal to Edward Moore \n                                Kennedy\n\n       ``We look forward,'' President Roosevelt told Congress and \n     an embattled world on January 6, 1941, ``to a world founded \n     upon four essential freedoms''--Freedom of Speech and \n     Expression, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, Freedom \n     from Fear.\n       On this 7th day of May, 1999, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt \n     Freedom Medal is awarded to Edward Moore Kennedy whose \n     commitment to peace and social justice and whose brilliant \n     command of the parliamentary process have made him the most \n     influential Senator of his era, esteemed by his colleagues, \n     and respected and admired throughout the world.\n       Six times the voters of Massachusetts have elected you to \n     the Senate of the United States. Like the great leaders of \n     this century, you have been the target of doubt, derision, \n     ridicule and hatred, but to your enemies' everlasting \n     disappointment, you have endured and prevailed, fortified by \n     an inner strength that caused each fateful assault to leave \n     you stronger, more determined, and more effective.\n       You have been much more than the heir to a great political \n     dynasty. You have been the executor of its legacy, a pioneer \n     forever advancing the new frontiers of equal opportunity and \n     American purpose. Born into a\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\n     family of wealth and influence, you created an independent \n     career that has profoundly enriched the Kennedy saga and \n     given voice and power precisely to those who, lacking wealth \n     and influence, have been denied the opportunity of the \n     American dream.\n       In the struggle for civil rights, your eloquence has been \n     the trumpet of our leadership. You are the inexhaustible \n     champion of racial justice and minority rights, of better \n     schools, of the protection of the environment, of care and \n     concern for the casualties of a market society--of those left \n     out of America's historic prosperity. No one has done more to \n     provide healthcare for all Americans. You have built \n     extraordinary coalitions--and when necessary you have stood \n     alone--in extending insurance coverage, in controlling costs, \n     in protecting the vulnerable, in advancing medical research. \n     You have fought for a social security system that truly \n     assures security. You have led the fight for the minimum wage \n     and the rights of labor, for equal opportunity for women, for \n     the protection of children and for all those caught in the \n     web of poverty. What the New Deal established, you advanced. \n     You are the defender of past social gains and the designer of \n     new social opportunities. Your capacity for friendship, your \n     graciousness and good humor, your willingness to do the \n     tedious homework that makes you a master of legislative \n     detail has enabled you to overcome partisan divisions. You \n     have achieved extraordinary results without compromising \n     principle.\n       In world affairs, you are a champion of peace and \n     international understanding. Northern Ireland has the hope of \n     peace today in large part because of your outspoken \n     opposition to violence and terrorism and your untiring \n     support of those on the front line working for justice and \n     reconciliation. The developing nations of the world know you \n     as their friend, and the United Nations esteems you as an \n     American leader who is determined to see our country fulfill \n     its responsibilities of leadership.\n       Your life has not been absent adversity and pain but that \n     has not lessened your determination to strive, to seek, to \n     find and never yield in the quest for a better world. In 1980 \n     bringing your campaign to an end, you said: ``. . . But for \n     all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes \n     on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream \n     shall never die.'' You have been faithful to that promise. \n     Those words define our purpose with this award. You have \n     understood and enhanced the great message of the Four \n     freedoms as Franklin Delano Roosevelt meant them. Therefore, \n     in his name, we honor--and we thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11753-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CLOSING OF FORT McCLELLAN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is an important day for the United \nStates and for Alabama in the community of Anniston, Calhoun County.\n  Fort McClellan closed today. It was a casualty of the 1995 BRAC \nprocess. There was a great institution and a great installation. \nThousands and hundreds of thousands of Americans served in that \ncommunity. It was given to the military in the early 1900s by the \npeople of that area in order to found this base.\n  I would like to read part of an article by Rose Livingston, writing \nfor the Birmingham News, captioned ``Taps for Fort McClellan as final \ndoor closes.''\n\n       The barracks are boarded up, and barricades block their \n     driveways. Flags have been furled and stored as mementos. \n     Soldiers have packed up and shipped out.\n       Fort McClellan is no more.\n       The 82-year-old Army training base in Anniston finally shut \n     its gates Thursday. It was given birth in 1917 by a community \n     that chipped in to buy the land and donated it to their \n     government. Its demise came at the hands of federal bean-\n     counters, who decided in 1995 that Fort McClellan was \n     surplus.\n       No bugle sounded, no cannon fired for the final shutdown. \n     Those symbols were quieted after a closing ceremony in \n     August, when soldiers were still around to march in it. Most \n     are long gone. All that remains now is a skeleton crew to \n     manage the base's transition from a bustling military post to \n     a profit-generating private enterprise.\n\n  Indeed, we will be looking for reuse of that facility. The community \nhas a joint power reuse authority: The Chamber of Commerce, the city of \nAnniston are all working to do what they can to create the kind of \nactivity in a different way than what existed there.\n  I am pleased we had the support of this Senate to create the Center \nfor Domestic Preparedness at Fort McClellan because Fort McClellan was \na chemical training school, among other things, and we have to be able \nto be prepared in this Nation for the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  So this base at least will be a small part of some of the chemical \ntesting facilities, some of the training facilities, and training of \nteachers. They will be able to teach firemen and police how to respond \nif they are faced with a chemical or biological weapons attack in their \ntowns and cities.\n  The people of Anniston, the people of Fort McClellan, and the people \nof Calhoun County are patriotic Americans. They gave the land that \nbecame Ft. McClellan, and now they will receive the land back. But they \nwill lose a great deal of income and support.\n  The people of Anniston fought for their fort, but took the loss \ngracefully. They believed that chemical weapons would remain a major \nthreat and that we ought not to close this base. I think they made a \nlot of good arguments.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for the \nremarks he made earlier and his commitment to revitalizing the moral \nfiber of this Nation.\n  I think the polls he showed that the American people consider the \nthreat of decline in values as the greatest threat facing our country \nare correct. If we lose our commitment to honesty, truth, discipline, \nhard work, and faith, if we lose those values, our Nation could be \njeopardized. I thank the Senator from Kansas for raising those points \nbecause in many ways they transcend all the other issues we are facing.\n  I know Senator Brownback, the Presiding Officer tonight, was watching \nclosely Sunday night when we had the ``Touched By An Angel'' show. They \ntalked about a Senator who was given a challenge to go out to Sudan and \nsee for themselves what it was like. The show could have been done \nabout the Presiding Officer tonight because Senator Brownback did that \nmonths ago. He personally went to Sudan and observed the terrible \nconditions there. He observed men being abused and killed. He observed \nwomen being taken into slavery and abused sexually--being bought and \nsold nearly into the 21st century. He was appalled by it. He has come \nback here and done something about that.\n  I know Dr. Bill Frist, another Member of this body, had been there \nhimself, to this poor, dangerous country, and helped serve with medical \nskills he possesses.\n  I just want to say congratulations to you, and thank you for that. I \nthink that film could well have been written about either of you. You \nfelt a calling to respond to the less fortunate and have done so. I \nbelieve something good is going to come out of that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/30/senate-section/article/S11753-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11753-S11754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TO REENACT CHAPTER 12 OF TITLE 11, UNITED STATES CODE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
