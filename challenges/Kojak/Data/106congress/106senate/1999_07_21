Mr. President, I rise to express my heartfelt sympathy to \nour colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, and the whole Kennedy Family on the \ndeath of his nephew, John F. Kennedy, Jr.\n  John Kennedy, Jr. was much admired by all Americans. The son of \nCamelot, he was aware of his own celebrity but did not flaunt it.\n  His entry into politics--the Kennedy family business--would have been \nwell paved for him, but he chose to go his own way. He succeeded in the \nextremely competitive publishing world. When failures in this industry \noutnumber successes, he created and built ``George'' into a popular and \noften insightful magazine. By all accounts, JFK, Jr. was a hands-on \neditor, had a fair hand, and had an eye for what would be interesting \nand fresh for American readers.\n  His marriage to Carolyn Bessette took America's number one bachelor \noff the market. But, it also gave his life new dimension.\n  We here in the Senate would be remiss if we did not also express our\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\ndeepest sympathy to the Bessette family who lost two daughters in this \nterrible accident. As a father, this is a loss I cannot begin to \nimagine.\n  It seems that no family should have to endure the level of tragedy \nthat has befallen the Kennedys. I will say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts: America mourns with you and the Senate mourns with you, \nyour family, and the Bessette family as well.\n  Elaine and I want to express publicly what we have said privately, \nwhich is that you and your family and the Bessette family are in our \nthoughts and prayers. May God hold you in the palm of his hand.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 1406 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, once again, I thank my dear friend from \nIllinois for allowing me to proceed, and at this point I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, under the order that was previously \nstated, I yield 3 minutes in morning business to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert Tobias \nfor his distinguished service at the National Treasury Employees Union, \nincluding four terms as its president.\n  Admired by his friends and adversaries alike, Bob Tobias has garnered \nrespect as an effective advocate and constructive mediator during his \ntenure at the NTEU.\n  Bob and his wife Susan reside in Bethesda, MD, and we are very proud \nto have them as residents of our State. However, Bob is a native of \nMichigan and received a bachelor's degree, as well as a master's \ndegree, in business administration from the University of Michigan. Bob \ncompleted his education at George Washington University, where he \nreceived a law degree. He built upon his formal education with \nsubstantial legal experience as a labor relations specialist for \nGeneral Motors Corporation in Detroit and with the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  When Bob first joined the NTEU in 1968, he became its second staff \nemployee. During his 31-year tenure at NTEU, Bob served the \norganization in numerous capacities and saw the staff grow to more than \n100 members with seven field offices across the country. Now \nrepresenting more than 150,000 Federal employees at the Internal \nRevenue Service, Customs Service, and other agencies, NTEU is a strong \nvoice for public servants on Capitol Hill and with the other branches \nof Government.\n  Starting at NTEU as a staff attorney, Bob later served as general \ncounsel and executive vice president, supervising a staff of 45 \nattorneys and field representatives nationwide, as well as the \nlitigation and negotiations staff in the NTEU training program. His \ndedicated and skillful performance in these positions led to his \nelection as President of NTEU in 1983 and his subsequent reelection on \nthree occasions.\n  Under Bob's guidance, NTEU has been an influential voice for Federal \nemployees and has waged many successful battles on their behalf. From \nchallenging the line-item veto, to securing the right to picket for \nFederal employees, to obtaining the payment of over a half billion \ndollars in back pay from the Nixon administration, Bob Tobias has \nachieved wide-ranging victories for our public servants.\n  In addition to his talent for successful litigation, Bob Tobias has \nworked with the Government and its agencies to improve the status of \nFederal employees and to enhance their ability to serve the public. For \nexample, he is credited with wide-ranging IRS reforms, rendering the \ntax-collecting organization a more efficient and responsive public \nagency. He is credited with instituting the first negotiated alternate \nwork schedule for employees and the first cooperative labor management \nprogram for onsite child care.\n  Because of his extensive interaction with the agencies that employ \nFederal workers, Bob is highly regarded as an expert on how to improve \nGovernment. Many different organizations have sought out his expertise \non these matters and, among others, Bob is now a member of the \nPresident's National Partnership Council, the Federal Advisory \nCommittee on Occupational Safety and Health, the Executive Committee of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, and the American Arbitration Association.\n  Because of his dedicated leadership on behalf of our Federal workers, \nhis consensus-building approach to Government reform, and the highly \nprofessional manner in which he carried out his work, Bob Tobias leaves \na powerful and enduring legacy as President of the NTEU. I am pleased \nthat he will continue in the public realm since he is planning a career \nin public policy teaching and writing.\n  Again, I congratulate Bob Tobias on his outstanding service at NTEU \nand his terrific record as a public servant on behalf of the American \npeople, and I wish him all the best in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say a word about the tragedy \nwhich has befallen the Kennedy family and the Bessette family, as we \nlearn about the terrible circumstances involving the plane crash last \nFriday. When my wife came in in Springfield, IL, Saturday morning and \nsaid that she had just heard on the radio that John Kennedy's plane was \nmissing, our reaction was the same: Could this be another tragedy for \nthis family?\n  The Kennedy family means so much to America, so much to the \nDemocratic Party, and so much to many of us personally. As a young \nstudent just starting at Georgetown University in 1963, I arrived weeks \nbefore the assassination of President John Kennedy. I stood on \nPennsylvania Avenue and watched the funeral cortege leave the White \nHouse for this Capitol Building, where President John Kennedy's body \nwas held in reverence for visitation by the American people.\n  Then I can recall, as a college student, sitting in this gallery and \nlooking down on this floor to watch as Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator \nRobert Kennedy talked about the war in Vietnam, and in the gallery \nacross the way was Ethel Kennedy and other members of the Kennedy \nfamily. Little did I dream that the day would come when I would serve \nwith Senator Ted Kennedy and come to know him personally. Each of us \nwho serves with him understands what an extraordinary person he is. He, \nin my mind, is the best legislator on the floor of the Senate. He is so \nwell versed, so well prepared, and so hard-working, that he is an \ninspiration to all of us.\n  We are reminded from time to time, as we were this weekend, that his \nobligations go beyond the Senate and certainly to a large family who \nlooks to him for guidance and leadership in times of trial. This week, \nTed Kennedy is bringing together the Kennedy family in mourning over \nthe death of John Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her \nsister Lauren. Our hearts go out to him and the entire family and to \nthe Bessette family as well.\n  Those of us who remember that 1963 assassination graphically can \nrecall exactly where we were at the moment that we heard President John \nKennedy was shot. As we watched all the scenes unfold afterwards, one \nof the most poignant was that of little John Kennedy saluting his \nfather as the casket passed in front of the church. I guess we had \nalways hoped that because Caroline and John Kennedy had endured this \ntragedy so early in life that God would find a special place for them \nand they would lead normal, happy, and secure lives. They certainly set \nout to do it and did it well, both of them. Then again, a tragedy such \nas this will occur and remind us again of our vulnerability and \nfragility as human beings.\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to both families, and certainly to \nSenator Kennedy in his leadership role in the Kennedy family. We will \nbe remembering them as this week passes and as we address our concern \nand sympathy on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend my very able colleague from \nIllinois for his very eloquent remarks about this tragedy, and I \nassociate myself with his remarks. Our hearts do go out to both \nfamilies, the Kennedy family and the Bessette family. The Bessette \nfamily has lost two children.\n  My State has been fortunate to be blessed by the extraordinary \nleadership of the next generation of the Kennedy family in terms of \nKathleen Kennedy Townsend, who now serves as our lieutenant governor. \nSo I have a direct sense of the strong responsibility of dedicated \npublic service which has marked this family from the very beginning.\n  All of us are deeply struck by this tragedy. Our hearts reach out to \nthe families. We extend them our very heartfelt sympathies. We feel \nvery deeply about our colleague, Senator Kennedy, who, of course, has \nassumed the family leadership responsibilities. We have to press on, \nbut it really comes as a very saddening tragedy for all of us.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I inquire of the time remaining under \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes under his control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8903-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8903-S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to address an issue which is \ntopical and one that most Americans will be hearing about during the \ncourse of this week and the next. It is an issue involving tax cuts. \nCan there be two more glorious words for a politician to utter than \n``tax cuts''?\n  People brighten up and their eyes open and they look in anticipation, \nand they think: What is this politician going to bring me by way of a \ntax cut?\n  Our friends on the Republican side of the aisle have decided that \nthey will make the centerpiece of their legislative effort this year a \ntax cut, a tax cut which, frankly, will have an impact on America--\npositive in some respects but overwhelmingly negative in other \nrespects--for decades to come. So I think it is important for us to \ncome to the floor and discuss exactly where we are today and where we \nare going.\n  First, a bit of history:\n  In the entire history of the United States of America, from President \nGeorge Washington and through the administration of President Jimmy \nCarter, our Nation accumulated $1 trillion in debt--a huge sum of money \nover 200 years. But at the end of the Carter administration, and the \nReagan and Bush administrations began, we started stacking up debts in \nnumbers that were unimaginable. In fact, today we have over $5 trillion \nin national debt. Think about that--200 years, $1 trillion, and, just \nin the last 20 years, another $4 or $5 trillion in debt.\n  What does it mean to have a debt in this country? You have to pay \ninterest on it, for one thing. The interest we pay each year on that \ndebt we have accumulated is $350 billion out of a national budget this \nyear of about $1.7 trillion. You see that each year about 20 percent of \nour national budget goes to pay interest on the debt we have \naccumulated.\n  The new President came in--President Clinton--in 1992 and said: We \nhave to do something about this. We can't keep going down this path of \naccumulating debt and paying more money in interest. It isn't good for \nour current generation to be paying out that money, and certainly we \nshouldn't saddle our children with that added responsibility.\n  In 1993, he came to the Congress and said: Let us take from what we \nhave been doing over the past 10 years and do something new. The \nPresident proposed a new budget plan--a plan that was determined to \nbring down this debt. That plan passed without a single Republican \nvote. In 1993, the Clinton plan passed without a single Republican vote \nin this Chamber. Vice President Gore came to the Chair and cast the \ndeciding vote to pass the plan.\n  It was a big gamble. Some Members of Congress on the Democratic side \nlost in the next election because they voted for the Clinton plan. \nMarjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, one of my colleagues from the State of \nPennsylvania, cast a courageous vote for that plan and lost in the next \nelection.\n  But was the President right? History tells us he was dramatically so \nbecause in the last 6 years we have seen not only our economy grow \ndramatically in terms of the creation of jobs and businesses--low \ninflation, new housing starts, and all the positive things we like--but \nwe have finally seen us turn the corner and move toward balance when it \ncomes to our annual Federal budget.\n  Now, if you will, we are not discussing what to do as we swim through \nthis sea of red ink but, rather, what to do with an anticipated \nsurplus. In 6 years, we have moved from talk of a deficit to speaking \nof surplus.\n  There are two different views on what to do with this future surplus. \nThe Republican side of the aisle is suggesting a $1 trillion tax cut \nover a 10-year period of time. I am sure that is appealing to some, \nparticularly if you are in the higher income groups in America who will \nbenefit from this tax cut. But certainly we ought to step back for a \nsecond and say: Is that the responsible thing to do? Should we be \ngiving away $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years at the \nexpense of virtually everything else?\n  Our side of the aisle, the Democratic side of the aisle, working with \nPresident Clinton, has a different approach, one which I think is more \nresponsible and more consistent with the leadership which the Democrats \nshowed in turning the corner on these Federal deficits. It is basically \nthis:\n\n  First, let us meet our current obligations to Social Security and to \nMedicare.\n  It is amazing to me, as I listen to the Republicans talk about all of \nour future challenges, that there is one word they are afraid to \nutter--the word ``Medicare,'' the health insurance program for over 40 \nmillion senior and disabled Americans, a program which needs our \nattention and help.\n  What the Democrats and the President propose is to take a portion of \nthe future anticipated surplus as it comes in to solidify Social \nSecurity for another 50 years and to make sure Medicare can start to \nmeet its obligations past the year 2012.\n  We will have to do more, believe me. But at least by dedicating that \nportion of the surplus, I think we are accepting the responsibility, \nbefore we give money away for any new program or give money away for \nany tax cut, to take care of the programs that mean so much to American \nfamilies and in the process bring down the national debt and start \npaying off this $5 trillion national debt.\n  Is that important? It is critically important because not only by \nbringing down this debt will we reduce our annual interest payments of \n$350 billion, but we will free up capital in America for small \nbusinesses, large businesses, and families alike to borrow money at a \nlow interest rate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to see our colleague, Senator \nSarbanes, because we all serve on the Budget Committee because we know \nwhat a turning point this is for our Nation.\n  My friend said that with the Clinton plan we have finally turned a \nsea of red ink into a fiscally responsible situation. Is my friend \nsaying--I want to make sure we all understand--that in the Republican \nplan for the projected surplus there is not $1 set aside for Medicare? \nIs that what my friend is telling me?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I point to this chart. I hope this can be seen because the Republican \ntax cut plan of $1 trillion over the first 10 years leaves nothing for \nMedicare--not a penny for Medicare, as if the Medicare program itself \nis self-healing. It is not.\n  If you were going to deal with the Medicare problems--and they are \nsubstantial--you have only two or three options: raise payroll taxes \nand increase the amount paid by those under Medicare or cut benefits. \nWe may face some combination of those, as painful as they will be. But \nthey will be much worse if, in fact, we don't dedicate a portion of the \nsurplus to the Medicare program.\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\n  The Senator is right. If you take a look at this, there is not a \npenny of the Republican tax cut plan for Medicare and other priorities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could I ask a final question?\n  My friend and I have been on this floor on numerous occasions as \nproposals have come forward to raise the eligibility age for Medicare \nto 67 or 68. We have said, at a time when there are so many Americans \nwith no health insurance, let us not raise the eligible age for \nMedicare.\n  I know how strongly the Senator feels, and how Senator Sarbanes and I \nfeel about Medicare. Does my friend not believe, as I do that, when we \ntalk about the safety net for our senior citizens, we must talk about \nSocial Security and Medicare--that, in fact, they are the twin pillars \nof the safety net?\n\n  I ask my friend--and I will yield to him--that if we save Social \nSecurity--and both parties have agreed, because President Clinton laid \ndown the challenge, that that was good--and then do nothing about \nMedicare--which is the Republican plan--and suddenly those on Medicare \nhave to pay $200, $300, or $400 a month more for their health care \nbecause Medicare is strapped, does that not mean there really is no \nsafety net because the seniors will have to use their Social Security \nto pay out-of-pocket expenses for their health care?\n  Does my friend believe, as I do, that to say you are reserving the \nsafety net for seniors and at the same time you do nothing for \nMedicare, it is really kind of a fraud on the people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from California.\n  I think we should take this a step further. It is not only a \ndisservice to seniors who are covered by Medicare but to their families \nas well.\n  Those of us who have dealt with aging parents and their medical \nproblems understand that a family often has to rally together to try to \nfigure out how to help a mother, a father, a grandmother, or a \ngrandfather. If the additional expenses that are being shouldered \nbecause of the refusal of the Republicans to deal with the Medicare \nchallenge end up falling on the shoulders of the frail and elderly, \nthey will be expenses shared by many members of the family.\n  I think it is an element that has to be brought to this basic \nconsideration. It is one thing to say we are giving you a tax cut on \nthe one hand and yet we are going to increase the cost of Medicare to \nyou on the other.\n  I want to make two points which I think are important as well. I am, \nI guess, right on the age of what is known as the baby boom generation. \nI took a look at this Republican tax cut not just for the first 10 \nyears. This isn't a tax cut where they want to change the law for 10 \nyears and then go back to the old one. It goes on indefinitely. We have \na right and a responsibility to chart out what the Republican tax cut \nmeans beyond the first 10 years, to see what it means in the next 10 \nyears and the following 10 years.\n\n  Look what happens. It explodes from the years 2000 to 2004, $156 \nbillion; $636 billion in the next 5 years; $903 billion in the \nfollowing 4 years, and over $1 trillion in the last.\n  What does it mean? For the so-called baby boomers such as myself, \nwhen the time comes for retirement, the debt is going to start \nexploding again. The service of that debt, the interest paid on the \ndebt because of the Republican tax cut proposal, will be a new burden \nto be shouldered by that future generation. It is not responsible. The \nRepublican approach is not responsible. Not only does it ignore \nMedicare but it drags America right back into the sea of red ink. They \nare so determined to give these tax cuts to wealthy Americans that they \nare going to do it at the expense of fiscal sanity. Haven't we learned \na lesson over the last 10 or 20 years, that we cannot do this without \njeopardizing the possibility that we are going to have some kind of \nfiscal sanity for decades to come?\n  Think about this in the private sector. My friends on the Republican \nside say run government like a business. Microsoft is a very profitable \nbusiness. Would Microsoft give shareholders huge dividends based on \nexpected future profits? Of course not. They declare a dividend when \nthe money is in the bank.\n  The Republican tax cut programs wants to declare a national dividend \nin anticipation of money coming into the bank; the Democratic \nalternative says no, dedicate a portion of that surplus to Social \nSecurity and to Medicare, and if there is to be a tax cut, let it be a \nreasonable, affordable tax cut to help middle-income families first. \nThat is the difference. It is an important difference.\n  We also have to take into consideration that if the Republican tax \ncut is enacted, it is going to put pressure on Congress to cut spending \nin future years. Some people say Congress should cut spending; we ought \nto live within our means. The amount of money that will be taken from \nthe Treasury by the Republican tax cut in the outyears would have a \ndramatic negative impact on America.\n  This chart illustrates that. If the Republican budget passes, and the \ntax cuts which they have propose are enacted, here are the cuts we will \nface. The Head Start Program--a program for the youngest kids in \nAmerica, in some of the most vulnerable families, who are given a \nchance to start school ready to learn--will be cut for 375,000 \nchildren. The Republican tax cut leads to a cut in Head Start of \nservices to 375,000 kids.\n  What will happen to these children? They will show up for \nkindergarten and the first grade and they may not be ready to learn. So \nschool districts will have added responsibilities and society will have \nadded responsibilities. We see it reflected in crime statistics, in \nwelfare statistics. When we cut back in early childhood education, \nwhich the Republican plan leads us to, we will pay for it dearly.\n  Veterans, VA medical care. If the Republican plan passes, forcing the \nbudget cuts which inevitably follow, they will cut treatment for 1.4 \nmillion patients, veterans who come to hospitals asking for the care \nthey were promised when they served our country. Is that a reasonable \nalternative? I think it is not.\n  Under title I, education for the disadvantaged, cutting services for \n6.5 million children; The FBI, eliminating over 6,000 agents.\n  The Republicans smile and say, come on, we can give tax cuts, we can \ncut the budget, and none of this will occur.\n  We have lived through that era, that era of overpromising, that era \nthat built up the red ink in this country to the point where we faced a \nnational crisis and pleas from the Republican side to enact a \nconstitutional amendment so that the courts could force Congress to \nspend its money responsibly. We don't want to return to that again.\n  This morning I had a meeting with the superintendent of the Office of \nEducation from the State of Illinois, Max McGee, and the chairman of \nthe State board of education, Ron Gidwitz, a businessman from Chicago. \nThey came in asking for more Federal dollars. They want to have early \nchildhood programs so kids get a better start at learning. They want \nthe schoolday to go from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until 6 o'clock \nwhere kids have added adult supervision. They want school extended in \nthe summer so kids have an added chance to learn.\n  These are all wonderful consensus ideas in education, and each one of \nthem costs money. Naturally, our State education officials come to us \nasking for more Federal dollars. I told them they came at exactly the \nright moment because the debate starts across the Rotunda in the House \ntoday on whether or not the Republican tax cut plan will pass. If it \ndoes, and if it is enacted--which I doubt the President would see in \nthe future--we will face the possibility of fewer dollars available for \neducation at a time when most people believe if the 21st century is to \nbe another American century, we need to dedicate resources to education \nand to our kids. That is the choice. It is stark. It is difficult. It \nis politically treacherous.\n  We must do the responsible thing. The responsible thing is to take \nwhatever surplus comes in the future, dedicate it first to Social \nSecurity, then to Medicare, and then to retiring the national debt so \nthat families across America and businesses alike can enjoy continued \nprosperity, a responsible approach which guards the prosperity for the \nfuture.\n  I don't think the American people will be deceived in believing this \ntax cut is their deliverance from concern in the future.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the Senator from Illinois.\n  We have a marvelous opportunity at this point, having come out of \nthis deficit box as a consequence of the fiscal policies pursued by \nthis administration, to reduce the national debt for the first time in \na great number of years. Indeed, if we maintain proper discipline, we \ncan in effect eliminate the national debt for the first time since the \nfirst part of the 19th century.\n  All of that is at risk of loss, as the Washington Post says, because \nof the ``egregious recklessness of the Republican proposal'' which goes \nway out to the extreme.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed at the end of \nthis discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has pointed \nout very carefully, first of all, this is an exploding tax cut. The \ncost of this tax cut escalates very quickly as time goes by. While the \nprojections are over the first 10 years, in the second 10 years it \nvirtually triples in terms of cost.\n  Secondly, it is premised on the proposition there will be about a 20-\npercent cut in existing programs; Head Start, VA medical care, title I \nfor the disadvantaged--all the investments we need to make for the \nfuture strength of our country. The Republican appropriations bills are \nzeroing out the COPS program which is putting community police on the \nstreets all across America and bringing down the crime rate.\n  Thirdly, it does not adequately provide for Medicare. In fact, it \ndoesn't provide at all for Medicare looking out into the future.\n  The real question is whether we are going to take advantage of this \nopportunity to exercise a responsible fiscal policy. Furthermore, if we \nstart stimulating the economy with a tax cut at the very time that we \nhave gotten unemployment down to 4.2 percent--an unprecedented low \nlevel, the best in the last 30 years--then we are going to run the risk \nthat we will start pressure on prices, have an inflation problem, and \nthe Federal Reserve will start raising the interest rates.\n  In fact, at the last Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve \nraised the interest rates a quarter of a point. If the Republicans \ncontrolling the Congress start stimulating the economy, you can assume \nthat the Fed will take up these interest rates in order to dampen down \neconomic activity, and we will be right back in the box with a problem \nwe had in terms of how to encourage economic growth and have a \nresponsible economic policy. We have done a good job.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the Senator from Illinois pointed \nout, in 1993 when we enacted the President's economic program, not one \nsingle person from the other side of the aisle supported that program. \nNot only did they not support the program, they made all sorts of dire \npredictions of what would happen to the Nation's economy. In the debate \non this floor, Members stood up and it was as though the sky was going \nto fall in if this program was carried through.\n  Only a few have been willing subsequently to own up to the inaccuracy \nof their prediction--only a few. The others sort of, I guess, forget \nthey ever made the prediction. But the fact of the matter is, the \npolicy has worked extraordinarily well: Unemployment at a 30-year low; \ninflation at a 30-year low; we have come out of deficit and into \nsurplus. Now we have the opportunity to move ahead in a responsible \nmanner, not in an egregiously reckless manner, as the Washington Post \npoints out in this editorial.\n  So I commend my colleague from Illinois for his comments. This is an \nextremely important decision we are about to make in terms of the \nfuture course of this Nation. If we make it responsibly, we can \ncontinue on the path of prosperity. We can continue to invest in the \nfuture strength of our country through education, research and \ndevelopment, and developing our Nation's infrastructure, our \ntransportation, and our communication infrastructure. We can shore up \nthe Social Security system. We can address the problems of Medicare. We \ncan bring down the debt. We can even do targeted tax measures to help \nmiddle-income people and to help improve and increase productivity in \nour Nation. All of those are possible.\n  But things must be done in moderation. We cannot go to extremes, and \nthe Republican proposal is an extreme proposal. Subjected to analysis, \nit does not stand up. We must not go down that path. I commend the \nSenator from Illinois for making that point so effectively here on the \nfloor this morning.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 1999]\n\n                              A Tax Party\n\n       In part to placate party moderates whose votes they need, \n     House Republican leaders are proposing modest cuts in the \n     cost of the tax bill they are scheduled to bring to the floor \n     this week. But no one should be fooled by this, least of all \n     the moderates whose stock in trade is that they take \n     governing seriously. The leadership trims don't begin to undo \n     the egregious recklessness of this bill. There are three main \n     problems.\n       (1) The surplus the sponsors are using to finance the tax \n     cut the bill would grant is mostly phony. It is predicated on \n     a willingness of future Congresses to make deep spending cuts \n     from just the first phase of which this Congress already is \n     retreating. Most programs would have to be cut more than 20 \n     percent in real terms. Without such cuts, about three-fourths \n     of the imaginary surplus in other than Social Security funds \n     disappears; the amount goes from $1 trillion over the next 10 \n     years to perhaps $250 billion. If they set aside some money \n     for Medicare, as they are bound to do, even less will be \n     available for tax cuts--most likely nothing.\n       (2) The bill when fully effective would actually cost much \n     more than the projected surplus. The cost is masked by the \n     fact that so many provisions have been carefully backloaded--\n     written to take effect only toward the end of the 10-year \n     estimating period. The estimated cost of the first 10 years \n     of the Ways and Means Committee bill is $864 billion. The \n     likely cost of the next 10 years would be three times that; \n     one estimate puts it at $2.8 trillion. This is a ludicrous \n     bill, a lemming-like effort to put political points on the \n     board whose effect would be to return the government to the \n     destructive cycle of borrow-and-spend from which it only now \n     is painfully emerging. The economy and the ability of the \n     government to function both would be harmed.\n       (3) The principal beneficiaries would be people at the very \n     top of the income scale. The rhetoric and some of the \n     analysis surrounding the bill suggest otherwise. But here \n     again, backloading comes into play. Some of the provisions \n     slowest to take effect are those that would be of greatest \n     benefit to the better-off. In the end, one analysis indicates \n     that nearly half the benefit of the bill would accrue to \n     households in the top one percent of the income distribution.\n       This is a bill that would mainly benefit relatively few \n     people at the expense of many. It would once more strand the \n     government--leave it with obligations far in excess of its \n     means--and in the process do serious social as well as fiscal \n     and economic harm. Not even as a political billboard that the \n     president can be counted upon to veto should it pass. There \n     ought not be a tax cut. The parties ought not use imaginary \n     money to cut a deal at public expense. The greatest favor \n     that this Congress could do the country would be to pass the \n     appropriations bills and go home.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland who has \nbeen recognized for his work with the Budget Committee and the Joint \nEconomic Committee. He is a thoughtful analyst of our Nation's economy. \nI certainly agree with his conclusion.\n  I would like to make two points, though, that we have not raised so \nfar, to take a closer look at the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans.\n  The Citizens for Tax Justice have done an analysis of the House tax \ncut proposal, and they have found that 44 percent of all the benefits \nin that tax cut bill will go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. \nI am sure Mr. Gates, Mr. Trump, and all the others who have done so \nwell in this economy would love to see a tax cut. But I am not sure \nthey need a tax cut.\n  Take a look at this. Mr. President, 60 percent of the Republican tax \ncut would benefit the wealthiest 5 percent, three-quarters of it to the \nwealthiest 20 percent. Whom have they left behind? Working families--\nworking families who will see little or no tax relief as a result of \nthis Republican plan.\n  I think about Governor Ann Richards of Texas who used to make \ncomments\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\nabout the other party, the Grand Old Party, and say: They just can't \nhelp themselves. When it comes to tax cuts, they just can't stay away \nfrom giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America at the expense \nof working families, at the expense of Medicare, at the expense of \npaying down the national debt, and at the expense of our current \neconomic prosperity.\n  The Republican Party is adrift, searching for an issue. The one they \nthink they can coalesce behind is a tax cut, the one thing that brings \nevery wing of their party, from extreme right to right and everything \nbetween it, together. Yet every time they do it, it turns out they have \ntipped the scales so heavily to the rich that the American people say \nwe do not want any part of this. If this is just going to be a cheering \nsection of people from country clubs who think the tax cuts are really \ngoing to be something for the future, so be it, but it is not good \nenough for the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a very quick question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have to again say thank you to the Senator. I was \nlooking at some of the analysis of the Republican tax cut, the across-\nthe-board one. It said, if you earn about $300,000 a year, you would \nget a $20,000-a-year tax cut. I wonder if the Senator has thought about \nthis. The tax cut, therefore, for those folks who earn over $300,000, \nwould be almost twice as much money as a person working on the minimum \nwage earns, which is approximately $11,000, $12,000. Could my friend \njust talk about the unfairness of that situation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think it is fundamentally unfair. I \nagree with the Senator from California. Most people who are in these \nhigh-net-worth situations would not miss a decimal point in their net \nworth, but the Republican tax cut plan wants to give them more money. \nYet when we try to bring up an issue such as increasing the minimum \nwage from $5.15 an hour, the Republicans just will not accept that. So \nwe are going to have that fight later this year, I am sure, on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  That gives me an opportunity to summarize, if I may, my view of this \nCongress and the difference between the two parties. Take a look at the \nSenate over the last 2 months if you want to know the difference \nbetween this side of the aisle, the Democratic side, and the Republican \nside.\n\n  On the issue of gun control, sensible gun control, after the \nshootings in schools across America, the Democrats pushed a sensible \ngun control plan which attracted the support of six Republican \nSenators. I salute their courage for joining us, giving us finally \nenough votes, as a minority, to bring in Vice President Gore casting \nthe tie-breaking vote for sensible gun control--trigger locks for guns \nthat are safer for kids, trying to make sure people buying guns at gun \nshows are not criminals or children, trying to make sure we do not keep \nimporting these high-capacity ammunition clips of 240 rounds of \nammunition. Who needs that for hunting or safety in their homes?\n  We passed it, sent it over to the Republicans in the House, and they \njust beat it to pieces. There is nothing left. We have to get back and \npass sensible gun control--a clear difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  On the Patients' Bill of Rights, we on the Democratic side came in \nand said what is going on is scandalous; doctors should make decisions, \nnot insurance companies; and insurance companies should be held \naccountable when they make the wrong decision. The Democrats stood for \nthat position. The Republicans, with the exception of two Senators, \nopposed us. The difference between the Democrats and Republicans: We \nbelieve in the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Republicans oppose it.\n  When it comes to this issue, what a change of hats. The Democrats are \nin the role of fiscal conservatives. The Democrats are saying mind our \nown business when it comes to Social Security, the future of Medicare, \nand retiring the national debt; the Republican side says at least $1 \ntrillion in tax cuts the first 10 years, and then watch it explode in \nthe outyears.\n  For the American people following this debate in the Senate, they \nhave a choice. If you buy into the Republican philosophy of runaway tax \ncuts and irresponsible spending in the future, if you buy into the idea \nof standing up on the floor of the Senate for the health insurance \ncompanies and opposing the efforts of families and doctors and \nhospitals to bring some sanity back to health care, if you buy into the \nRepublican position supporting the National Rifle Association and the \ngun lobby, then that is your party, that is where you should turn, and \nbe proud of it.\n  But if you think there is a better choice, if you think coming \ntogether on a bipartisan basis for sensible gun control, for the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, and for a fiscally responsible approach to \nour budget in the future, I think that is the better way to go. That is \nthe clear choice, and politics is about choices.\n  I thank my colleagues from California and Maryland for joining me in \nthe morning business, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8906-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nis recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1260 to Amendment No. 1258\n\n   (Purpose: Relating to the field reporting relationships under the \n                    Agency for Nuclear Stewardship)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1260 to amendment No. 1258.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 213 of the Department of Energy Organization \n     Act, as proposed by subsection (c) of the amendment, at the \n     end of subsection (k), insert the following:\n       ``Such supervision and direction of any Director or \n     contract employee of a national security laboratory or of a \n     nuclear weapons production facility shall not interfere with \n     communication to the Department, the President, or Congress, \n     of technical findings or technical assessments derived from, \n     and in accord with, duly authorized activities. The Under \n     Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall have responsibility \n     and authority for, and may use, as appropriate field \n     structure for the programs and activities of the Agency.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and my cosponsors, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid.\n  The amendment does two things. The first sentence of the amendment \nsays:\n\n       Such supervision and direction of any Director or contract \n     employee of a national security laboratory or of a nuclear \n     weapons production facility shall not interfere with \n     communication to the Department, the President, or Congress, \n     of technical findings or technical assessments derived from, \n     and in accord with, duly authorized activities.\n\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\n\n  That sentence makes clear that communication which presently occurs \nis intended to continue. The clarification is necessary because in the \nunderlying amendment officers and employees of contractors, including \nthe Directors and employees of the three National Laboratories, are \nreferred to as ``personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship'' and \nall personnel of the Agency are subject to the supervision and \ndirection of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  We want to be sure if they have information of a technical nature or \nbased on their technical assessment that they believe should be \ndirectly communicated, that communication occur.\n  The Directors of the three nuclear weapons laboratories are \nresponsible for certifying the adequacy of the nuclear weapons \nstockpile. Their independence and the integrity of their judgments are \ncritical to the national security of the Nation. It is important that \nthe legislation recognize and protect that independence and integrity \nby ensuring that these lab Directors and employees can communicate \nthese technical findings and assessments to the Department, the \nPresident, and the Congress.\n  The second sentence of the amendment simply provides that the Under \nSecretary for Nuclear Stewardship may use field offices for the \nprograms and activities of the Agency. This is a departure from one of \nthe recommendations of the Rudman report. The Rudman report proposed \nstreamlining the reporting chain for the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship \nby cutting the ties between the weapons labs and the Department of \nEnergy field offices.\n  We had a hearing in the Energy Committee last week, and I asked Dr. \nVic Reis, who is the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense \nPrograms, whether he agreed with that Rudman report recommendation. He \nsaid he did not. He said we certainly need weapons ties in the field \noffice because ``we cannot run the operation entirely from \nWashington.''\n  All we are saying is the Secretary has authority to use the field \noffices in an appropriate fashion--we are not dictating how but in an \nappropriate fashion to carry out the policies of the Department.\n  As I understand what Dr. Reis was saying, the important point is to \nclarify the lines of authority between the Agency for Nuclear \nStewardship and the labs. The underlying amendment does that. But he \nsaid the new Under Secretary will still need field offices to help them \noversee and run the complex of weapons laboratories and production \nfacilities, and this gives the Under Secretary that option.\n  I believe this amendment is straightforward. My colleague on the \nRepublican side, Senator Domenici, is the prime cosponsor of this \namendment. I hope it is acceptable. I believe it is acceptable to all \nSenators, and I hope the Senate will adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly agree we ought to adopt \nthe amendment. I will speak for one moment on it. I will not address \nthe first portion of it, wherein the amendment discusses the \nresponsibility that rests with reference to making sure that \nappropriate communications occur rather than be stymied by the new \nAgency. I think that is good language. I do not know that we would have \nhad anything different than that in the underlying bill, but this \nclarifies it. I am pleased to be part of that.\n\n  With reference to the second part of the amendment, the Department of \nEnergy has been operating with field offices--some of them very \nsuccessful, some of them not so successful. There has even been a \nclamor over the past 5 or 6 years to create more of them rather than \nfewer of them. In fact, there have been proposals to create more field \noffices that this Senator personally has had to confront in the \nappropriations bill.\n  What this says is that rather than being silent in the bill with \nreference to the Rudman recommendation regarding field offices, this \nsays the Deputy Secretary may use an appropriate field structure for \nprograms and activities of the agency. I think that is good. It gives \nthem the options and it gives them all they need for good management. \nWhat we are talking about is good management--field offices versus the \nnational office.\n  So I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment. We have no objection on \nour side. I urge the chairman and cochairman of the Intel Committee to \nconcur in our recommendations.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Bingaman for offering \nthis amendment. I believe it is constructive in nature. It is something \nwe believe will, at the end of the day, clarify what we are trying to \ndo. That is what this legislation is all about--to restructure the \nlabs, making it harder for espionage to go on at the labs. So it is a \ngood amendment. I urge that at the proper time we adopt it.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I also believe this is a good amendment. I \nam going to accept it. I think it is a sign that Senators on both sides \nof the aisle understand that we have an opportunity to do something \nthat is long overdue, but that there is a reason in the past this has \nnot been done; that is to say, restructuring the agency to increase the \naccountability for the work that is being done on nuclear weapons, both \nto make certain we preserve sound science at its best and security at \nits best.\n  I fervently hope we continue in this spirit, because if we do, we \nwill produce a bill with a big vote, and we will be able to conference \nit, be able to change the law, and enact good reform that will keep the \nUnited States of America and our people safe.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It has been a pleasure working with Senator Bingaman on \nthis and on some other amendments. I say to the two floor managers, it \nis my hope we can take the four or five remaining issues and see if we \ncan't get one amendment put together to see if we can resolve them. We \nshould have an answer to that for the floor managers within the next \nhalf hour, 45 minutes.\n  Having said that, let me talk about the field offices for a moment. I \nhave also been a proponent of the belief that if you can do some of the \nbusiness of government down close to where the problems are, you are \nbetter off. I believe that such is the case with field offices. If \nproperly run, under the appropriate accountability rules, wherein \neverybody knows who is accountable for what, I believe they can be very \nhelpful.\n  Because I believe that, I think this amendment gives the option to \nretain them in a manner that will be helpful to the new Under Secretary \nas he puts together the semiautonomous entity.\n  I think much of the activity in field offices has been good. The fact \nthe entire Department has made it very difficult to run the nuclear \nweapons part may be some of the reason the Rudman board was not \nthinking of field offices in a very good light. I believe it is \nimperative we look at it that way--in a good light. We have not told \nthem how to use them. We have not told them what kind of role they \nplay. We have said they may be used for programs and activities of the \nagency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the most important contributions to \nour national security is the annual stockpile report to the President \nand the Congress in which the safety, security, and reliability of the \nstockpile is assessed.\n  A very important piece of that report is an assessment by the \nDirectors of the national security laboratories regarding the results \nof their technical investigations.\n  That assessment by the lab Directors combines scientific and \nengineering findings with expert professional judgment to form an \nindependent evaluation of the quality and character of the weapon \ndesigns that make up our nuclear stockpile.\n  The scientific and engineering findings are derived from data \ndeveloped at Pantex, at Oak Ridge's Y-12 plant, at the Kansas City \nPlant, at the Nevada Test Site, and at the national security labs, \nSandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore.\n  Experts from all of these sites combine their efforts to review and \nvalidate this information upon which the\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\neffectiveness of our stockpile is determined.\n  More experts are convened to consider the ramifications of findings \nand the whole effort is finally integrated into a certification of the \nreliability, the safety, and the security of the stockpile.\n  It is absolutely essential that this effort be free of political or \nbureaucratic interference.\n  Scientists, engineers, and technicians at these national security \nfacilities are hired for their expertise and diligence.\n  They are the only experts who know the significance of their findings \nand they should remain absolutely unimpeded in exercising their \nprofessional skills and judgment.\n  At the same time, the lab Directors earn their positions of trust and \nresponsibility by a lifetime of outstanding technical accomplishments, \ndemonstrated skill at integrating large complex bodies of information, \nand consummate integrity in reporting their conclusions.\n  They, too, should remain absolutely unimpeded in the performance of \ntheir stockpile certification responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, in matters as important as certification of our \nstockpile, the possibility of interference, or even just the appearance \nof the possibility of interference, can affect the exercise of skills \nand professional judgment.\n  These professionals should retain their independence from \nbureaucratic or political interference.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment takes a step that will destroy that \nindependence by asserting that these civilian contractor employees \n``shall be responsible to, and subject to the supervision and direction \nof, the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship or \nhis designee.''\n  So now there are at least three Federal officers, necessarily \npoliticized by their positions, and undoubtedly bureaucratic in their \norigins, who can direct these professionals in any or all aspects of \ntheir work.\n  That is not an environment that promises assessments that are \nindependent of political or bureaucratic interference.\n  Mr. President, the labs and production facilities should not be \nindependent of Federal direction, but that direction must not be \nallowed to dictate technical findings or their interpretation.\n  My concerns in this regard could be adequately addressed by adding to \nthe appropriate section the following clarification:\n\n       Such supervision or direction of any Director or contract \n     employee of a national security laboratory or of a nuclear \n     weapons production facility shall not interfere with \n     communication to the Department, to the President, or to the \n     Congress, of technical findings or technical assessments \n     derived from, and in accord with, duly authorized activities.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1260) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. Res. \n158 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to return to the business of \ntoday, the Intelligence Committee authorization bill and the underlying \nKyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to that authorization bill which \nprovides for the reorganization of the Department of Energy with a \nsemiautonomous agency responsible for our nuclear weapons programs. \nThat is the business of the Senate since this time yesterday.\n  Americans who are watching the activities of the Senate might be a \nlittle confused. I would like to try to straighten out some of the \nconfusion. I challenge my colleagues who have a different point of view \nto express that if, in fact, they care to do so.\n  We are well aware, over the last several years now, of espionage that \nhas been occurring within our nuclear laboratories and other facilities \nin this country which has resulted in a significant number of very \nimportant secrets of this country being obtained by others who should \nnot have them, including, we believe, the Government of China. This is \nnot minor. The secrets that have been obtained, we believe, from our \nnuclear laboratories include the information necessary to build the \nmost sophisticated weapons ever designed by man. They include \nthe designs for the most sophisticated weapons in our arsenal--the \nseven or eight nuclear warheads the United States now has on our \nexisting weapons, as well as designs for a weapon that we never \nproduced but which we understand because the Chinese have now said they \nhave; the so-called neutron bomb that they have developed; as well as \nsome other technology dealing with radar, for example, that can detect \nour submarines under the sea.\n\n  These are the most sophisticated technological developments of our \ncountry in recent years. Design information about these weapons has \nbeen obtained by others. So, naturally, one of the questions is: How \ndid it happen, and how can we prevent it from happening in the future?\n  We don't know the answer to the question of how it happened exactly, \nbecause people involved in espionage don't come forward and say to you, \nwell, here is what I did. But piecing the information together, we have \nconcluded that it is likely that information was obtained from our \nnuclear weapons laboratories, and this information got into the wrong \nhands.\n  So part of the question of how to prevent this in the future is: What \ndo we need to do, if anything, to ensure security at our nuclear \nlaboratories?\n  Now, it turns out that over the years there have been numerous \nGeneral Accounting Office studies, studies by other independent groups, \nand even studies of the Department of Energy itself, which has \njurisdiction over these National Laboratories, which have highlighted \nthe ongoing problems and have suggested that there have to be changes \nmade in the organizational structure of the DOE if we are ever to stop \nthis espionage.\n  Most recently, the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard, chaired by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued a scathing \nreport and made some very important recommendations about the \nreorganization of the Department of Energy. In this report, in effect, \nthe Rudman panel said to the President that the Department of Energy \nwill tell you that it can reorganize itself. It can't. It is the \nproblem.\n  Many of the bureaucrats within the Department don't want to \nreorganize in a way that will solve these problems. They want to \nprotect their turf. Therefore, it is going to have to be up to Congress \nto pass a new statute that literally reorganizes the Department of \nEnergy to get this done.\n  Now, interestingly, just before that Presidential advisory panel made \nits recommendations, Senator Domenici of New Mexico, in whose State two \nof the three primary weapons labs are located, had come to the same \nconclusion, based upon a lot of these previous reports that I talked \nabout, and had actually developed an idea of how to reorganize the \nDepartment of Energy to provide for greater accountability and \nresponsibility. He discussed those ideas with me and with Senator \nMurkowski, chairman of the Energy Committee. The three of us decided to \nintroduce\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\nlegislation, which we attempted to attach to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill back in May, to accomplish this exact result.\n  At that time, for a variety of reasons, the leadership, including \nSenator Warner and others, said: Don't attach that to this bill, do it \nlater with the intelligence authorization bill--which we now have \nbefore us. For one thing, no hearings have been held, and we need time \nto work out the specific language.\n  So Senators Domenici and Murkowski and I agreed to do that back in \nMay. Since then, there have been, I believe, six different hearings by \nfour different committees specifically on this legislation. Senator \nRudman has testified, as has Secretary Richardson, and many others, \nabout this specific legislation.\n  Since the time of our initial introduction of the amendment, the \nRudman panel made its recommendations. It was so close to what Senator \nDomenici and the rest of us had originally proposed that we conformed \nour legislation to that recommendation so that we were in effect asking \nthe Department to be reorganized exactly along the lines recommended by \nthe President's own advisory panel. That was back in May.\n  A lot of time has now elapsed, obviously--almost 2 months--while we \nhave been going over this. We have been meeting with Secretary \nRichardson. We have been talking to each other trying to come up with \nsome compromise language where we thought it was appropriate.\n  But in the meantime, we have the question of whether our secrets are \nbeing protected at our National Laboratories. The Rudman report, and \nSenator Rudman's testimony before at least one of these committees in \nthe interim, made it clear that we had not solved the problem. The Cox \nreport made the point that espionage was still continuing. The Rudman \nreport specifically said the recommendations of the Secretary of Energy \nand the implementation of what he was doing was in effect too little \ntoo late; it was not solving the problem; it didn't go far enough; and \nwe had to get on with the urgent business of solving this problem.\n  The reason I point this out is that we agreed to delay even though \nthat delay poses a risk to the people of the United States of America; \nthat more secrets will fly out the window before we get this thing \nresolved. But we agreed to hold the hearings and to try to get the \nacquiescence of the Secretary of Energy.\n  He has now finally agreed with the proposition that was recommended \nto the President's advisory panel that we need a semiautonomous agency.\n  We are now arguing about a lot of the details. But in this matter the \ndetails matter. The details matter because it is possible for the \nbureaucrats within the Department of Energy to scuttle the reform if \nthey can take enough pieces of it out and create the same kind of \nburdensome, multimanagement kind of structure that exists today which \nthe Rudman report criticized as being so ineffective.\n  We fear that is what some of the amendments which will be proposed \nwill do.\n  We have been trying over the last 48 hours literally to bring this \nbill before the Senate. We had to actually invoke cloture in order to \nbegin debating the intelligence authorization bill. Democrats objected \nto the consideration of the intelligence authorization bill.\n  What does that mean? Without an intelligence authorization bill, the \nprograms for fiscal year 2000 in our intelligence community cannot go \nforward.\n  Why would people object to even considering the bill, not voting on \nit, but even bringing it up when these kinds of threats to our national \nsecurity exist? Why would they object to the consideration of the \namendment for the reorganization of the Department of Energy along the \nlines recommended by the President's own panel of advisers, the concept \nof which has been signed off by his Secretary of Energy?\n  Why would we have this delay? Why now for the last 48 hours have the \npeople who want to amend our proposal not come forward to present this \namendment so we can get on with this?\n  We have had this bill pending for 24 hours. People watching might \nsay: Why have we heard speeches about everything under the Sun except \nthe Department of Energy reorganization?\n\n  The answer is because people who object to our proposal have not come \nto the floor and have not been willing to offer their own amendments.\n  Senator Domenici has been laboring mightily in the back rooms trying \nto work out some language differences. We have been willing to meet \nothers more than halfway in trying to resolve differences that we could \nresolve. We have agreed to accept a couple of amendments and make some \nmodifications to language so we can work together in a bipartisan \nfashion. But I have yet to hear anybody say, who has proposed \namendments that we have accepted, that they will agree with and support \nthe legislation at the end of the day, even if we accept what they have \noffered.\n  I am not going to suggest a lack of good faith. But there is a matter \nof national security involved. Time is wasting.\n  I see nobody on the floor willing to debate with us or tell us where \nthey think we are wrong or to offer amendments to what we are trying to \npropose.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, unless they come down and do that, we \nare stuck.\n  We don't want to spend all of the time just reiterating what Senators \nDomenici, Murkowski, Thompson, Bunning, and myself and others have \nalready said on the floor. We could keep talking about this.\n  I sometimes wonder what the American people think. They hear there is \na crisis with intelligence. They hear there is a problem with these \nNational Laboratories. They hear there is a suggestion to fix it made \nto the President by his own advisory board, and we have amendments to \nimplement those recommendations. Yet nothing happens. In fact, people \nactually object to bringing up the bill that would begin to fix the \nproblem.\n  When we finally bring it up because we invoked cloture, we actually \nmade them vote on that--they all agreed to bring it up at that point--\nand nobody comes down to offer amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues, even those who disagree with us, to come to the \nfloor. Let's debate this. If you think you have a legitimate point of \nview, let's talk it out. Reasonable people can differ about these \nthings. If you have an amendment, bring it to the floor so we can \ndebate and vote on it.\n  But, sooner or later, the American people are going to reach a \nconclusion, which is that this matter is being delayed.\n  I find it unconscionable that anybody would delay efforts to secure \nthe Nation's most important secrets and to delay our efforts to ensure \nthe security of our National Laboratories. That is what we are all \nabout here.\n  I just hope that sooner rather than later people will be willing to \ncome down and work with us to bring this bill to a conclusion so that \nwe can get on with the important business of this country in protecting \nour national security.\n  I see Senator Domenici is on the floor. I know he has been working \nmightily to try to work out some language. I think it would be \nappropriate now to call upon him for a report on the success of his \nefforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me, first of all, congratulate and \nthank Senator Kyl.\n  There have been many Senators involved, including the occupant of the \nChair, who have serious concerns about the issue. But I believe we have \na great threesome who worked together fundamentally from the beginning. \nSenator Kyl was more than willing right up front when the idea evolved. \nWhen we said let's work on it, he was most willing to take the lead, \nand, frankly, knows a lot about nuclear weapons, the safety, and the \nwell-being of them. He knows a lot about the so-called science-based \nstockpile stewardship. He has not been an advocate of doing anything \nwith reference to nuclear weapons that would diminish in any way \nAmerica's great strength in that regard. I commend him and thank him \nfor it.\n  I want to comment for just about 3 minutes on the issue that he \nraised.\n  There have been contentions that the Department of Energy is moving \nin the right direction. In fact, I think the\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\nSecretary misspoke once when he said to the Congress and to the people \nwe have taken care of the security problems. That is not a quote. It is \njust a general notion of what he said.\n  I noted over the weekend that the new four-star general, retired, has \nbeen put in charge of security and counterintelligence. They called him \nthe czar. I note that he has indicated he is a year away from getting \nwhat he thinks is necessary under this dysfunctional department to be \nable to say we are taking care of the security issues in the best \npossible way.\n  Why wouldn't we hurry up and reorganize? Instead of that czar \nspending all of his time trying to get a structure set up under the old \nsystem--which everybody says isn't going to work, and which says, Good \nluck, general, but when you are finished with all of that, it isn't \ngoing to work--we ought to get this reorganization in the hands of that \nDepartment, in the hands of the President of the United States, and \nsay, Let's get on with trying to implement.\n  I submit that it is going to be hard to implement.\n  There are many ties that are going to have to be broken. There are \nmany parts of the Energy Department that are going to go down swinging \nin terms of them having little or nothing to say anymore about the \nnuclear weapons aspect of this. They all have parts in it. It has made \nit such a bureaucratic mess that even as I look at amendments that want \nto ease up a little on the semiautonomous nature, my mind immediately \ngoes back to, well, if we open the door a little bit, we are just going \nto end up in 10 or 5 years right back where we are.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands that we want to keep it \nsemiautonomous where the Secretary is ultimately engaged, but within \nthat is something similar to the FAA that is doing its own work on \nnuclear weapons. I think we are close.\n  However, I suggest to those Senators who want to discuss amendments \nor who contemplate offering amendments, including the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Carl Levin, that we hear from him \nsoon as to what he wants to do. We have a proposal we are discussing \nabout going somewhat in his direction but not totally.\n  I am trying to see if we can minimize amendments and get this done \nquickly. If not, I think we will just start voting. Some don't want to \ndo that. I think we will have to do that within the next hour or so if \nwe can't put things together. Then I will have a couple amendments, if \nthat is the case. I think they are more acceptable than what I \nunderstand others are going to offer. We will get those debated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8910-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8910-S8911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the floor of the Senate today, \nyesterday in a press conference at the White House, today in a press \nconference, and this afternoon, the President of the United States will \nend about 48 hours of White House attack on tax cut proposals that \nRepublicans have put forth. We are very grateful, however, that some \nDemocrats are now espousing the same --in particular, in the Senate. \nThe whole idea of the attack is, we don't have enough surplus to give \nthe American people a tax break.\n  I hope the American people understand the contentions made by the \nPresident, by the Secretary of the Treasury, by those on the floor \ntoday from the other side who debated it. I hope they understand that \nthis is an attack that should be called ``anything but taxes.'' That is \nthe philosophy of those who are attacking what we are trying to do--\nanything but taxes.\n  For those who think we don't have enough resources, I will take some \ntime today, both on the floor and in other places here at the Capitol, \nto explain that, indeed, it is a prudent plan. Indeed, there are \nsufficient resources, and there are sufficient resources in the \nbroadest sense, to take care of our commitment to Social Security. We \nhave done that. We want a lockbox, and we can't get it passed in this \nSenate. There is ample money for reform of the Medicare system to \ninclude prescription drugs.\n  We will also today let the American people know that the \nCongressional Budget Office believes the President's prescription drugs \nare not going to cost only $48 billion in new money; their estimate is \nthey could cost $118 billion--a very important difference, more than \ndouble the amount. The point of all this is the contention that we \ncan't take care of the rest of government if we have a tax cut.\n  I will just use a round number here. My recollection is that the \nsurplus is $3.9 trillion--people can't even fathom $3.9 trillion--over \nthe next decade. To put it in perspective, the entire budget of the \nUnited States on an annual basis, including Social Security payments, \nMedicare payments, all of the appropriated accounts, is about $1.8 to \n$1.9 trillion. Almost twice the total expenditures of the Federal \nGovernment in a given year is the surplus accumulating, according to \nthe best estimators and best economists we can put on this issue--\nexperts at both the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  I quickly penned some figures. If we have $3.9 trillion in surplus \nand we want a tax cut over a 10-year period of $782 billion, that is 20 \npercent of the surplus that would be given back to the American people \nby way of tax cuts and tax changes. That will make for better economic \nsense in the future.\n  That is a rough number. That is a gross number. However, it puts it \nin perspective. We ask the question, Where is the rest of it going? We \nwill share in detail what we say it is going for and what the \nCongressional Budget Office says the President's budget is going to be \nused for. It will be an interesting comparison.\n  For those on the other side and those in the White House--including \nthe Secretary of the Treasury--who think they will have free rein \nmaking their case, which in my opinion is extremely partisan, it is \nDemocrats in the White House, including the Secretary of the Treasury, \nwho are saying, ``We are not for tax cuts,'' and making every kind of \nexcuse in the world to avoid it.\n\n  We will make sure that our side of this is understood. We believe if \nwe don't have a significant tax cut adopted now for the next decade, \nall that surplus will be spent. We can already see it in plans coming \nfrom the White House. We can already see it in the current budget of \nthe President extended over a decade as estimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  I thank the Senate for giving me a little bit of time this morning. I \nclearly did not today present our case in its totality. I want \neverybody to know there is another side to the partisan antitax fever \nthat will be coming out of the White House the next couple of weeks. \nThat is what it is. It is a ferocious attack on anyone who wants to \ngive back taxes to the American people, using all kinds of arguments, \neven if they are totally partisan, one-sided exaggerations.\n  We won't get as much news because the President's press conference \nwill be heralded everywhere. Before we are finished, we will have a few \nspokesmen tell the American people what this is about. I wish we had an \nopportunity to present what we are going to present today to the House. \nI wish we could do it in a joint meeting to the public. The concern \nthat there is not enough money for discretionary appropriations in \ndefense is wrong. The notion that there is not enough money for \nMedicare--be it the President's $48 billion or the $118 billion that \nthe CBO says a plan such as the President's would cost--is not so.\n  In these 5 minutes, that is the best I can do. I don't have charts. \nThey prepared their charts for use today and hereafter. We will use \nthem. Frankly, attacks on the budget resolution by the White House \nshould get thrown in the wastebasket. If Members want to attack a \nbudget, attack the President's budget and see what he did with all this \nsurplus. See what the Congressional Budget Office says he will do with \nall this surplus. We know what we will do. We will lock up $1.9 \ntrillion for Social Security. That leaves a very large amount for \ndefense, education, and other areas--indeed, a very significant amount \nfor Medicare, if we choose to reform it, and a tax cut about the size \nproposed in the budget resolution approved here.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

One of them has already been accepted, as I understand, in \nmodified form. It is now my understanding that the managers would just \nas soon proceed to my amendment while they are trying to work out \nSenator Bingaman's second amendment. That is fine with me.\n  Mr. KYL. Fine.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1261 To Amendment No. 1258\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is not often an amendment is read in its \nentirety around here, even a short one. Usually we ask unanimous \nconsent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with. I do \nnot know how many times I have used those words on this floor in the \nlast 20 years. But in this case I decided to have this amendment--it is \nfairly short--read in its entirety because it may sound familiar to \nsome people.\n  These are Senator Rudman's words. This amendment incorporates some \nvery important parts of Senator Rudman's panel's recommendation that \nare left out of the pending amendment. That is why I wanted the entire \namendment read.\n  The sponsors of this amendment have correctly pointed out that \nSenator Rudman is recommending a semiautonomous agency, and that is the \nheart of Senator Rudman's proposal. It happens to be a proposal that I \nsupport. But the difference between my position and the sponsor's \nposition, relative to Senator Rudman's recommendations, is that their \namendment leaves out some very critical recommendations of the Rudman \npanel relative to the operation of the Department of Energy.\n  My amendment would insert in the pending amendment some very \nimportant recommendations of the Rudman panel the pending amendment \nomits.\n  We have heard a lot relative to the importance of the Rudman panel \nrecommendations. Senator Rudman and his panel performed an extremely \nimportant service to this Nation in pointing out the complicated \nbureaucratic maze that exists at the Department of Energy and pointing \nout that for 20 years, report after report, recommendation after \nrecommendation to streamline the bureaucracy the Department of Energy \nhave been made, including made to the Congress, without action being \ntaken by the Congress.\n  All of us bear responsibility for that failure. Three administrations \nand 20 years of Congresses have been told in a number of reports there \nshould be some reorganization done at the Department of Energy\n  Finally, a year and a half ago, President Clinton issued a \nPresidential directive that reorganizes the Department of Energy. That \ndirective has been mainly implemented, not yet fully apparently but \nmainly implemented. The Rudman panel goes beyond that Presidential \ndirective but does give credit to President Clinton for being the first \nPresident in 20 years to direct the reorganization of the Department of \nEnergy, even though three Presidents have been told there is \nsignificant organizational problems, and even though as early as 1990 \nthere was a public statement about espionage being carried out by the \nPeople's Republic of China at one of these labs.\n  Secretary Richardson is engaged in significant reorganization of this \nagency, and the Rudman panel gave credit to Secretary Richardson for \nbeginning the important reorganizational changes.\n\n  This Congress has taken some steps to reorganize the Department of \nEnergy. The Armed Services Committee, for instance, upon which our \nPresiding Officer sits with distinction, has acted on our bill, which \nis now in conference, to carry out some significant reorganization of \nthe Department of Energy.\n  On the House side, the Armed Services Committee did the same thing. \nThe language is different. Parts of their provision differ from ours. \nBut the point is, there are some very important things going on in \nterms of reorganization in the Department of Energy, as we speak. But \nthe Rudman panel goes beyond that. It would put into law, for instance, \nthings which are in an Executive order. We know how much more important \na law is than an Executive order because an Executive order, No. 1, can \nbe changed by the next President but, No. 2, can be too often ignored \nby the bureaucracy. We had a recent example of that in another agency \nwhere an agency just almost totally ignored an Executive order.\n  We want to put into law a significant reorganization, and we want \nto--at least I do, and I think most of my colleagues want to--put into \nlaw a reorganization along the lines of the Rudman panel \nrecommendation. I do not know that there is any disagreement on that, \nbut apparently there is a disagreement when it comes to setting forth \nnot just the provisions of the Rudman panel's recommendations relative \nto the power of this new semiautonomous agency, but when it comes to \nsetting forth the power of the Secretary of Energy relative to \ndirecting and controlling his Department.\n  What is left out in this amendment is also important, according to \nthe Rudman panel. This is not the Senator from Michigan talking; this \namendment is the Rudman panel talking. I will go into what these \nprovisions are in just one moment.\n  I emphasize, the security breakdown that has existed for 20 years \nthat was highlighted in the Cox commission report must be corrected. \nThere are a number of steps underway to correct them, but we should \nact. There have been some pretty important, good-faith discussions \ngoing on over the last few days as to how we might be able to come up \nwith a bill which can become law.\n  We can pass a bill, and if the House does not accept the bill because \nthey think it ought to be a freestanding bill and not on an \nintelligence authorization bill, or because they do not think it ought \nto be on a Department of Defense authorization bill--and that is their \nposition in conference relative to the defense authorization bill--we \ncan attach language here. But if we do not have a strong, healthy \nconsensus, it seems to me we are in a much weaker position in getting \nthis law actually\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\npassed in the House and signed by the President. That should be our \ngoal.\n  If we are serious about trying to tighten up and streamline the \nDepartment of Energy, if we are serious about passing a law to do that, \nthen we ought to figure out a way we can come together, incorporate the \nRudman panel recommendations, including the ones which are left out in \nthis amendment which I will try to add in a moment, so we can go to the \nHouse of Representatives with a healthy consensus vote, a strong vote, \nrather than a divided vote, and the same message would then be \ndelivered to the President.\n  The Rudman report calls for a semiautonomous Agency for Nuclear \nStewardship. I fully support that. That would be an agency which will \noversee all nuclear-related matters in the Department of Energy, \nincluding defense programs and nuclear nonproliferation. It would also \noversee all functions of the national security labs and the weapons \nproduction facilities. I strongly support that. It would streamline the \nnew Agency's management structure by abolishing ties between the \nweapons labs and all DOE regional field and site offices and all \ncontractor intermediaries. It would appoint the Director of the new \nAgency by the President with Senate confirmation, and it would have \neffective administration of safeguard security and counterintelligence \nat all the weapons labs and plants by creating a coherent security \ncounterintelligence structure within the new Agency.\n\n  In making the recommendation for a semiautonomous agency, the Rudman \nreport cites as models similar agencies within the Department of \nDefense, such as the National Security Agency, NSA, the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, and the National \nReconnaissance Office, the NRO.\n  Each of these three agencies is a separately organized agency run by \nan administrator within the Department of Defense. While the mission of \neach is different from the other, all three are under the authority, \ndirection, and control of the Secretary of Defense; all three are \nsubject to Department of Defense policies and regulations; and all \nthree are directed by the Secretary and his deputy through an \nassistant.\n  That is the model Senator Rudman has based his recommendation on--\nthree agencies in the Department of Defense, separately organized, each \nhaving their own staff, but where the Secretary and the Deputy \nSecretary direct that separately organized agency through an assistant.\n  That is a very important part of that model which is omitted in this \nbill. So Senator Rudman and his panel, on June 30, sent a ``Memorandum \nof Clarification'' relative to their report. One of those \nrecommendations in the statement is the following: ``The Secretary is \nstill responsible,'' under their model, ``for developing and \npromulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters,'' these matters being \nsecurity, intelligence, and counterintelligence, ``and it makes sense \nto us,'' that is, the Rudman panel, ``that a Secretary would want \nadvisers on his/her immediate staff to assist in that vein.''\n  So the first sentence of our amendment says:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for developing and \n     promulgating all Departmental-wide security, \n     counterintelligence and intelligence policies, and may use \n     his immediate staff to assist him in developing and \n     promulgating such policies.\n\n  It is verbatim from Senator Rudman's panel's recommendation.\n  Senator Rudman's panel also says: ``. . . The Agency Director,'' that \nis the new Agency, ``. . . is responsible and held accountable for \nensuring complete and faithful implementation of the Secretary's \nsecurity, counterintelligence and intelligence policies within the new \nAgency.''\n  The second sentence of our amendment reads:\n\n       The Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is \n     responsible for implementation of the Secretary's \n     security, counterintelligence, and intelligence policies \n     within the New Agency.\n  Again, it is verbatim from the Rudman panel's memorandum of June 30.\n  The Rudman panel also said on that day that ``The Director of the \nAgency,'' that is, the new Agency ``may establish agency-specific \npolicies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental \npolicies established by the Secretary.''\n  The third line in our amendment says:\n\n       The Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific \n     policies so long as they are fully consistent with the \n     departmental policies established by the Secretary.\n\n  It is verbatim from the Rudman panel recommendation.\n  I do not think we can have it both ways. The Rudman panel's \nrecommendations are very important. We are not obligated to adopt every \none. We are not obligated to adopt any of them. But there are some of \nus who believe those recommendations are hugely important. As always is \nthe case when you create a new agency within a Department, you have to \nfigure out a balance between the power of the new Agency and the power \nof the Secretary to run his Department that contains that new Agency.\n  That is a very important balance. We are doing it on the Senate \nfloor. Usually that kind of a complex and rather arcane effort would be \nmade by the Governmental Affairs Committee, but in this case, for many \nreasons, legitimate reasons, it comes to us in this form, and we must \ndeal with it.\n  But in dealing with these issues, as to that balance, we have \nguidance. We have guidance from the Rudman panel. The Rudman panel \nsays: Create a semiautonomous agency. It then goes into detail on the \nfunctions of that semiautonomous agency and the power both of its \ndirector and the Secretary of Energy. It sets them out. It lays this \nout for us.\n  The amendment before us omits some critically important \nrecommendations of the Rudman panel, the ones I have just read and the \nones that are in my amendment. It is that omission which, it seems to \nme, so flaws, and unnecessarily flaws, may I say, the amendment before \nus.\n  I do not quite fathom why it is that specific recommendations of the \nRudman panel, relative to what the balance and the relationship are, \nshould be omitted when they are important.\n  The sponsors of the amendment will no doubt say that the Secretary \nreserves the right in their amendment to direct and control the \nDepartment, and that is true. But when it comes down to putting any \nflesh on those bones, when it comes down to saying how the Secretary \nwill do that--that he is able, for instance, to use his staff to \npromulgate policies, that the agency must comply with the Department's \npolicies that apply departmentwide--when it comes to those things, then \nwe have a problem with this amendment.\n  This amendment actually suggests the opposite is true from what \nRudman has suggested when it says that ``The Secretary may not delegate \nto any Department official the duty to supervise or direct'' but leaves \nout the critically important power that Rudman would give the Secretary \nto utilize his staff to assist him in developing and promulgating \ndepartmentwide policies.\n  So we correct this omission. The spirit of Rudman is that there be a \nsemiautonomous agency when it comes to spelling out how that agency \nwould function, what the balance of powers and functions would be \nbetween the Secretary of the Department, of which this agency is a \npart, and the new Agency Director. It is at that point that we have the \nomissions that Rudman recommends and the omissions in this pending \namendment which my amendment would fill in.\n\n  Mr. President, I inquire how much time this Senator has left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Michigan has 10 \nminutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have 30 minutes on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes exactly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, Senator \nFitzgerald, had asked, before we knew the Senator was coming up, \nwhether he could come to the floor and speak for 5 minutes. He got \nhere, but the Senator had started so he was cut out for an hour. I \nwonder if we could have consent for the Senator to speak for 5 minutes \nand it not be counted against either side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair. To the Senator from Michigan, I \nthank him for allowing me to speak on Senator Kyl's underlying \namendment.\n  The recent release of the Cox report and the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board's report has confirmed our worst fears that \nlax security at our national laboratories enabled the Chinese to steal \nsome of our nation's most guarded nuclear secrets. This appears to be \namong the most severe breaches of American security in our Nation's \nhistory. This issue is of particular concern to my state, Illinois, as \nwe are the home of three labs--Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi \nNational Accelerator Laboratory, and the New Brunswick National \nLaboratory.\n  But despite years of warnings, beginning with a detailed briefing by \nthe Department of Energy on the issue, the administration did next to \nnothing to close the breach in security at our national labs, and did \nnext to nothing to keep suspected scientists away from classified \ninformation. Instead, the administration soft-pedaled the issue, \nencouraged the transfer of technology to China, and even denied that \nany secrets were lost to China during this administration. The \nadministration's response to report after report of security threats to \nour labs has been, ``See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.'' In \nfact, the administration sought to undermine the truth and accuracy of \nreports of these security breaches. And when the disastrous \nconsequences of this policy of denial and inaction were exposed, the \nadministration played a half-hearted game of catch-up that continues to \nthis day.\n  The report issued by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard presents a scathing and highly critical account of DOE's handling \nof, and response to, the threat posed to weapons labs by Chinese \nespionage. The report characterizes DOE as having a ``dysfunctional \nmanagement structure and culture,'' unable to respond to the unique \nchallenge posed by China. Unfortunately, DOE is in the words of the \nreport a `dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of \nreforming itself''\n  In the coming years, the United States may pay a terrible price for \nthis dereliction of duty. China is likely to make a great leap forward \nin its ability to threaten the United States with nuclear attack, \nthanks to stolen American nuclear weapon and missile technology. In \nfact, China now admits that it has neutron bomb technology. A well-\nknown proliferator, China may sell or give this advanced technology to \nIran or Pakistan, further increasing the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the missiles to deliver them.\n  For our part we, as Senators, must undertake the task of repairing \nthe system that allowed this information to fall into the hands of \nChina. To this end a number of my colleagues and I have co-sponsored an \namendment to the intelligence authorization bill initially offered by \nSenators Kyl, Domenici, and Chairman Murkowski. This amendment would \ncreate a semi-autonomous agency within DOE responsible for the nuclear \nweapons laboratories and their security. I ask for and encourage \nSenators to join me and the other cosponsors in supporting this \nmeasure. I welcome Secretary Richardson's change of mind on this issue. \nAlthough he was initially opposed to such an agency, the Secretary has \njoined the bipartisan group of Senators in supporting the concept of a \nsemi-autonomous agency for nuclear stewardship.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join us in passing this legislation \nand implementing this important step in sealing the breach in security \nat our Nation's weapons labs.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take the first few minutes and reply \nto Senator Levin's amendment, and then Senator Domenici will add his \nthoughts.\n  I first note that this language was handed to us as this debate \nbegan, and so it has been a little difficult to correlate the \nprovisions of this amendment with the provisions of our bill and with \nthe recommendations of the Rudman report. I think it is fair to say the \nfollowing four things about this amendment.\n  First of all, it is not necessary. I haven't really heard any \nexplanation of why we need this different language. I believe that our \nbill, which tracks the report of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, allows the Secretary of Energy to create policies that \nare applicable to the entire department and that the implementation of \nsecurity and counterintelligence within this new Agency is the \nresponsibility of the new Under Secretary that is responsible for \nnuclear stewardship, but that the Secretary of Energy will always have \nthe ultimate say with respect to those security and counterintelligence \npolicies. That is what our bill calls for. That is what the Rudman \nreport recommends should be done. I don't see any need for this \ndifferent way of saying it.\n  There are also at least two problems with the language itself. I am a \nlittle concerned because Senator Levin scores a debater point by saying \none of the sentences of his three-sentence amendment comes right out of \na letter that Senator Rudman wrote to us. It is not the Rudman report, \nbut it is a letter that he sent to us. Since we have been saying that \nour legislation tracks the Rudman recommendation, therefore, we have to \naccept that sentence.\n  That is, of course, a dual standard. Senator Levin is perfectly \nwilling to reject parts of the PFIAB report. Under his analysis, then \nhe should accept everything the Rudman report recommends as well.\n  The truth of the matter is, we have tried to track it as closely as \npossible, and I think we have done a good job. We haven't included the \nsentence from the letter that Senator Rudman wrote. It is not \nnecessary.\n  I think there is a dual standard being applied here. I think all of \nus can appreciate the fact that we are trying to track it as closely as \nwe can, consistent with writing this legislation.\n  The two primary points of objection I have to the amendment are \nthese: As a practical matter, this whole exercise is to do things \ndifferently within this new Agency than they are done departmentwide. \nThat is the essence of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard report. It says: You need to create a new semiautonomous agency \nthat doesn't have to do things the way they are done all over the rest \nof the Department of Energy. That has been the problem--all these \ndifferent people making rules and regulations and policies. It is \nimpossible to protect the Nation's security and our foremost secrets \nwhen you have so many people, in effect, with their finger in the pie. \nYou need to create a very specific semiautonomous agency that has \ncontrol over those nuclear programs, and don't apply all of the other \ndepartmentwide policies, as good as they may be for the rest of the \nDepartment, to this new Agency.\n  Many of the departmentwide policies will be appropriate, but \nundoubtedly some of them will not be. The whole point is to do things \ndifferently than they have been done in the past and to have the \nflexibility to do them differently within this new Agency.\n\n  For example, suppose the Secretary says to one of his staff \nassistants: I want you to develop a new departmentwide policy on \npolygraph tests. This person goes out and does the research, comes back \nand says: We shouldn't have any polygraph tests. The Secretary of \nEnergy says: Okay, that is our departmentwide policy.\n  Under the Levin amendment, this new Agency, this new semiautonomous \nAgency that is responsible for control of our nuclear secrets, wouldn't \nhave any choice but to implement that departmentwide policy. That is \nexactly what this language says. I will read it, Mr. President:\n\n       The director of the agency may establish agency-specific \n     policies so long as they are fully consistent with the \n     departmental policies established by the Secretary.\n\n  No flexibility to do anything different. That is the whole point. \nThat is what the PFIAB report said: You have to do things differently. \nYou cannot expect a different result if you keep doing them the same \nold way. You cannot require, for this very unique, highly technical \nbusiness of making nuclear weapons, the application of all the same \nstandards and policies that apply throughout the Agency.\n  The one example used frequently is the refrigerator standards. But \nthere are so many differ examples you can point to. Agencywide policies \nmay be fine agencywide, but they should not\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\nnecessarily be applicable to this new Agency. They may be, but they \naren't necessarily. That is the approach our bill takes. It says the \nSecretary can develop these agencywide policies, but the Director of \nthis new Agency has to have some flexibility to say some of the things \nthat apply to other parts of the Department of Energy should not apply \nhere; they are not applicable, and they may even be dangerous.\n  That it the whole point of what we are trying to accomplish. When the \namendment says the Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is \nresponsible for the implementation of the Secretary's security, \ncounterintelligence, and intelligence policies within the new Agency--\nand he can only devise agency-specific policies as far as they are \nfully consistent with the departmentwide policies--you are tying his \nhands behind his back; he is set up for failure before he even starts.\n  This amendment is very dangerous. One reason it is dangerous is that \nthe language seems to track fairly closely elements of the report. But \nagain, what we are saying is the Secretary, of course, can develop \nagencywide policies. Some of those will be applicable to this new \nAgency, but they don't necessarily have to be. That is where we \ndiverge. That is a critical difference here. It would be impossible for \nthis new Agency Director to do his job if he were bound by this \nlanguage.\n  Our whole point is to have accountability and responsibility of this \nperson. Well, I would not take the job if I were given the \nresponsibility to protect our Nation's nuclear secrets and then I was \ntold: However, you cannot establish any policy within your new Agency \nthat is inconsistent with departmentwide policies. I would not \nundertake that job because I would not be able to do it the way I \nthought best.\n\n  Mr. President, with respect for the Senator from Michigan, I have to \nsay this is the wrong approach and we will have to oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. How much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes 49 seconds. Senator \nLevin has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I inquire, does the Senator from Michigan want to speak \nnext? We have more time on our side. Would he want to address the \nSenate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, perhaps we should suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I misheard the Senator. Did he say there were additional \nspeakers on his side?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Kerrey has expressed a desire to speak in support \nof the amendment. I will briefly yield 2 minutes to myself. Regarding \nthe comments of the Senator from Illinois about both the President and \nthe Secretary relative to the Secretary's actions, the PFIAB, or the \nRudman report, as we call it, says the following:\n\n       We concur with and encourage many of Secretary Richardson's \n     recent initiatives to address the security problem at the \n     Department. And we are heartened by his aggressive approach \n     and command of the issue. He has recognized the \n     organizational dysfunction and cultural vagaries at the DOE \n     and has taken strong, positive steps to try to reverse the \n     legacy of more than 20 years of security mismanagement.\n\n  Now, the contrast between what the Rudman report says about Secretary \nRichardson and what the Senator from Illinois says the Rudman report \nsaid, relative to Secretary Richardson, is a pretty sharp contrast, \nindeed. This is what the Rudman panel actually said:\n\n       We concur with and encourage many of Secretary Richardson's \n     recent initiatives to address the security problems at the \n     Department. And we are heartened by his aggressive approach \n     and command of the issues. He [Secretary Richardson] has \n     recognized the organizational dysfunction and cultural \n     vagaries at the DOE, and he [Secretary Richardson] has taken \n     strong, positive steps to try to reverse the legacy of more \n     than 20 years of security mismanagement.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking Democrat, the vice chair \nof the committee, whether he wishes to speak at this time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I gave you both titles.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Arizona. I \ndid not hear all the reasons for opposing the Levin amendment because I \nam afraid, in my own mind, this is getting down to a point where it \nseems to me--I said to Senator Levin earlier that it seems the bill \ngives the Secretary the right to do all these things. I don't see a lot \nof reason to oppose this, I really don't.\n  As I understand it, the Senator from Arizona has a problem with the \nlast sentence, which says, ``The director of the agency may \nestablish''--this is a nuclear security agency--``agency-specific \npolicies''--that is the same autonomous objection that we have--``so \nlong as they are fully consistent with departmental policy established \nby the secretary.''\n  It seems to me we want the Secretary to be able to establish \nDepartment policies that would apply to everybody and allow the new \nsecurity Agency still to be able to establish specific policies that \ndon't relate to the rest of the Department. I don't understand the \nSenator's objection to that because it seems to me that is a reasonable \nthing to say.\n  The trouble I am having--and I am trying to make certain we achieve a \nbig bipartisan vote on this because I don't want to lose the \nopportunity that we have been given many times in the past couple of \ndecades, and the Senator from Arizona has been pushing hard on this \nthing. I would hate for us to fail as a consequence of not being able \nto resolve what seems to me is not that big a conflict. I would \nappreciate the Senator talking about this last sentence and what he \nthinks seems to be wrong with it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond on my time, and if we need \nmore time, we can utilize that.\n  Senator Kerrey raises the exact right question. In many respects, we \nare not that far apart. I think this language creates one specific, big \nproblem, however. In the bill, we provide the authority for the \nSecretary to establish not only departmentwide policies on security, \ncounterintelligence, and other matters, but also he would have the \nresidual authority to direct those issues within the new Agency itself \nif he really wanted.\n  Mr. KERREY. Can the Senator refer to where that is in the bill?\n  Mr. KYL. I will have my staff find the pages. On page 2 of the bill, \nthere is ``general authorities residual to the secretary.''\n  I refer the Senator's attention to section 213(c):\n\n       The secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the \n     agency.\n\n  So that is the overall general policy here. That is, of course, \nconsistent with the recommendations of the Rudman report. It is what we \nhave always said has to be--that ultimately the Secretary has the \nauthority to impose his will on this new Agency in any way he should \ndesire to do so, whether it is agency specific, or with respect to a \ndepartmentwide policy. We provide for that.\n\n  The problem with this amendment and the problem with the last \nsentence is that it would remove from the Under Secretary in charge of \nthe nuclear program the ability to have policies different from general \nDOE-wide policies because it says:\n\n       The director of the agency may establish agency-specific \n     policies so long as they are fully consistent with the \n     departmental policies established by the Secretary.\n\n  I can give an example of polygraphs. If you read the first sentence \nof this amendment, the Secretary may use his immediate staff to assist \nhim in developing these departmentwide policies.\n  He asks a person not in this new semiautonomous Agency to go out and \ndevelop a policy regarding polygraphs. I am using this as a \nhypothetical. The person comes back and says we shouldn't have \npolygraphs. That is a departmentwide policy. And the new Under \nSecretary, in the second sentence, is directed to implement the \nSecretary's policies within the new Agency.\n  How might he do that? The third sentence:\n\n       The director of the agency may establish agency-specific \n     policies so long as they are fully consistent with the \n     departmental policies established by the Secretary.\n\n  We need to allow enough flexibility so there can be some differences.\n  The whole point of the Rudman recommendation is that this new Agency \nmay have to do some things different from the rest of the Department. \nThere may be personnel policies. There may\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nbe contracting policies. There may even be policies of security and \ncounterintelligence that would be different in this new entity.\n  But even if they are different--this, I know, goes right to the point \nof the Senator from Nebraska--even if the person in charge of this new \nsemiautonomous Agency says, look, we have to do things differently with \nrespect to security in our new Agency than you do them in the rest of \nthe Departments, the Secretary of Energy still has the ultimate say as \nto whether he approves of that and agrees with that or not because he \nis ultimately in charge.\n  But the way this amendment is written, the new Director wouldn't have \nany options. He has to do it consistent with the departmentwide policy. \nHe has no discretion to do it differently. He has to have this \ndiscretion to do it differently if he thinks it is necessary. Then if \nthe Secretary says, no, I don't want you to, the Secretary still wins. \nHe is still the boss.\n  That is my answer to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that answer.\n  I am struggling. I have been in this position before, I say to my \nfriend from Arizona, where I hear words and they mean something to me \nand they mean something entirely different to somebody else. I am still \nstruggling.\n  It seems to me that the language of ``the director of the agency may \nestablish agency-specific policies,'' which is what the Senator from \nArizona wants, by the way, this amendment amends section 213(a). At the \nend of the following, ``the secretary shall be responsible''--OK, at \nthe end. It has a paragraph (u) to this.\n  Is that what the Senator from Michigan just took?\n  Is the Senator saying in his amendment that the Secretary shall be \nresponsible for all policies of the Agency? The Senator is saying the \nSecretary still has that authority.\n\n  How is that inconsistent? I still don't understand how that \nundercuts. This one says:\n\n       The director of the agency may establish agency-specific \n     policies so long as they are fully consistent with the \n     departmental policies established by the Secretary.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the point is as long as they are consistent \nwith departmental policies established by the Secretary. In other \nwords, the policies the Secretary establishes for all of the other \nDepartments would control. We don't want it to.\n  I might add that the language that I quoted before was specifically \nrequested by the Senator: The Secretary shall be responsible for all \npolicies of the Agency.\n  We think that is important to clarify--that in the end he always has \nthe authority. If this language says something, it is not wise to try \nto fix that amendment during debate. But if the language in effect says \nthat the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies, \nit is obviously always subject to review by the Secretary--no problem. \nBut when I say in the language that they have to be consistent with \ndepartmental policies, obviously that infers previously established.\n  Then you could have a problem.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is saying that if this language says that the \nDirector of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies--the \nSenator is quite right; I added that. I appreciate very much that \nchange being made.\n  Before I get to the rest of it, let me say that one of the reasons I \ndid that was because of the experience of dealing with agencies or \nsituations in the executive branch where somebody has the \nresponsibility but lacks authority. It is a heck of a problem to be in \nwhere you are held accountable for something, but you don't really have \nthe authority to do anything about it in the first place.\n  That is exactly the problem that the Senator is trying to fix with \nthis amendment in the first place--situations where Secretaries have \nauthority and responsibility, but they lack the authority. They lack \nthe ability to actually be able to manage.\n  I appreciate that inclusion. The Senator is saying that if the \nlanguage said the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific \npolicies subject to the approval of the Secretary, you have no problem \nwith that?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, obviously that is in response to the \namendment. But I think that is the general idea.\n  I also add one other point. In the second sentence of the amendment \nit provides that the Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is \nresponsible for implementation of the Secretary's security \ncounterintelligence and intelligence policies within the new Agency.\n  I think, while that is true, since it follows the Secretary, the \nsentence previous to it, which talks about departmentwide policies, \nthere is an implication in the second sentence, again, that he has to \nimplement all of the departmentwide policies without exception.\n  I think we have to make it clear that the second sentence is what we \nare talking about, and the third sentence as well.\n  Mr. KERREY. Part of the problem I am having with this is it is very \nclear in the Senator's amendment that the Secretary shall be \nresponsible for all policies of the Agency. That is very clear in the \nlanguage of the amendment. That is why I am having difficulty \nunderstanding how this language undercuts that, or changes that. The \nSenator wants the Secretary to have the responsibility for the policies \nof the Agency. What the Senator is trying to do is establish a \nsufficient amount of independence that this new Agency for nuclear \nsecurity can develop its own agency-specific policies. It doesn't \nundercut or eliminate the authority of the Secretary to be able to come \nin and say: I don't like that. I am not going to allow you to do it. \nBut it is going to occur in an environment where Congress knows it, and \nthe people understand what is going on.\n\n  It seems to me that is what Senator Levin is trying to do, as well.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator said it very well.\n  Obviously, the whole intention here is that there be a lot of things \ndone differently in this new Agency than would otherwise be done within \nthe Department.\n  Our problem with Senator Levin's amendment is it not only implies but \nin the last sentence actually directs that whatever is departmentwide \nalso has to exist in this new Agency--no exceptions; ``fully consistent \nwith.''\n  That is just not what this whole reform is all about. There are going \nto be a lot of things with a new agency that are going to be different.\n  To the Senator's point, as I said before, I wouldn't take the job as \nthe new Under Secretary in charge of this new Agency if I took the job \nknowing that I had to begin by complying with all departmentwide \npolicies.\n  Mr. KERREY. We have comparable agencies.\n  I was very much involved with the development of the new law \ngoverning the IRS. We wanted that agency also to be semiautonomous.\n  In that case, we created a board with authority to evaluate the \nbudget and make budget recommendations to the Secretary of the \nTreasury, and that budget has to be forwarded on. If the President \nwants to change it, he can change it. That budget gets forwarded on to \nus.\n  In addition, we made a change that the Internal Revenue Commissioner \nhas a 5-year term allowing some continuity. That is one of the problems \nwe had. We had lots of turnover.\n  The same problem existed with the FBI Director a number of years ago. \nI don't know who was involved in changing that law. We changed some \nindependence of the FBI Director. But in both cases, if the Secretary \nof the Treasury decides they don't like what the IRS Commissioner is \ndoing, or in Justice's case they don't like what the FBI Director is \ndoing, one of the things we are not talking about is they can always go \nto the President. The President issues an Executive order; everybody \ndoes it. At least they are supposed to do it. Although, again, that is \npart of the problem that we are trying to address--eliminating a lot of \nthat middle-level management and creating direct lines of authority so \nExecutive orders are carried out. In this case, a Presidential \ndirective was implemented relatively slowly. Perhaps the Senator from \nMichigan has some suggestions.\n\n  Does the Senator see a substantial difference between the language in \nhis amendment that says, ``the director of the agency may establish \nagency-specific policies so long as they are fully\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\nconsistent,'' and language that says, ``the director of the agency may \nestablish agency-specific policies understanding,'' and then reference \nback to section 213(c) that says the Secretary shall be responsible for \nall policies of the agency? If the Senator can tie it into that line, \nit seems that is what he is trying to do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the suggestion is that the Director of the Agency may \nestablish agency-specific policies which are different from the \npolicies which govern the rest of the Department with the approval of \nthe Secretary--if that is the question, I see no difference between \nthat and the last line because at that point those agency-specific \npolicies are consistent with departmental policy. The departmental \npolicy at that point is that that Agency will be governed by a \ndifferent rule than the rest of the Department. I don't see any \ndifference in terms of that concept with what is already in the last \nline.\n  The last part of that discussion I am not sure I fully follow. As far \nas that specific question is concerned, the Senator from Arizona is \nsaying, as I understand it, and the Senator from Nebraska is responding \nin the following way: The Senator from Arizona says we want to make it \npossible for there to be an agency-specific policy that does differ \nwith the departmentwide policy. My answer to that is, yes, providing it \nis approved by the head of the Department, at which point it is then \nDepartment policy that that separate agency have a different policy \nthan the rest of the Department.\n  I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. KERREY. If the Senator will yield, it seems to me what we ought \nto try to do is work this thing a little bit longer and see if we can \nget agreement.\n  I think in the key area with the amendment, we have to reference back \nthis very declarative and clear line the Senator from Arizona \nreferenced, which is 213(C) that says the Secretary shall be \nresponsible for all policies of the Agency.\n  The Senator is shaking his head.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't want to read too much into the Senator from \nArizona nodding his head, but I think he is responding positively to \nhow I characterized his suggestion.\n  I ask the Senator from Nebraska if he would, perhaps, yield to me a \nmoment.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will yield the floor and let the Senator have more than \na moment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to see if both concur in this.\n  The Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies \nwhich are different from the general policy for the Department with the \napproval of the Secretary.\n  Those are not artfully perfect words, but that is the concept as I \nunderstood it that the Senator from Arizona is proposing.\n  I say to my dear friend from Nebraska, if that is what the Senator is \nproposing and with your intermediary help, that is fine with me.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it appears to me that we have achieved a \nmeeting of the minds--almost--and therefore the language could be \nworked out.\n  Let me restate the two concerns I have, both of which I think we \nwould have to satisfy. In the second sentence of the amendment, it says \nthat the Director of the Agency is responsible for the implementation \nof the Secretary's policies within the new Agency. Obviously, that has \nto mean to the extent that they are applicable to this new Agency and \nnot inconsistent with any agency-specific recommendations.\n  If the Senator has that language following the first sentence, it \ndoesn't mean that it means whatever the departmentwide policies are \nthis new Director has to implement them. That is not what we intend.\n  Secondly, to the final sentence, the Senator is correct, this head of \nthis new Agency should have the ability to have agency-specific \npolicies with respect to security and counterintelligence and virtually \nanything else. It is always subject to the Secretary's approval.\n  I don't think in this one unique situation we want to say that prior \nto the effectiveness of any policy, the head of this new Agency has to \nobtain the approval of the Secretary. But since he has to report to the \nSecretary, the Secretary, obviously, has the ability to say no.\n  Clearly, we want this Agency to be running not on its own but \nsemiautonomously. If the new person has to go get approval from people \nbefore he does things--obviously, he would have to notify the \nSecretary--then I think that could diminish his ability to operate the \nnew entity.\n  However, if the principle is agreed to that there can be, and indeed \nshould be in some cases, different policies within this new Agency than \ndepartmentwide, and if we understand that the Secretary always has the \nability to say no or to say do it differently, then I will say \npositively that I think we have a meeting of the minds and it is simply \na matter of drafting the language in a way to achieve that.\n  I thought our bill did that. If the Senator thinks we need to modify \nit somewhat, clearly we can talk about it.\n  Mr. KERREY. If I can respond, the Senator from Michigan has a lot of \nrespect on this side of the aisle and I know a lot of respect on that \nside of the aisle as well, not just because of this particular issue \nbut because of his longstanding interest in the operations of \ngovernment and his understanding of how statutes need to be written in \norder to get government to function properly.\n  If the goal is to produce a big bipartisan vote so we can seize this \nopportunity, as the Senator from Arizona has pressed so relentlessly to \nget done, it is my hope that there could be a meeting of the minds \nleading to an agreement of language.\n  If we can get that done, we are one step closer to getting a very \nlarge bipartisan vote. That sends a very important signal to the House. \nThat increases the chances to successfully conference this in the \nIntelligence Committee and bring it back to the full Senate for \napproval.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe that we are all in agreement that \nthe weapons program should remain within the Department of Energy, with \nclear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability.\n  The sponsors of this amendment agree that the Secretary of Energy \nmust have the ultimate authority for Department functions because he \ncarries the ultimate responsibility.\n  The question is how does the Secretary exercise his authority in a \nway that allows him to meet his Cabinet-level responsibilities and \nstill remain consistent with the restrictions in this bill.\n  The bill's prohibition against delegation of any supervisory or \ndirective authority over the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship \nmeans that only the Secretary may intervene in Agency matters that may \nbe inconsistent with Department policy.\n  That is backwards.\n  The provision for non-Agency review of Agency programs permits the \nSecretary to understand the compliance status of the Agency, but the \nprohibition against delegation requires the Secretary to appeal to the \nUnder Secretary to respond to noncompliance findings.\n  That is a reveal of normal management flow of authority.\n  The Under Secretary should be the one making the appeal to the \nSecretary if the Agency is found to be noncompliant in a review.\n  Under the provisions of the amendment, the Secretary is likely to \nspend far too much of his valuable time ensuring that the Agency is \ncomplying with the Department policy.\n  A simple change in the bill would effectively accommodate this \nconcern.\n  The amendment should specifically acknowledge that the Secretary is \nendowed with equivalent authority to meet his Department-wide \nresponsibilities; and those include the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  Instead of prohibiting delegation of authority, the bill should \nprovide direct appeal authority for the Under Secretary to the \nSecretary.\n  I understand the reluctance of the sponsors to encourage broad \ndelegation of authority to non-Agency Department employees.\n  Nevertheless, compliance reviews of the Agency should be communicated \nto the Under Secretary and to the Secretary, with the presumption that \nany corrective actions would be implemented by the Under Secretary \nunless he determines to appeal to the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\n  This would encourage the Under Secretary to consider the merits of \nreview findings and consider changes before involving the Secretary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Nebraska \nall of his time has expired. There are 9 minutes 30 seconds remaining \nto the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Certainly, Senator Domenici wants to speak to this issue. To \nthe extent we need any further discussion, I am sure we will agree to \nprovide the time for that.\n  I agree with Senator Kerrey; the more bipartisan this is the better. \nI say the first goal is security. Frankly, I detect a flaw in the exact \nwording of this amendment. If we can eliminate that flaw and thereby \nachieve bipartisan consensus on this point, obviously, that is a \ntwofer. It not only achieves our policy objective but the political \nobjective of the bipartisan approach as well.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to speak on this \nand to respond on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wonder if there is a chance, rather than \ngoing to a motion to table, we can work this out. If we can work it \nout, it increases the chances of getting a big affirmative vote on this \nbill, which all of us want.\n  The Senator from Michigan sees a flaw in the bill and is concerned \nabout national security and concerned about good science. He has a lot \nof experience in this.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona if it is possible we could get the two \nsides to see if the meeting of the minds we apparently have could lead \nto an agreement on specific language and acceptance of this amendment, \nrather than having to get a vote to table or a vote up or down on the \namendment with disagreement.\n  Mr. KYL. We will have to defer. I am advised the majority leader is \nconcerned about the amount of time and is desirous of having a vote as \nsoon as possible. I think perhaps after Senator Domenici has spoken, we \nshould confer and attempt to resolve this very quickly along the lines \nthe leader has requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope this issue does not in any firm \nmanner split the Senate. It seems to me that need not be the case.\n  I want to read from the original Rudman report and then I will try to \nput quickly into a framework why we think we have complied with what \nthe distinguished Senator, the ranking member of the Department of the \ndefense authorization committee, Senator Levin, is concerned about.\n  I am reading from page 46 of the report:\n\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform of the weapons lab is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To \n     achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must \n     have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous \n     operational structure free of all the other obligations \n     imposed by DOE management.\n\n  Actually, when you read that and you read the letter that came some 3 \nor 4 weeks after the report from the panel, talking about \nclarification, the best you can conclude is that it is not absolutely \nclear how we should do this. I submit that when you read the \nclarifications that were proposed with reference to the issue before \nus, we have solved that issue in this bill. I hope those who are \nthinking they can vote against the bill if we do not do this will \nunderstand.\n  On page 2 of the bill, as said a number of times, we have made it \neminently clear that the Secretary is the ultimate authority; the \nSecretary, not the new Under Secretary. We have said:\n\n       There shall be within the department a separately organized \n     agency under the direction, authority and control of the \n     Secretary.  . . .\n\n  I do not read the rest of the sentence, but that is what it says. \nThen it says, at the request of the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, paragraph C:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for all the policies of \n     the agency.\n\n  Then, at the request of others because they wanted to make sure the \nSecretary could use other Department people to help him--that is, the \nbig Secretary--we said:\n\n       The Secretary may direct other officials of the Department \n     who are not within the agency to review agency programs and \n     make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the \n     administration of such programs . . .\n\n  And then--I read the next part very slowly:\n\n       . . . including consistency with similar programs and \n     activities in the Department.\n\n  I read that, and other things in this bill, to say that those who are \nputting this bill before us to straighten up the Department and give us \nsome security and counterintelligence that is reliable have, to the \nbest of our ability, provided the Secretary and the new Agency with \nprecisely what the Rudman board recommended. First, they wanted \nautonomy. I read that: It should be a structure free of all other \nobligations of the DOE. Yet it goes on in the supplemental report, or \nthe letter of transmittal, saying here is our final interpretation of \nconflicts. It talks about some policies that ought to be consistent \nacross the Department.\n  I do not believe we need to put language in that charges the \nSecretary with putting these policies that are departmentwide in place \nand then saying this new Agency is bound by them. I think the room \nought to be there for the new Agency to prepare its programs in this \nregard, be it on the environment, be it on management, be it on safety, \nbe it on whatever. The Secretary still has the overriding authority, if \nhe chooses, to say: I have selected some members of the staff of the \nDepartment, we have reviewed it carefully, and we recommend that you \nchange something because we want you to be more in harmony with the \nDepartment.\n  But to create a structure that is semiautonomous and then say \nwhatever policies the Secretary pronounces that are departmentwide are \nbinding on this Agency is to deny the Agency the autonomy right up \nfront and to set the presumption in the wrong place. So I hope we do \nnot do that. I am willing to clarify it, if it needs to be clarified \nfurther, but I do not think we need this provision ripping at the \nautonomy at the very outset, waiting around to see what the \ndepartmentwide rules are before you can implement this. I just think \nthat is the wrong way to go.\n  Having said that, I want to recapitulate where we are going for just \na moment. The amendments that have been offered so far have been \noffered on the Democrat side. Senator Bingaman and I have one we are \ngoing to offer together, that we have resolved and the Senate is going \nto accept, with reference to work for others within the laboratory, \nwhich has been an issue of concern. Then I understand there are a \ncouple more amendments.\n  I want to say to my friend, Senator Bingaman, I know he has an \namendment with reference to the environment. Since I have not offered \nan amendment, I am going to offer an amendment on the environment \nbefore he offers his. I am hopeful it will clarify the situation and he \nmay not offer his. But if he chooses to, we will have one on the \nenvironment, safety, and others, so as to make it eminently clear we do \nnot intend to exculpate this new Agency from any of the national \nenvironmental laws or the national laws with reference to safety. We \nnever intended to. We will make it clear.\n  Beyond that, we have a little bit of time left. I, myself, am going \nto run out of time to be able to be down here working on this, but if \nthe Senator thinks another 10 minutes of effort together will help--\nmight I do it this way? Might I ask, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds remaining. \nThe Senator from Michigan has 52 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if we have not \nreached conclusion of this amendment, that we vote on or in reference \nto this amendment at 1 o'clock.\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nKerrey has said he would be gone 30 minutes. I indicated to him I would \nreserve his right to get here before we voted. That will probably be, \nsay, 1:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I modify my request and make it 1:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \namendment aside and that I be able to speak for 10 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nIntelligence Authorization Act.\n  While we cannot discuss the details of the bill, I can say that as a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, we have provided the necessary \nfunds to the intelligence community to do their job.\n  One matter of controversy for some is the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski DOE \nreorganization amendment. I strongly support this amendment.\n  In the last year, the Cox report has shown us why we need to improve \nthe security structure at DOE, and the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, headed by Senator Rudman, shows us the way. The Kyl \namendment before us is nearly identical to the President's own Advisory \nBoard recommendation.\n  The President's Advisory Board report states that the problems at DOE \nare worse than most people could have ever imagined. Quoting from the \nreport:\n\n       In response to these problems, the Department has been the \n     subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and \n     attempted but aborted reforms . . . sSecond only to its \n     world-class intellectual feats has been its ability to fend \n     off systematic change.\n\n  I know that Secretary Richardson has put forward a reorganization \nplan, and I commend him for taking the initiative. I have known him for \nsome time and I know he is doing what he believes is right for the \nDepartment. However, my concern is that he will not be the Secretary \nforever, and I am worried that the Department's ``ability to fend off \nsystematic change'' will prevail once he leaves.\n  The only way to fix the security problems are to make radical changes \nat the Department, as recommended in the DOE study headed by then \nchairman of Motorola, Bob Galvin.\n  The amendment before us is not the most ``radical'' idea which could \nhave been presented. In many ways, I believe that a separate agency for \nthe nuclear programs could be the best way to enhance security, but I \nam a realist and know that if the amendment before us causes such \nheartache, I can only imagine the reaction to a separate agency \namendment.\n  Basically, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment would establish a \nseparate entity, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, within the \nDepartment of Energy. The Agency will have clear lines of authority, \naccountability, and an independent budget. The new Agency will be \nheaded by an Under Secretary of Nuclear Stewardship who reports \ndirectly to the Secretary. The Directors of the 3 national labs and the \nnuclear labs will report to the Under Secretary.\n  First, I understand the amendment creates a ``security czar,'' for \nthe lack of a better term, who will be in charge of security for all \nthe nuclear lab programs under the Under Secretary. While I understand \nwhy this position would be placed under the Under Secretary, I also \nunderstand how bureaucracies work and the perception they hold for \ntheir hierarchy of authority. That is why I believe the security czar \nposition should be placed directly under the Secretary, if for no other \nreason than to show that he is in charge and will be held accountable. \nHowever, I have also heard the concern that if this person is placed \nunder the Secretary then his attention may be diverted to the other \nmatters outside of the nuclear programs. For this reason, I hope that \nit will be understood that the security czar has the authority, both \nreal and perceived, and will be solely focused on the real security \nconcerns of the nuclear programs but also with the flexibility to not \nbe tied to nonnuclear concerns.\n  Second, Secretary Richardson believes that this amendment would only \ndivide the Department into more fiefdoms. I do not agree with this \nassessment. We must break the nuclear stewardship programs out of the \nmain programs of DOE. This new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is too \nimportant and sensitive to treat it like the power marketing \nadministrations, fossil energy, or any other area of the Department. \nThe reports from the last year show that we need to break the nuclear \nprograms out and the approach in this amendment will raise the stature \nof the programs and will improve the security for our nation.\n  Let me end by stating that after five internal DOE reviews, four \noutside studies, six GAO reports, and three blue ribbon commissions, it \nis time to make these much needed changes at the Department. I ask that \nall my colleagues support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment and the \nIntelligence Authorization Act.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman is in the Chamber. I \nassume the Bingaman-Domenici amendment with reference to work for \nothers is available and ready; is that correct, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is ready. We have it written up in \namendment form. We just got it on a sheet of paper. We can easily do \nthat and take another minute or two.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to get it done before this vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We will put it on the right paper and go with it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use the remaining 10, 15, 20 seconds to say we \nhave been looking through the amendments to see if we can see daylight \nin dealing with the agency for nuclear weapons development. I believe \nSenator Carl Levin has another amendment. We are going to submit to him \nsome language on reporting, the deputy to the Secretary being available \nfor the Secretary to accomplish some of the responsibilities that the \nSecretary has. We will get with him on that. Hopefully, we can work \nthat out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman has an environment and safety \namendment. I will have one I will offer ahead of that. Perhaps it can \nbe accepted and Senator Bingaman can offer his after it. We will work \non that. It seems to me, other than the alleged, talked-about \nsubstitute, which I know nothing about, which I assume will be ready--\nis that correct, I ask Senator Levin? It will not cause us a long delay \nto have that available?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct, depending on the actions of the Senate \nprior to that. It should not take more than perhaps 10, 15 minutes to \nprepare after we are done with all the amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Katy Lampron, of my \nstaff, have privileges of the floor throughout today, including all \nvotes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have some rather brief remarks that will \nprobably take me 15 minutes. Is this a time when I might speak out of \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled to occur at 1:15.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if there is no objection, I would like to \nproceed. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be delayed for an \nadditional 5 minutes or whatever.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly I do not object for such a \nreasonable request from the Senator. But I would hope there would be no \nfurther delay. We had intended to vote at 12; then we were told 12:30, \n12:40, 1:15, and now it is 1:20. I know there is an effort being made \nto work it out, and that is very commendable, but I think we need to \nhave a recorded vote.

Mr. President, the small, serious, tousled-hair lad seemed, \neven at the tender age of 3, to know just the right thing to do. With a \nstraight back and a smart, entirely proper, military salute, John F. \nKennedy, Jr. expressed the grief of an entire nation with a dignity far \nbeyond his years. He was only 3, yet he gave the Nation a lasting, \nmemorable, indelible image, an image that is remembered by millions and \ncaptured on videotape for generations to come.\n  Now John F. Kennedy, Jr. has, himself, been lost at an age far too \nyoung for easy acceptance by a country which had affectionately watched \nhim grow to manhood. His untimely death feels as heavy and oppressive \nas the too hot, too dry summer in which he lived his final days.\n  Words fail to express the special deprivation that the human spirit \nfeels when the young, the beautiful, the handsome, the vital among us \nare suddenly taken from our midst before they have fulfilled their \npotential promise. Especially, in this case, the mind reels at the \nspectre of yet another Kennedy, taken too soon, yet another unbearable \nsorrow for this family which has had so much sorrow to bear. Yet this \nincredible American family will undoubtedly once again demonstrate to \nthe Nation that they will endure, and that it is how one lives, and not \nhow one dies, that ultimately matters.\n  John Kennedy, Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and his sister-in-law, Lauren \nBessette have vanished in the summer night in the springtime of their \nyears, and our hearts go out to the Bessette and the Kennedy families. \nI am particularly saddened for my good friend, Senator Ted Kennedy. He \nis a great Senator. He is a great figure on the American political \nstage. I know that his heart must be broken by this latest family \ntragedy, yet I am confident that his expansive spirit and his deep \nfaith in God will see him safely to a harbor of peace and of comfort.\n  My wife, Erma, and I offer our prayers and our deepest sympathies to \nhim and to the families at this saddest of sad times.\n  Ted Kennedy, in July of 1996--3 years ago--presented to me a book \ntitled ``American Poetry.''\n  I have chosen a bit of poetry by Nathaniel Hawthorne from that book \nfor the Record today. It seems to me that it is most appropriate for \nthis occasion.\n  The title of this poem is ``The Ocean.''\n\n     The Ocean has its silent caves,\n     Deep, quiet and alone;\n     Though there be fury on the waves,\n     Beneath them there is none.\n     The awful spirits of the deep\n     Hold their communion there;\n     And there are those for whom we weep,\n     The young, the bright, the fair.\n     Calmly the wearied seamen rest\n     Beneath their own blue sea.\n     The ocean solitudes are blest,\n     For there is purity.\n     The earth has guilt, the earth has care,\n     Unquiet are its graves;\n     But peaceful sleep is ever there,\n     Beneath the dark blue waves.\n\n  Mr. President, what is the scheduled time for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an amendment that Senator \nDomenici, Senator Reid, and I have agreed to, which I offer at this \ntime and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Senator Domenici and Senator Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1262 to amendment No. 1258.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 213 of the Department of Energy Organization \n     Act, as proposed by subsection (c) of the amendment, strike \n     subsection (o) and insert the following new subsection (o):\n       (o)(1) The Secretary shall ensure that other programs of \n     the Department, other federal agencies, and other appropriate \n     entities continue to use the capabilities of the national \n     security laboratories.\n       (2) The Under Secretary, under the direction, authority, \n     and control of the Secretary, shall, consistent with the \n     effective discharge of the Agency's responsibilities, make \n     the capabilities of the national security laboratories \n     available to the entities in paragraph (1) in a manner that \n     continues to provide direct programmatic control by such \n     entities.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we could get \nagreement to offer this amendment. It is a joint amendment that Senator \nDomenici, Senator Reid, and I have participated in drafting. It tries \nto ensure that our national laboratories, particularly those that are \nfocused on defense-related activities and our nuclear weapons \ncapability, are open to do other work, work for other parts of the \nDepartment of Energy, work for other agencies of the Government, and \nwork with industry, where appropriate.\n  We provide what the Secretary needs to ensure that this is the case, \nand that the Under Secretary, working under the direction of the \nSecretary, shall make the capabilities of the national laboratories \navailable to these other entities that want to perform work there, and \nthat these entities shall be able to do so in a manner that continues \nto provide them with direct programmatic control of the activities they \nare sponsoring at the laboratories.\n  Mr. President, this concern has been for the future of civilian \nresearch and development at the DOE laboratories that carry out \ndefense-related research. I was concerned that the Kyl amendment was \nsetting up an architecture for these laboratories that well may make it \nmore difficult to carry out civilian-related research. We don't want to \nwake up, 5 years from now, and discover that this architecture dictated \nthe destiny of those laboratories in unfortunate ways.\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\n  I don't quarrel with the notion that these labs have, and should \ncontinue to have, nuclear weapons as a core mission. But it seems to me \nthat the task of science-based stockpile stewardship cannot succeed \nunless these labs are fully integrated into the larger world of science \nand technology.\n  I believe that the civilian R programs at Sandia, Los Alamos, and \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratories play a critical role in \nattracting and keeping the best people in those laboratories. By \ncivilian R, I am talking about the work funded at the laboratories by \nDOE programs other than the defense programs, programs funded by other \ncivilian agencies of the government, and technology partnerships with \nindustry.\n  There have been numerous cases where this civilian R has provided \nnew ideas for defense-related technical activities. In other cases, \nthis civilian R has helped maintain core competencies at the labs \nneeded for their defense missions. Our national security, in my view, \nwould be damaged in the long run if these institutions stopped being \nnational laboratories and just had a weapon focus.\n  My colleagues and co-sponsors agree with this assessment. It is basic \nto a number of provisions of law that we have enacted in past \nCongresses, particularly the National Competitiveness Technology \nTransfer Act of 1989, which I sponsored with Senator Domenici. The \nfindings of that bill are as relevant today, 10 years later, as they \nwere when we passed that bill as part of the Defense Act that year.\n  Last week, before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, we \nheard testimony from one of DOE's most distinguished laboratory \ndirectors, Dr. Burt Richter. He's the head of a civilian DOE \nlaboratory, but has a long acquaintance with the defense side of DOE. \nHe stated, ``one has to face the fact that maintaining the credibility \nof a nuclear deterrent is not the most exciting job in science these \ndays'', underlining the issues of attracting and retaining personnel. \nBut he says, ``it needs some of the best people to do it''.\n  He then went on to say, ``The scientists at the weapons labs have to \nbe able to interact with the rest of the scientific community, because \nall of the science needed for stockpile stewardship is not in the \nweapons labs, and the best people will not go into isolation behind a \nfence in today's world.'' He concluded by reminding us, ``This is not \nWorld War II.''\n  I think that he's right. In creating this new Agency, we need to make \nsure that we are not damaging one of the most precious assets for which \nthe Department of Energy is the custodian.\n\n  I think this is an important clarification, an important provision to \nadd to the bill. I appreciate the cooperation of my colleague in \ngetting agreement on the amendment. I hope the Senate will adopt it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. I was \npleased to work with the Senator Bingaman and Senator Reid in getting \nit developed. I thank our staff.\n  We are very proud that the laboratories do work for others. That \nmeans the Department of Defense and the private sector; it means other \nagencies of the Federal Government and work for the Department in other \nareas besides nuclear. It is important, and we knew it from the very \nbeginning, that this flexibility and ability to do such work be \nprotected to the maximum extent in the new configuration and management \nscheme.\n  I believe we have done that. It will not detract from its principal \nmission, which is the subject matter of the amendment, creating a new \nagency within the Department, but it will assure that these jewels of \nresearch, which are the three nuclear deterrent laboratories, remain at \nthe high level they have been for many, many decades. That means it \nwill work for others, thus attracting the very best scientists.\n  We think this can be done and protect intelligence and \ncounterintelligence activities within the laboratories.\n  We have no objection on our side, and I don't assume there is any on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, there is no objection here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we are all in agreement that the \nquality of American science benefits from participation by the national \nsecurity labs.\n  And, I think all would agree that the quality and character of our \nnuclear stockpile benefits from non-weapons research and development at \nthese labs.\n  The national weapons labs are truly multi-program labs that apply \ntheir skills and facilities, unmatched anywhere in the world, to the \nsolution of critical nondefense problems as well as defense problems.\n  I do not believe for one moment that any of the bill's sponsors \nintend to isolate the weapons labs from their scientific roots.\n  But I do believe that the amendment's restrictive language that \nassigns direct responsibility and authority to the Under Secretary for \nNuclear Stewardship for ``all activities at the Department's national \nsecurity laboratories, and nuclear weapons production facilities'' will \ndo just that.\n  For example, the Director of the Office of Science is responsible for \nresearch in high energy physics, a topic of particular interest and \nskill at the weapons labs.\n  But, according to the amendment, the Director has no authority over \nhigh energy physics work that might be performed at Lawrence Livermore \nNational Lab.\n  According to the amendment, only the Under Secretary for Nuclear \nStewardship can have responsibility and authority for work at that lab.\n  Mr. President, I suppose that the Director of the Office of Science \ncould simply ``trust'' the Under Secretary to do the ``right thing'', \nbut that is not the way things normally work.\n  A far more likely outcome in my opinion would be that the Director \nwould choose to assign work to a University or other source of skills, \nregardless of the lost opportunity at these superb weapons labs--just \nin order to retain authority over things for which the Director is \nresponsible.\n  In the same way that the Secretary needs to retain authority over \nfunctions for which he is responsible, other functionaries in the \nDepartment need to retain authority over work for which they are \nresponsible.\n  There has been unanimous agreement among my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle as well as among the members of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board that no person should be assigned \nresponsibility without appropriate accompanying authority.\n  So I think we should be able to agree on this matter.\n  I understand that we are very near agreement on this matter with some \ndifferences remaining between whether it is the Secretary or the Under \nSecretary who ensures that the national security labs remain available \nfor appropriate scientific work for other agencies and other parts of \nthe Department.\n  I hope we can arrive at some common ground on this issue.\n  It does not seem wrong to me to call for the Secretary to establish \npolicies regarding the availability of the national security labs since \nthe Secretary is, according to the underlying amendment, responsible \nfor all policies at the Department of Energy.\n  So I hope my colleagues can continue to work toward a bipartisan \nagreement that will strengthen this legislation and allow it to endure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, farmers across America are experiencing hard \ntimes. This year, the difficulties of farmers in the northeast and \ncentral-Atlantic regions of America have been made worse by a serious \nlack of rainfall for many, many weeks.\n  West Virginia's farmers have been especially hard hit by the drought \nof 1999. No significant rainfall has drenched the scorched earth in my \nState since May 15. On May 28 the Governor of West Virginia declared an \nAgricultural State of Emergency for West Virginia. At that time, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture's State Emergency Board for West \nVirginia concurred with that decision. Now farmers await a decision by \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture that would permit much needed \nfederal emergency assistance funds to be dispensed.\n  We know that here in Washington, in northern Virginia, in the \nMaryland suburbs, and on the farms nearby, the ground is dry. We can \nlook out our windows and see that where there was once soft green grass \ngrowing, there is now a crispy, lifeless carpet of beige. Where there \nis no grass, cracked, dusty earth remains. I know that my tomato plants \nhave needed extra watering to keep them growing up their stakes, but \nthese are merely part of my backyard small garden that I sow for \npleasure. My life will not drastically change if I fail to bring in a \ntomato crop. That is not true for those whose livelihood depends upon \nit.\n  Close your eyes and take a moment to imagine this: you have been \nlooking to the sky for two months praying that the clouds will release \na downpour, but no drops fall. Your corn plants that should be up to \nyour shoulder by the fourth of July in a normal season, remain below \nyour knees. They are short stems shriveling slowly on acres and acres \nof parched land. You have moved your herd to your last pasture. In a \nshort period of time the animals have grazed it over so thoroughly that \nnothing remains but unpalatable dried-out grass stubble. Your pastures \nhave been grazed over so thoroughly that you are now, during the middle \nof the summer, when lengthy pasture grasses should blow in the gentle \nsummer breeze, and naturally produced resources should be plentiful, \nfeeding your animals with purchased hay and grain as though it were the \ndesolate season of winter. Even though they are being fed enough to \ngain weight, the extreme heat is causing them so much stress that they \nare losing weight. It is impossible to keep them cool and comfortable. \nThe pond on your farm that you use as a source of water for your \nanimals is slowly, slowly becoming a puddle. The stream that runs \nthrough the far end of your property first became a muddy trickle, but \nnow is becoming dusty and cracked. When you turn on the tap, try to \nflush your commode, or bathe, no water flows. You instead must travel \nevery day to a truck parked in the middle of your town to get a couple \nof gallons of water for you and your family to drink. Even if it rains \ntoday or tomorrow, you begin to wonder if it will make any difference \nto you. You have fallen on hard times before as an Appalachian farmer. \nTimes are often lean in that region. Now, in desperation, you begin to \nthink about what you could do if you were not a family farmer.\n  This is a very real situation for the farmers in West Virginia and in \nmany areas of the country. The most serious impact of the drought on \nfarmers is having to purchase feed for their animals. Under normal \nconditions, there are regions in West Virginia where farmers can grow \ntwo or three cuttings of hay in a year. They use this hay to feed their \nanimals.\n  Last year's cuttings were thin, and this year's have been even \nthinner, with farmers barely being able to make one cutting! So, as I \nmentioned earlier, the farmers have begun to purchase feed. This does \nnot bode well for the winter, either, as farmers will have to rely on \npurchasing expensive hay and grain brought in from outside the drought \nareas, or face the prospect of selling off their underweight stock for \nlittle or no profit or at a loss. Farmers will not be able to afford to \nkeep feeding their animals in this way. West Virginia's farmers fear \nthat they may lose their farms--not just lose their crop, lose their \nfarms--if they must wait until next spring to receive U.S. Department \nof Agriculture assistance, which is how long it would take for the \nfunds we appropriate to reach them if appropriations are completed on \ntime, as I hope they will be. West Virginia farmers need Federal \nassistance now.\n  And the same can be said for Maryland farmers and Virginia farmers \nand others. Nearly $2.9 million in Federal emergency aid for energy \nassistance was released through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program on Monday, July \n12. Hopefully our farmers who have been having a difficult time keeping \ntheir animals cool will be allowed a portion of these funds. However, \nthis is a tiny drop of water in a very empty State bucket where it is \nestimated that the drought has caused $50 million in damages.\n  Regulations allow farmers to become eligible for emergency assistance \nwhen they have suffered at least a 30-percent loss of normal production \nin a single enterprise. In West Virginia, which is not a large State \nand certainly not a large farming State, according to the most recent \nstatistics available, which were calculated in the middle of June, in \nall but 3 counties 40 to 50 percent of grass hay production has been \nlost for this year. It has been lost. In 17 West Virginia counties, 35 \npercent of corn production has already been lost--already been lost; 40 \npercent of tobacco has been lost; 50 percent of pasture--50 percent of \npasture has been lost. A dozen other counties have experienced at least \na 10- to 20-percent loss of corn, tobacco, and tobacco crops; a 30- to \n50-percent loss of pasture; and a 20- to 40-percent loss of their truck \ncrops, such as apples and peaches, grown for table consumption. Twenty-\nthree other counties have lost 10- to 30-percent of their alfalfa hay, \n40- to 50-percent of their pasture, 10- to 30-percent of their corn, \nand 25- to 30-percent of other grains.\n  So I remind those listening and those who are watching through the \nelectronic cameras that these statistics are\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\nfrom the middle of June. Now, weeks later, after a continued period of \nscorching temperatures, and arid conditions, it is expected that a \nstatistical report that will be generated later this week will show \nsignificant losses occurring in every one of the 55 counties of the \ngreat State of West Virginia.\n  The Federal Government has established mechanisms that are intended \nto aid Americans in times of crisis. However, when these mechanisms are \nslow to work, difficulties have a tendency to grow, and greater \nassistance becomes necessary. As we have often heard, ``One stitch, in \ntime, saves nine.'' In the case of farmers, if nothing is done, and the \nfarmer is forced to abandon the land that he has worked, it is likely \nthat this land will not be reclaimed next year or the year after as a \nfamily farm. A farm is not a machine that can be shut down temporarily \nuntil someone is ready to work on it again or conditions make it \nprofitable. Farming is, by its very nature, a cyclical industry that \nevery now and then needs the support of the Federal Government.\n  America can never afford to not help its farmers. Now is the time to \nhelp farmers and I speak particularly of West Virginia farmers, of \ncourse. If we fail to help them now, they will not be able to survive. \nFarmers are losing out on every side of their industry. Prices have \nbeen, and continue to be, low, the weather is slowing or eliminating \ncrop production, crop insurance payback is so low that it may not even \ncover costs, and springs and farm ponds are drying up. There are no \nresources left from which to draw.\n  Farmers have always been an essential part of the fabric that makes \nAmerica great. ``God made the country but man made the town.'' And from \nthe country is where America gets much or most of its sustenance--not \njust America but also the world, many nations in the world.\n  We cannot forget these farmers. We cannot forget them now like a \nchild forgets a once-treasured security blanket that has become worn \nand he has now outgrown. Therefore, I am urging that West Virginia be \ngranted Federal disaster area status so that farmers will receive \nimmediate Federal assistance that will enable them to continue to work \ntheir land and raise their animals.\n  I have talked with the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, and he \nhas indicated that as soon as he is supplied with the sufficient data \nfrom the State, adequate and careful and prompt consideration will be \ngiven. But I have to say that time waits for no one and the clock waits \nfor no one and the farmers' problems cannot wait. We must have help. We \nneed it and the sooner the better.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the events that have weighed so heavily on all of us. Whether one \nknows Senator Kennedy well or casually through contact in the Senate, \none cannot but have respect and admiration for the contribution the \nKennedy family has made to our public well-being for so many years. \nThat is why I am sure others share the same feeling of grief as I do, \nand others who know the Kennedy family well, at the loss of John F. \nKennedy, Jr.\n  When the news came--and I was on my way to Martha's Vineyard--that \nthe young Mr. Kennedy's airplane was missing, we all, I am sure, had \nthe same reaction--let's pray that it is not true, that there is some \ninformation that will come out that will prove to be worry-unfounded. \nUnfortunately, our worst fears were realized. This day, apparently, the \ndiscovery has been made that confirms the death of John F. Kennedy, \nJr., 38 years of age.\n  One of the remarkable things we saw in this young man was the way he \ntreated his position in life, coming from a famous family, with all of \nthe celebrity status one could imagine, from a family that has seen \ntragedy after tragedy after tragedy.\n  I had an opportunity, a year ago Christmas week, to sit with Michael \nKennedy and his young sons on the morning of the day he perished on the \nski slopes below. We actually skied together for a while in the \nmorning. I visited with his brother that night to see if I could be of \nany help to the family in managing the affairs they had to put in \norder. It was very sad.\n  When John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s life was just really beginning to \nflourish, it is hard to understand what it was that took this young man \nso full of life. The imagery of John F. Kennedy, Jr., was the same \nimagery that we had, in a way, of John F. Kennedy, Sr., President of \nthe United States--attractive, intelligent, concerned about the well-\nbeing of our country, trying always to lift the opportunity and the \nspirits of those who in America depended so much on government and \nindividual leadership. John F. Kennedy, Jr., evoked the same imagery--\nof this attractive young man, of this bright, intelligent, caring \nperson, eschewing the spotlight whenever he could, trying to become \npart of the society in which we all live.\n  His early death will prevent what all of us believe was so much \ntalent and so much future. Any of us who have worked with Ted Kennedy--\nand I have now for 16 years--only gains respect the longer we know \nSenator Kennedy. His accomplishments are legendary, but his commitment \nto people--rich, poor, those who have needed help--is without \nreservation. We have seen an energized Senator Kennedy over at his \ndesk, stating the causes and cases he is concerned about. And to see \nthem, the whole Kennedy family, put into the grief can only be imagined \nby those who have their family intact without the trail of misfortune \nthat has followed the Kennedy family.\n  So I just came in, for the Record, to make some comments to register \nmy feelings, as I know so many others have, of grief for the families \nof John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife, and his sister-in-law, the Kennedys \nand the Bessettes.\n  We hope his life will inspire us to give whatever we can by way of \nservice to our country, to recognize the advantages we have as citizens \nof the United States, not to be discouraged by this untimely tragedy \nbut, rather, to be motivated to try to do better.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will reserve appropriate time, collectively, \nto acknowledge our share of feelings for the Kennedy family and the \ngrief they are going through.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman. I will shortly send an amendment to the \ndesk on\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\nbehalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, Senator Levin, Senator Lieberman, \nand Senator Reid.\n  Let me suggest, first, that this has been worked out during very \nserious discussions, and I think it turned out to be a very good \namendment.\n  Senator Bingaman has played a vital role in it. He has been concerned \nand wants to make sure that it is eminently clear that this new \nsemiautonomous Agency complied with the applicable environmental, \nsafety and health rules, and laws.\n  I will read quickly a couple of sentences of the amendment and yield \nto my friend, Senator Bingaman, and see if we can agree. We have no \nobjection on our side. I don't believe he has any on his side.\n  This is section (u), in the underlying Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski \namendment. It says:\n\n       The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship shall comply with all \n     applicable environmental, safety, and health statutes and \n     substantive requirements. The Under Secretary for Nuclear \n     Stewardship shall develop procedures for meeting such \n     requirements. Nothing in this section shall diminish the \n     authority of the Secretary to ascertain and ensure that such \n     compliance occurs.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1263 to Amendment No. 1258\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for himself, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1263 to amendment No. 1258.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 213 of the Department of Energy Organization \n     Act, as proposed by subsection (c) of the amendment, add at \n     the end of the section the following new subsection:\n       ``(u) The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship shall comply with \n     all applicable environmental, safety, and health statutes and \n     substantive requirements. The Under Secretary for Nuclear \n     Stewardship shall develop procedures for meeting such \n     requirements. Nothing in this section shall diminish the \n     authority of the Secretary to ascertain and ensure that such \n     compliance occurs.''.\n\n  It has always been the intention that this new, semiautonomous agency \nbe subject to applicable environmental, safety, and health rules. The \nquestion we had was to make sure the new agency could go about \ndeveloping their environmental safety and health rules. On the other \nhand, there was concern that they be bound by the applicable laws and \nrules. I think this amendment does that.\n  Then Senator Bingaman raised the question which we have just made \nvery clear. I thought it was in the statute. He raised the question \nabout the Secretary making sure there was compliance. As he put it, if \nsomething untoward happened of an environmental or safety nature, it \nneeded to be solved. I think we covered that.\n  I am pleased Senator Bingaman had others join in this amendment. I \nthink we will agree to it by voice vote shortly.\n  I yield to Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for yielding. I \nthank him for his willingness to accommodate despite the concerns he \njust described.\n  Of course, all of us have intended from the very beginning that all \nenvironmental laws be complied with. My concern has been that the \nSecretary, who is ultimately responsible for the entire Department and \nfor the conduct of the entire Department, Secretary have the \nwherewithal and the legal authority to be sure that all of these \nenvironmental, safety, and health requirements be met.\n  I believe this amendment adequately meets that concern. I think it is \na compromise between a provision I earlier drafted and one that Senator \nDomenici drafted. I think it is a good resolution of this issue. I \nthink it does clarify for all Senators what we intend in this regard.\n  I am very pleased to cosponsor it. I urge all my colleagues to vote \nfor it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President I will take just a minute and commend the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and also the junior Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for their work in bringing this about. I \nthink what they have done is drafted a good amendment. I have no \nproblem with it, and I am sure Senator Kerrey doesn't.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1263) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 1264 And 1265, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I believe the \ndistinguished chairman is prepared to accept en bloc, as is the ranking \nmember, as I understand.\n  They are, first of all, a sense of the Senate, which says:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the systematic \n     declassification of records of permanent historic value is in \n     the public interest and that the management of classification \n     and declassification by the Executive Branch agencies \n     requires comprehensive reform and additional resources.\n\n  The second measure, in regard to that last phrase, the Information \nSecurity Oversight Office, which is charged with administering this \nNation's intelligence classification and declassification, would \nreceive an additional $1.5 million to hire more staff so it can more \nefficiently manage the program. They are in the National Archives. The \nArchives asked for $5 million. They did not get it. This is a small \nagency. It does indispensable work. It gives you a continuous series of \nthe amount of classification we do and the degree of classification and \nthe agencies that do it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, have the amendments been sent down?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send the amendments to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am sorry. Forgive me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] proposes \n     amendments numbered 1264 and 1265, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 1264 and 1265) are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 1264\n\n       On page 5 strike lines 7-12, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104.

The Information Security \n     Oversight Office, charged with administering this nation's \n     intelligence classification and declassification programs \n     shall receive $1.5 million of these funds to allow it to hire \n     more staff so that it can more efficiently manage these \n     programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1265\n\n       After section 308 insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON CLASSIFICATION AND \n                   DECLASSIFICATION\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the systematic \n     declassification of records of permanent historic value is in \n     the public interest and that the management of classification \n     and declassification by Executive Branch agencies requires \n     comprehensive reform and additional resources.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York for offering these amendments. They make sense to me. We \nhave reviewed them. I think Senator Kerrey has reviewed them.\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\n  I also commend the senior Senator from New York for his past work, \nnot only in the Senate but specifically on the Intelligence Committee, \nwhere he spent a lot of time--a lot of hours, and a lot of years--and \nunderstands what we are going through--and what we need to do. \nHopefully, this is one of those little steps.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, like Chairman Shelby, I fully support \nthese two amendments and am enthusiastic as well for the efforts the \nsenior Senator, Mr. Moynihan, has made in the area of secrecy over the \nyears.\n  I made a point earlier, when we were talking about secrecy, that \nsometimes secrecy does equal security. We have to have secrecy in order \nto maintain security. But there are times when secrecy actually makes \nit harder for us to achieve security. It can make us less secure.\n  I retold the story in the Senator's book on the Venona project when \nOmar Bradley made the decision not to inform the President of the \nUnited States about Klaus Fuchs and others. As a consequence of \nbelieving the President didn't have a need to know, he kept the secret. \nI think, as a consequence, there was less security for the Nation.\n  I appreciate and fully agree with the chairman. These amendments are \ngood amendments and should be adopted. I appreciate and applaud and am \ngrateful for the leadership of the Senator from New York on this issue \nof secrecy.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1264 and 1265) were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be able \nto proceed as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, a unanimous consent request was \npropounded with respect to the Senate's consideration of campaign \nfinance reform legislation. I objected to the request and I want to \nexplain to my colleagues why I did so.\n  There is no more important work for this institution than passing \ncampaign finance reform. Despite our good efforts in 1974, following \nthe debacle of Watergate, to limit the influence of money in our \npolitical system, we are currently operating without effective limits. \nWe have a law that sets out reasonable limits at $1,000 for \nindividuals, $5,000 for PACs, and $25,000 to a national party. But \nthose limits are easily evaded by the unlimited contributions of soft \nmoney. We have, in effect, no limits today.\n  The 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act has, in effect, been repealed. \nTo return our elections to issues and people and away from money, we \nmust pass campaign finance reform. Since the time agreement is critical \nto determining how and when we take up campaign finance reform, and \nperhaps its ultimate success, I wanted to be sure that I understood \nwhat the agreement contained. I objected initially on the basis of \nneeding time to review the agreement. Having read the agreement, I do \ncontinue my objection to the original unanimous consent proposal, \nbecause I believe the agreement is inadequate for the necessary \nconsideration of campaign finance reform.\n  I am well aware of the opponents' desire to filibuster the McCain-\nFeingold bill, a bill which is supported by a majority of the Members \nof the Senate. The opponents have every right to do that, and I respect \nthat right. But supporters of campaign finance reform have every right \nnot to back down in the face of a filibuster.\n  The unanimous consent agreement proposed that each of us agree that \nthe McCain-Feingold proposal be withdrawn if we do not get 60 votes on \nthe first try to close off a filibuster. But as long as we have a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate supporting passage of campaign \nfinance reform, we should be able to defeat efforts to withdraw the \nMcCain-Feingold bill from Senate consideration. Opponents can \nfilibuster, but supporters don't have to agree in advance to withdraw \nin the face of that filibuster.\n  The unanimous consent agreement, however, would require supporters to \nagree to withdraw if we don't achieve, on the first try, the 60 votes \nnecessary to close off the filibuster.\n  The unanimous consent agreement said that not sooner than the third \ncalendar day of consideration a cloture motion may be filed on the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, and if cloture is not invoked, the bill will be \nplaced back on the calendar. It then said that it will not be in order \nduring the remainder of the first session of the 106th Congress for the \nSenate to consider issues relevant to campaign reform. This agreement \nwould lock the Senate into relying on the one cloture vote to determine \nwhether the fight for campaign finance reform, this year, lives or \ndies.\n  I cannot agree with that proposal. If we can't at first get 60 votes \nto close off the filibuster, I can't agree to putting the McCain-\nFeingold bill back on the calendar and just calling it quits for the \nyear. The proposed time agreement would have us do that.\n  If it takes an all-out battle to keep campaign finance reform on the \nfront burner of this Congress, I believe we should be prepared to wage \nsuch a battle. Opponents say they are prepared to wage such a battle in \nopposition. Supporters surely feel just as passionately in support of \nthis bill as opponents do in opposition.\n  Another term of the agreement with respect to the consideration of \namendments is also unacceptable to me. The proposed agreement says:\n\n       If an amendment is not tabled, it will be in order to lay \n     aside such amendment for two calendar days.\n\n  The unusual provision allowing an amendment which the Senate has \nfailed to table to be laid aside for 2 days puts in question whether \nsuch amendments will be voted on after they are not tabled prior to the \ncloture vote. I am afraid this provision would cause more mischief than \nfacilitate serious consideration of key campaign finance issues.\n  I objected--and do object--to the unanimous consent agreement which \nwas proposed yesterday. But I am, of course, willing to work with \ncolleagues to try to address the concerns that I have.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that I am speaking as one Senator who was \nasked to participate in a unanimous consent agreement. The proponents, \nthe sponsors of the bill, of course, with the leadership, have every \nright to work out any arrangement they see fit.\n  But to ask unanimous consent from this Senator to agree to proceeding \nin this form is something to which I objected, and do object, as a \nSenator.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the managers, \nthe good Senators, who have worked very hard to adopt this language.\n  This implements the heart of the amendment which I previously \noffered. I want to read it so that people who are following this \ndebate--it is very short--can understand why this is important.\n  The amendment reads:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for developing and \n     promulgating Departmental security, counterintelligence and \n     intelligence policies, and may use his immediate staff to \n     assist him in developing and promulgating such policies.\n\n  With one minute change, that is the same sentence which was \npreviously in my amendment.\n  The next sentence is:\n\n       The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship is responsible \n     for implementation of all security, counterintelligence and \n     intelligence policies within the Agency for Nuclear \n     Stewardship.\n\n  I think that is basically the previous language.\n  The one change is really in the third sentence, which is now with \nthis amendment:\n\n       The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship may establish \n     agency-specific policies unless disapproved by the Secretary.\n\n  That was the intention of the third sentence in effect.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1268 to amendment No. 1258.\n       In the fourth sentence of section 213(c) of the Department \n     of Energy Organization Act, as proposed by subsection (c) of \n     the amendment, insert after ``to any Department official'' \n     the following: ``other than the Deputy Secretary''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment makes it possible for the \nSecretary of Energy to fully utilize his Deputy Secretary. The Deputy \nSecretary of Energy, as with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is the \nNo. 2 person in the Department. The Secretary of Energy simply must be \nallowed to rely on his deputy to serve in his absence, to help with the \nrunning of the Department when he is absent and, indeed, to effectively \nbe his alter ego.\n  To be useful to the Secretary and perform his job, the Deputy \nSecretary must be involved fully in every facet of the business of the \nDepartment. This amendment will allow the Deputy Secretary to carry out \nthat very important function.\n  The bill will now have that change, that the Secretary may not \ndelegate to any departmental official other than the deputy the duty to \nservice or direct the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  This is a very important change. I thank the managers for their \nsupport of this change. I believe it has broad support. I hope it will \npass.\n  The organizational chart contained in the Rudman panel report, which \ngraphically displays the panel's recommendation to create a new \nseparately organized Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, includes the \nDeputy Secretary in the same box as the Secretary. The amendment before \nthe Senate today, however, is silent with respect to the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Deputy Secretary.\n  The absence of any reference to the Deputy Secretary of Energy could \nbe simply an oversight. But given the language in the underlying \namendment that prohibits all others in the Department of Energy, except \nthe Secretary, from supervising or directing the new Agency or its \nstaff, I believe the role of the Deputy should be clearly spelled out.\n  Each of the separately organized agencies of the Department of \nDefense, sited as organizational models by Senators Rudman's panel, \nrelies heavily on the involvement of the Deputy Secretary of Defense. \nIndeed, the Deputy Secretary of Defense has a full delegation of \nresponsibility from the Secretary of Defense to act for the Secretary.\n  This amendment removes the potential for confusion about the role of \nthe Deputy Secretary of Energy and is consistent with the \norganizational charts contained in the Rudman panel report that \ndescribe the organization of the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I think it is a good amendment. I believe \nthe amendment has been cleared by Senator Domenici as well. I don't \nthink there is any problem with this amendment at all. I think it is a \ngood amendment and a good improvement in the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Nebraska. \nThis is an agreed-on amendment. A lot of work has gone into it. I \ncommend the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Arizona, and also \nthe Senator from New Mexico in fashioning this with their staff.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1268) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendments which we have just adopted \nimprove the underlying provision. Nevertheless, there are some \nimportant concerns that were raised, and I want to take a moment to \naddress them and speak to the hope they be addressed in conference. Let \nme go through some of these concerns.\n  First, section (k) of the amendment prohibits anybody in the \nDepartment except for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary from providing \nsupervision or direction to the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  That could prohibit certain specific statutory authorities found in \nother laws from being implemented. For instance, the Chief Financial \nOfficers Act established some very specific authorities and duties for \nchief financial officers. They must direct all aspects of a \ndepartment's fiscal policy.\n  Second, the same is true for the Inspector Generals Act. The \ninspector general has independent investigatory authority over the \nentire Department of Energy, including the new Agency. This authority \nincludes the authority to direct and conduct investigations unimpeded. \nTo conduct the investigations, the inspector general has, by law, full \naccess to everyone in the department.\n  Those two important pieces of law, existing legislation, are key \ntools in avoiding waste, fraud, and abuse. I do not believe that we can \nnor should nor perhaps even intend in this amendment, this underlying \namendment, to modify them. But it is unclear and I hope it will be \nclarified in conference so we do not impede the operation of those laws \nby this language.\n  Third, the method of appointing certain employees of the new Agency, \nin my judgment, violates the appointments clause of the Constitution. \nFor instance, in section 213 (j)(1), the amendment says that ``the \nUnder Secretary shall, with the approval of the Secretary and Director \nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation, designate the chief of \nCounterintelligence. . . .'' That responsibility, making an \nappointment, is, under the appointments clause, restricted to the \nSecretary or the President of the United States. I do not think we can \ndelegate that authority by statute to this new Agency Director.\n  Fourth, there are certain restrictions on how the head of the new \nAgency submits reports to Congress, which I believe run afoul of the \nseparation of powers doctrine.\n  Fifth, there are still too many restrictions on the Secretary's \nauthority to control and direct the Agency.\n  Sixth, there are provisions which establish new relationships between \nthe Department of Energy contractors and Federal employees of the \nDepartment. Those relationships may violate the current operating \ncontracts for DOE facilities. More important, these new relationships \nmay make these contractor employees Federal employees for certain \npurposes, such as the Federal Authority Claims Act, the Federal Drivers \nAct, and the Federal ethics statutes.\n  These are a few of the statutes that could be interpreted as being \napplicable to contractor employees, raising new issues of liability and \nresponsibilities. I believe the implications of these should be and \nmust be fully understood before we finally adopt a law in this area, a \nreorganization of this Department, and a conference report which \ncontains any such implications or changes.\n\n  These issues and others should be addressed in conference on this \nprovision. I wanted to highlight them now for our colleagues. We have \nmade some progress on this underlying amendment, on the amendment which \nI think reflects the determination of most of us that we do create this \nsemiautonomous agency. That represents, I believe, almost the consensus \nview of the Senate--pretty close to it--that we have a semiautonomous \nagency. But there are a lot of subquestions to that issue. Just \ncreating a semiautonomous agency does not resolve the myriad of \nquestions that exist in that process. Some of them have now been \nresolved. I thank my colleagues for their work with me on that.\n  Senator Bingaman has had some very important amendments which have \nbeen adopted as well. The Kyl amendment is a better amendment now that \nthose amendments of ours have been added to it. But, again, there are \nmany remaining questions and doubts which, hopefully, the conferees \nwill resolve. I wanted to bring some of those to the attention of our \ncolleague at this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to report on the status, as I \nunderstand, of where we are on the Kyl amendment. When you turn on your \ntelevision set and see what is happening in the Senate Chamber, you see \nthat the pending business is the Kyl amendment. Since that is me, I \nthought I should explain we are about ready to bring this to a \nconclusion, I think a very successful conclusion. In fact, the \nbipartisanship we were seeking to attain earlier in the day, in fact, \nwill be attained with respect to the adoption of the Kyl amendment.\n  I will back up a little bit and recapitulate where we are. The \nunderlying bill is the intelligence authorization bill. There will be a \nlittle bit of business to transact on that after the adoption of the \nKyl amendment. Then the intelligence authorization bill can be approved \nby the Senate and we can move on to other business.\n  In the meantime, the Kyl amendment is the pending amendment. That is \nthe amendment cosponsored by Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and a \nhost of others, that will reform the Department of Energy so it will be \nless likely in the future that there will be nuclear secrets walking \nout the door of our National Laboratories. That is an \noversimplification, but that is the essence of what we are trying to \ndo.\n  The reorganization involves the creation of a semiautonomous agency \nwithin the Department. We basically have followed the recommendations \nof the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in establishing \nthat new Agency.\n  There have been some amendments dealing with details of this \nreorganization that have been worked out between representatives of the \nDemocratic side and supporters of our amendment.\n  With respect to the most perplexing of the difficulties, a matter on \nwhich an earlier vote was held, where the Levin amendment was defeated, \nwe have gone back and rewritten the language of the bill and the Levin \namendment and combined the two in a way in which we think both sides \nthink we can make the legislation work. There have been some other \nconcessions, as well, to Members on the Democratic side in order to \nachieve a broad bipartisan consensus for this legislation.\n  I am pleased to report that there is an agreement, A, to bring this \nKyl amendment to a vote very soon, so I think Members should expect \nthat in the very near term we will be able to have a final vote on it; \nand, B, that it will have the concurrence of many, if not most, of the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle, as well as the Republican side \nof the aisle. That is because of the concessions that have been made in \nthis intervening time.\n  So my hope is, if there is anyone else who wishes to discuss any \naspect of the Kyl amendment, or to raise any questions about it, or \nabout the other amendments that have been offered and to one degree or \nanother worked out in the interim, that they would come and do that now \nbecause in just a matter of a few minutes we are going to propound a \nrequest to get on with the vote and then be able to move on.\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\n I know that is the leader's desire, and we would like to be able to do \nthat.\n  If there isn't anybody at this point who wants to weigh in, let me \nadd one other point about the reason why the Senate is acting on this \nimportant matter. At the end of the day, for the Nation, there is \nnothing more important than our national security. We in the Senate and \nthe House and the President understand that probably our first \nobligation is to protect the American people.\n  One of the stable elements of the peace that has prevailed over the \nlast many decades has been the nuclear stockpile of the United States, \nthe fact that we have nuclear weapons that provide a deterrent to any \nattack by an aggressor that would threaten the homeland of the United \nStates.\n  It is a horrible thing to ever contemplate using those weapons, but \nit is undeniable that the threat of nuclear retaliation has enabled us \nto have a period of peace literally since World War II with our major \nadversaries.\n  It is important that the stability the world has seen because of the \ncreation of those weapons not be disrupted by other nations acquiring \nthe same weapons. Obviously, that could unbalance this stability that \nhas been created over time because of the U.S. possession of those \nweapons.\n  We now know that the design information for all of the nuclear \nwarheads that are currently in our useful arsenal are in the hands of \npeople who could cause us harm if they were able to build weapons from \nthat data, from those plans. That is a very distressing fact.\n  There are ways that we can hope to prevent the development of those \nweapons. It is going to require us to be very careful about what we \nsell to other countries and what we permit by way of technology \ntransfer because it is still difficult to build a nuclear weapon even \nif you have the designs. You have to have the materials; you have to \nhave the computing capacity and the machining capacity, and all the \nrest of it.\n\n  So there may still be some ability on our part to have control over \nour own destiny. There is no question we have now been put at risk \nbecause of the theft of these secrets. The National Laboratories, which \nare responsible for developing those nuclear weapons, have begun to \nembark upon a very important project called the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram in which we will attempt to be able to certify the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile through computing which will \nsimulate nuclear testing.\n  If that program is compromised, it would, in effect, be the \ncompromise of everything we have, not just the design information but \nalso our analysis of how all these things work.\n  If we cannot protect that, we cannot protect our national security. \nThat is one of the reasons why it is important for us to ensure that \nnothing else happens in the way of security breaches at our National \nLabs.\n  The Rudman report made it very clear that under the existing \norganization of the Department of Energy, we could not guarantee that. \nThere were too many people that had too much influence over things, \nand, in effect, everybody's responsibility became nobody's \nresponsibility. As a result, that recommendation was: We have to \nreorganize the Department; and it cannot reorganize itself.\n  Congress needs to pass a statute that provides for that \nreorganization. That is why we brought forth the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski \namendment. That is why I am very proud of the fact that soon the Senate \nis going to vote to approve that amendment. By putting it on the \nintelligence authorization bill, we will enable it to become the law of \nthe land and enable the Department of Energy to be reorganized with \nthis semiautonomous agency having jurisdiction over the nuclear \nprograms, including the National Laboratories.\n  That will be a very big step. No one should rest easy that this is \nthe end of the issue, that we do not have to worry about spying, that \nthis will stop the espionage or the release of secrets that other \npeople should not have. But at least it is one thing we can do, and we \nbelieve it will have a significant impact in at least this one area.\n  I guess one of the things many of us were saying was: If we can't do \nthis now, after all of this time, then we think it is fairly clear we \ncan't protect the national security of the United States.\n  I am not saying this is easy. But if we cannot accomplish this \nreorganization, then, frankly, we are not up to the task. That is why I \nam so glad we are going to be able to effect this reorganization. After \nwe pass this bill, I am very hopeful that our friends in the House will \nbe willing to work with us. If they have additional ideas, obviously, \nwe want to work with them. But we need to send to the President a bill \nthat he can sign. After all, his own advisory board made the \nrecommendations we are attempting to follow.\n  If I am correct that what we have done has resulted in a broad \nbipartisan consensus, we will be able to make it clear to the executive \nbranch of the Government that it is the will of the Congress--not just \none party, the majority party of the Congress--and that should enable \nus to also then gain the support from the Secretary of Energy, who has \nacknowledged that he supports the basic concept of a semiautonomous \nagency but had some disagreements with us about specifics. By making \nsome changes that go some distance toward meeting his objections, I \nhope we will not only have the support of both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Congress but also the Secretary of Energy because we \nhave to get about this quickly.\n\n  There is no reason, after the Senate acts today, hopefully, that the \nprocess cannot begin in anticipation of the fact that this will be the \nlaw. No one has to wait until September or whatever date we might \nactually be able to get the President's signature on this law. This \nSecretary of Energy has a great opportunity; as the person who came \ninto office about the time all of these revelations were made public \nand who himself began to make some changes in a positive way, he is in \na unique position now to take advantage of the reorganization that we \nwill present to him and actually institute the changes so that his \nsuccessor, a year and a half from now, whoever that might be, \npresumably will have in place a very well-functioning Department of \nEnergy with a semiautonomous agency in charge of our nuclear weapons \nprograms.\n  That is something this Secretary will have the opportunity to do. But \nit is a real challenge for him. If he is able to accomplish that, he \nwill certainly have earned his place in history. Meanwhile, it is up to \nus to earn our place in history by adopting this legislation and moving \nthe process forward.\n  I am very hopeful we will not see any additional delays now. There \nhave been some in the past. I had complained about that earlier in the \nday. I am hopeful we will not see any additional delays, that we will \nmove this legislation forward, get it signed into law, and get it \nimplemented. If we do that, we will be proud of the fact that we have \nhelped the security of the people of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I will soon propound a request with respect to a vote \non my amendment. I will check with a couple other people before I do \nthat. But, again, I think Members should expect that pretty soon we \nwill be having a vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, regarding an issue \nassociated with the implementation of the Kyl, Domenici, Murkowski \namendment. This amendment creates a new semi-autonomous Agency for \nNuclear Stewardship within the Department of Energy by collecting \ntogether various national security programs and nuclear weapons \nlaboratories and facilities into a new agency. My state of Idaho hosts \ntwo Department of Energy laboratories--the Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory West. \nSince these laboratories do not meet the definition of nuclear weapons \nlaboratories, they are not included in the amendment, but I want to \nraise for my colleagues some of the complexities of implementing this \nnew organizational structure.\n  As I said, the laboratories in my state are not included in the \nproposal for the new agency but it is important to understand that \nIdaho's laboratories are making significant contributions to national \nsecurity. Just as my colleagues from New Mexico have mentioned earlier \nin this debate, that we\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nmust do nothing to impede the continued contribution of the weapons \nlaboratories to the critical civilian missions of the Department of \nEnergy, I want to emphasize and confirm my colleague's agreement that \nthe non-weapons laboratories shall continue to contribute and have \ntheir capabilities made available to the national security programs of \nthe Department of Energy.\n  To clarify this point, I would like to use a specific example from \nthe Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The \nAdvanced Test Reactor, or ATR, in Idaho is the only world-class test \nreactor left in the United States. I do not state this as a boast, but \nas a fact. The ATR has a vital role in both improving the operation of \nthe nuclear Navy and supporting our nation's future nuclear energy \nresearch and development endeavors. In addition, this important \nfacility has the potential to attract significant international \ninterest and investment. I am concerned that this amendment, which \nmoves the Naval Reactors program from under the umbrella of DOE's \nnuclear research and development program to the new agency, will also \nreassign responsibility for this reactor.\n  Reassigning the responsibility for this reactor to the new agency \nwould be harmful from two perspectives. First, our Naval Reactors \nprogram is a user of this facility but should not be burdened with its \noperation and maintenance. Second, moving responsibility for this \nreactor out of the nuclear research and development program could \ninadvertently endanger its use by the U.S. civilian and international \nresearch community. Since this latter use is growing and very important \nto our future civilian nuclear research activities, could I ask my \ncolleague from New Mexico to confirm that it is not the intent of this \namendment to move responsibility for the Advanced Test Reactor when \nmoving the Naval Reactors program to the new agency?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In responding, let me first confirm for my friend from \nIdaho that it is not the intent of this amendment to shift or reassign \nresponsibility for Idaho's Advanced Test Reactor to the new Agency for \nNuclear Stewardship. Let me further acknowledge the larger issue that \nmy colleague has raised, by stating that under the new Departmental \nstructure created by the Kyl, Domenici, Murkowski amendment the \nSecretary of Energy should continue to ensure that the capabilities, \nskills and unique expertise of all of the Department's laboratories are \nmade available to the national security programs of DOE. In this way, \nthe beneficial collaboration between defense and non-defense sectors of \nthe Department--a collaboration that has been taking place over the \nentire history of DOE--will continue under the new structure.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague for that clarification and assurance. \nThe Naval Reactors program has a proud history in Idaho. All spent \nnaval nuclear fuel is sent to Idaho for examination and storage pending \nits permanent disposition. Although Idaho's facilities are not included \nin the new agency, I am assured that the many ways in which Idaho's \nlaboratories contribute to our national security will continue under \nthis new organizational structure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Mr. \nDomenici's amendment to the Department of Energy reorganization \namendment. I have been a strong supporter of the need to reorganize the \ndefense labs in order to improve security and I applaud the sponsors of \nthe reorganization amendment that we will be considering. It is of \noverriding importance that we take all necessary actions to protect our \nnational security.\n  However, as I have considered the very serious need to address \nsecurity threats, I have also been listening closely to the debate \nabout how environment, safety, and health protections can best be \nincorporated into the Department of Energy's operations as they relate \nto the weapons labs.\n  The legacy of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of \nEnergy regarding environmental protection is not a proud one. Since the \nfirst days of the Atomic Energy Commission over 40 years ago, weapons \nproduction programs and facilities emphasized production and too often \nneglected environmental safety. By the 1980s, the history of \nmismanagement caught up with the Agency, when 17 major plants in 13 \nstates, employing 80,000 people were brought to a standstill because of \na series of accidents and leaks. Over 10,000 individual sites have been \ndocumented where toxic or radioactive substances were improperly \nabandoned or released into soil, groundwater, or surface waters. \n``Tiger Teams'' of trained investigators were sent to plants to ensure \ncompliance with environmental and safety requirements. The Agency and \nthe public have paid for the cost of this mismanagement: the price tag \nof past mistakes is now at about $250 billion dollars, or $6 billion a \nyear. Clearly we have to learn from the past as we think about how to \ndeal with environment and safety in the future.\n  Based on the Rudman report, there is a strong case made for treating \nenvironment and safety issues separately. Our former colleague Warren \nRudman himself has said that environment and health issues ``ought to \nstay where they ought to stay, with the Secretary . . . because I know \nwhat we all went through back during the 1980s.'' GAO has testified on \nnumerous occasions that independent oversight is critical to ensuring \nadequate protection of health and safety. They have said explicitly \nthat this oversight needs to encompass on-site reviews of compliance \nwith environmental and safety laws.\n  Much has changed since the time that rampant disregard for \nenvironmental protections at the labs was discovered. Over time, we as \na society, within industry, and within government have come to \nincorporate environment and health concerns more fully into both policy \nand practice. And I have no reason to believe that there would be any \nintentional disregard for environmental and health concerns if the \nthose functions were put under the supervision of the Agency for \nNuclear Stewardship. However, given the potential magnitude of problems \nthat could be caused even by simple, honest mistakes, the best course \nof action is to be prudent. I therefore support the Domenici amendment \nbecause it allows the Secretary of the Department of Energy to ensure \ncompliance with all environmental, safety and health requirements, \nwhile protecting the security of the weapons labs. I am pleased that we \nwere able to work out this issue as part of the restructuring proposal.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor to the Kyl/\nDomenici/Murkowski amendment requiring reorganization of the Department \nof Energy.\n  Over the past several months, I have been deeply troubled by the \nrevelations regarding the efforts made by the People's Republic of \nChina to acquire our most sensitive technology. The report of the House \nSelect Committee revealed that design information has been stolen on \nall of the nuclear warheads that the United States currently has \ndeployed. Among the material stolen by China was design information on \nthe W-88, the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the U.S. has ever \nbuilt. We use the W-88 on the sixth-generation ballistic missiles \ncarried aboard our nuclear submarine fleet.\n  With this information, the PRC has rapidly assimilated stolen nuclear \nsecrets into its own weapons systems and advanced their nuclear program \nby approximately forty years. Not only am I deeply concerned about \nthese incidents of espionage, I am even more disturbed by the \nlackadaisical response by the Clinton Administration. After learning \nabout the theft of information in 1995, the Administration failed to \nundertake a serious reassessment of our intelligence community. When \nquestioned a few months ago about the Department of Energy's security \nstructure, Secretary Bill Richardson commented, ``whoever figured it \nout must've been smoking dope or drunk.'' What a sobering assessment, \nindeed, of the state of security at our nuclear weapons laboratories. \nIn fact, only after the espionage accounts hit the news media earlier \nthis year did the President take any action to reevaluate the security \nof our weapons labs.\n  In March, the President requested that the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) undertake an inquiry and issue a \nreport on the security threat at the Department of Energy's weapons \nlabs. This review, chaired by the former Senator Warren B. Rudman, \nfound that the Department of Energy is responsible for the worst \nsecurity record that the members of\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\nthe advisory board had ever encountered. The Department devoted far too \nlittle time, attention, and resources to the responsibilities of \nsecurity and counterintelligence. Without change, it is feared that the \nDepartment of Energy laboratories would continue to be a major target \nof foreign intelligence services. According to the Rudman report, the \nonly way to combat these problems is through a reorganization which \ntakes the oversight of our weapons labs away from the ``dysfunctional \nbureaucracy'' of the Department of Energy and gives it to a new, semi-\nautonomous agency.\n  The Kyl/Domenici/Murkowski amendment, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor, will begin the reform efforts at the Department of Energy by \nestablishing a separate organizational entity, the Agency for Nuclear \nStewardship, with clear lines of authority, accountability, and \nresponsibility. These changes will help correct the current \norganizational disarray and ensure that all programs and activities \nrelated to national security functions receive proper attention and \noversight. These changes will strengthen the security and protection of \nour most vital technological secrets and ensure that if violations do \noccur, the responsible parties are readily identified, and the proper \ncorrective actions put into place immediately.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this amendment to \nhelp ensure the security of our nation for years to come.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside momentarily for the purpose of \nconsidering an amendment that I propose to offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1269\n\n (Purpose: To terminate the exemption of certain contractors and other \n    entities from civil penalties for violations of nuclear safety \n           requirements under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1269.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TERMINATION OF EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTORS AND \n                   OTHER ENTITIES FROM CIVIL PENALTIES FOR \n                   VIOLATIONS OF NUCLEAR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS UNDER \n                   ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954.\n\n       (a) Nonprofit Educational Institutions.--Subsection b. (2) \n     of section 234A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2282a) is amended by striking the second sentence.\n       (b) Liability of Nonprofit Contractors.--Subsection b. of \n     that section is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the amounts of civil \n     penalties for violations of this section by nonprofit \n     contractors of the Department shall be determined in \n     accordance with the schedule of penalties employed by the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the General Statement of \n     Policies and Procedures for NRC Enforcement for similar \n     violations by nonprofit contractors.\n       ``(B) A civil penalty may be imposed on a nonprofit \n     contractor of the Department for a violation of this section \n     only to the extent that such civil penalty, when aggregated \n     with any other penalties under the contract concerned at the \n     time of the imposition of such civil penalty, does not exceed \n     the performance fee of the contractor under such contract.''.\n       (c) Specified Contractors.--That section is further amended \n     by striking subsection d..\n       (d) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     and shall apply with respect to violations specified in \n     section 234A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 that occur on \n     or after that date.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to call your attention to a \nsituation that I became aware of only a short time ago. An article that \nappeared in the June 28 issue of Newsweek caught my attention. It is \nentitled ``Nuclear Leaks of Another Kind.''\n  This was in the context of a discussion we have had about some of the \nespionage activity that has occurred in our labs and, particularly, the \nissue as it relates to Los Alamos in recent months. Let me share an \nexcerpt so my colleagues will get the flavor of the article and \nunderstand the amendment I am offering and its underlying purpose.\n  The article begins by saying:\n\n       Nuclear secrets aren't the only kind of unauthorized leaks \n     from U.S. weapons labs. According to a General Accounting \n     Office draft report obtained by Newsweek, over the past three \n     weeks, the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs were \n     assessed fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars for safety \n     violations, including exposing their employees to radiation \n     levels that exceed the standards promulgated by the \n     Department of Energy.\n\n  Then it goes on to say that, under the law, in an anomaly--which the \noccupant of the Chair will readily appreciate because of his own \nextraordinary and impressive legal background--we make a distinction \nwith respect to the contractor status of those who work in the DOE \nlabs. If the contractor is a contractor who is a private entrepreneur--\nthat is to say, it is a profit-making contractor--these fines for \nsafety violations--one in particular that caught my eye is the \nradiation standards to protect the employees according to the DOE \npromulgated standards. With respect to those fines that would be \nimposed upon a contractor who is a private sector contractor, the fines \nare assessed and collected. But under what I consider an extraordinary \nanomaly in the law, if you are a nonprofit contractor, the very \nviolation--again, fundamental to the essence of protecting the health \nand safety of the employees; namely, the radiation standard they would \nbe exposed to--for those kinds of violations, a fine is assessed but is \nnever collected.\n  So in effect we have a totally inconsistent policy. One says that if \nyou are a private contractor and you are an entrepreneur and are in the \nbusiness to make money or to profit from that--all of which is very \nlegitimate--and you violate one of the DOE's safety regulations and you \nare fined, you are assessed initially, and the fine is collected. If \nyou are a nonprofit, you are assessed for the identical violation, but \nit is never collected.\n  Let me say that the General Accounting Office report that was \nreferenced in this Newsweek article has now been made public in its \nfinal form. This is a document issued June 1999: General Accounting \nOffice, Department of Energy Nuclear Safety, ``Enforcement Program \nShould Be Strengthened.''\n  This report gives additional persuasive force to what I propose in \nthe amendment. This General Accounting Office report makes an important \npoint that if the regulations were promulgated by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the NRC, no distinction is made between the \nprivate sector contractor and the public sector contractor. That is to \nsay, if a violation occurs with respect to the nonprofit contractor, \nand it is a violation of health and safety standards, then the \nnonprofit is assessed and a fine may be collected. So we have an \nanomaly in the law that makes no public policy sense at all.\n  Let me make it clear to my colleagues that it is not my intention to \nimpose onerous fines on nonprofit entities that have a contract. But as \nthe General Accounting Office makes very clear, the fact that a fine \nmay be collected has a deterrent value. As this report further makes \nthe point, there is no rational basis--none whatsoever--in making the \ndistinction between for-profit and nonprofit contractors, and the \nfurther point that the purpose of imposing these civil penalties is not \nto collect fines but to encourage contractors to perform safely, that \nis the issue that I seek to address.\n\n  I recognize the concern that the nonprofits raise that, my golly, if \nyou change the law, somehow this may constitute an invasion of our \nendowment moneys; that all of this could be compromised. Let me assure \nmy colleagues that nothing is further from the truth. That is not what \nI intend.\n  So as a further effort to assuage those concerns in the amendment \nthat\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nis before this body, we would limit any fine that was assessed to the \namount of the performance fee provided to the nonprofit contractor by \nthe Department. Let me repeat that. In effect, we would put a ceiling, \na limit, if you will, on any fine that would be assessed and would say \nthat, in no event, notwithstanding the extent, severity, and the \nextended period of time in which the violation may have occurred, may \nthe fine exceed the performance fee that you are provided. It strikes \nme that that addresses fairly and reasonably the concern that a \nnonprofit would have in terms of the potential invasion of the \nendowments.\n  The point I seek to emphasize is that nonprofits have a track record \nof some very extensive fines. The assessments, according to the report, \namount to several hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we are not \ntalking about something that is theoretical, hypothetical, or highly \nspeculative; it has occurred. And, remember, under current law, with \nrespect to nonprofits, a fine can be assessed but never collected. So \nhuman nature tells us--and our entire legal system is structured on \nthis premise--that for people who violate the rules, whether it is a \nspeed limit or some other regulation, the fact that one can be fined or \ncan be subject to some kind of a sanction, tends to influence our \nbehavior in a positive way. That is, we don't do that sort of thing. No \none is accusing the nonprofits of bad faith. But I must say we have not \ngotten their attention with respect to these violations.\n\n  I conclude, as I began, by describing the nature of these violations. \nWe are not talking about some highly technical extenuated rule or \nregulation that only a flyspeck--as we used to say--lawyer could pick \nup. We are talking about something fundamental to the public health and \nsafety. That is the radiation standard--the exposure to which employees \nin these laboratories could be exposed.\n  I can't think of anything that would be more significant or more \nimportant in terms of health and safety than to make sure the \nlaboratory is adhering to a radiation standard which the Department of \nEnergy has promulgated, which they say is to observe to protect health \nand safety.\n  Let me say that I have had a little experience in this area, not as a \ntechnical person, but many years ago in my youth I worked as an \nemployee at the Nevada Test Site. Every employee who entered the Nevada \nTest Site was given a badge. That badge had in it a gasometer. The \nreason for that is this was during the days of atmospheric testing \nprograms. It was to periodically check to make sure no employee by \ninadvertence or accident was exposed to a higher radiation standard \nthan had been determined necessary for the protection of the health and \nsafety of that employee.\n  In the same spirit, these standards have been imposed to protect the \nhealth and safety of those individuals who work in the lab. That is the \nkind of violation about which we are talking.\n  I have attempted to work some type of an accommodation through the \nvery able manager of the bill, and others, particularly the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, who understandably have an \ninterest in this measure. We have not been able to reach an agreement.\n  I want to serve notice that this is not the last time this amendment \nwill surface. This is a gross injustice to those employees who serve in \nthe lab, and their families. Their health and safety can be endangered. \nAnd those who would do so face no penalty under the law.\n  I will not ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment. I intend to \nwithdraw the amendment at the appropriate time, after the distinguished \nchairman of the committee responds. But this is an issue which must be \naddressed. It will be addressed by this Senator. We will have a series \nof votes on this at a later point in time if we are not able to reach \nan accommodation.\n  I will be happy to either yield the floor or to respond to any \nquestions that the able managers of the bill have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  First of all, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Bryan, who \nbrought this to the attention of the Senate. We have discussed this \nbefore. He feels very strongly about it. I believe if you look at it in \nits entirety, it has some merit. But I also think this should be \naddressed at the level of the appropriate committee. At the time when \nhe pursues this, I will tell every one of my colleagues to look at this \nvery carefully because I believe what he is proposing should be \nevaluated in that light. Personally, I think it has some merit.\n  I commend the Senator from Nevada, who is also a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, and a senior member. Perhaps soon he will be \nthe vice chairman of the committee--next year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Nevada for \nbringing this to our attention. I was not aware of the problem. I look \nforward to the opportunity of having a chance to work with the Senator \nto change the law and to end the problem he has identified.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank both the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nNebraska, with whom I have the privilege of working closely in the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  We need to address that. His comments have been very helpful and \nencouraging. We want to work through this and protect the employees in \nthese critically important national security facilities.\n  I am not sure of the parliamentary vehicle that I may need to employ. \nIf I need to ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment--I don't \nthink I need that--if I do, I will ask for it.\n  If the Chair will guide the gentleman from Nevada, I will ease us out \nof this parliamentary situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would need to ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1269 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1269) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1258\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to address the Senate for a few \nmoments about a topic I know has consumed the attention of each and \nevery one of us in this Chamber, indeed all Americans, over the past \nseveral days, and that is the tragic deaths of John Kennedy, Jr., his \nwife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette.\n  Permit me, if you will, to engage in a little regional chauvinism, \nfor there are few things in life so pleasant as a New England summer \nday. It is glorious to behold. The warm sweet air, the cold waters of \nits rivers and lakes and ocean seem to command a celebration of the \nvery simple pleasures of life.\n  On this past Saturday, though, the inherent joy of a New England \nsummer season dissolved throughout America with the news that these \nthree young people were lost off the New England coast. Lost on a day \nthat seemed meant for gladness, not grief. Lost in waters that should \nhave welcomed pleasure, not disaster. For one family, the Kennedy \nfamily, a moment of a family's supreme joy--a wedding--was snatched \ngreedily by the hand of a very cruel fate, indeed.\n\n  Most of us spent the better part of this past weekend hoping against \nhope that John and Carolyn and Lauren could be found safe and alive. By \nSunday night we were resigned to the awful truth. Two American families \nhave endured unspeakable loss.\n  One of those families, which is represented by the Bessette and \nFreeman families, we know very little about. They are constituents of \nmine and my colleague, Senator Lieberman. We know very little about \nthem other than the fact of their tragic loss. We can only imagine the \njoy and love and, yes, the easy and brilliant summer days, that they \nshared with these two remarkable and talented young women.\n  The other family we know a great deal about--about its moments of \ntriumph and tragedy--and through it all their consistent service to our \nNation and to humanity.\n  It happens that the patriarch, if you will, today of that family is \nour colleague and one of my dearest friends in this body, Ted Kennedy. \nWe can only wonder at the immense burden of the grief he carries for \nhis relatives over this loss and over all the other senseless, \nexcruciating losses endured by the Kennedy family over the years. Those \nof us who have come to know him can only admire his courage and \nperseverance in the face of adversity which would wither the will of \nother men.\n  I know I speak for all of us here, and that I echo the sentiments \nexpressed here on the floor this morning and last evening by other \ncolleagues, in saying that we send our deepest, deepest sympathies to \nhim, to his family, and to the family of Carolyn and Lauren Bessette.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I cannot add to the words of Senator \nDodd. I thank him for what he said on the floor of the Senate. And I \nsay to him that what he said represents how I feel as a Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am about to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest on the juvenile justice conference. I notified the \ndistinguished majority leader that I would be doing this earlier, and a \nday ago I also notified the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I do it not in expectation the unanimous consent request \nwill be agreed to but to, I hope, move this ball down the field.\n  So my request is this: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1501, the House juvenile justice \nbill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and that the text \nof S. 254, as passed by the Senate, minus the provision added by \nSenator Feinstein's amendment No. 343, as modified, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; the bill be passed, as amended; the Senate insist on its \namendment and request a conference with the House; that the conferees \nbe instructed to include in the conference report the provision added \nby Senator Feinstein's amendment No. 343 to S. 254; and that the Chair \nbe authorized to appoint conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. I reserve the right to object--and I will object.\n  First of all, this is the kind of motion that usually the majority \nleader would make, and it is my intent to do that in the near future. I \nthink we should go to conference on this issue. The juvenile justice \nbill came from the Judiciary Committee. The committee had been working \non it, I think, for 3 years. Senators on both sides of the aisle worked \non that bill. It included a variety of Senators, including, obviously, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Hatch, Senator Feinstein, Senator Sessions, \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Thompson, and a whole number of Senators over \na period of years.\n  It does have very important provisions in regard to how do you deal \nwith juvenile crime, how do you try offenders, and where do you \nincarcerate them. It deals with the real world problems of trying to \ndeal with juvenile crime, including security in our schools. \nSpecifically, it provides for metal detectors at our schools. It has \nprograms that deal with alcohol abuse, drug abuse. It has some very \nimportant\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\namendments dealing with values in society and how we can help in that \narea with our young people.\n  So I think this is legislation that should go to conference. It is my \nintent to move to go to conference and to appoint conferees. However, \nthere have been some Senators who had some concerns about it both in \nterms of the makeup of who the conferees would be, but also I think it \nwould be fair to say that Senator Smith of New Hampshire has indicated \nthat he would be opposed to going to conference at this time. I have \nbeen working with him to see how that procedure could be worked out. I \nknow most Senators don't get into some of the esoteric rules around \nhere, but believe me, we need to try to find a way to work it out where \nwe can get to conference. I am trying to do that. At an appropriate \ntime, within the next 2 weeks, I will do so--if not this week, next \nweek. The only reason I didn't do it this week is because of \ninterminable delays by the Senate on other issues.\n\n  We had the whole of last week tied up with the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We didn't want to interrupt the Patients' Bill of Rights for a \n3- or 4-hour process to appoint conferees. And then this week we have \nbeen dragging all day and yesterday on a question we should have done \nlike that--reorganization of the Department of Energy. Hearings have \nbeen held on it. We had a good proposal. Instead, we have been talking \nand chatting here all day. Now it is 6 o'clock and we still have not \ngotten it done, the intelligence authorization bill, an authorization \nfor intelligence, the CIA. Give me a break.\n  If the Senate would like for us to act on some of these issues, then \nthe Senate needs to find a way to quit delaying and dragging out other \nissues. We have appropriations bills to do. We need to get going on \nthem.\n  The main thing I want to assure the Senate is, I think we should go \nto conference. I intend for us to go to conference. If Senators on both \nsides will work with me and support my effort to do that, I think we \nwill get an overwhelming vote to do that. But as is the case with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, when a Senator or Senators have \nproblems, my disposition is to try to see if we can work it out in a \nway that is acceptable to him or her. That is my intent.\n  Mr. President, I make that explanation as to what is happening. We do \nintend to go to conference. With the cooperation of both sides of the \naisle, I am sure we will go to conference.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the explanation of the \ndistinguished majority leader. He and I had discussed this earlier. I \nanticipated both the objection and the explanation.\n  I fully concur that such a unanimous consent request would normally \nbe made by the leadership, but it is also the reason I notified both \nthe distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic \nleader that I would do this. I had expressed my concern, actually, \nbefore the Fourth of July recess, how the Congress is able to move \nlegislation and move it quickly if the right interests want it. I \ncompared the priority being put on two separate pieces of legislation, \nS. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, and H.R. 775, the Y2K \nAct, to show how this works.\n  The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate \nafter 2 weeks of open debate, after significant improvements, on May \n20. That was a vote, as I recall, of 73-25, a bipartisan vote. On June \n17, the House passed its version of this legislation but chose not to \ntake up the Senate bill and insert its language, as is standard \npractice. Nor has the Republican leadership in the House made any \neffort over the past month to seek a House-Senate conference or to \nappoint House conferees.\n  Instead, what the other body did was send the Senate a blue slip, \nreturning S. 254 to the Senate on the ground it contained a revenue \nprovision that must originate in the House. The provision they point to \nis the amendment to S. 254 that would amend the Federal Criminal Code \nto ban the import of high-capacity ammunition clips. Whatever the \nmerits are of that particular provision, the majority thought that did \nhave merit. I voted against it. But it appears to me that no matter \nwhich side one is on, the House resorted to a procedural technicality \nto avoid a conference on juvenile justice legislation.\n  The amendment is in the final bill which a majority of us, three-\nquarters of us, voted for. The Senate has so far taken no steps to \nproceed to conference on the juvenile justice bill or to appoint \nconferees. This delay costs valuable time to get the juvenile justice \nlegislation enacted before school resumes this fall.\n  I appreciate the words of the distinguished majority leader that we \nwill try to move quickly to it, but I mention this as a contrast to the \npace of action on the juvenile justice bill when we look at the Y2K \nAct. That legislation provided special legal protections to businesses. \nAfter earlier action in the House on H.R. 775, the Y2K liability \nlimitations bill, the bill passed the Senate on June 15, almost 1 month \nafter we passed the juvenile justice bill. On June 16, the next day, \nthe Senate asked for a House-Senate conference and appointed its \nconferees. The House agreed to the conference and appointed its own \nconferees. The legislation immediately went to conference. The \nconference met that same day, on June 24. After a weekend break for \nextensive negotiations with the administration, the conference report \nwas filed on June 29. The bill was taken up, passed before the Fourth \nof July recess, and the President signed it yesterday.\n  Now, this took care of the potential liability of a lot of businesses \nunder Y2K, some found it at the expense of American consumers, but \nwhichever way it was, it become law very quickly.\n  The juvenile justice bill can make a difference in the lives of our \nchildren and families. That should be our No. 1 priority, so that we \nget the conference, conclude it, and so that new programs and \nprotections for schoolchildren can be in place when school resumes this \nfall, and not wait until this fall to do it. A lot of the programs in \nhere are designed to be available to schools when they come in.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Vermont, if the majority leader \nappoints a conference committee within the next 2 weeks, doesn't that \ndiminish the likelihood that we could even have a conference report and \ndo anything before school starts again?\n  This bill was inspired in large part by school violence and shootings \nin schools, and now we will have passed through the entire summer and \nnot have done anything in the Senate or the House to respond to that if \nwe delay this conference committee. Is that not a fact?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished senior Senator from Illinois raises a \nvalid point. This bill is designed, very substantive parts of it, for \nprograms that we in the Senate debated and I think the American public \nare in support of and thought should be in place before our children go \nback to school this fall. This prompt action is what parents have \ntalked to me about it, what school administrators have talked to me \nabout it--that they need to have it in place before the schoolchildren \ngo back this fall. They want to pass into law the things we learned \nfrom Columbine and other school tragedies.\n  That means we have a very short window, I think about 3 weeks, to \nfinish this before the August recess. We have a very short window. If \nwe don't finish this before the August recess and get it on the \nPresident's desk, I don't know how these programs will be in place.\n  Frankly, a lot has changed since my children were young enough to be \nin those classes. It may have been growing then, but the demand is \nparamount today. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. If we \ndon't do it now, we are not going to get it done on time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I salute the leadership of the Senator from Vermont. I \nhope he will renew this request on a regular basis until we have a \nconference committee appointed to pass the juvenile justice bill to do \nsomething in Congress about the school violence which American families \nunderstand is a national problem we should address.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I yield to the Senator\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nfrom New York without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and just \nwant to concur with what the Senator from Illinois said and what the \nSenator from Vermont said. We should be moving this bill. As I \nunderstand the Senate procedure, even if we wait 2 weeks to appoint \nconferees, and there is objection, we could have trouble there as well. \nSo there is no guarantee at all, given the volatility of this issue, \nthat we would go to conference even after 2 weeks. Am I correct in \nassuming that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from New York is correct. The Senator from New \nYork has sat on a number of conferences in the other body and now is a \ndistinguished and respected Member of this body. He knows from that \nexperience that conferences can take awhile, especially when you are \ndealing with criminal law. I recall the Senator from New York and I, \nwhen he served in the other body, on a major crime bill, sitting there \nuntil 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, breaking for 45 minutes while we \ngrabbed some breakfast, and going right back in around the clock again.\n  There is no guarantee if we went tonight that we could finish by \nAugust. If we wait until the last few days, it is almost impossible.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The bottom line, I say to the Senator, is that if we \nwant to get something done, we really can't afford to wait. There are \nso many slips between the cup and the lip, especially on an issue such \nas this, that we ought to be moving and not waiting 2 weeks but \nappointing conferees tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree, Mr. President.\n  I have been advised by the distinguished chairman and vice chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee that they are prepared to wrap up \nwith voice votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8933-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, under the previous order, I am to reclaim \nthe floor, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the juvenile justice bill, the reason \nwhy I have encouraged the leadership to move as quickly as they are \nable to--and I say, in regard to what the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi said earlier, I also know if he were to make the same \nrequest I made, he could face an objection. What I am urging is that we \nfind a way to move forward because to have the full impact in the \nUnited States of our juvenile justice bill, which passed by a 3-to-1 \nmargin in the Senate, we have to get it on the President's desk in its \nfinal form before the August recess so there is some chance of moving \nbefore school goes back in this fall. All of us, whether we are \nparents, grandparents, teachers, or policymakers, have been puzzling \nover the causes of children turning violent in our country.\n  Certainly all of us in our lifetimes have seen random acts of \nviolence somewhere in the country. I don't think any of us have seen \nthe severity or the number, almost a regularity, of violence we are \nseeing today. The root causes are likely multifaceted, and we know \nthat. But the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and \nsignificant step in the right direction. Passage of this bill shows \nwhen the Senate rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make \nsignificant progress. But that progress amounts to naught if the House \nand Senate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good \nbill.\n  Once conferees are appointed, there will be another point in the \nlegislative process where we will have to roll up our sleeves to work \nout differences between the House- and Senate-passed legislation.\n  Every parent in this country is concerned this summer about school \nviolence over the last 2 years. They are worried about the situation \nthey are going to confront this fall. Each of us wants to do something \nto stop that violence. There is no single cause and there is no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or on our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to at \nleast start to do something, to do our part. Now, it is unfortunate we \nare not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on \nbalanced, effective juvenile justice legislation.\n  We should not repeat the delays that happened in the last Congress on \nthe juvenile justice legislation. In the 105th Congress, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reported juvenile justice legislation in July 1997, \nbut then it was left to languish for over a year until the very end of \nthat Congress. In fact, serious efforts to make improvements to this \nbill did not even occur until the last weeks of that Congress, when it \nwas too late and we ran out of time.\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\n  The experience of the last Congress causes me to be wary of this \ndelay in action on this legislation this year. I want to be assured \nthat after the hard work so many Senators put into crafting a juvenile \njustice bill, that we go to a House-Senate conference that is fair, \nfull, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a \nstrong, bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders \nwhen the House returns a juvenile justice bill rather than proceeding \nto a conference. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this \nbipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation.\n  To this end, I circulated yesterday to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee the unanimous consent request that I made. It \nlays out a simple road map for us to proceed to a juvenile justice \nconference before the August recess and before the new school year \nbegins. I understand the unanimous consent request cannot be accepted \ntonight, but if we could accept this, or a form of it, this is what it \nwould do:\n  We would take up the House juvenile justice bill, H.R. 1501; we would \nsubstitute the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 254, amended to eliminate the \nprovision banning the import of high-capacity ammunition clips; pass \nthe bill as amended; request a conference with the House; instruct the \nconferees to include in the conference report the eliminated provision \non high-capacity ammunition clips--put it back in, because \nparliamentarily it would be allowed--and we would authorize the Chair \nto appoint conferees.\n  The fact that the House returned the Senate juvenile justice bill to \nus is not an insurmountable obstacle to get to conference on this \nimportant issue. This unanimous consent--or a form of it--would lay out \na simple procedure for us to get to conference promptly, and the \nmajority has the power to say: We agree, let's go to conference.\n  We know only too well that when it is something that has the \ncommercial interests of Y2K liability protection, we can go over what \nseem to be insurmountable obstacles and enact legislation into \nlaw. There is no commercial interest. There is certainly far more. It \nis the safety of our children. It is allowing our children to have a \nyouth. It is allowing our children to go to school, as we did, in \nsafety. It is allowing our children to learn, to be young people, and \nnot to be forced to grow up in violence.\n\n  It is a gift we could give to the children of America. It is \nsomething we could do before they go back to school. It is something we \nshould do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is a very brief question.\n  I have just gone over with my colleague and some of our staff the \nfact that the House sent this bill over 3 weeks ago. We did our work. \nThey did their work. And when our friend, the majority leader, says we \nare dragging our feet, we certainly didn't drag our feet on the \njuvenile justice bill.\n  I ask my friend if he agrees that we have not dragged our feet on \nthat bill and that we have acted as we should. God knows, we want to \nmake sure we do something to make things better.\n  As I see it, on June 23, 1999, this bill was placed on the calendar. \nNo one is dragging their feet on this bill. Both Houses have done their \nwork, and it is time to move forward to avoid another tragedy.\n  I ask my friend if he agrees with that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from California is correct. We have moved very \nquickly on it. I hope we do not run into the situation that happened \nlast year. We spent a lot of time on the juvenile justice bill, and \nthen it languished and languished after coming out of committee. It sat \nso long that by the time we got to it, the time of the session ran out. \nIn fact, the end of the Congress ran out.\n  Here we are not right at the end of a Congress, but we are facing a \nschool year, and we should begin.\n  I promised the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire that I \nwould wrap up. I believe I have wrapped up.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8940-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8940-S8947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \nCalendar No. 153, the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, Justice, and State \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1217) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I bring before the Senate today, on behalf \nof myself, the Senator from South Carolina, and members of the \nAppropriations Committee, the bill to fund the Departments of Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies, which I want \nto spend some time discussing.\n  But before I do that, let me begin by thanking, for the extraordinary \namount of work and effort that they put into this bill, my staff and \nthe staff of the Senator from South Carolina. They have put in so many \nhours. It is incredible. They spent evenings here. They spent nights \nhere. And they spent weekends here, all at the expense of their \nfamilies. I, for one, am extraordinarily appreciative of that.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Let me mention a few folks. I ask unanimous consent that all of these \npeople be granted full floor privileges during the consideration of \nthis bill.\n  Jim Morhard, of course, who is the clerk of the staff and chief \noperating officer, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Eric Harnischfeger, \nClayton Heil, Dana Quam, Meg Burke, Vas Alexopoulos, Jackie Cooney, \nBrian McLachlan, Lila Helms, Emelie East, and Tim Harding. These folks \nwork incredible hours. We very much appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, this bill recommends a total of $35.3 billion in \nspending for the fiscal year 2000. The bill provides, however, $918 \nmillion less than was appropriated in fiscal year 1999.\n  In fact, if you include in it the fact that we have had the \nsignificant increase in the amount of money that is being spent on the \ncensus over what was spent last year, because we are headed into a \ncensus period, the real reduction below last year's spending in this \nbill is closer to about $2.6 billion. It is, of course, significantly \nless than the President's request.\n  Much of this reduction, however, from the President's request, is the \nresult of the fact that we decided not to fund advanced appropriations, \nsomething I very much oppose, and I think is bad policy. The President \nincluded in his budget request advanced funding requests of \nconsiderable amounts. We simply did not proceed with those.\n  In fact, his advanced funding initiatives covered 6 years out. So I \nhope the President won't be putting out press statements that we are \n``denying'' him something. When we get to those years, we will take a \nhard look at his request and, hopefully, be able to address them in a \nway that we can agree on them, should we all be in our present \npositions.\n  The Committee chose not to add a great deal of money for many of the \nPresident's requests that are new initiatives. We instead took a very \nstrong, fiscally conservative approach. We stay within our budget \nallocation, which was $918 million below last year's level.\n  The Administration's proposed programmatic spending increased by 29.5 \npercent over last year's enacted budget. We decided that was a mistake. \nIronically, considering the amount of the increase, the President's \nbudget still underfunded what we considered to be critical functions of \nthese agencies under our jurisdiction.\n  Specifically, the Border Patrol was underfunded by $185 million; and \ntargeted programs that the Committee relies upon, such as the State and \nlocal law enforcement block grants, cut by $522 million; juvenile crime \nfunding by $250 million; and State prison grants by $665 million. These \nwere all reductions in the President's budget, even though the \nPresident's budget was a high number.\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\n  So we took the President's budget, and we tried to work with it, and \nwe put our priorities in place. I think we have come up with an \nexcellent bill considering the tightness of the allocation and the \npressures which are on us. We had to reevaluate our priorities in light \nof that.\n  The Justice Department is, of course, the single biggest area in our \nbill. It is a big number. It represents, obviously, a significant part \nof the responsibility of the Federal Government. It has within it \nagencies such as the FBI, DEA, INS, U.S. Attorneys Office, and many \nother subagencies that do an exceptional job of protecting our country \nand making us a safe nation in which to live.\n  We have attempted to show our concern and our respect for the efforts \nof these agencies by funding them as aggressively as we can in the \ncontext of this difficult financial situation in which we find \nourselves.\n  We have, however, also made some initiatives. First, we initiated \nefforts in the area of children and youth. Last year, unfortunately, we \nsaw--and this year we have seen--students shoot people in schools. We \nhave seen violence in schools of extraordinary proportions that has \ndepressed us and outraged us.\n  Last year we were a little bit ahead of the curve, I guess, in this \nCommittee in that we set up a fund the purpose of which was to address \nsafe school initiatives. This year we are expanding that fund. The Safe \nSchools Initiative was really an effort by myself and Senator Hollings. \nIt addressed issues such as making sure that schools would have the \nopportunity, if they so desired, to have police officers work with the \nstudents, making available better equipment for schools, and \ndetermining whether weapons were being brought into the schools. It is \nto provide a significant amount in the area of prevention in the \nschools so that there would be adequate counseling funds available.\n  That effort, which was started last year with approximately $240 \nmillion, is continued in this bill aggressively. We have for example, \nput $180 million in for school resource officers. The idea is to have \npolice officers in the school systems, if the school systems want them, \nto help educate kids as to the need to respect the law and to work with \nlaw enforcement.\n  There is $38 million for community planning and prevention \nactivities, which is a big sum, and $25 million to develop new and more \neffective safety technology that schools can use for surveillance.\n  We are also providing a significant amount of money for a number of \nspecific agencies which we think do an extraordinary job in helping \nprevent crime and deal with kids who may have gotten off the path in \ntheir early years. Specifically, we are providing $50 million for the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America, which we think have done an excellent \njob.\n  We also put money in for Big Brothers/Big Sisters and for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, significant amounts \nof dollars, increases over last year.\n\n  We don't want to reinvent the wheel. We think there are programs out \nthere working. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we are saying \nto the programs, ``Let us help you.'' They are the professionals, and \nthey know how to do this. They have a track record of doing it well, \nsuch as the Boys and Girls Club, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Let us support you. \nWe have done that in this bill. I named those three agencies; there are \nothers.\n  We also escalated the effort in the area of the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention to a level of $284 million, and $100 \nmillion for the juvenile accountability block grants, giving funds to \nStates that come forward to use the money.\n  We address the Missing and Exploited Children Program. Again, the \nNational Center has done an extraordinary job. The FBI has the strike \nteam in this area. We have funded both those areas very aggressively. \nWe feel very strongly this is an area where we have made progress, and \nwe want to keep that progress going. For example, we have a Cyber \nTipline for parents, teachers--even kids, if they are so inclined--who \ncan directly access the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren. The tipline is reached through the Internet. The information \nentered goes to professionals who review each concern, whether it \nhappens to be pornography, pedophilia, or just a threat to a child. \nProfessionals can directly access the proper law enforcement agency or \ncommunity service agency to immediately be brought into the process for \naddressing that person's concern.\n  We have done a great deal in the area of fighting drugs. I can go on \nat considerable length in the drug-fighting area. We put a high \npriority on this. We felt the Administration maybe missed the mark a \nlittle bit. Instead of giving the DEA the reinforcement teams they \nneeded, they underfunded the teams. We funded the regional and mobile \nenforcement teams at the level the DEA wanted so we can have the strike \nteams that have been so successful. In the methamphetamine area we have \ndone a great deal, and we will continue to push that aggressively.\n  The Justice Department covers such a broad spectrum, there is no \nshortage of areas to discuss. I am trying to highlight themes of the \nbill. We are trying to put funds where we know we get results. We are \ntrying to address needs we know are essential, such as the safe school \nprograms, the missing children programs, the issue of child pornography \non the Internet, and the pedophile issue of predators over the \nInternet.\n  Again this year, we put an extremely strong effort into the violence \nagainst women initiatives. This was an area both Senator Hollings and I \nfelt strongly about. We have funded this aggressively over the last few \nyears. We will continue to fund this area aggressively. The bill \nincludes $283 million to combat violence against women. The funding \ncontinues special grants started last year at the suggestion of Senator \nWellstone for colleges to have funds available to address threats \nagainst women on campuses.\n  We have Indian initiatives in the bill, including the Indian Country \nLaw Enforcement Initiative. These have mostly been done at the \nsuggestion of Senator Campbell, who is the head of the Indian Affairs \nSubcommittee, and is also on this Committee. He has had great ideas.\n  We have initiatives in the area of DNA identification.\n  A long-standing effort of the Committee has been to make sure that we \nare getting better prepared for what is an inevitable, unfortunate \nevent, and that is a terrorist attack against American facilities. We \nare coming upon, unfortunately, the anniversary of the Nairobi and Dar \nes Salaam attacks. We know there are evil people that wish Americans \nharm. We have to get ready for that. We have had a three-prong approach \nto this which was started about 4 years ago, purely through the urging \nand initiative of this Committee. We set up a task force effort for \ncoordination of the agencies on counterterrorism. We have great \nresults, although we are nowhere near where we need to be. However, we \nare moving in the right direction.\n\n  The three levels of effort are: (1) counterintelligence, especially \noverseas counterintelligence; (2) interdiction of people before they \nget to the United States; and, (3) the issue of dealing with an event \nshould a catastrophe occur as a result of a terrorist attack.\n  We have set up counterterrorism initiatives in this bill, and we \ncontinue to expand all our efforts on all three of those fronts. We \nfund research to try to get a handle on how to respond to biological \nand chemical attacks. For first responders, we are giving communities \nthe ability through police, fire, and health facilities, when they are \nfirst on the scene, to be able to handle that efficiently. We have an \nexcellent national effort on first responders. There is adequate \nfunding for the FBI and State Department, which are under our \njurisdiction, in their efforts of counterterrorism, intelligence, and \nidentifying the threat.\n  I don't claim we are there. We are just at the beginning, an \nadolescence level. We were at an embryonic state 4 years ago, but we \nhave grown and gotten better. We will continue to grow and get better. \nUnfortunately, we are in a race against time, in my opinion, but we do \nrecognize that. It takes a long time to educate and get people up to \nspeed. It takes a long time to buy the equipment we need. We are doing \nour best at it. In this Committee, and I think as a government, we are \nworking well together.\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\n  The INS issue is another big issue we tried to address. We have had a \nlot of support from people who have border issues. Certainly, Senator \nHutchison from Texas has been a strong member of this Subcommittee and \nfeels very strongly about this. Senator Domenici, of course, from New \nMexico feels strongly about this. Senator Kyl from Arizona feels \nstrongly about this.\n  Last year, we funded an extra 1,000 Border Patrol agents in our bill. \nUnfortunately, the INS has not been able to put those people in place. \nThere are a lot of excuses flying around and a lot of finger pointing. \nWe think we have in this bill addressed the finger pointing. There \nshould be no excuse for not getting those folks on board. We have added \nanother 1,000 agents on top of those 1,000. We had made a commitment to \nadd 3,000 and we are keeping that. We differ with the White House, who \ndid not address the 1,000 agents. There was a front-page newspaper \nstory about people in terror in Douglas, AZ, of being overrun by \nillegal aliens. People cannot water their garden without a gun in order \nto protect themselves. We have to control our borders. This bill makes \nan extraordinary effort to do that.\n  We have funded aggressively the Commerce Department. That is not an \nunderstatement, even in the context of our tight funding situation.\n  We have increased the Census Bureau significantly with $1.7 billion \nof new funds, for a total of $3.1 billion. We understand they do not \nfeel that is enough. We will hold hearings to find out what they think \nthey need. The night we were marking up, we got the notice they were \nupset with the amount of money. I found that to be ironic and not very \ngood management. When I see something similar to that, I say to myself \nmaybe we better find out what they really do need. If they can't get it \nto us sooner than that, maybe there is not a good management scheme \nbehind that request. We will have hearings to find out. There may have \nto be some further effort to address the census funding. I recognize \nthat. I think everybody else recognizes that.\n  The NOAA account is well funded. This is a very important agency for \nmany who live on the coast. Obviously, it is critical, but equally \nimportant, for those that happen to live in Oklahoma or in Arkansas \nwhere the severity of the weather can have horrible events. As in \nOklahoma recently, the importance of adequate atmospheric predictions \nare critical. We have taken a major effort to adequately fund that.\n  NTIA and ITC--we have funded all those as best we can. We think we \nhave done a good job, especially in the international trade accounts.\n  State Department is another agency which comes under the jurisdiction \nof this Committee. This Committee has fascinating jurisdiction. State \nDepartment, of course, is critical. We had the Crowe report, which told \nus that we need to spend $1.4 billion annually for a period of 10 years \nin order to get our embassies to a position where they could adequately \ndefend themselves against potential terrorist attack. We are coming up \non the 1-year anniversary of that event.\n  Now, we did have an emergency appropriation a year ago of $1.4 \nbillion and that is being spent, and I think they are doing a good job \nof using that money to do the initial, primary protective things they \nneed to do: put in barriers, change the location of the security \nhouses, and making sure people have adequately secured the immediate \nactivity going on in the embassies. But there are tens of embassies \nwhich have to be repaired, changed, physically moved in order to become \nsecure. The cost is extraordinary.\n  The White House regrettably did not send up a very high number in \nsecurity. They asked for $300 million. We put a priority on this. We \nhave it up to $430 million in this bill, which was difficult to do in \nthe context of the caps we are working with. We hope to find more money \nsomewhere as we move down the road because we feel very strongly that \ngiving adequate security--not only physical security is important, but \nI feel very strongly, and I know Senator Hollings feels strongly, the \ndependents of our people we send overseas need to have security. If you \nhave kids going to school, if your wife is living, going to the grocery \nstore or maybe working another job in a foreign country, she, and your \nchildren--or your husband and children--should not be at risk. We \nshould be able to give them security too. So we are trying to upgrade \nthe security, not only for the diplomats but also for their dependents, \nsomething I place a very high degree of responsibility on.\n  Obviously, the State Department has a lot of other functions. U.N. \narrears has been an item of considerable discussion now that there has \nbeen an agreement. With the foreign relations authorization bill being \npassed, we have funded the arrears. There is still some discrepancy as \nto what the number was in that agreement, but our intention is to fund \nthe arrears, pursuant to the agreement reached between Senator Helms, \nthe Administration, and the U.N. But let's remember those moneys do not \nget spent unless the U.N. lives up to its responsibilities to start \nputting in place adequate accounting systems, to cut down on what is \nthe patronage system there, which is outrageous, and to give the United \nStates an adequate voice in the budgetary process. It does not have \nthis now because it was kicked off the Budget Committee which was \ninexcusable considering the fact we pay 25 percent of the costs of that \ninstitution.\n  We have also, of course, funded a variety of other activities within \nthe State Department, and we are totally committed to trying to give \nthe State Department the resources they need. I recognize there are \nsome shortfalls here in the State Department which again were forced \nupon us by the tight constraints we are confronting. They are not \nshortfalls which we are happy with, but they were things we had to do, \nespecially in the overhead area.\n  There may be some amendments to move money around in the State \nDepartment. If there are, I am going to ask people serious questions as \nhow they can do that because there is no budget in the State Department \nthat has any excess money in it. I can assure my colleagues of that, \nafter we have gone through this and had to reduce overall spending a \nstated $73.683 million below last year's level, but it's actually \n$3.614 billion below the President's budget request. We have funded \nthis year's services at last year's levels. It is something members of \nthe Subcommittee have agreed with.\n  We also made, as I mentioned, a major initiative in the area of \nInternet on a variety of different levels. I feel very strongly we \nshould not discipline the Internet. It's not our job to try to control \nthe Internet. It would be a serious mistake as a Government. We should \nnot be taxing it. What we do need to do is look at those areas where \nthe Federal role is appropriate. One, of course, as I mentioned before, \nis to continue to police the Internet relative to the use of child \npornography and the predations of pedophiles on the Internet. We have \nagain aggressively funded the FBI efforts in that area, along with the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Boys and Girls \nClubs' initiatives in this area, so we can start to get a handle on \nthis. So when a predator goes on the Internet and starts selling child \npornography, or starts trying to entice a child, through the use of the \nInternet, into some sort of meeting that might end in the harm of that \nchild, that predator will have to ask themselves, ``Am I talking to a \nchild or am I talking to a FBI agent or a trained local law enforcement \nagent?'' That is a good question today because, I can tell you, there \nare a lot of FBI resources committed to this. Every day we are \nmultiplying the number of local law enforcement resources committed, so \npeople are at significant risk if they try to use the Internet for \nthose types of things.\n\n  In addition, the Internet is unfortunately being used to prey on \nsenior citizens through fraudulent schemes. We funded the FTC effort in \nthis area, which I think is very important. They started their own \ninitiative to try to deal with fraud over the Internet, and we are \naggressively funding this program.\n  Not of less importance, but not as personally important because it \ndoesn't impact individuals so immediately, but certainly it can impact \nthem, is the need for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to \nbe more aggressive. They understand this. There is an initiative that \ncame from the SEC to get more aggressive in monitoring the Internet and \ncertainly the\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nstock activities on the Internet. Therefore, we fund the SEC \ninitiatives in this area. We are happy to do that.\n  In our opinion, we fund adequately the other agencies regulatory \nagencies, SBA, FCC. I already mentioned the FTC and the SEC. So we have \nattempted in this bill to address, with the extremely limited amount of \nmoney that we had, the needs of the agencies which are under our \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from South Carolina. Before \nI do, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his extraordinary \nknowledge and support. I say this every year, but it is absolutely \ntrue. He brings so much institutional history to this bill, we really \ncould not function without him. He understands what the background is \nof these issues as they come down the pike, something I do not \nnecessarily understand. That type of information is critical.\n  He is wonderful to work with. I respect his knowledge, his ability, \nand his willingness to be supportive and helpful on what is a very \ncomplex bill, which includes many strong initiatives of which he is \ncertainly the father.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my subcommittee \nchairman and colleague, Senator Gregg, in presenting to the Senate S. \n1217, the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, \nand related agencies appropriations bill. Once again, I would like to \ncommend Chairman Gregg for his outstanding efforts and bipartisan \napproach in bringing a bill to the floor that--in most areas--is good \nand balanced.\n  We fund a wide variety of Federal programs through this \nappropriations bill. We fund the FBI, the DEA, the State Department and \nour embassies overseas, the Census Bureau, NOAA, the Supreme Court, the \nFederal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and \nthe list goes on and on. As a result, this bill provides funding for a \nhost of efforts that range from fighting ``the war on drugs'' and ``the \nbattle against cybercrimes'', to preparing at the local level against \n``domestic terrorism'' and ``natural disasters.'' This bill provides \nfunding to protect both our elderly citizens from abuse and marketing \nscams and our youth from sexual predators on the streets and on the \nInternet. We provide funding for fisheries research and atmospheric \nresearch; we provide funding for our weather satellite systems and \nforecasts; we provide funding for the management of our fragile coastal \nareas--initiatives that impact every single aspect of our community--\nbusinesses, farms, the fishing industry, the tourism industry, and the \nconsumer.\n  In total, this bill provides $34.1 billion in budget authority which \nis about $400 million above last year's appropriated level. Even though \nwe had an increase of $400 million in our allocation for fiscal year \n2000, the funding level requested for the Census Bureau for fiscal year \n2000 was a $1.7 billion increase above the current funding level. In \nother words, Mr. President, to fully fund the 2000 decennial census we \nwere required to cut $1.3 billion in funding from the fiscal year 1999 \nfunding level for all other programs. This was not an easy task, and \nwith the exception of a few circumstances that I will touch on in \ngreater detail later, Senator Gregg did a remarkable job.\n  Chairman Gregg has mentioned many of the funding specifics in this \nbill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point \nout to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill.\n  This bill provides $17 billion for the Department of Justice, \nincluding $2.9 billion for the FBI, $1.2 billion for the DEA, and $3 \nbillion for the Office of Justice programs. Within the Department of \nJustice, we continue the Safe Schools Initiative which Senator Gregg \nand I started last year, and provides $218 million in funding for \nadditional school resource officers, technology, and community \ninitiatives in an effort to combat violence in our schoools.\n  Mr. President, again this year Americans watched news stories unfold \nabout shootings and other violent acts as they occurred in our schools. \nViolent crime in our schools is simply unacceptable and must be \nstopped. We cannot allow violence or the threat of violence to turn our \nschools into a hostile setting that prevents our students from \nobtaining the education they deserve. To fully understand the \ncircumstances under which our youth are attending school, one needs to \nonly look at a few statistics that have been gathered recently:\n  During the 1996-97 school year, 10 percent of all public schools \nreported one or more serious violent crimes to the police or other law \nenforcement representatives. An additional 47 percent of public schools \nreported at least one less serious or nonviolent crime to police. (1998 \nDepartment of Education Annual Report on School Safety)\n  About 6,093 students were expelled during the 1996-1997 academic \nschool year for bringing firearms or explosives to school. (1998 Report \non State Implementation of the Gun-Free Schools Act--School Year: 1996-\n1997, Department of Education)\n  In 1995, over 2 million students between the ages 12 and 19 feared \nthey were going to be attacked or harmed at school.\n  Likewise, about 2.1 million students between the ages 12 an d19 \navoided one or more places at school for fear of their own safety. \n(1998 Indicators of School Crime and Safety, U.S. Depts. of Education \nand Justice.)\n  This Safe Schools initiative is aimed at protecting our children by \nputting more police in the school setting. The bill provides $180 \nmillion, $55 million above the President's request, through the Office \nof Justice programs solely for the hiring of school resource officers. \nThe additional $38 million is directed towards community planning and \nprevention activities--for local police departments and sheriff's \noffices to work with schools and other community-based organizations to \ndevelop programs to improve the safety of elementary and secondary \nschool children and educators in and around the schools of our nation. \nThis is a much needed program, and an initiative that has proven to be \nsuccessful in the past.\n  This bill also provides $283.7 million for the Violence Against Women \nProgram, $75 million for State prison grants, $400 million for the \nLocal Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, $40 million for drug courts, \nand $284.5 million for juvenile justice programs. In addition, $25 \nmillion has again been provided for the bulletproof vest grant program \nto reduce the risk of serious injury or death to our nation's law \nenforcement officers. In an effort to respond to the proliferation of \ncrimes involving children, the committee has provided $19.9 million for \nthe Missing Children Program, an increase of $2.78 million over last \nyear's amount. This money will be used to combat the ever increasing \nnumber of crimes against children with an emphasis on kidnapping and \nsexual exploitation.\n  The bill provides $7.2 billion for the Commerce Department, of which \n$3.1 billion is to be used to conduct the decennial census. The \nadministration submitted a budget amendment for an additional $1.7 \nbillion in funding for the decennial census; unfortunately, we received \nthat request only two days before consideration of the bill by the \nsubcommittee and full committee. Senator Gregg and I are working on \nscheduling a hearing prior to conference with the House to address the \nbudget amendment, and I appreciate the chairman's efforts in addressing \nthis issue in a nonpartisan manner.\n  The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology (NIST) is funded at $233.1 million which is \nabove last year's level by $29.6 million, and the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership (MEP) program is funded at a level of $109.8 \nmillion. This amount will fully fund all MEP centers.\n  The bill also provides $2.5 billion for NOAA, an increase of $384 \nmillion over last year's funding level. I am pleased that the \ndistinguished chairman has worked with me to insure that we maintain a \nfocus on our oceans and coastal waterways.\n  Regarding NOAA, Mr. President, if I could just take a minute, I would \nlike to recognize the outstanding work of Dr. Nancy Foster, head of the \nNational Ocean Service, which oversees the labs, estuarine reserves, \nand the Coastal Services Center in my home state of South Carolina. I \ncan tell you she is one of the hardest working public servants with \nwhom I have had the privilege of working over the past several\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\nyears, and she has brought to the job boundless energy, understanding, \nand an ability to fix problems.\n  Dr. Foster has been with NOAA since 1977. She helped create the \nNational Marine Sanctuary and Estuarine Research Reserve Programs. \nThese programs preserve America's near shore and offshore marine \nenvironments in the same manner as do the better known national parks \nand wildlife refuges run by the Department of the Interior. Nancy went \non to serve as the Director of Protected Resources at NOAA's National \nMarine Fisheries Service, where she managed the Government's programs \nto protect and conserve whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other \nendangered and protected species. After that, she was named the Deputy \nDirector of the entire fisheries service, where she proved especially \nsensitive to the economic impact on communities and the need to promote \nwhat the folks downtown and in academia call ``sustainable \ndevelopment.''\n  In 1997, Secretary Bill Daley and Under Secretary Jim Baker tapped \nNancy to take over the National Ocean Service. That is about as high as \na career professional can go; in other agencies or bureaus, this level \nof position would be held by at least an Assistant Secretary-level \nofficial. NOS is the oldest part of NOAA--coastal mapping traces its \nlineage back to 1807--and she directed reinvention and change so that \nthe Ocean Service became one of the most modern and more effective \nparts of NOAA. Dr. Foster is always finding new ways to do business. \nShe is an innovator. She directed the total modernization of NOAA's \nnautical mapping and charting. Along with Dr. Sylvia Earle, she has \ncreated a partnership with the National Geographic Society to launch a \n5-year undersea exploratory program called ``Sustainable Seas \nExpeditions.'' Their goal is to use these exploratory dives to rekindle \nour nation's interest in the oceans, and especially the national marine \nsanctuaries. They are bringing back the kind of enthusiasm and public \neducation that Jacques Cousteau created when I first came to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, Nancy Foster is the person at NOAA whom the rank and \nfile employees--the marine biologists, scientists and researchers--\ntrust and look up to. She is a role model for professional women \neverywhere, especially those who work in the sciences. She is an \nofficial whom we in the Congress can look to for leadership and who \npays attention to local and constituent issues. She is non-partisan and \nplays it straight.\n  Dr. Foster recently underwent surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and \nis home recuperating. So Nancy, if you are watching at home on C-Span, \non behalf of Senator Gregg, the Appropriations Committees as well as \nthe Commerce Authorization Committee, and our professional staff, I \nwant to wish you the best. Take your time and get well. We need you \nback on the job, and wish you a speedy recovery.\n  The bill includes a total of $5.4 billion for the Department of State \nand related agencies. Within the State Department account, $883 million \nhas been provided for worldwide security, an increase of $146 million \nabove the President's request. Additionally, in recognition of the high \nprofile risk that State Department family members face in overseas \nlocations, $40 million has been included to improve the security in and \naround both housing and school areas for the families of those who \nserve in this capacity. The funding level also includes payment of \ninternational organization and peacekeeping funds, including $244 \nmillion for UN arrears.\n  I highlighted a few minutes ago the Safe Schools Initiative that \nChairman Gregg and I have worked together on for the past 2 years. I \nwould also like to comment briefly on two other important initiatives \nbefore closing: electronic commerce and COPS.\n  Regarding electronic commerce and the Internet, I would like to \ndiscuss an area which is growing in significance each day. With the \nexplosion of the Internet as an electronic transaction medium, we \ncannot ignore the increasing potential for fraud, abuse, and attacks on \nconsumer privacy. If we stop and take a look at the Internet and the \npotential that it has, we recognize that its very design allows \nschemers and con artists to reach more people, with more scams, at a \nfaster rate while remaining virtually anonymous. This is a veritable \nbreeding ground for electronic fraud and abuse. In fact, it was \nrecently reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nreceives more than 100 complaints per day about illegal Internet \nactivity involving fraudulent stock and investment schemes. In 1998, \nthe National Consumers League received over 7,700 Internet fraud \ncomplaints which was a 385-percent increase over the previous year. \nWith reports like this I think that it is clear that protection efforts \nneed to keep pace with the growing number of Internet users, \nparticularly since estimates indicate that perhaps 50 percent of the \npopulation of the United States will have access to the Internet by the \nyear 2000.\n  In response to the growth of this sector, Mr. President, this bill \nincludes funding for a number of programs and activities. I would like \nto again commend Chairman Gregg for his efforts to address this growing \nproblem of Internet fraud, particularly given the tight budget \nconstraints under which this bill was put together. This bill provides \n$133 million in funding to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for FY \n2000, an increase of $16.7 million above the current funding level. \nThis increase was provided in part because the subcommittee is mindful \nof the FTC's efforts toward ensuring that electronic commerce continues \nto flourish and consumers do not become victims of fraud and abuse \nwhile conducting transactions on the web. Additionally, the committee \nhas provided $10 million in funding for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) to assist in the prevention, detection, and \nprosecution of Internet related fraud and investment schemes.\n  Finally, regarding the COPS initiative, I can fully understand the \ndifficult decisions the chairman had to make as we put this bill \ntogether. And as I have stated, I support him on just about everything \nin this bill--with the exception of eliminating the COPS program. This \nis a good program that has proven to work. And it works well. Crime has \nbeen declining for 6\\1/2\\ consecutive years and is at a 25 year low. We \nare getting the jump on crime and this is not the time to just stop \nfunding the program. Numerous law enforcement groups agree. The \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers support the program, the \nNational Sheriffs Association supports the program, the National \nTroopers Coalition supports the program, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police supports the program, and the list goes on. I \ncompletely understand the limitations under which the chairman operated \nin getting a bill to the floor. Several of my colleagues have been \nworking for the past several weeks in putting together an amendment to \nreestablish the COPS Program. While I believe that program deserves \neven more funding than provided in the amendment, I also believe the \namendment is a good response and practical effort toward restoring an \neffective and valuable program while acknowledging the many funding \nrestraints imposed on this bill. I look forward to debating this issue \nfurther when the amendment is offered.\n  In closing let me say again that given the allocation we received, \nthis is a good bill. Many--but not all--of the administration's \npriorities were addressed to some extent. Likewise many--but not all--\nof the priorities of congressional Members were addressed to some \nextent. I know that every year we face difficulties with respect to \nlimited funding and multiple priorities, but the funding caps this year \nproved to be unusually prohibitive. As a result, tough decisions were \nmade. However, I believe that the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee \nmade those decisions in a bipartisan and judicious manner which will \nallow us to address many critical funding needs such as Census 2000, \n1000 additional Border Patrol agents, counter-terrorism efforts, the \nFBI's capabilities to combat cybercrime and crimes against children, \nDEA's continued war on drugs, critical fisheries research, and overseas \npeacekeeping efforts.\n  I would like to take a moment before closing to acknowledge and thank \nSenator Gregg's staff and my staff for their hard work and diligence in \nbringing together a bill that does everything I have just mentioned and \nmore. They have worked nonstop in a straightforward and bipartisan \nmanner, to deliver the bill that is before the Senate\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\ntoday. This bill could not have come together without their efforts and \nI thank them for all of their hard work.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate my gratitude to Chairman Gregg and my \nadmiration for the balanced bill that he has produced. What we were \nconfronted with, in a capsule, was a cut of some $1.3 billion from the \npresent policy appropriation, with the ad-on demand of $1.7 billion for \nthe census for next year. Within those confines, Senator Gregg has \nreally done an outstanding job, I can tell you that. It is balanced. It \nis thoughtful. I have seen, over the years, this bill handled by \nseveral chairmen but no one has done the job Senator Gregg has done on \nthis particular measure. So I am glad to join with him. We want to move \nit as expeditiously as we possibly can.\n  With that said, let me yield to the chairman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1271\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I send to the desk a managers' \namendment. I ask unanimous consent the managers' amendment I have now \nsent to the desk be considered and agreed to, en bloc.

Mr. President, this amendment deals with the violent crime \ntrust fund. I understand there are some people who wish to speak on it. \nI ask unanimous consent that debate on this be limited to an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as we know, the violent crime trust fund \nwas set up back in 1993, and the concept of it was through savings \nwhich would occur as a result of the reduction in personnel in the \nFederal Government, that funding from those savings would be used to \nexpand our efforts in fighting crime in this country.\n  It has been a tremendous success. As a result of the violent crime \ntrust fund, we have been able to undertake a significant expansion of \nthe efforts of the FBI, the INS, the DEA, just to name a few at the \nFederal level, and also our local and community law enforcement, who \nare so important to us. This is critical. Without this trust fund, we \nmight have some serious problems as we go down the road maintaining \nsome of these efforts.\n  The President is funding his Community Oriented Policing (COPS) \nProgram from the violent crime reduction trust fund. Later, we are \ngoing to get from the other side an amendment which, I presume, deals \nwith the COPS Program, but as a practical matter, I think we have \nresolved it. I do not think we are going to have a problem on this bill \nwith the COPS Program. The COPS Program was a violent crime initiative, \nand a good one. It worked. I have to admit, I had suspicions about it \nwhen it was first offered, but it has worked out.\n  We move on to other initiatives in the violent crime trust fund: \nterrorism initiatives; some initiatives to deal with the question of \nhow the FBI is able to identify DNA; and initiatives with local \ncommunities, for their efforts to gear up with the technology of today. \nSo, for example, when someone is arrested on the street, a law \nenforcement officer will have the computer capability to immediately \ncontact the FBI, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), and get \na reading as to whom that person is and in what possible other activity \nhe or she might be involved.\n  These are critical expansions in our efforts in law enforcement \nacross this country. They are proving to work well. As we move down the \nroad, they will work even better, I am sure.\n  We have a number of major initiatives at the Federal level. We just \ngot our Integrated Automated Fingprint Identification System up and \nrunning, fingerprinting. The NCIC program is working now. And coming on \nline--it may take some more years than I would like--is something \ndealing with information sharing initiative (ISI) which will give \nFederal agents the computer capability they need to have instant access \nto what is going on nationally. This is an initiative that is very \nappropriate. There are a lot of other things that are going to make our \nlaw enforcement much more effective as it deals with crime in this \nNation.\n  In addition, of course, we have done a lot in the area of DEA and \ndrug enforcement. The violent crime trust\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\nfund plays a major role, and it is about to run out, so we should \nreauthorize it. That is why I have offered this authorization. I hope \nthe Senate will agree to it.\n  I suggest we set a vote for tomorrow, if that is all right with the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest to the distinguished chairman that we limit \nthe time to be equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Senator Biden and Senator Leahy wish to be heard on \nthis in the morning. If it is all right with the distinguished \nchairman, we will reserve that time for the morning.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we reserve a half hour of the time on this \namendment so it can be given to Senator Biden and Senator Leahy and \nthey can take that time between them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Good. They are ready, then, to lay down that amendment \non COPS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that under the time \nagreement, no second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, tomorrow I will ask unanimous consent that \nall first-degree amendments be filed by noon. Hopefully, we can get an \nagreement on that. I am not asking it now.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have to check on our side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am telling people so, hopefully, they will have their \namendments together tonight, and staff will listen to this request and \nbe all charged up to get their amendments down here by 12 o'clock \ntomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8947-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

KENNEDY, JR.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I come to \nthe floor today to speak of the tragedy that struck the Kennedy family \nlast Friday night. I offer my condolences to the Kennedy family, and in \nparticular to my friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, who has lost a beloved nephew.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Kennedy and Bessette families as \nthey struggle to cope with the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife \nCarolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette. While we as a \nnation mourn the loss of a young man who had so much yet to offer the \nworld, these families must suffer the private pain of the loss of their \nbeloved brother or sisters, their children, their cousins, their \nfriends.\n  The late John F. Kennedy was a genuine inspiration to me and so many \nof my generation. I am grateful for the hope and the direction that \nPresident Kennedy gave so many of us when we were young, and I know \nthat in his own way John F. Kennedy, Jr., carried on his father's work \nto inspire young people to public service, or to otherwise serve the \npublic good, throughout his lifetime.\n  There can perhaps be no comparison to the contributions the Kennedy \nfamily has made to our country, or the sacrifices the family has \nendured, and sadly continues to endure with the death of John F. \nKennedy, Jr. Like his father and his uncle Bobby, John F. Kennedy, \nJr.'s life was cut tragically short, but like them he lived his life to \nthe fullest, with the vigor and dedication that marks the Kennedy \nlegacy.\n  Recently I had the honor of receiving the Profile in Courage Award \nfrom the late President Kennedy's family, and had the pleasure of \nmeeting and spending time with John F. Kennedy, Jr. I was impressed by \nhis kindness, his dignity, and the keen grasp of both politics and \npolicy which he so often displayed as editor of George magazine. John \nreflected all the best hopes we have for our country, as did his father \nbefore him.\n  In a speech I gave at that time, I chose one of the many beautiful \nmemorials I have heard about President Kennedy to express my own \nfeelings. The following passage from Romeo and Juliet was previously \nused by Robert F.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nthat I offered yesterday with Senator Sessions and many of my \ncolleagues which recognizes the 30th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Lunar \nLanding.\n  Mr. President, for thousands of years, men looked to the sky and were \nfascinated by the moon. To our forefathers it was a source of wonder, \nhope, curiosity and fear. Near enough to draw their attention, yet so \nfar beyond their reach to remain a constant mystery, the moon was an \nunattainable destination for the people of earth.\n  Undaunted by the significance of the task, President Kennedy called \nupon our nation ``to commit itself to achieving the goal . . . of \nlanding a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.'' With \nthis challenge, a goal that had previously exceeded the grasp of every \ngeneration, became the mission of the United States to achieve within \nten years.\n  Facing this great endeavor, the men and women of the American Space \nProgram set to work with steadfast conviction. While their efforts \nproduced steady results, there were tragic losses and technical \nsetbacks that tested their resolve. Brave men gave their lives. \nBrilliant men and women spent countless hours trying to work through \nthe numerous difficulties associated with such a complex undertaking. \nHowever, all remained dedicated to the goal of landing a man on the \nmoon.\n  On July 20, 1969, 30 years ago yesterday, that goal was achieved. On \nthat day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin closed the timeless breach \nthat had separated the earth from the moon and landed on the Sea of \nTranquility. With Neil Armstrong's first step on the lunar surface, the \nAmerican Space Program met the awesome challenge set by President \nKennedy. This important event marks America's ascendance to the \npreeminent role that it occupies today as the world's leader in space \nexploration.\n  While yesterday was an important anniversary for all the people of \nthe world, it was especially important for the people of the United \nStates. Landing men on the moon represents a great triumph of American \nendeavor. As the Spanish could be proud for having built the great \nships that carried Columbus on his voyage of discovery, American \nscientists and engineers can feel equally proud for having built the \nSaturn V Rocket, the vehicle that carried the astronauts to the moon. \nThat no other nation has produced a similar vehicle is a testament to \nthe unparalleled achievement of our Space Program.\n  This resolution celebrates the anniversary of the great achievement \nof landing men on the moon. It celebrates the efforts of the many men \nand women who defied the odds and helped to make what was once believed \nto be\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nimpossible, possible. Finally, it celebrates the courageous spirit of \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8948-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PENDING NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today in communities all around the country \nand here at the United States Capitol, Asian Pacific Americans are \nleading all Americans in a demonstration of our commitment to one \nAmerica, equal opportunity and equal justice under law by urging the \nSenate to vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil \nRights Division at the Department of Justice. I hear the call of the \nCongressional Asian Pacific Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus for prompt Senate consideration and a \nvote on this highly-qualified nominee and dedicated public servant. I \ncommend the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans and their Chair \nDaphne Kwok, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association and \nthe National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium for their \nleadership in connection with this matter and their commitment to \nfundamental fairness.\n  Today is the second anniversary of the initial nomination of Bill \nLann Lee to the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \nI repeat today what I have said before: It is past time to do the right \nthing, the honorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the \nSenate so that the Senate may fulfill its constitutional duty under the \nadvice and consent clause and vote on this nomination without further \ndelay. Two years is too long to wait for Senate action on this \nimportant nomination.\n  Yesterday, I was privileged to attend a meeting with the President of \nthe United States in the East Room of the White House in which he \nissued a challenge to the lawyers of our country to rededicate \nthemselves to help build one America and realize the American dream of \nequality for all under the law. What kind of message is the Senate \nsending when it refuses to act on the nomination of this outstanding \nAsian Pacific American?\n  After Bill Lann Lee graduated from Yale and then Columbia Law School \nhe could have spent his career in the comfort and affluence of any one \nof the nation's top law firms. He chose, instead, to spend his career \non the front lines, helping to open the doors of opportunity to those \nwho struggle in our society. His is an American story. The son of \nimmigrants whose success can be celebrated by all Americans.\n  In my view, Bill Lann Lee should be commended for the years he worked \nto provide legal services and access to our justice system for those \nwithout the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work \nshould be a source of pride and a basis for praise. His career should \nbe a model for those who take up the challenge that the President \nenunciated yesterday to lawyers across this country. I say that Bill \nLann Lee represented the best of the legal profession while serving \nthose without means.\n  It appears that some on the Republican side want to hold the Lee \nnomination as a partisan trophy--to kill it through obstruction and \ndelay rather than allowing the Senate to vote up or down on the \nnomination. This effort started with a letter from the former Speaker \nof the House, Newt Gingrich, to the Republican Majority Leader of the \nSenate in 1997. Over the ensuing weekend progress toward confirmation \nof this nomination ground to a halt. Speaker Gingrich is gone but the \ndisastrous consequence of his unjustified opposition to this nomination \nlingers. It is past time to put past injustice to rest. As speaker \nafter speaker reiterated today across the country, it is time for the \nSenate to vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.\n  Bill Lann Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal \njourney that he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full \nopportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in \nus. Let us affirm the best in us. Let the Senate vote on the \nconfirmation of this good man. We need Bill Lann Lee's proven problem-\nsolving abilities in these difficult times with apparent hate crimes on \nthe rise across the country. He is spearheading efforts against hate \ncrimes, against modern slavery and for equal justice for all Americans.\n\n  If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed \nand will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will \nsubside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each \nchild-- girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, \nregardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual \norientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to \nlive the American dream.\n  Earlier this year Congress voted to award the Congressional Gold \nMedal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. I heard Mrs. Parks, Reverend Jackson and the \nPresident each take the occasion to remind us that the struggle for \nequality is not over.\n  I will ask the Judiciary Committee again tomorrow, in the spirit of \nfairness, that the Committee recognize the 18-month stewardship of the \nCivil Rights Division of Bill Lann Lee, his qualifications, and his \nquiet dignity and strength and send his nomination to the full Senate \nso that the United States Senate may, at long last, vote on that \nnomination and, I hope, confirm this fine American to full rank as the \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  When confirmed Bill Lann Lee will be the first Asian Pacific American \nto be appointed to head the Civil Rights Division in its storied \nhistory and the highest ranking Federal Executive officer of Asian \nPacific American heritage in our 200-year history.\n  I have previously brought to all Senators' attention a June letter \nfrom the Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights from the \nEisenhower through Bush Administrations in support of this outstanding \nnominee: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley \nPottinger, Drew Days and John R. Dunne note in their letter:\n\n       Over the past eighteen months, Mr. Lee has shown that he \n     honors the Civil Rights Division's mission to safeguard equal \n     justice for all. He has enforced the nation's civil rights \n     laws fairly and effectively. He has demonstrated that he can \n     and will meet the demands of the position with distinction \n     and thus merits the Senate's confidence.\n\n  Civil Rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee \nought to have an up or down confirmation vote on the Senate floor. The \nSenate should fulfill its constitutional duty under the advice and \nconsent clause and vote on this nomination. Twenty-four months and \nthree sessions of Congress is too long for this nomination to have to \nwait. He should no longer be forced to ride in the back on the \nnominations bus but be given the fair vote that he deserves.\n  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it \nserves as the conscience of the nation. I call on the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate to bring this nomination to the floor for an \nup or down vote without obstruction or further delay so that the Senate \nmay vote and we may confirm a dedicated public servant to lead the \nCivil Rights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination, and \nharmful discrimination in all its forms, remain among the most vexing \nunsolved problems of our society. Let the Senate move forward from the \nceremonial commemorations earlier this year by doing what is right and \nvoting on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8948-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8948-S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SWEARING IN OF DIANE WATSON AS AMBASSADOR TO MICRONESIA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with real pleasure that I rise \ntoday to note the swearing-in this afternoon of California State \nSenator Diane Watson as United States Ambassador to the Federated \nStates of Micronesia. Senator Watson's confirmation was a long time \ncoming, and I am proud that today she will finally come to occupy the \nAmbassadorial posting which she so well deserves.\n  State Senator Watson was the first African-American women elected to \nthe California State Senate, and has represented California's 26th \nDistrict--which includes Los Angeles, Culver City, Ladera Heights, \nBaldwin Hills, Palms, Miracle Mile, Mar Vista, Cheviot Hills, and \nKoreatown--since 1978. Senator Watson has been a real leader in \nCalifornia politics and community life, and has been in the forefront \nof the fight for civil rights and human rights in Los Angeles and the \nentire state of California for her entire career. She was a dedicated \ncrusader in\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nthe desegregation of Los Angeles school, and, in 1975, became the first \nelected African American to serve on the Board of Education of the Los \nAngeles Unified School District.\n  Prior to her elected office, Senator Watson led a distinguished \ncareer in the field of education, including service as an assistant \nsuperintendent of child welfare, a school psychologist, and as a member \nof the faculty at both California State university Los Angeles and Long \nBeach. She has also traveled extensively, participating in numerous \ninternational conference on women's health issues, democracy building, \nand trade.\n  As a member of the State Senate and as an educator, Diane Watson has \nalways brought honor to the organizations and people she has \nrepresented. For many years now she has been a leader in improving the \nlives of Californians, and I am pleased that the people of the United \nStates will now also be able to benefit from her experience, energy, \nand talents as our Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8949-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to inform my colleagues of a \nsignificant honor recently bestowed upon our colleague, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Abraham.\n  On June 16, Senator Abraham became the first United States Senator to \nreceive the ``Cyber Champion'' award, from the Business Software \nAlliance. He was recognized for his legislative accomplishments in \nsupport of America's high-technology economy. I would like to \ncongratulate Senator Abraham on receiving this well-deserved honor.\n  Senator Abraham has been a champion of high-tech since coming to the \nSenate. He has worked hard on a high-tech agenda to keep Americans \nemployed in good jobs at good wages, and to help our nation keep the \nedge we need in the global marketplace. It has been my pleasure to work \nwith him on many of these issues.\n  Whether fighting to expand and rationalize the use of electronic \nsignatures, expanding high-tech visas, increasing charitable giving to \nour schools so that we can train our kids in the uses of high-\ntechnology, keeping the Internet free from unnecessary interference and \ntaxation, or seeing to it that we are prepared for the year 2000, \nSenator Abraham has been a leader on high-tech issues.\n  Now Senator Abraham is working to protect property rights on the \nInternet through his anti-cybersquatting legislation. His bill would \nempower trademark owners to protect their marks, at the same time \nprotecting consumers from potential fraud.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Abraham's efforts will help \nworkers and the economy in Michigan and across the United States. Once \nagain, I congratulate him on this honor, and on the accomplishments \nthat have earned it for him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8949-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8949-S8950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PROTECT ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nincreasing national and international importance.\n  Mr. President, encryption may not yet be the most common term in the \nAmerican lexicon, but it may well affect every American as we progress \nin this Information Age. Encryption systems provide security to \nconventional and cellular telephone conversation, fax transmissions, \nlocal and wide area networks, personal computers, remote key entry \nsystems, and radio frequency communication systems. As we become more \nreliant on these technologies, encryption becomes a more important \napplication.\n  For these and other reasons, I come to the floor today to discuss my \ndecision to cosponsor S. 798, the Promote Reliable Online Transactions \nto Encourage Commerce and Trade, or PROTECT Act. This bill pushes us \ntoward a thoughtful debate on encryption policy.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain, to push this important legislation forward. As the \nchairman knows all too well, balancing competing interests, regardless \nof issue, is a difficult, and often thankless, job. In this case, we \nmust find an equitable balance between personal privacy, technological \ninnovation and public safety.\n  The rapidly expanding global marketplace and our increasing reliance \non new technology has resulted in the almost instantaneous transfer of \nconsumer information. Bank information, medical records, and credit \ncard purchases are transferred at lightning speed. But these \ntransactions, and even browsing on the Internet, can leave consumers \nvulnerable to unwanted and illegal access to private information. \nEncryption technology offers an effective way consumers can ensure that \nonly the people they choose can read other communications or their e-\nmail, review their medical records, or take money out of their bank \naccounts. Plain and simple, encryption products protect consumers.\n  Over the past couple of years, we have seen the power of Internet \ncommerce. From amazon.com to eBay to drugstore.com, companies with a \ndot com have become the darlings of the investment world. For \nconsumers, online commerce provides viable competition and, thus, a \ncost-effective alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores.\n  The Internet, however, will never achieve its full potential as a \ncenter of commerce if consumers do not trust that their transactions \nand communications remain confidential. If we ever are to realize the \ncommercial and communications potential of the Internet, we must have \nsophisticated and effective encryption.\n  For these precise reasons, consumers have an economic interest in the \nuse of strong encryption technology. That economic interest \nnecessitates more research and more development of stronger technology. \nThe current export control climate, however, stifles development of \ndomestic encryption technology. I believe that expansion of the market \nfor U.S. developers will serve to quicken the pace of innovation.\n  Two recent reports bear this out. The Electronic Privacy Information \nCenter found that the United States is virtually alone in its \nrestrictions on encryption. Another report by researchers at George \nWashington University found that 35 foreign countries manufacture 805 \nencryption products. The same GWU report found that of the 15 \nalgorithms now being considered by the National Institute of Standards \nfor a new American encryption standard, 10 have been developed outside \nthe U.S. Clearly, our outdated policies are doing more to exclude U.S. \nmanufacturers from the marketplace than they are doing to keep \nencryption technology out of the hands of criminals.\n  I do not mean to belittle the serious law enforcement implications of \nencryption. As the FBI has stated, ``encryption has been used to \nconceal criminal activity and thwart law enforcement efforts to collect \ncritical evidence needed to solve serious and often violent criminal \nactivities.'' The same technology that prevents a computer hacker from \nstealing one's credit card number can prevent a law enforcement \nofficer, even one with a properly\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nobtained court order, from decrypting illegal information.\n  But the fact of the matter is that criminals simply can purchase and \nuse an advanced encryption product produced in a foreign country. I \nunderstand concerns that some in the law enforcement community may \nhave. Muzzling American development and export, however, is a doomed \nstrategy. I believe there should be criminal penalties for those that \nuse encryption in the furtherance of a crime and I hope the Senate will \nadopt penalties similar to those found in the leading House encryption \nbill.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that this bill moves us forward, \nboth in terms of privacy and technological innovation. I must point \nout, however, that my support for this bill will not preclude me from \nadvocating a stronger privacy position in the future. My cosponsorship \nof this bill establishes what I believe should be the starting point \nfor the Congress to begin the encryption debate. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8950-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8950-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE NOTICE OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE IRAQI EMERGENCY--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to combat hate crimes.\n\n\n                         combating hate crimes\n\n  Mr. HATCH: Mr. President, in the face of some of the hate crimes that \nhave riveted public attention--and have unfortunately made the name \nBenjamin Nathaniel Smith synonymous with the recent spate of shootings \nin Illinois; the names James Byrd synonymous with Jasper, Texas; and \nthe name Matthew Shepard synonymous with Laramie, Wyoming--I am \ncommitted in my view that the Senate must lead and speak against hate \ncrimes.\n  During and just preceding this past generation, Congress has been the \nengine of progress in securing America's civil rights achievements and \nin driving us as a society increasingly closer to the goal of equal \nrights for all under the law.\n  Historians will conclude, I have little doubt, that many of America's \ngreatest strides in civil rights progress took place just before this \npresent moment on history's grand time line: Congress protected \nAmericans from employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \ncolor, religion, and national origin with the passage of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964; Congress protected Americans from gender-based \ndiscrimination in rates of pay for equal work with the Equal Pay Act of \n1963; and from age discrimination with the passage of the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967; Congress extended protections \nto immigration status with the Immigration Reform and Control Act in \n1986, and to the disabled with the passage of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act in 1990. And the list continues on and on.\n  Yet while America's elected officials have striven mightily through \nthe passage of such measures to stop discrimination in the workplace, \nor at the hands of government actors, what remains tragically \nunaddressed in large part is discrimination against peoples' own \nsecurity--that most fundamental right to be free from physical harm.\n  Despite our best efforts, discrimination continues to persist in many \nforms in this country, but most sadly in the rudimentary and malicious \nform of violence against individuals because of their identities.\n  A fair question for this Congress is what it will do to stem this \nugly form of hatred and to counter hate crime as boldly as this \nCongress has attempted to redress workplace bias and governmental \ndiscrimination. Will we continue to advance boldly in this latest civil \nrights frontier by furthering Congress' proud legacy, or will we demur \non the ground that this is not now a battle for our waging?\n  Let me state, unequivocally, that this is America's fight. As much as \nwe condemn all crime, hate crime can be more sinister that non-hate \ncrime.\n  A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but out of the \nmotive of sending a message of hatred to an entire community--\noftentimes a community defined on the basis of immutable traits--is \nappropriately punished more harshly, or in a different manner, than \nother crimes.\n  This is in keeping with the long-standing principle of criminal \njustice--as recognized recently by the U.S. Supreme Court in a \nunanimous decision upholding Wisconsin's sentencing enhancement for \nhate crimes--that the worse a criminal defendant's motive, the worse \nthe crime. (Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 1993)\n  Moreover, hate crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes; \nthey inflict deep, lasting, and distinct injuries--some of which never \nheal--on victims and their family members; they incite community \nunrest; and, ultimately, they are downright un-American.\n  The melting pot of America is, worldwide, the most successful multi-\nethnic, multi-racial, and multi-faith country in all recorded history. \nThis is something to ponder as we consider the atrocities so routinely \nsanctioned in other countries--like Serbia so recently--committed \nagainst persons entirely on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or \nreligious identity.\n  I am resolute in my view that the federal government can play a \nvaluable role in responding to hate crime. One example here is my \nsponsorship of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, a law which \ninstituted a data collection system to assess the extent of hate crime \nactivity, and which now has thousands of voluntary law enforcement \nagency participants.\n  Another, more recent example, is the passage in 1996 of the Church \nArson Protection Act, which, among other things, criminalized the \ndestruction of any church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of \nreligious worship because of the race, color, or ethnic characteristics \nof an individual associated with that property.\n  To be sure, however, any federal response--to be a meaningful one--\nmust abide by the constitutional limitations imposed on Congress, and \nbe cognizant of the limitations on Congress' enumerated powers that are \nroutinely enforced by the courts.\n  This is more true today than it would have been even a mere decade \nago, given the significant revival by the U.S. Supreme Court of the \nfederalism doctrine in a string of decisions beginning in 1992. Those \ndecisions must make us particularly vigilant in respecting the courts' \nrestrictions on Congress' powers to legislate under section 5 of the \n14th amendment, and under the commerce clause. [City of Boerne \n(invalidating Religious Freedom Restoration Act under 14th amendment); \nLopez (invalidating Gun-Free School Zones Act under commerce clause); \nBrzondala (4th circuit decision\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\ninvalidating one section of the Violence Against Women Act on both \ngrounds).]\n  We therefore need to arrive at a federal response to hate crimes that \nis not only as effective as possible, but that carefully navigates the \nrocky shoals of these court decisions. To that end, I have prepared an \napproach that I believe will be not only an effective one, but one that \nwould avoid altogether the constitutional risks that attach to other \npossible federal responses that have been raised.\n  Indeed, just a couple months ago, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that states and \nlocalities should continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \noverwhelming majority of hate crimes, and that no legislation is \nworthwhile if it is invalidated as unconstitutional.\n  There are four principal components to my approach:\n  First, it creates a meaningful partnership between the federal \ngovernment and the states in combating hate crime, by establishing \nwithin the Justice Department a fund to assist state and local \nauthorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crime.\n  Much of the cited justification given by those who advocate broad \nfederal jurisdiction over hate crimes is a lack of adequate resources \nat the state and local level.\n  Accordingly, before we take the step of making every criminal offense \nmotivated by a hatred of someone's immutable traits a federal offense, \nit is imperative that we equip states and localities with the resources \nnecessary so that they can undertake these criminal investigations and \nprosecutions on their own.\n\n  Second, my approach undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the raw \ndata that has been collected pursuant to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics \nAct, including a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--\nsome with hate crime law, others without--to determine whether there \nis, in fact, a problem in certain states' prosecution of those criminal \nacts constituting hate crimes.\n  Third, my approach directs an appropriate, neutral forum to develop a \nmodel hate crimes statute that would enable states to evaluate their \nown laws, and adopt--in whole or in part from the model statute--hate \ncrime legislation at the state level.\n  One of the arguments cited for a federalization of enforcement is the \nvarying scope and punitive force of state laws. Yet there are many \nareas of grave national concern--such as drunk driving, by way of \nexample--that are appropriately left to the states for criminal \nenforcement and punishment.\n  Before we make all hate crimes federal offenses, I believe we should \npursue avenues that advance consistency among the states through the \nvoluntary efforts of their legislatures. Perhaps, upon completion of \nthis model hate crime law, Congress will review its recommendation and \nconsider additional ways to promote uniformity among the states.\n  Fourth, my proposal makes a long-overdue modification of our existing \nfederal hate crime law (passed in 1969) to allow for the prosecution by \nfederal authorities of those hate crimes that are classically within \nfederal jurisdication--that is, hate crimes in which state lines have \nbeen crossed.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passage of this comprehensive measure \nwill prove a strong antidote to the scourge of hate crimes.\n  It is no answer for the Senate to sit by silently while these crimes \nare being committed. The ugly, bigoted, and violent underside of some \nin our country that is reflected by the commission of hate crimes must \nbe combated at all levels of government.\n  For some, federal leadership necessitates federal control. I do not \nsubscribe to this view, especially when it comes to this problem. It \nhas been proposed by some that to combat hate crime Congress should \nenact a new tier of far-reaching federal criminal legislation. That \napproach strays from the foundations of our constitutional structure--\nnamely, the first principles of federalism that for more than two \ncenturies have vested states with primary responsibility for \nprosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries.\n  As important as this issue is, there is little evidence such a step \nis warranted, or that it will do any more than what I have proposed. In \nfact, one could argue that national enforcement of hate crime could \ndecrease if states are told the federal government has assumed primary \nresponsibility over hate crime enforcement.\n  Accordingly, we must lead--but lead resonsibly--recognizing that we \nlive in a country of governments of shared and divided \nresponsibilities.\n  In confronting a world of prejudice greater than any of us can now \nimagine, Lincoln said to Congress in 1862 that the ``dogmas of the \nquiet past'' were ``inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is \npiled high with difficulty, and we must rise--with the occasion. As our \ncase is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.''\n  In that very spirit, I encourage this body to question the dogma that \nfederal leadership must include federal control, and I encourage this \nbody to act anew by supporting a proposal that is far-reaching in its \nefforts to stem hate crime, and that is at the same time respectful of \nthe primacy states have traditionally enjoyed in prosecuting crimes \ncommitted within their boundaries.\n  Ultimately, I believe the approach I have set forth is a principled \nway to accommodate our twin aims--our well-intentioned desire to \ninvestigate, prosecute, and, hopefully, end these vicious crimes; and \nour unequivocal duty to respect the constitutional boundaries governing \nany legislative action we take.\n  My proposal should unite all of us on the point about which we should \nmost fervently agree--that the Senate must speak firmly and \nmeaningfully in denouncing as wrong in all respects those actions we \nhave increasingly come to know as hate crimes. Our continued progress \nin fighting to protect Americans' civil rights demands no less.\n  Mr. President, I feel deeply about this. I hope our colleagues will \nlook at this seriously and realize this is the way to go. It \nappropriately respects the rights of the States and the rights of the \nFederal Government. It appropriately sets the tone. It appropriately \ngoes after these types of crimes in a very intelligent and decent way. \nI believe it is the way to get at the bottom of this type of criminal \nactivity in our society today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Declarations.--Congress declares that--\n       (1) further efforts must be taken at all levels of \n     government to respond to the staggering brutality of hate \n     crimes that have riveted public attention and shocked the \n     Nation;\n       (2) hate crimes are prompted by bias and are committed to \n     send a message of hate to targeted communities, usually \n     defined on the basis of immutable traits;\n       (3) the prominent characteristic of a hate crime is that it \n     devastates not just the actual victim and the victim's family \n     and friends, but frequently savages the community sharing the \n     traits that caused the victim to be selected;\n       (4) any efforts undertaken by the Federal Government to \n     combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that States and \n     local officials have traditionally been accorded in the \n     criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and\n       (5) an overly broad reaction by the Federal Government to \n     this serious problem might ultimately diminish the \n     accountability of State and local officials in responding to \n     hate crimes and transgress the constitutional limitations on \n     the powers vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n       (b) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of hate crime.--In this paragraph, the term \n     ``hate crime'' means--\n       (i) a crime described in subsection (b)(1) of the first \n     section of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 \n     note); and\n       (ii) a crime that manifests evidence of prejudice based on \n     gender or age.\n       (B) Collection from cross-section of states.--Not later \n     than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation \n     with the National Governors' Association, shall select 10 \n     jurisdictions with laws classifying certain types of crimes \n     as hate crimes and 10 jurisdictions without such laws from \n     which to collect data described in subparagraph (C) over a \n     12-month period.\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\n       (C) Data to be collected.--The data to be collected are--\n       (i) the number of hate crimes that are reported and \n     investigated;\n       (ii) the percentage of hate crimes that are prosecuted and \n     the percentage that result in conviction;\n       (iii) the length of the sentences imposed for crimes \n     classified as hate crimes within a jurisdiction, compared \n     with the length of sentences imposed for similar crimes \n     committed in jurisdictions with no hate crime laws; and\n       (iv) references to and descriptions of the laws under which \n     the offenders were punished.\n       (D) Costs.--Participating jurisdictions shall be reimbursed \n     for the reasonable and necessary costs of compiling data \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Study of trends.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall complete a \n     study that analyzes the data collected under paragraph (1) \n     and under the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to determine \n     the extent of hate crime activity throughout the country and \n     the success of State and local officials in combating that \n     activity.\n       (B) Identification of trends.--In the study conducted under \n     subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall identify any \n     trends in the commission of hate crimes specifically by--\n       (i) geographic region;\n       (ii) type of crime committed; and\n       (iii) the number of hate crimes that are prosecuted and the \n     number for which convictions are obtained.\n       (c) Model Statute.--\n       (1) In general.--To encourage the identification and \n     prosecution of hate crimes throughout the country, the \n     Attorney General shall, through the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws of the American Law \n     Institute or another appropriate forum, and in consultation \n     with the States, develop a model statute to carry out the \n     goals described in subsection (a) and criminalize acts \n     classified as hate crimes.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing the model statute, the \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) include in the model statute crimes that manifest \n     evidence of prejudice; and\n       (B) prepare an analysis of all reasons why any crime \n     motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a victim should \n     or should not be included.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State and Local Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or a political subdivision of a State, \n     the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide technical, \n     forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of assistance in \n     the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State; and\n       (iii) is motivated by prejudice based on the victim's race, \n     ethnicity, or religion or is a violation of the State's hate \n     crime law.\n       (B) Priority.--In providing assistance under subparagraph \n     (A), the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes \n     committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than \n     1 State.\n       (2) Grants.--\n       (A) In general.--There is established a grant program \n     within the Department of Justice to assist State and local \n     officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate \n     crimes.\n       (B) Eligibility.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State applying for assistance under this paragraph shall--\n       (i) describe the purposes for which the grant is needed;

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Technology \nAdministration of the Department of Commerce for fiscal years 2000, \n2001, and 2002, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n  technology administration authorization act for fiscal years 2000, \n                             2001, and 2002\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to \nauthorize the appropriations for the Technology Administration (TA) of \nthe Department of Commerce for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. This \nbill authorizes funding for activities in the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology (NIST), the National Technical Information \nServices (NTIS), the Office of Technology Policy (OTP), and the Office \nof Space Commercialization (OSC).\n  The Technology Administration is the only federal agency responsible \nfor maximizing technology's contribution to America's economic growth, \nand for partnering with industry to improve U.S. industrial \ncompetitiveness. Because technological progress is the single most \nimportant factor in our current economic growth, it is important that \nthe agency be adequately funded to pursue its missions, even during the \ncurrent era of fiscal constraints. As the pace of technological changes \naccelerates and as the world transitions to a digital economy, we must \nwork proactively to ensure that the private sector has the best \npossible tools to compete in this new economy.\n  NIST, as the main research laboratory in Technology Administration, \npromotes and strengthens the U.S. economy by collaborating with \nindustry to apply new technology, measurement methods, and technical \nstandards. In support of the programs in Scientific and Technical \nResearch and Services, the bill seeks to increase the authorization \namounts for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 by 5.5 percent annually, \nconsistent with my objective for doubling the aggregate federal funding \nfor civilian research over an 11-year period beginning in fiscal year \n2000.\n  In keeping with my firm belief that our national commitment to \ntechnological innovation must include a complete framework that also \nfacilitates the realization and commercialization of new technologies \nin the marketplace, the bill also continues to provide funding for two \nNIST programs that have been particularly contentious: the Advanced \nTechnology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). \nWe respond to existing criticisms of ATP with several changes to the \nadministration of ATP awards to ensure that the program fulfills its \noriginally intended mission. These modifications include provisions to \nensure that federal funds would not interfere or compete with private \ncapital for the commercialization of new technologies, and that these \nfunds would benefit primarily small businesses.\n  With MEP approaching maturity, the evidence of its success in \nproviding technical assistance and advanced\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\nbusiness practices to help small manufacturers improve their \ncompetitiveness has been overwhelming. However, as we transition from a \nlabor-based to a knowledge-based economy, the function of the \nmanufacturing sector will change and its needs will evolve accordingly. \nIn anticipation of these changes, the legislation requests the Director \nof NIST to examine these issues closely, and recommend modification or \nexpansion of MEP as appropriate.\n  NTIS is an agency within Technology Administration that collects, \narchives, and disseminates scientific, technical, and related business \ninformation produced by or for the federal government. NTIS is required \nto cover its expenses through its revenues. However, the advance of the \nInternet and the convenience of electronic dissemination of information \nfreely via agency web sites have severely impacted NTIS's ability to \nsell its products. It is my belief that the agency serves an important \nmission in ensuring the preservation of research results produced from \nfederal investment. Yet, prudent fiscal management practice dictates \nthat we give serious consideration to the agency and its future. \nAccordingly, the bill reauthorizes additional funding for the agency, \nbut only if the Secretary can recommend potential resolutions to the \nissue. We leave open the option of possibly resolving this issue in a \nlater bill.\n  Through the Technology Administration Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-309), we \ncreated the Office of Space Commercialization, and for the first time, \nthe Office will receive its own funding authorization. As the pace of \nactivities to commercialize aspects of space increases, I hope that the \nOffice will become a more active participant in the ongoing discussion \nbetween the government and industry in this strategically important \nmarket.\n  Two other issues that the legislation addresses include the \ncommissioning of a study to strengthen and maintain technical expertise \nof the national laboratories, and a study on the role and impact of \ninternational and domestic technical standards of global commerce. \nThese are issues with national impact that I believe we must discuss in \na timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this authorization bill reflects a \nbalance between prudent fiscal policies and wise investment for our \nNation's future. We have incorporated input from my colleagues in the \nSenate, the House, and the Administration, as well as my constituents, \nand other interested parties. The legislation reaffirms our national \ncommitment to maximize technology's contribution to economic growth in \na responsible manner, while at the same time, prepares us for changes \nahead as we transition into a knowledge-based economy. It also seeks to \nmaintain America's unique technical skills. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support timely passage of this legislation so that we can \ngive a clear indication to the American people that we are serious \nabout enhancing U.S. competitiveness as we approach the next century, \nand ensuring that our federal investment is well spent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1408. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \npromote the cleanup of abandoned, idled, or underused commercial or \nindustrial facilities, the expansion or redevelopment of which are \ncomplicated by real or perceived environmental contamination, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n          small business brownfields redevelopment act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999.\n  As we debate the best avenue to promote smart growth in our \ncommunities, a prominent issue is brownfields revitalization. \nHistorically an issue of corporate America, small businesses can play a \ncrucial role in revitalizing brownfields sites. Providing small \nbusinesses with the necessary capital to redevelop these sites is \ncritical. The potential for small businesses to redevelop brownfields \nsites has gone untapped for far too long.\n  Although Congress clarified lender liability in 1996--in the FY 1997 \nOmnibus Appropriations bill--P.L. 104-208--there has been little \nprogress to enhance small business brownfields redevelopment efforts. \nLarger corporations have the necessary resources; for example, Bank of \nAmerica has recognized the economic benefits for brownfields lending. \nThe Small Business Brownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999 would level \nthis playing field.\n  Our goal with this legislation is to take an existing framework--the \nSmall Business Administration's (SBA) successful loan guarantee and \ncommunity development corporation programs--and channel important \nresources into brownfields redevelopment and prevention. It is a \nconcept with multiple objectives. It will provide legitimacy to \nbrownfields investment and lending, which does not now exist; and \npromote innovative cleanup technologies.\n  By redeveloping brownfields and easing development pressure on \ngreenfields, we are promoting smart growth; and by providing critical \nfinancial tools to our small businesses, we are promoting the backbone \nof our nation's economy.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Business \nBrownfields Redevelopment Act of 1999, a bill to set aside a portion of \nthe Small business Administration's (SBA) resources for use by small \nbusinesses for brownfields prevention and redevelopment.\n  I am pleased to co-sponsor this measure with Senator Jeffords of \nVermont. Together, we co-chair the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. \nWe recognize that our area of the country has its share of brownfields \nand the need for this important legislation.\n  Many smaller banks, including those represented by the SBA, are \nhesitant to lend to projects involving brownfields which they perceive \nto be risky. Our bill will encourage and provide the legitimacy to \nbrownfields investment and lending that is long overdue.\n  This bill designates a portion of the funding of two of SBA's \nprograms, Section 504, Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and Small \nBusiness Investment Companies (SBICs), for brownfields activities. This \nwill ensure that small businesses receive the support they need to \npromote the redevelopment of valuable land.\n  Companies across the nation have recognized the financial and social \nadvantages of Smart Growth and brownfields redevelopment. Communities \ncall on us to preserve and promote open space. This bill unites the \ngoals of businesses and residents in a common purpose: more efficient, \neconomical and ecological use of our nation's lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1409. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nfrom 24 months to 12 months the holding period used to determine \nwhether horses are assets described in section 1231 of such Code; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    legislation reducing the capital gains holding period for horses\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Mr. Bunning, \nto introduce legislation to reduce from 24 months to 12 months the \ncapital gains holding period for horses. All capital assets--with the \nexception of horses and cattle--qualify for the lowest capital gains \ntax rate if held for 12 months. This discrepancy in the tax code is \nsimply not fair to the horse industry.\n  The horse industry is extremely important to our economy, and \naccounts for thousands of jobs. Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, \nor showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along a trail--\none in thirty-five Americans is touched by the horse industry. In \nKentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 \nbillion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees.\n  What supports this industry is the investment in the horses \nthemselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are \nessential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without \nothers willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the \nindustry to remain competitive. The two-year holding period ultimately \ndiscourages investment, putting this industry --and the 1.4 million \njobs it supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic \npolicy and must be changed.\n  Mr. President, the two-year holding period for horses is sorely \noutdated. It was established in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter \nprovision. Since then, there have been a number of changes in the tax \ncode. Specifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, \nputting an end to these previous tax loopholes.\n  Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely \ndifferent function than other animals, like cattle. While both are \nlivestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. \nBeef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. \nHowever, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or \nworking--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their \nlonger life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. \nAdditionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they \ncontinue to enhance their value through breeding.\n  Mr. President, there is no sound argument for distinguishing horses \nfrom other capital assets. The two-year holding period discriminates \nagainst the horse industry and must be reduced. I urge my colleagues to \njoin Senator Bunning and me in correcting this unfair tax policy. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that the text of this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HOLDING PERIOD REDUCED TO 12 MONTHS FOR PURPOSES \n                   OF DETERMINING WHETHER HORSES ARE SECTION 1231 \n                   ASSETS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1231(b)(3) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definition of \n     property used in the trade or business) is amended by \n     striking ``and horses''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 1410. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with \nrespect to the treatment of certain air trnasportation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   empty seat tax relief legislation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to equate the tax \ntreatment of persons occupying what would otherwise be empty seats on \nprivate aircraft with the treatment of airline employees flying on a \nspace available basis on regularly scheduled flights. Right now, use of \nthese empty seats is deemed taxable personal income to the employee. I \nrefer to it as the ``empty-seat tax.'' Filling these empty seats--the \nway airlines do--can be likened to personnel taking offsets on freight \nflights, and empty seat passengers on auto, trucks, taxis or limousines \nthat are being driven for business.\n  Under current law, airline employees and retirees and their parents \nand children can fly tax-free on scheduled commercial flights for \nnonbusiness reasons. Military personnel and their families can hop \nmilitary flights for nonbusiness reasons without the imposition of tax. \nCurrent and former employees of airborne freight or cargo haulers, \ntogether with their parents and children, can fly tax-free for \nnonbusiness reasons on seats that would have otherwise been empty.\n  In addition, no tax is imposed on passengers accompanying employees \ntraveling on business via auto or other nonaircraft transportation. For \nexample, a trucker can take his wife on a haul without facing the \nimposition of a tax for the seat that she occupies. Yet tax is \nfrequently imposed on employees or ``deemed'' employees flying for \nnonbusiness reasons when they occupy what would otherwise be unused \nseats on business flights of noncommercial aircraft. Employers who own \nor lease these aircraft are compelled by IRS regulations to consider 13 \nseparate factors or steps in determining the incidence and amount of \ntax to be imposed on their employees. My proposal seeks to deal with \nthis inequity by treating all passengers the same way.\n\n  Under this provision, the employer would have to demonstrate to the \nIRS on audit that the flight would have been made in the ordinary \ncourse of the employer's business whether or not the person was on the \nflight. The employer would also have to show that the presence of the \nperson did not cause the employer to incur additional costs for the \nflight. Personal use of a plane, such as when an executive files with \nhis or her family or guests to a vacation home, would remain fully \ntaxable, just as under current law.\n  In 1984, the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that it was \n``unacceptable'' to continue ``conditions'' under which ``taxpayers in \nidentical or comparable situations have been treated differently'' \nbecause of the ``inequities, confusion and administrative difficulties \nfor business, employees and the internal revenue service resulting from \nthis situation.'' The Joint Committee on Taxation was right then, and \nthe comment continues to be accurate 15 years later.\n  This is not just about creating equity for all passengers. It also \ngoes to our ultimate goal of simplifying the Tax\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\nCode for all Americans. Upon passage of this provision, a separate \ncategory of taxpayer will be eliminated and employees and employers \nwill be able to better assess the tax implications of travel on \naircraft.\n  This is an especially important issue to large States with smaller \npopulations because air travel comprises such a large part of our \ntransportation systems. Instead of getting on a plane to travel across \ncountry, many people from rural areas get on a plane to travel within \nthe State.\n  This is also a health care issue. Many people in rural States like \nmine must take an empty seat on a company-owned airplane because they \nget sick and need medical treatment that can only be found in larger \ncities. In the contiguous States, someone can call an ambulance to take \na car or bus to a larger metropolitan area to receive medical \ntreatment. There are no buses from Barrow to Fairbanks or Cold Bay to \nAnchorage. The current Tax Code overlooks this fact of life and my \nprovision will take this into account. We must begin to treat all \npassengers fairly, regardless of how they get to their final \ndestination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 1411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe credit for producing electricity from certain renewable resources; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       Fish Oil Heat Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fish Oil Heat Act \nof 1999. This act would provide a tax credit for fishing operations who \nchoose to burn waste fish oil rather than diesel fuel. Fishing \noperations would earn a tax credit for each Btu of heat produced by \nthis alternative fuel source. This measure is similar to others that \nare before the Senate in that it encourages businesses to use \nalternative energy sources at hand rather than relying solely on fossil \nfuels.\n  This bill would amend section 45 of the Tax Code to include fish oil \nas a qualified energy producing resource. Fishing operations, whether \non shore or at sea are able to use fish oil to keep their working areas \nwarm and to process the fish they harvest. My legislation would expand \nthe current Tax Code to provide an incentive to use alternative energy \nsources by including heat generated by waste fish oil under section 45. \nAs it stands now, the Tax Code allows tax credits for electricity \nproduced by wind or through a closed loop biomass system. Fishing \noperations are often isolated from energy grids and they do not rely on \nthe organic biomass systems for energy, so they cannot take advantage \nof the electricity producing tax credit.\n  Several Senators have introduced bills to expand the current Tax Code \nto allow for new energy producing tax credits from alternative \nresources. However, the tax credits are limited to a single form of \nenergy--electricity. My bill would take into account a different form \nof energy--heat. This provision would give the same amount of tax \ncredit for a single Btu of heat produced as the current Tax Code allows \nfor a kilowatt hour of electricity produced. This will create equity \nwithin the tax system and across industry lines.\n  Fishing operations in my State are often isolated and rely on the \nresources they have at hand. Unlike many of the industries in the \ncontiguous United States, fishing operations in Alaska can't connect to \narea wide power grids. They rely on fossil fuels to run generators for \nheat and electricity. The fuel must be transported to the operation, \noften by barge or small boat. This bill would encourage these isolated \nfishing operations to collect and use the waste fish oil that they \ngenerate to keep their business warm. This would cut down on the amount \nof fossil fuel being transported to these distant locations, thus \nreducing the chances of fuel spills. Additionally, by encouraging the \nfishing operations to burn the waste oil they generate, we can reduce \nthe amount of fish oil going to waste.\n\n

47--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n        REGARDING THE REGULATORY BURDENS ON HOME HEALTH AGENCIES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bond, Ms. Collins, Mr. Frist, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. \nTorricelli) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 47\n\n       Whereas 3,900,000 elderly persons currently use health care \n     services provided under the medicare home health program;\n       Whereas the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made a number of \n     changes to the administration of the medicare home health \n     program;\n       Whereas many such changes imposed by such Act were required \n     to be implemented by the Health Care Financing Administration \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``HCFA'') of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services;\n       Whereas many of such regulations promulgated by HCFA in \n     order to implement such changes have proven to be \n     administratively burdensome, have diverted funds away from \n     needed beneficiary care, and were promulgated as final rules \n     without prior opportunity for comment by the home health \n     industry and home health patients;\n       Whereas HCFA has implemented a branch office policy that \n     imposes arbitrary distance and suspension requirements that \n     are administratively burdensome and threaten access to home \n     health services, particularly in rural areas;\n       Whereas, in order to implement the shift of medicare \n     payment for home health services from part A to part B, HCFA \n     imposed a sequential billing policy that prohibited home\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n     health agencies from submitting bills for patient services if \n     a previous bill was submitted for that patient who was \n     undergoing medical review;\n       Whereas HCFA has expanded medical reviews of home health \n     claims so that the processing of such claims has slowed down \n     significantly nationwide;\n       Whereas HCFA is requiring home health agencies to submit \n     patient data using the Outcomes and Assessment Information \n     Set (referred to in this resolution as ``OASIS'') in \n     anticipation of and to assist the development of a \n     prospective payment system (PPS) for home health services;\n       Whereas, HCFA plans to implement an overly burdensome \n     requirement that agencies report visit times in 15-minute \n     increments that fails to account for the entire time spent in \n     the home and on activities such as care planning, \n     coordination, documentation, and travel that are essential \n     for a home health visit;\n       Whereas most home health agencies will not be reimbursed \n     for any of the costs or the increase in administrative \n     requirements associated with OASIS;\n       Whereas the slowdown in claims processing, coupled with \n     sequential billing and implementation of OASIS, has \n     substantially increased home health agency cash flow problems \n     because payments are often delayed by 3 months or more;\n       Whereas the vast majority of home health agencies are small \n     businesses that cannot operate with such significant cash \n     flow problems; and\n       Whereas there are many other elements of the medicare home \n     health program, such as the interim payment system, which \n     have created financial problems for home health agencies, \n     such that more than 2,200 agencies nationwide have already \n     closed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should actively oversee the administration by \n     the Health Care Financing Administration (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``HCFA'') of the medicare home health program;\n       (2) in overseeing such administration, Congress should pay \n     particular attention to HCFA's compliance with the public \n     notice and comment requirements of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), HCFA's consideration \n     of input from the home health community, and HCFA's \n     coordination and consistent application of policies among \n     HCFA's central and regional offices; and\n       (3) Congress should monitor HCFA's adherence to and \n     implementation of Congressional intent when executing changes \n     during such administration.\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nconcurrent resolution intended to focus the attention of Congress on \nthe current plight of Medicare beneficiaries who receive home health \ncare. Specifically, the resolution calls for increased Congressional \noversight with regard to home health care of the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA), which has responsibility of implementing the \nfederal Medicare program.\n  Home health providers, or ``agencies'' as they are called, are being \ndecimated by overly burdensome and complex regulations issued by HCFA. \nOstensibly issued to implement the Medicare preservation provisions of \nthe 1997 Balanced Budget Act, these regulations instead have ignored or \nconjured Congressional intent and in the process have driven thousands \nof home health agencies out of business and left tens of thousands of \nhomebound seniors scrambling to find care.\n  Mr. President, my home state of Texas is very rural. Despite the fact \nthat there are now almost 20 million people living in Texas, most areas \nof the state remain rural, even isolated from major population centers. \nMany of these areas are medically very underserved. There are counties \nin Texas without a single hospital, and several without so much as a \nclinic for people to go to find basic health services. It's not unusual \nfor a Texan in some parts of the state to have to drive 100 miles or \nmore just to see a doctor.\n  When Congress created the home health benefit within the Medicare \nprogram, it dramatically extended Medicare's reach to senior citizens \nand disabled persons living in these rural areas. Home health also \noffered to bring much needed health services to many who, although they \nmay reside in a city, nevertheless may live an isolated existence \nbecause they are homebound.\n  Because of the tremendous need and demand for home health care, the \nprogram began to grow rapidly. This growth began to alarm some who felt \nthat the cost of the program would soon outstrip the Medicare system's \nability to pay for it. There were also a growing number of reports of \nabuse and fraud within Medicare generally, and specifically within the \nhome health program.\n  So in 1997, as part of a broader Medicare package, Congress acted to \nmake the home health program more efficient and to crack-down on fraud \nand abuse. While these reforms were intended as a wake-up call to \ninefficient and fraudulent home health providers, they were not \nintended to pull the rug out from under the entire home health \nindustry, and the 4 million patients nationwide who depend on the \nservices home care provides. Unfortunately, that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  Home health agencies have been besieged on all sides. Implementation \nof the Interim Payment System (IPS) has caused immediate cuts in \npayments to agencies by upwards of 60 percent. In many cases, these \ncuts are being implemented retroactively, resulting in many agencies \nbeing slapped with ``overpayment'' demand notices for hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. In some cases, these payment demands exceed the \nagency's annual payroll. Moreover, the manner in which HCFA has chosen \nto implement the IPS has caused the most efficient agencies to suffer \nthe most severe cuts. Agencies that were less efficient, and thus were \npaid more in the past, are ironically given higher reimbursements under \nthe IPS.\n  At the same time, home health agencies have been hit with many new, \ncomplex, and burdensome regulations, some of which seem to have no real \npurpose other than to generate more paperwork and administrative costs \nby home care agencies.\n  For example, home health providers are now required to keep track of \nand report their time in 15 minute increments. Many visiting nurses and \nother home health providers report having to use a stopwatch while they \nadminister care to their patients in order to comply with this new \nrequirement. Another example is HCFA's implementation of a sequential \nbilling policy, wherein an agency cannot bill Medicare for services \nprovided to a patient until all previous claims for that patient are \nresolved, even if those earlier claims are held-up by the Medicare \nbureaucracy.\n  Across the nation, and particularly in my home state of Texas, the \ncombined results of these payment cuts and new regulations have been \nnothing short of catastrophic. In Texas alone, an estimated 700 home \ncare agencies have already gone out of business since 1997, and many \nmore are on the verge of collapse. Nationwide, upwards of 2200 agencies \nhave reportedly shut their doors, representing about a third of the \ntotal number of home care agencies.\n  Mr. President, it seems that everywhere I travel in Texas, and I \ntravel to some very rural areas, the one health complaint I hear \nconsistently from my constituents concerns changes in the Medicare home \nhealth benefit. I have heard numerous instances of home health \nbeneficiaries, particularly those with complex illnesses and demanding \nhealth needs, who have been left high and dry by the closure of their \nhome care agency. Many of these individuals have been forced into \nhospitals or nursing homes. Others simply get no care, or must rely to \nthe extent they can upon what care family or neighbors can provide.\n  I and many of my colleagues have communicated with HCFA in an attempt \nto soften the blow of their regulations, with only very limited \nsuccess. And while HCFA has been largely unresponsive to Congress, it \nhas been even more insulated from the comments, suggestions, and \ncomplaints from the home health community. In many cases, payment \nsystem changes have been enacted with virtually no public participation \nor comment.\n  Mr. President, our nation's homebound senior citizens deserve more.\n  This resolution seeks to bring attention to the plight of home health \nbeneficiaries under HCFA's cumbersome implementation of the reforms \nCongress enacted. It calls upon Congress to take a more active role in \noverseeing the Health Care Financing Administration with regard to home \nhealth care and HCFA's implementation of its home care regulations. \nMost importantly, the resolution calls upon HCFA to adhere more closely \nto Congressional intent in administering the Medicare home health \nbenefit to ensure that the program is not further eviscerated.\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\n  This resolution is certainly not the only solution to the current \nhome health crisis. Just this month I joined with Senators Collins, \nBond, and others, many of whom are original cosponsors of this \nresolution, in introducing substantive legislation that will repeal \nsome of the most severe applications of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. \nWhile these changes cannot turn back time to restore the agencies and \nservices that have been lost, it can help prevent even more providers \nfrom going out of business and even more homebound patients from being \nmedically stranded.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support this resolution, \nas well as the substantive legislation just introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Collins. But most importantly, I call upon my colleagues to \nrecognize the real and ongoing health care crisis facing America's \nhomebound seniors and disabled individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8960-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8960-S8961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 158--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 21, 1999, AS A ``DAY OF \n         NATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \nGrams, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, \nMr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nTorricelli, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 158\n\n       Whereas every day in the United States, 14 children under \n     the age of 19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims \n     aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun;\n       Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students \n     reported having carried a gun in the past 30 days;\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear \n     and violence;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of October 21, 1999, as a ``Day of \n     National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence'' will \n     allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about \n     their future in that such students will have the opportunity \n     to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun \n     Violence'', and promise that they will never take a gun to \n     school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will \n     actively use their influence in a positive manner to prevent \n     friends from using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 21, 1999, as a ``Day of National \n     Concern about Young People and Gun Violence''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the school children of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat has passed the Senate now for 3 years unanimously.\n  My resolution, which I am submitting today, along with Senator Warner \nand 28 other original cosponsors, establishes October 21, 1999, as a \nday of national concern about young people and gun violence. For the \nlast several years, I have sponsored this legislation. This year, \nSenator Warner has joined me in leading the cosponsorship drive as we \npledge to our young people across the Nation that we support their \nstrong efforts to help stop the violence in their own schools and \ncommunities. I thank Senator Warner for his help and partnership in \nwork on this issue.\n  Sadly, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the \ntragic events that occurred earlier this year in Littleton, CO, and \nConyers, GA. These school shootings across the Nation have paralyzed \ntheir communities and shocked the country. In recent years, we have \nseen similar shootings from Mississippi to Oregon. These events have \ntouched us all. Adults and young people alike have been horrified by \nthe violence that has occurred in our schools, which should be a safe \nhaven for children. We are all left wondering what we can do to prevent \nthese tragedies.\n  I am again introducing this resolution because I am convinced the \nbest way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual \nchildren and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution \nsimply establishes a special day that gives parents and teachers, \ngovernment leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a way \nto focus on the problems caused by gun violence. It also empowers young \npeople to take affirmative steps to end this violence by encouraging \nthem to take a pledge not to use guns to resolve disputes.\n  A Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed this idea of \nstudent pledges and for a day of national concern for young people and \ngun violence. In addition, Mothers Against Violence in America, the \nNational Parent Teacher Association, the American Federation of \nTeachers, the National Association of Student Councils, and the \nAmerican Medical Association have joined the effort to establish a \nspecial day to express concern about our children and gun violence and \nsupport a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge \nagainst gun violence.\n  In 1998, more than 1 million students across the Nation signed this \npledge card. The student pledge against gun violence gives students the \nchance to make a promise in writing that they will do their part to \nprevent gun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: \nFirst, they will never carry a gun to school; second, they will never \nresolve a dispute with a gun; and third, they will use their influence \nwith friends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns.\n  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had \nsigned and lived up to such a pledge just last year.\n  Consider that in the months between today and the day we demonstrated \nour concern about youth violence last year, we have had terrifying \noutbreaks of school violence. Sadly, 12 students and one teacher have \nbeen killed, and more than 25 students have been wounded in shootings \nby children at school. In addition, we have lost many more children in \nwhat has become the all too common violence of drive-by shootings, drug \nwars, and other crime, and in self-inflicted and unintentional \nshootings.\n  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on \nthe decline. Many factors are involved, including community-based \npolicing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention \nprograms, and population demographics. None of us intend to rest on our \nsuccess because we still have far, far too much crime and violence in \nthis society.\n  So, we must find the solutions that work and focus our limited \nresources on those. We must get tough on violent criminals--even if \nthey are young--to protect the rest of society from their terrible \nactions. And we, each and every one of us, must make time to spend with \nour children, our neighbor's children, and the children who have no one \nelse to care about them. Only when we reach out to our most vulnerable \ncitizens--our kids--will we stop youth violence.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple \neffort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming \nOctober 21 a ``Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' \nOctober is National Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center \nour attention of the special needs of our kids and gun violence. We \nintroduce this resolution today in the hopes of getting all 100 \nSenators to cosponsor it prior to this passage, which we hope will \noccur in early September. This is an easy step for us to help \nfacilitate the work that must go on in each community across America, \nas parents, teachers, friends, and students try to prevent gun violence \nbefore it ruins any more lives.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \npassed the United States Senate by unanimous consent each of the last \ntwo years. I am pleased to join Senator Murray in establishing October \n21, 1999, as the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun \nViolence.\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\n  On April 20, 1999, two teenagers wearing long black trench coats over \nfatigues began shooting their fellow classmates and faculty at \nColumbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. In the end, 15 people \ndied and many others were injured, in the bloodiest school shooting in \nAmerica's history. Unfortunately, the atrocity that occurred in \nLittleton, Colorado, is not an isolated incident. Before the shooting \nin Columbine High School, recent school shootings occurred in Pearl, \nMississippi; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and \nSpringfield, Oregon. After Littleton, six students were shot in \nConyers, Georgia, by one of their fellow students.\n  The problem of young people and gun violence expands beyond school \nshootings. Every day in the United States, 14 children under the age of \n19 are killed with guns, and in 1994, approximately 70 percent of \nmurder victims aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun. America has \nlost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common \nviolence of drive-by shootings, drug wars and other crimes, as well as \nin self-inflicted and unintentional shootings.\n  In the aftermath of these tragedies, we all find ourselves looking \nfor answers. While there is no simple solution as to how to stop youth \nviolence, a Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of \na Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. I \nbelieve this idea is a step in the right direction, as do such groups \nas Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Association of \nStudent Councils, the American Federation of Teachers, the National \nParent Teacher Associations, and the American Medical Association.\n  Simply put, this resolution will establish October 21, 1999, as the \nDay of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this \nday, students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to \nvoluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence.'' By \nsigning the pledge, students promise that they will never take a gun to \nschool, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will use their \ninfluence in a positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to \nsettle disputes.\n  Mr. President, losing one child from gun violence is one too many. \nThough this resolution is not the ultimate solution to preventing \nfuture tragedies like Littleton, if it stops even one incident of youth \ngun violence, this resolution will be invaluable. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join in this resolution to focus attention on gun \nviolence among youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8961-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8961-S8968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1260\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici and Mr. Reid) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 1258 proposed by Mr. Kyl to the bill (H.R. \n1555) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for intelligence \nand intelligence-related activities of the United States Government, \nthe Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nRetirement and Disability System, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In section 213 of the Department of Energy Organization \n     Act, as proposed by subsection (c) of the amendment, at the \n     end of subsection (k), insert the following:\n       ``Such supervision and direction of any Director or \n     contract employee of a national security laboratory or of a \n     nuclear weapons production facility shall not interfere with \n     communication to the Department, the President, or Congress, \n     of technical findings or technical assessments derived from, \n     and in accord with, duly authorized activities.

Elizabeth Colton, the president of the Board of \nDirectors of the International Museum of Women is building broad \nsupport among community leaders and public officials. The museum will \nbe built in San Francisco, since this city has roots which reach \nvirtually every corner of the globe. The museum will start construction \nin 2003, and the total cost of the museum is $50 million.\n  Women have made important contributions and this museum can help us \nto better explore the role of women in history. This museum will seek \nto not simply bring recognition to women and their contributions, but \nit will re-examine history to more accurately incorporate the effects \nand implications of women's actions and ideas. The museum's educational \nprograms can play a significant role in shaping how society views women \nand girls.\n  In addition, International Museum of Women can provide role models \nfor women and girls, furnish a new context for historical \ninterpretations, and portray the importance and existence of the \nhistoric, ongoing fight for equal rights. This museum can open the \ndoors to endless possibilities and limitless opportunities for females.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in saluting the International \nMuseum of\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nWomen, as one way to eradicate inequality and open doors to \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8971-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8971-S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MISSION SAN JOSE DE LA LAGUNA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Our Independence Day, July 4th is also a \nsignificant day at the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico. On July 4, 1699, \nseventy-seven years before the famous American Independence day, the \nSpanish Governor of the New Mexico Territory sanctioned the ground-\nbreaking for the Mission San Jose de la Laguna.\n  Laguna Pueblo has six villages--Laguna, Mesita, Paguate, Encinal, \nParaje, and Seama. The Mission San Jose is the Mother Church for all \nthe villages. To celebrate this important milestone, a feast day was \ndeclared for the Laguna Pueblo. Events started with a fund raising \ndinner on Friday, July 2. On Saturday, July 3, traditional dances were \nheld at the main plaza and a beautiful fireworks display and community \ndance closed the first full day of celebration.\n  On Sunday, July 4, at 8 o'clock in the morning, an open air mass was \ncelebrated by Bishop Donald Pelotte of the Archdiocese of Gallup. \nLaguna Pueblo drummers and singers in traditional dress participated in \nthe mass. Pottery vessels by Laguna artists were made for the \nEucharist.\n  Special guests included former U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, \nthe Blessed Sacrament Sisters, Sisters of St. Agnes, and Sisters of the \nImmaculate Conception. Father Antonio Trujillo of the San Jose Mission \nwas a key participant in the mass. He spoke of the importance of \ncontinuing to embrace two religious traditions in mutual respect.\n  Gratitude to all who organized this very special Independence Day \nevent for Laguna Pueblo was generously given. Laguna Pueblo Governor \nHarry Early and the Pueblo Council were present and active throughout \nthe activities. Special guests were introduced.\n  Traditional Indian dances such as the Hunter's Dance and the Eagle \nDance were held throughout the day on the same plaza where the mass was \ncelebrated.\n  The formal mass of the Mission San Jose and the Laguna Pueblo \ntraditional dances emphasized the beauty in which these two cultures \nhave overcome past difficulties and now flourish in grace and common \nrespect. As Father Mark Joseph noted, we are reminded today to ``take \ncare of your family as St. Joseph took care of his family.'' The \nCatholic Church and the Laguna Pueblo families have clearly taken this \nmessage to heart.\n  A Spirit Garden was organized and planted to honor all those who \nfarmed these arid lands over the past centuries. A procession to the \nRio San Jose was held on Saturday afternoon. Statues of St. Joseph, St. \nMary, Jesus Christ, and other saints were brought in from all the \nvillages for this procession.\n  A new niche about four feet high and a couple of feet deep for a \nshrine to St. Joseph was carved out of the sandstone between the church \nand the San Jose River. The niche was hand chiseled by the Siow \nbrothers of Laguna Pueblo, Gaylord, Virgil, and Delbert. A stone \ncarving of St. Joseph holding baby Jesus was placed in the shrine. The \nstatue was made by Robert Dale Tsosie.\n  This new shrine to St. Joseph was dedicated and blessed with water \nfrom the Rio San Jose. This river water was also used to bless the \npersonal and village saints that were carried to the river by about two \nhundred participants. Governor Harry Early led the procession as he \ncarried a statue of St. Joseph down to the river and then back up the \nhill to the Mission San Jose. A blessing ceremony for the saints, the \nmission, and the Pueblo was held at the river on Saturday, July 3, \n1999.\n  In preparation for this 300th anniversary celebration, many \ntraditional practices like gardening, belt weaving, drum making, and \npottery making were undertaken with special pride by young and old \nalike.\n  I am pleased to be able to share this special event with my \ncolleagues who will be intrigued by the added significance of the 4th \nof July to the Laguna Pueblo of New Mexico and to Americans in general.\n  Mr. President, an article by Debra Haaland Toya further explains the \nsignificance of this important anniversary to Laguna Pueblo. This \narticle was published in the June, 1999, edition of New Mexico \nMagazine. Debra is an enrolled member of Laguna Pueblo and a member of \nthe San Jose 300th Anniversary Committee. I ask that her article be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     Mission San Jose de la Laguna\n\n                        (By Debra Haaland Toya)\n\n       The splendor of the San Jose Mission at the Village of Old \n     Laguna goes much deeper than its three-century-old altar, \n     dominated by hand-carved pine columns. A magnificent wooden \n     altar screen, originally painted by a man known only as The \n     Laguna Santero, depicts the guardians of the village. \n     Brilliant red and green dominates the floor to ceiling \n     adornment and prominently attests to the unification of \n     traditional Native and Catholic Religions. This July 4th, \n     Laguna's coexistence with the Catholic Church will enter its \n     300th year.\n       Built of sandstone, San Jose Mission sits on the highest \n     rise in the village, watching over its caretakers. The church \n     is revered for its magnificent art and architecture, and for \n     its spiritual contributions. Laguna's church was built after \n     the Pueblo Revolt of 1680; therefore, enjoyed a peaceful \n     existence. It missed the fire and destruction exerted by \n     other peoples, onto their churches, as a result of opposition \n     to religious suppression.\n       Before the mission was built, a delegation of Lagunas \n     traveled the dusty roads, by foot and with horses, to Santa \n     Fe during the late-1600s, to ask Governor Pedro Rodriguez \n     Cubero for a priest. The Governor sent the delegation away \n     and told them that once they prepared a place of worship, a \n     priest would be sent. On July 4, 1699, Mission San Jose was \n     founded along with the recognition by the Spanish Government \n     that Laguna Pueblo was a legitimate possession. The original \n     document attesting to this shift states that Laguna ``swore \n     its vassalage and obedience,'' to Spain.\n       Throughout the years the church has been a beacon, although \n     its path has not always been a straight one. The Indians \n     continued their traditional ceremonies even after \n     Christianization. From time-to-time, this practice gathered \n     ire from those non-Indians intent on making Lagunas single-\n     minded in their worship. It is documented that during the \n     mid-1800s most Lagunas attended church out of fear rather \n     than desire. During Mexican rule, prior to 1848, part of the \n     church's convent fell into ruins, and another part of the \n     church was used as a kiva, where sacred ceremonies were \n     prepared for.\n       In spite of the changes that occur with time, the care the \n     church receives remains constant. In August of 1998 a \n     meeting, of the San Jose 300th Anniversary Committee and the \n     elder women, highlighted plans of replastering the floor. \n     Lifetime resident, Julia Herrera, who has plastered since she \n     was a girl, stressed the importance of youth involvement.\n       Father Antonio Trujillo, committee chairman, widely \n     announced plans for the 2-week-long project. No fewer than 30 \n     people per day, including teenagers, arrived daily to give \n     their share of toil. The job included removing five inches of \n     old floor, hauling dirt, cutting straw, and mixing mud using \n     a wooden block like a mano. The entire 2300 square feet were \n     plastered on hands and knees. ``This is good,'' Julia says \n     approvingly, `` if the kids don't learn how, who'll take care \n     of the church when we're gone?\"\n       The people plan to completely resurface the outside of the \n     church in the near future. During the mid-sixties, in an \n     effort to protect the church, a cement coating instead of \n     plaster was applied. Over the years, the cement has cracked, \n     allowing water to enter but not escape. Upon inspection, \n     Cornerstone Foundation, an organization that helps \n     communities rebuild traditional structures, discovered that \n     the water caused enormous damage to the large rocks at the \n     base of the walls, particularly on the north side.\n       To undertake this project the people will have to carve \n     away the current coating using special saws, chisels, and \n     hammers. The disintegrated rocks will be replaced and the 30-\n     foot-high-walls will be replastered. Upon surveying the \n     damage, Julia looks up and recalls a time when her relatives \n     hoisted her up with a pulley, and a rope tied around her \n     waist, in order to cover the highest portion of the walls. \n     ``Not anymore, I'm too old now,'' she remarks.\n       In years past, plastering would occur prior to feast days \n     and neighboring tribal members would offer help. During the \n     work, they were given room and board in village homes and \n     feasted when the work was done. This forthcoming project will \n     be undertaken by the community alone, with no professional \n     help, and this time Julia will be on the ground supervising.\n       The committee planned a number of cultural events leading \n     up to July 4th when a traditional feast day will take place. \n     Through the years, and due to increased outside influences, \n     such as 30 years of uranium mining, off-reservation \n     employment, and the affects of technology, some cultural \n     activities have not been as strongly exercised as others.\n       In December 1998, committee member, Ann Ray, organized a \n     day which focused on the almost forgotten practice of making \n     of clay\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\n     figurines. It was common at Christmas time to send children \n     below the village to get clay from the San Jose River. The \n     family would sit near the wood stove, while a kerosene lamp \n     cast shadows of working hands or the grandfather beating a \n     steady drum, and singing. The family shaped moist earth into \n     animals, houses, vegetables, or other forms, depending upon \n     the wishes of the individuals. Domesticated animals were \n     often popular, as Lagunas have raised cattle and sheep since \n     the seventeenth century. Shapes of corn and melons also \n     defined many people's wishes for rainfall and successful \n     crops the following year.\n       The people would take the figures to the church altar on \n     Christmas eve and leave them for four days. Upon their return \n     home, the clay cows were, perhaps, buried in the corral, and \n     the corn was laid deep in the field. The symbol of one's wish \n     for the time and endurance to build a home for a loved one \n     might be buried in a vacant plot of land. This past Christmas \n     the altar was graced by figurines, which had not been present \n     for years. Clay figures in 1998 included symbols for good \n     grades in school, money for college, computers, and wishes \n     for athletic ability, in the forms of basketballs and \n     footballs.\n       A ceremony to bless the saints with water will also be \n     reintroduced on the evening of July 3rd. When the original \n     saint statues came to Laguna, they were taken to the river \n     and dipped in the rushing waters to obtain the earth's \n     blessings, before they were placed in the church. The saints \n     were also believed to hold power. One story tells of a severe \n     drought in the earlier part of this century, wherein the \n     people prayed for rain to no avail. The spiritual leaders of \n     the time entreated the priest to take the saints back to the \n     river and dip them in the water as the ancestors had done in \n     1699. The drought passed, and the people's faith continued \n     strong. This year, the people will be encouraged to bring \n     their saints from home, and a blessing will take place near \n     the shrine, which was recently erected in honor of San Jose \n     and the 300th Anniversary.\n       In times past, the San Jose river was also the location on \n     which Lagunas planted their irrigated fields of corn, beans, \n     and squash. Today an irrigation system runs the length of the \n     pueblo and people can successfully plant and harvest miles \n     from the river. Although this system is in place, with the \n     men and boys cleaning the ditches seasonally, many fields lay \n     dormant. One main reason for this absence of agriculture is \n     the 30-year interruption of the Jackpile Mines near the \n     village of Paguate. With the mine's beginning in 1953, Laguna \n     eventually relied primarily on money, rather than bartering, \n     as they had for centuries.\n       The 300th Anniversary Committee wished to bring back an \n     interest in the ancient art of farming by planting The Spirit \n     Garden, also near the river. Attention to our role as \n     agriculturists has had positive effects, and a new interest \n     in farming will, hopefully, persist. As a girl, I used to go \n     with my grandfather to his field below the village of Mesita, \n     where we would hoe weeds, pick worms off corn, and sit in the \n     shade of his peach trees eating the sweet fruit on hot, \n     breezeless days. I was especially proud at taking the fruits \n     of our harvest home for my grandmother to cook. In planting \n     the Spirit Garden, this appreciation for the land will have \n     the opportunity to grow strong again.\n       The love of agriculture, the people's coexistence with the \n     church, and other events crucial to our purpose on this earth \n     are present in those who are gifted with the ability to \n     recall the stories of our ancestors. A project to document an \n     oral history of Laguna has also been set in motion in a \n     principal effort to teach our young people. Before \n     electricity was available to Laguna households in the late \n     60s, the absence of television, radio, and video games was \n     filled by the elders telling stories or singing songs. My \n     grandmother was our primary story-teller, once my grandfather \n     died in 1968, and to this day, her knowledge of the past \n     holds our family together.\n       The public is welcome to visit Laguna and the San Jose \n     Mission on most days. Tours of the Spirit Garden, San Jose \n     Shrine, and the church are conducted daily, and more \n     frequently as the 300th celebration nears. A traditional \n     feast day will be held on July 4th, with mass in the plaza at \n     8 AM, arts and crafts, and all-day dancing.\n       Upon approaching the carved doors of the church, a well-\n     preserved image of the Franciscan Seal, with the crossed arms \n     of Jesus and St. Francis will tell you that the structure was \n     built by the Franciscans. When entering the church, the \n     elaborate decoration will tell you that a people's wish to \n     embrace their God in a Christian way, yet maintain their \n     respect and worship of nature is unwavering. Pax et bonum--\n     Peace and all good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8972-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACK WARNER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nJack Warner, a pillar of the Tuscaloosa business community and a man of \ndeep passion both in his business and personal pursuits. The former \nChairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper Corporation, I would like to \nrecognize him for the work that he and his wife, Elizabeth, have \ncontributed to Tuscaloosa in the form of time, expertise and money to \nmany local causes.\n  The pragmatic approach that he has brought to his life combines old-\nfashioned common sense with a flexible philosophy. This philosophy has \nevolved over time, through two world wars, numerous labor strikes, and \ntough financial circumstances. Through it all, Jack Warner has remained \nsteadfast in his beliefs and a pioneer from which others might draw \ninspiration. He has made tough business decisions throughout the years, \nand through it all kept Gulf States Paper privately owned, when so many \nother companies have gone public. His gritty determination has led to \nfinancial success, which has helped him to pursue his personal \ninterests and also allowed him to give back to the Tuscaloosa \ncommunity.\n  Jack Warner truly represents an era when a man presented his best \neffort to any obstacle in his path. As an officer in the Army's last \nhorse-mounted unit, his cavalry unit was sent to India to pack supplies \nalong the Burma trail during World War II. Once there, his unit was \nissued mules instead of horses, which would be enough to take the wind \nout of any proud soldier's sails. Jack Warner persevered however, and \nhis regiment ended up making a significant contribution to the War \neffort when a traditional cavalry unit would have had little to offer. \nThis story encapsulates the life of Jack Warner, demonstrating \npersistence through adversity, and a humble focus to get the job done \nright.\n  Jack Warner has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the \nsurrounding area. In fact, he has recently completed the redecoration \nof the University of Alabama President's Mansion at his own expense. \nPerhaps almost as importantly, Jack followed through with the \nrenovation to the last small detail, going so far as to choose the \ndrapery as well as replacing a smaller chandelier with an immense late \n18th century Waterford crystal chandelier. Again, this typifies the man \nwhich has been so integral to the Tuscaloosa community, not only \nproviding the money for the project, but following through and making \nsure everything turned out right. His commitment to Tuscaloosa and the \nState of Alabama is greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8972-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8972-S8973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE FOUNDATION\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nNational Youth Science Foundation and the 99 outstanding high school \nstudents who have been chosen to represent their states in the \nsciences. The National Youth Science Foundation honors and encourages \nexcellence in science education. Since its inception in 1963, the \nNational Youth Science Camp has brought together thousands of \noutstanding high school students who excel in the sciences. I want to \ncongratulate the two students chosen from my state for this high honor, \nMelissa Corley from Dallas and Jason Simon from Highland Village. These \nstudents are selected from the program through a competitive process in \neach state that stresses scholastic excellence, scientific curiosity, \nand leadership in their schools and communities. These students will \nparticipate in a four-week summer forum where delegates exchange ideas \nwith leading scientists and other professionals from academic and \ncorporate worlds. Lectures and hands-on research projects are presented \nby scientists from across the nation who work on some of the most \nprovocative topics in science today--topics such as fractal geometry, \nthe human genome project, global climate change, the history of the \nuniverse, the fate of our rain forests, and robotics. Delegates to the \nScience Camp are challenged to explore new areas in the biological and \nphysical sciences, arts, and music with resident staff members.\n  This week my constituent Bill Conner, of Nortel Networks, and an \nalumnus of the National Youth Science program, will speak at a luncheon \nin the Senate honoring this year's National Youth Science Camp \nparticipants. Bill Conner is an excellent role model for the young \nscientists who will be honored this week.\n  The National Youth Science Foundation, Nortel Networks and Bill \nConner have like-minded visions. America has much to lose if we do not \nnurture young scientists and engineers who have the skills, vision and \nenthusiasm to lead us into the twenty-first century. It gives me great \npleasure to recognize the National Youth Science\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nFoundation and thank all those who support America's educational \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/21/senate-section/article/S8973-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DESIGNATING MEMORIAL DOOR\n\n  Mr. GREGG.
