Mr. President, I rise today in support of the budget that \nis before the Senate. I am sorry that our dear chairman, Senator \nDomenici, is not here, but I want to say some very strong, positive \nthings about this budget, and I wish he were here to hear it. I want to \nsay it mostly because it is true. It would just be a plus if he were \nhere to hear it.\n  It has been my great privilege since I first came to Congress to be \nactively involved in budget debates. In fact, I remember the first \ndebate I ever was involved in as a Member of the House was a debate \nabout raising the debt ceiling, and I remember as if it were yesterday \nthe House majority leader, Congressman Wright from Texas, stood up and \nsaid that we had no choice except to raise the debt ceiling of the \nGovernment, that we were in a position that a man would be in if his \nwife went out and ran up all these debts on the credit card and the \ndebt collector was at the door.\n  Today, in this era of political correctness, no one would ever \nsuggest such a thing. They would say their spouses ran up these bills, \nand probably the reality would be the man did run up the bills in any \ncase. But the point is that the then-majority leader of the House, in \n1979, made the point that these bills had been run up and the bill \ncollector was at the door, and so we didn't have any choice except to \npay the bills as any good, honest family would.\n  And so I stand up and say that the first thing I ever said in debate \nin the Chamber of the House was, well, it is not really the way it \nworks. It is true that honest families would pay their bills, but what \nthey would do is they would sit down at the kitchen table, they would \ntalk about how they got in this financial mess, they would get out the \ncredit card, they would get out the butcher knife, they would cut up \nthe credit card, they would get an envelope and pencil and they would \nwork out a new budget on the back of an old used envelope, and they \nwould start over again. The problem in Congress was we kept simply \nspending money, incurring debt, raising the debt ceiling, and nobody \never sat down around the kitchen table, nobody ever got out the butcher \nknife and cut up the credit cards, and so, as a result, we never \nchanged anything.\n  So anyway, I opposed raising the debt ceiling. It failed. And then we \ntried to offer an amendment trying to tie the debt ceiling to the \nbudget and saying you can only raise the debt ceiling if you balance \nthe budget.\n  Well, to make a long story short, from that time in 1979 until today, \nI have been involved in debate about every budget that has passed in \nthis Congress or been enforced in this Government since 1979. And let \nme say\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nthat of all those budgets, this is the best budget that has ever been \nwritten by American Government in that period.\n  Now it is probably not, certainly not the most profound budget. The \nmost profound budget was the Reagan budget that was written in 1981. \nBut in terms of what you want a budget to be, it would be very hard to \nimprove on what this budget does. And it is one of my frustrations that \neverything is now so focused on the war in Kosovo and on many other \nissues, and we are not having any kind of adequate debate or focus of \nattention on the profound nature of the budget that is in front of us \nand what great promise this budget holds for America if we actually \nenforce this budget.\n  So let me begin by just ticking off some things this budget does, and \nthen I want to get into a discussion of a comparison of this budget \nwith what the President proposed. I want to get into some of these \nareas like Social Security and Medicare that have been talked about a \nlot and will be talked about again. But let me outline what this budget \ndoes.\n\n  First of all, this is a 10-year budget that, if enforced, will \nbalance the budget every single year for 10 years. To sort of turn on \nits head the language of the 1980s, this is a budget that has surpluses \nas far as the eye can see. And it has those surpluses because it \nmaintains a restriction on spending in a period where revenues are \ngushing into the Federal Treasury, a period where if we are not very \ncareful we are going to see the launching of a massive new spending \nspree which could squander the surpluses of today that give us the \nopportunity to pay down debt, to rebuild Social Security, and do it \nright this time by basing it on wealth instead of debt, that give us \nthe ability to let working men and women in America keep more of what \nthey earn through a reduction in taxes. If we can keep these spending \ncontrol measures in place, we can provide adequate Government--in fact, \nthe highest levels of Government spending in American history. And yet \nby controlling the growth of spending, with the power of the American \neconomy and our competitiveness on the world market and the \nattractiveness of our capital market with huge amounts of wealth \nflowing into our equity markets, inflating values, making American \nfamilies richer, and inducing them to take income and capital gains and \npay record levels of taxes on it, we can keep the budget balanced, we \ncan rebuild Social Security based on wealth, and we can cut taxes for \nworking Americans. This budget does all those things.\n\n  Now, a budget is like a marriage license. It gets you into the deal, \nbut it doesn't make it successful. The easy part is saying ``I do.'' \nThe hard part of a successful marriage is what comes after the wedding. \nBut you cannot have the successful marriage if you don't have the \nwedding. We are being brought to the altar here with a document that \npromises all the right things. It is now going to be up to us to \nenforce those promises. But the key promise, the linchpin of this \nbudget, the element of this budget on which everything else hinges is \nit enforces the spending caps. If we do not control spending, we are \nnot going to have the surplus. We are not going to be able to rebuild \nSocial Security based on wealth instead of debt. We are not going to be \nable to preserve a balanced budget, and we are not going to be able to \ncut taxes.\n  Now, the second thing this budget does, which I rejoice in, is it \nstrengthens our ability to do these things. Every Member of Congress, \nand I wish every American, understood what happened last year. The \nPresident stood up really on the opening day of Congress last year in \nthe State of the Union Address and said save Social Security first. \nDon't spend a penny of the surplus on either Government programs or tax \ncuts. Save every penny of it for Social Security.\n  Well, we all know that the President was not telling the truth. We \nall know that in the end we ended up spending very much of that \nsurplus. We ended up on the last day of Congress taking a third of the \nsurplus that was meant for Social Security and spending it on other \nprograms, and we did it in the name of emergency spending.\n  One of the most important features in this budget is that we have in \nthis budget an enforcement mechanism that says that if someone wants to \ndesignate an emergency in nondefense spending, they are going to have \nto get 60 votes, if somebody raises a point of order. My basic view is, \nif something is not important enough or enough of an emergency that 60 \nout of the 100 Members of the Senate will vote for it, then it is not \nan emergency.\n  I say right now that I personally intend, if others don't, to raise a \npoint of order against each and every emergency spending bill that \nwould raid the Social Security trust fund. I give notice right now that \nanybody who has an idea that we are going to make all these wonderful \npromises, that we are going to promise to love, cherish, and obey in \nthis little wedding we are having here on the budget, but that we are \ngoing to turn around and start cheating in the fall by breaking this \nbudget by claiming all kinds of expenditures are an emergency, that \nthey better be ready to get 60 votes in the Senate if they are going to \nbe successful. They better be ready for a real battle, because I, for \none, believe in this budget, and I intend to fight for it very, very \nhard.\n  This budget puts a focus on some priorities. It basically says that \neven in a tight budget not all spending is equal. It puts a focus on \nveterans' health care, and it does it by, quite simply, taking the \nposition that in a time when you are trying to control spending, you \nhave benefits and you have earned benefits. The basic position of our \nbudget is that those who have served the country, who have preserved \nits life by wearing with pride its uniform and fighting its wars and by \nkeeping its peace, that even at a time when we have tight budgets, they \nought to come first. So this budget provides more money for veterans' \nhealth care, and I support it.\n  This budget provides more money for education. It doesn't create the \nmoney magically. It takes it away from other programs, with the basic \nidea that we ought to let the States decide how to spend money on \neducation rather than the Senate being a huge 100-member school.\n  This budget calls for an increase in defense. One of the great \nunknowns now, not knowing what the war in Kosovo is going to cost, is \nwhat is this going to do with our budget and where do we go from here. \nI want everybody to understand that this budget is written in such a \nway that we contemplate an increase in defense spending. We want to \ngive a pay increase to everybody in the military. We want to try to \nprovide the pay and benefits and recognition that will help us retain \nin uniform and recruit the finest young men and women who have ever \nworn the uniform of the country. Today they wear that uniform with \npride, but we have grown increasingly concerned that we are falling \nbehind in recruitment, in retention. We are having trouble, especially, \nkeeping pilots. Now that the President has us deployed in some 30 \ndifferent engagements around the world, where defense spending has been \ncut by over a third since its peak in real terms, and yet we have \nmassive military deployments, what is happening is, people are \nbeginning to leave the military.\n\n  This pay increase that we call for in this budget is vitally \nimportant in terms of helping us recruit and retain the best people. \nHaving all these miracle weapons does us no good if we don't have \nquality people to man those systems. We have the best people in uniform \ntoday that we have ever had. We want to keep it that way. That is what \nthis budget does.\n  That is the choice we have. The choice that is presented to us in \nthis budget is, even though we are in a period of record prosperity, \neven though the level of revenue flows is a record level, what we call \nfor is to limit the growth of Government spending, put a focus on areas \nlike veterans' health care and education and defense, use the surplus \nto deal with the looming crisis that faces us in Social Security, and \nto the extent that we have surpluses flowing from the general budget \ninstead of from Social Security, take the bulk of that money and give \nit back to working families in tax cuts.\n  That is what this budget does. I believe that it is an excellent \nbudget. I think looking at the whole package, it is the finest budget \npresented in America in the 20 years that I have served in Congress.\n\n[[Page S3727]]\n\n  Talking specifically about several different areas, I want everybody \nto understand that there is a shell game going on with Social Security. \nI want to explain, because people have trouble understanding what it is \nthe President is doing on Social Security and what this budget does on \nSocial Security. Let me first explain what this budget does on Social \nSecurity, and then explain the fraud that is perpetrated in the \nPresident's budget.\n  What this budget does on Social Security is very, very simple. It \nsays every penny that we collect in Social Security taxes that we don't \nhave to have to pay Social Security benefits should be dedicated to \nSocial Security. It ought to be locked away, and it ought to be \navailable to any effort to rebuild the financial base of Social \nSecurity. But we should not spend it on any other Government program, \nnor should we use it for tax cuts. In fact, Senator Domenici, in a \nproposal that is enshrined in this budget, but we will have to vote on \nseparately, sets up a lockbox where we literally change the lending \nlimits that the Government faces, the debt ceiling, so that we will not \nbe able to spend one penny of the Social Security surplus.\n  This is vitally important because, as anybody in the Senate knows, \nand I wish every American knew, our Government has been stealing every \npenny of money coming in to the Social Security trust fund. We \ncurrently have IOUs for this money that are sent to West Virginia and \nput in a metal filing cabinet, but the Government then takes the money \nand spends it on everything but Social Security. None of that money is \nbeing used for Social Security purposes.\n  Senator Domenici's lockbox would change that permanently and say that \nthis money would be set aside to reduce debt, and it would be available \nwhen we can agree with the White House on a way to rebuild the \nfinancial base of Social Security. That is a critically important \nproposal.\n  If the American people knew the extent that we have been stealing \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund, there would be outrage in \nthe country. That is exactly what is happening. The Domenici lockbox \nends that forever, and it is vitally important. I hope every Member \nwill support it.\n  Now, let me talk about this shell game the administration is playing \non Social Security. Let me say, to begin with, that if you have been \ninvolved in every budget since 1979, you have seen phony assumptions, \nsmoke and mirrors, shell games, or whatever the words are that we use. \nBut let me say, so that no one is confused, that in Republican and \nDemocrat administrations I have seen people make assumptions that were \nwildly unrealistic about the future, about what inflation was going to \nbe, about what interest rates were going to be, about what economic \ngrowth was going to be, about what spending was going to be; but those \nwere always assumptions about what was going to happen in the future \nwhere at least people could say, well, it may be based more on hope \nthan reality, but it could happen.\n  What the Clinton administration has done is they have brought \nphoniness, distortion and untruth into the budget at a level which has \nnever existed in the American budget in the history of this country. \nAnd no better example exists than under Social Security.\n  I think I can explain it to you very simply. Here are the facts. In \nthe year 2000, the first year of this budget, we projected a $131 \nbillion surplus in the unified Federal budget. If you take every penny \nwe get from every source, and you take every penny we spend on every \nprogram or giveaway, or lose, or forget about, and you bring those two \ntogether, we are taking in $131 billion more than we are spending. Now, \nSocial Security is taking in $138 billion more than it is spending. So \nwhile we show that we have a $131 billion surplus, the reality is that \nif you don't count the Social Security trust fund, we are actually \nspending $7 billion more than we take in.\n  So let me show it to you this way. We are taking in $138 billion more \nthan we are spending on Social Security alone. We are then spending $7 \nbillion of that money from Social Security on general government. Now, \nthat would leave you with $131 billion of money for Social Security.\n  What the administration does is it sends to West Virginia this piece \nof paper that actually prints out on a computer, and it says, ``IOU \nSocial Security $138 billion.'' So they get this piece of paper, they \ntear it off--and it has actually been on television, and they won't let \nyou photograph the bonds, interestingly--they tear off the perforated \nedges and they take that $138 billion IOU and put it in the filing \ncabinet.\n  Now, what happens is, we then spend $7 billion of it immediately, and \nthat brings us down to $131 billion. Now, the President says, well, \nlet's take 62 percent of that and give it back to Social Security and \nwe will spend 38 percent of it. So we started with $138 billion, we \nspent $7 billion, and then the President says let's spend 38 percent of \nwhat is left and then we will send another IOU to Social Security for \n$81 billion. So out of the $138 billion that they initially had, they \nsend IOUs to Social Security for $219 billion. Now, they started with \n$138 billion and then they spent $7 billion, and then of that $131 \nbillion that was left, they spent another $50 billion, and then they \ngive Social Security an IOU for $219 billion.\n  Now, any freshman accounting student in any accounting class in \nAmerica would be given an ``F'' if they proposed on an examination \npaper such an accounting system. Yet, some of the most highly educated \npeople in America--men and women of great stature--stand up in front of \nGod, a television camera, and everybody else in the world and defend \nthis totally phony, fraudulent, embarrassing proposal. I guess we all \nhave our own standards, but I would not do it. I don't admire people \nwho do it. I think it does a terrible injustice and disservice to the \nAmerican public that this is happening.\n\n  I wanted to show this graph to sort of bring the whole thing \ntogether. What I have here is plotted between the years 2000 and 2009, \nthe years where this budget is in effect, the Social Security surplus. \nIt starts out at $138 billion and it grows over the period to over $200 \nbillion a year. That is the amount of money that Senator Domenici locks \naway in his lockbox. Now, in addition to the Social Security surplus, \nbecause the economy is growing so quickly and because we are \ncontrolling spending, if we actually do it, we will get an additional \nsurplus in the rest of the Government in this area that I call ``B'' on \nthis chart.\n  Interestingly enough, what the President does is, he says let's take \n38 percent of this unified budget, Social Security plus non-Social \nSecurity budget, and let's spend it and then give the rest to Social \nSecurity on top of the Social Security surplus that we have already \nmeasured. So that is how they start out with the Social Security \nsurplus and then end up with these huge IOUs that they claim they are \ngiving to Social Security. It is interesting because if you look at the \nPresident's plan--and this chart is from the Social Security \nAdministration--if you look at their plan, they claim that under their \nplan they are building up the assets of Social Security from $864.4 \nbillion to $6,697.8 trillion. Yet, when you look at the Office of \nManagement and Budget figures--and all this is put out by the same \nadministration--when you look at their actual level of paying down the \ndebt, that level turns out to be only $2,183.6 trillion. So the \nquestion is, What happened to the $3.6 billion? What happened to it?\n  The President says that under his system, with all this double \ncounting of money, he was putting $5.8 trillion into Social Security; \nyet, his budget shows only $2.163 trillion actually saved for Social \nSecurity. What happened? Well, what happened is that none of this money \never went to Social Security to begin with. It was all a paper, double-\ncounting bookkeeping. Their own numbers show it. Yet, nobody is \nembarrassed enough about it to simply say, well, this is phony and we \napologize and we should have never tried to perpetrate this fraud on \nthe American people.\n  Now, I think we can be proud of the fact that in this budget every \npenny of the Social Security surplus is locked away to be used for \nSocial Security. And when we decide how to save Social Security--and I \nwish we could decide today; maybe we will tomorrow--those funds will be \nthere for that purpose. I think that is very important and I want to \ncongratulate Senator Domenici\n\n[[Page S3728]]\n\nfor his leadership on this issue. I want to address two other issues \nand I will speed it up if anybody else comes over and wants to speak. \nIf not, I will give a fairly detailed description of both.\n  The next issue is tax cuts. The budget before us simply says that \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus will be there for Social \nSecurity; that of the surplus that is left, we keep a reserve of money \nthat is available for a contingency use which could be used for one of \nmany purposes, and then after we set aside that contingency, we provide \nthe rest of the money for tax cuts for working Americans. After all, \nthe surplus we have is due to the fact that Americans are working \nharder, working smarter, working in a more productive way, earning more \nand paying more taxes.\n  There have been several proposals to cut taxes. None of them are \nendorsed in this budget. This budget simply gives to the Finance \nCommittee the ability to cut taxes. And there have been a lot of \nproposals discussed. But the one that especially our Democrat \ncolleagues have talked the most about is a proposal to cut taxes across \nthe board. This has given rise to a debate in which I love to engage. \nObviously, my Democrat colleagues love to engage in it as well. This is \nthe debate that basically takes the view, as our Democrat colleagues \noften do, that investment is a good thing but investors are somehow bad \npeople; that wealth is a wonderful thing but people who create it, that \nsomehow there is something wrong with them, or that there is something \nwrong with letting them keep part of it. I don't understand how you can \nlove investment and not love investors.\n  I view people who are successful as being public benefactors. I never \ngot a job being hired by somebody who made less money than I did. \nEverybody who ever hired me was richer than I was, which is why they \nwere hiring me rather than me hiring them. And I never resented the \nfact that people had gotten rich by working in America. But here is \nwhat you are going to hear all day today, and here is what you are \ngoing to hear as we debate the tax cut.\n  We have a very, very progressive tax system in America. \n``Progressive'' is really a phony word. It is a made-up word that is \nmeant to really cloud the issue so you don't really understand. Under \nour system, if you make more money, you not only pay more taxes \nproportionately, but the rate of taxes goes up. So that as you make \nmore money, your taxes don't go up proportionately but they go up \nexponentially.\n  Our system of taxes is so progressive that roughly 50 percent of \nAmericans pay virtually no income taxes. And they pay no income taxes \nbecause there are many provisions which were adopted when Ronald Reagan \nwas President in terms of changing the Tax Code. We were able to make \nsome changes with the child tax credit and in our tax cut of 2 years \nago that further exempted income from taxes. But the bottom line is \nthat about 95 percent of income taxes are paid for by people who are in \nthe upper half of the income distribution in the country.\n  What our Democrat colleagues have discovered is that we do have a \nprogressive income tax. So that if I pay $5,000 of income taxes, and \nsomeone else pays $50,000 of income taxes, and we give a 10-percent tax \ncut, I get $500 as a tax cut and they get $5,000 as a tax cut. And our \nDemocrat colleagues think that is somehow outrageous.\n  But the point is, the only way you are getting more of a tax cut is \nif you are paying more taxes. So that what they are really talking \nabout is that the system is progressive.\n  Should it be progressive? You know there are many people who believe \nwe ought to have a flat tax and that everybody ought to pay the same \nrate. But the point is, if we are going to cut taxes and Senator \nRockefeller pays 10 times as much in taxes as I do, or 100 times as \nmuch in taxes as I do--I don't know, and I hope he pays 100 times as \nmuch because then he is better off and so is America. But, whatever it \nis, the fact that he would get a bigger tax cut than I do from an \nacross-the-board tax cut is the most reasonable thing on Earth to me if \nhe is, in fact, paying more taxes than I am paying.\n  I believe our No. 1 priority in cutting taxes is we ought to cut \neverybody's taxes by 10 percent. So, if you do not pay any taxes, you \nshould have learned in the third grade--since I repeated the third \ngrade I remember it--that anything times zero is zero. So with a 10-\npercent tax cut, if you are not paying any taxes, you don't get a tax \ncut. You are going to hear our colleagues say, well, 50 percent, or 40 \npercent, or whatever the number is they choose or make up today, people \nwill get no tax cut under a 10-percent tax cut. The only person in \nAmerica who will get no cut in income taxes from a 10-percent tax cut \nby definition is a person who pays no income taxes.\n\n  Here is my point. Most Americans don't get Medicaid. Most Americans \ndon't get food stamps. Most Americans don't get welfare. Why don't they \nget those things? They don't get those things because they are not \npoor. Tax cuts are for working people. Welfare is for poor people. \nMedicaid is for poor people who are sick. Medicare is for elderly \npeople for their health care. We have many different programs that do \nnot go to everybody. We have very few programs in America that \neverybody benefits from directly.\n  The point is, if not everybody gets welfare, why should we be shocked \nthat if you do not pay income taxes, that when we cut income tax rates \nyou don't get a tax cut? I don't find that to be shocking. I don't have \nany trouble saying to somebody in my State who says, ``You cut income \ntax rates by 10 percent and I didn't get a tax cut.'' I know, because I \nunderstand arithmetic, that they are not paying any income taxes \nanyway. So I don't have any problem saying, ``Yes. That is right,'' \nbecause tax cuts are for one unique group of Americans, ``wagon \npullers,'' I call them--the people who are pulling the wagon in which \nso many other Americans are riding; the people who are paying for the \nMedicaid they don't get, for the welfare benefits they don't get, for \nthe food stamps they don't get. Tax cuts are for the people who are \npulling the wagon in which all other beneficiaries of Government are \nriding.\n  So I don't feel the least bit squeamish about saying that tax cuts \nare for taxpayers. If you do not pay income taxes, you don't deserve a \ncut in income taxes, because you are not paying any.\n  We have a surplus because Americans are working harder and paying \nmore taxes. In fact, they are doing it today, tax day. I want everybody \nwho is going to the post office today to send their taxes to the \ngovernment--if you happen to be on mountain time, or if you are on \nPacific time and you have nothing better to do than to turn on C-SPAN--\nI want you to remember this when you pay your taxes: I want you to \nremember, you didn't get food stamps, you didn't get welfare, you \ndidn't get Medicaid, but I believe--and the party I am a member of, the \nRepublican Party believes--that you ought to get a tax cut. Our \nDemocrat colleagues are going to say--you are going to hear it, so pay \nclose attention. They are going to say, yes, you get a tax cut. You--\nthis person working in Los Angeles, CA, on your way to mail your check \nin right now--you get a tax cut.\n  Think of these people that don't get a tax cut. How is it fair that \nJoe Brown and Susie Brown, who make $21,000 a year, pay no income \ntaxes, and get an earned-income tax credit--which is really a welfare \nbenefit--why is it they don't get a tax cut when you do? The answer is, \nthey don't pay any income taxes and you do.\n  We have this basic viewpoint which our Democrat colleagues find to be \nradical. That point is, if you don't pay income taxes, you don't get a \ntax cut; if you do pay income taxes, you do get a tax cut. The more \ntaxes you pay--and God bless you for doing it, because if people are \npaying record taxes it means they are earning record incomes--I \nbelieve, and the great majority of the Republicans in Congress believe, \nif you pay more taxes, you ought to get a bigger tax cut. That is what \nan across-the-board, 10-percent tax cut would do.\n  A final point: This used to be a bipartisan idea. John Kennedy \nproposed an across-the-board tax cut in 1961 which was adopted and \nbecame law. His famous words are, ``A rising tide lifts all boats.'' \nThat is still believed by one-half of the political spectrum in \nAmerica. It is no longer believed by the other half--and that is the \nhalf that he was once a part of.\n  To conclude, let me talk a little bit about Medicare. There is no \nmore fraudulent portion of the President's\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nbudget than the proposal about Medicare. Let me give Members a tiny bit \nof history. We, through an act of Congress, signed by the President, \nset up a Medicare Commission. In a gesture toward bipartisanship, \nRepublicans--who control both Houses of Congress--agreed to appoint a \nDemocrat, Senator Breaux, as chairman of that Commission. Senator \nBreaux did a great job as chairman of the Medicare Commission. It was \nmy privilege to serve on that Commission. I remember as if it were \nyesterday President Clinton called the whole Commission down to the \nWhite House and talked to us about the terrible problems we had in \nMedicare and challenged each of us not to let the work of the \nCommission fail because of us. He challenged each of us to find a way \nto be for the final proposal.\n  As it turned out, as most people now know, the final work of the \nCommission did fail. It failed by one vote. Not one single person \nappointed by President Clinton found a way to be for the final \nproposal, and they all voted against the Commission proposal. The \nPresident, in 3 months, had an opportunity to change American history \non Social Security and Medicare, and in both cases he failed.\n  What did the President do in his budget? What the President did in \nhis budget is literally this: He said we are going to pay off debt--\nthough not as much as the Domenici budget--but we are going to name the \ndebt reduction in honor of various programs. That is in essence what it \nwas. In essence, what the President's budget does is send a little note \nto Medicare that says: You will be happy to know that Federal debt was \nreduced by such and such an amount and it was done in your name. It \nwould be sort of like our Presiding Officer having someone send a check \nto his university saying, ``We made a contribution in your name,'' and \nthen you say, ``When do I get the money?'' You don't ever get the \nmoney.\n  What the President did in Medicare--which was one of the cruelest \nhoaxes I can imagine in public policy--the President didn't give \nMedicare a penny over 10 years, provided no additional money to \nMedicare. In fact, he cut Medicare, cuts that are not in the budget \nbefore the Senate. So he cuts Medicare funding over 10 years, and yet \nby sending this IOU to HCFA, the agency that runs Medicare, he somehow \ncreates the impression that he has given Medicare more money, when none \nof this IOU can be spent. In fact, the only way we could ever provide \nmoney under this is to raise taxes, to cut Medicare or cut other \nGovernment programs. Yet the President creates this impression that he \nhas provided this money that could be used for pharmaceutical benefits \nor all these other wonderful benefits. It is a cruel hoax.\n  What we do in our budget is set out a procedure where this reserve \nfund, this reserve money that we didn't use for tax cuts that we kept \nas a buffer could, in part, be used for Medicare. Our problem in \nMedicare is we need to adopt the Breaux Commission report. We had a \nvote on instructing conferees for us to preserve our commitment to \nthat. It is in this budget. We are going to bring that proposal to the \nFinance Committee. I hope we are going to adopt it.\n\n  What that proposal will do, in addition to planting the seeds to save \nMedicare, for moderate- and low-income retirees it will, for the first \ntime, give them assistance on pharmaceuticals. For middle-income \nretirees and upper-income retirees, by expanding the options that are \navailable, by literally letting them have the same health insurance \nthat I have as a Member of the Senate, it will allow them for the first \ntime to have an opportunity to buy into a plan that will give them some \nassistance with their pharmaceuticals.\n  I have talked a long time and covered a lot of subjects. Let me \nconclude by simply congratulating Senator Domenici. This is a great \nbudget. If we can enforce this budget, America will be richer, freer, \nand happier. If we can enforce this budget, we will have an opportunity \nto begin the long process of rebuilding the financial base of Social \nSecurity based on wealth and not debt. If we can enforce this budget, \nwe will pay off Government debt. If we can enforce this budget, we will \nbe able to give working Americans tax cuts.\n  It is one thing to enter the marriage; it is another thing to make it \na successful one. This is a very important day, a very important \nbudget. I am very proud to be for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I just came to the floor to hear my \ndistinguished colleague from Texas say this is the finest budget in 20 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the same act, same scene, under \ndifferent auspices, different rules and regulations, with the manifest \nintent, in this particular Senator's opinion, that what is on course \nhere is a Milton Friedman-like plan of the distinguished Senator from \nTexas to privatize Social Security, to establish private savings \naccounts. The Republicans do this in violation of all the rules and \nregulations that you can think of that have been put in over the past \nseveral years to bring about fiscal discipline.\n  Let's get right to the point: We, up until now, have been on course \nwith some fiscal discipline. Credit President Clinton and the 1993 \nCongress that enacted the Balanced Budget Act, which cut spending, \nincreased taxes, increased taxes on Social Security--the very measure \nthat they said was going to end the world and throw us into a \ndepression whereby even the distinguished chairman on the House Budget \nCommittee said he would change parties. I don't know whether he is \nrunning today for President as a Democrat or Republican, but to my \nknowledge Mr. Kasich is still a Republican. He said he would change \nparties if it worked. It is working. The market is over 10,000, we have \nhousing starts and inflation is down, unemployment is down, and \neverything else of that kind.\n  When they reported this budget, trying to continue the fiscal \ndiscipline, here is the language:\n\n       In addition to the fiscal policies contained in the budget \n     resolution, I also am troubled by the process the Republican \n     majority wants to use in this year's budget. The \n     reconciliation process have been used sparingly in the past \n     to improve the fiscal health of the budget. It was created to \n     give the Senate a process for making difficult fiscal \n     decisions--decisions that often require cutting popular \n     programs and increasing taxes to balance the budget.\n       That is not the case this year. The Republicans want to use \n     the reconciliation process to dramatically reduce revenues \n     over the next ten years and impair the progress we have made \n     so far in reducing the deficit and beginning to pay down the \n     debt.\n       The budget resolution also would modify the pay-go point of \n     order. Pay-go was required to insure the Senate would provide \n     off-sets to reduce taxes or increase spending. The modified \n     budget resolution now will make it possible to cut taxes \n     without a fiscal off-set. By making it easier to use future \n     surpluses to cut taxes instead of paying down the debt, this \n     will eliminate the fiscal discipline that has reduced the \n     deficit and contribute to the fiscal cancer eating away at \n     America.\n\n  I say cancer, and I say that advisedly, because when President \nJohnson last balanced the budget, the interest cost on the national \ndebt was only $16 billion. Today it is just about $1 billion a day. The \nlast estimate of the Congressional Budget Office was $357 billion each \nyear. When President Johnson last balanced the budget, after 200 years \nof history--the cost of all the wars from the Revolution on up, World \nWar I, World War II, the cost of Vietnam, Korea--the interest cost on \nthe national debt was only $16 billion. Now, since that time, without \nthe cost of a war--we made money on Desert Storm--so, without the cost \nof a war it is now $1 billion a day, eating away. With that wasted \nmoney, the interest cost on the debt, I could give the distinguished \nPresiding Officer his $80 billion tax cut, I could give our Democratic \nfriends our $80 billion in increased spending, I could give $80 billion \nto save Social Security, I could give $80 billion to pay down the \ndebt--that is only $320 billion. But we are going to spend at least \n$357 billion this year on nothing, and if interest costs start going \nback up we will be to $500 billion.\n  But, to the original point, read this conference report. Here are the \nshenanigans that go along and are given dignity by my distinguished \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\nfrom Texas saying it is the finest budget he's seen. I was sorry to see \nhim do that because I joined him in passing Gramm-Rudman-Hollings for \nfiscal discipline, and this is the most undisciplined shenanigan that \nyou will ever find.\n  On page 18, section 202 of the conference report:\n\n       Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill, or an \n     amendment thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that enhances retirement security through \n     structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may--\n       (1) increase the appropriate allocations and aggregates of \n     new budget authority and outlays by the amount of new budget \n     authority provided by such measure (and outlays flowing \n     therefrom) for that purpose;\n       (2) in the Senate, adjust the levels used for determining \n     compliance with the pay-as-you-go requirements of section \n     207; and\n       (3) reduce the revenue aggregates by the amount of the \n     revenue loss resulting from that measure for that purpose.\n\n  I want the Parliamentarian to listen to that one. I can tell you how \nhe will rule. He will say it means whatever Mr. Domenici says it means. \nWhat does that gobbledygook mean? Listen to this. I will read it again:\n\n       Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or an \n     amendment thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that enhances retirement security through \n     structural programmatic reform, the appropriate chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may [blah blah blah blah].\n\n  He can do away with the pay-go rule, he can cut the revenues, he can \ndo whatever he pleases. And that is what my distinguished colleague \nfrom Texas calls the finest budget he has seen, because he doesn't want \nthis crowd to read and understand what is going on.\n  Bring out the Roth IRA for the rich. Under this budget, pass a law, \ndon't care about the rules, don't care about pay-go, don't care about \nany available monies. I say that IRA is for the rich because one \nAmerican--to bring it into focus, Bill Gates, $51 billion--is worth \nmore than 100 million Americans. One man in this society that we are \ndeveloping is now worth more than 100 million Americans.\n  So there are a lot of people who do not have anything to say about \nthis. But you sort of enhance your security and retirement--for the \nidle rich. Whoopee and the dickens with the pay-go rule, Mr. \nParliamentarian. You don't have to worry about that. You don't have to \nworry about the loss of revenue or anything like that, the \nreconciliation process. It is reserved. Now the Republicans can come on \nin and privatize Social Security, all under the auspices of saving \nSocial Security.\n\n  It is still off on this public debt, as if there is some difference \nfrom the national debt. Let me explain one more time. When you pay down \nyour public debt, you increase your Social Security debt. That is where \nthe money comes from. The whole gimmick here is to pay down Wall \nStreet's credit card with the Social Security credit card. It is like \nhaving a Visa and a Master and you want to pay down the MasterCard with \nyour Visa card, so you pay down the MasterCard with the Visa card. But \nit is still your card; it is your debt. All you've done is shift debt \nfrom spending column to another. That is why the debt this particular \nfiscal year, 1999, goes up $100 billion. That is the Congressional \nBudget Office figure.\n  Let's sober up here. Everybody is running around saying, ``Surplus, \nsurplus.'' How are we going to do it? They all have different ideas: \n``Surplus, surplus.'' The truth of the matter is there is no surplus. \nThere is a deficit. We are spending $100 billion more than we are \ntaking in.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from South \nCarolina. This country could have avoided an awful lot of the pain of \nthe 1980s and 1990s if this country had listened to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina on budget matters. There has been no Member of this body \nwho has had a better handle on the budget problems of this country than \nthe Senator from South Carolina. Years ago, if we would have followed \nthe Hollings plan and put in place a budget freeze, we could have \navoided the massive deficits that came in the 1980s and the early \n1990s, and this country would have been in a far better fiscal \nposition.\n  He has been an activist and a leader on the Budget Committee of every \neffort to provide fiscal discipline to this country. I venture to say, \nin this Chamber there is no single Member who has made a greater \ncontribution moving this country from massive deficits to now surpluses \nthan the Senator from South Carolina. Senator Hollings has been, I \nthink, a model of what a United States Senator should be, in terms of \nbudget discipline for this country. This country owes him a debt of \nthanks for the leadership he has provided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, he has been \nfar too generous. Our floor leader, Senator Conrad of North Dakota, has \nreally been leading the fight for us in the Budget Committee. That is \nwhy we are able to get some semblance of some discipline there. I hope, \nwith the conference--maybe I could ask the Senator a question. Did they \nhave a conference? Did the distinguished Senator from North Dakota go \nto a conference on the budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I was on the conference committee. It went to the \nconference.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, they had one.\n  Mr. CONRAD. They had one, but they did not have a budget there. It is \nmost amazing. As my colleague knows, a conference is the \nrepresentatives of the Senate and the representatives of the House \ncoming together to work out the differences between the two. We were \nthere, the Members were there.\n  I think you would have been quite amazed, I say to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, because there was no budget there, there was no \ndocument there. There was no discussion about the differences between \nthe House and Senate. What we had was an immaculate conception. What we \nhad was a document that appeared out of nowhere after we had met.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As one big charade, rather than save Social Security, \nthey plan to privatize it. There is no question in this Senator's mind.\n  Mr. CONRAD. To privatize it or raid it in some other way. We really \ndo not know. I was very interested to listen to the Senator from Texas \nsay--say--that they had reserved every penny of Social Security surplus \nfor Social Security. That is what we said.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what he said.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, that is not what the budget document \nprovides. It is very interesting; the Senator from South Carolina \nprobably knows better than anybody how one can play games with these \ndocuments. It is fascinating what they have done here, because on one \nline, they suggest that they have provided a lockbox for Social \nSecurity. That is on one line on page 16 and it runs on to page 17. But \nthen on the bottom of page 17, in the next section, they gut what they \ndid earlier on the page. This is the oldest budget game in the book: \n``Now you see it, now you don't.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is an old insurance game. I remember that when I was \nGovernor, we were trying to clean up the insurance industry in my \nState. A new company was looking for a slogan, and we finally came up \nwith the winning slogan: ``Capital Life will surely pay, if the small \nprint on the back don't take it away.''\n  Now we have it all the way up here 35 years later in the budgetary \nprocess of the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish it were not the case but, unfortunately, it is. We \nhad, I think, hoped--certainly the Senator from South Carolina and I--\nthat we would be at a point where we really would reserve every penny \nof Social Security surplus for Social Security. We thought that is \nwhere we were headed. Unfortunately, what our friends across the aisle \nhave done is indicate that that is what they are doing, but that is not \nwhat the budget document says. No, no, no, they have changed it all, \nand they have made it possible to continue the raid on the Social \nSecurity trust fund on a simple majority vote which, of course, their \nlockbox was intended to protect against.\n  Unfortunately, what they say they have done and what they have done \nare two very, very different things.\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They gave the key for the lockbox to everybody save the \nSocial Security recipients.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Social Security is clearly in danger. Clearly, the \npriority on the other side is a tax cut, a massive tax cut at all \ncosts. That is their priority.\n  Looking at this budget, the budget that is before us, the major \nproblem with it is that it does not represent the priorities of the \nAmerican people. I think the best way to understand this is we now have \nprojected a surplus over the next 10 years of $2.6 trillion. Our \nfriends on the other side say all of the non-Social Security surplus--\nvirtually all of it--ought to go for a tax cut. Nothing, not a dime out \nof that surplus is for Medicare--not a dime--even though it is in \ngreater danger than Social Security. They do not have the resources \navailable for the high-priority domestic concerns of education, health \ncare, defense, because if you look over time, they are going to have \nmassive cuts in those categories. They are disguised, they are hidden, \nbut they are there.\n  Mr. President, I think perhaps it would be useful to recount a little \nbit of the budget history, how we got to where we are today and where \nwe are headed.\n  This chart shows over the last 30 years the budget history of the \nUnited States at the Federal Government level. We can see the last time \nwe had a surplus was back in 1969, a little bitty surplus of $3 \nbillion. We bumped along. Then we got into the seventies and the \ndeficits started rising. Then we got into the Reagan years and the \ndeficits exploded.\n\n  We then had the Bush years and the deficits got even worse, so that \non a unified basis--unified basis simply means all spending, all \nrevenue put in one pot; that is a so-called unified budget--and on a \nunified basis in 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, we had \na $290 billion deficit.\n  In 1993, President Clinton put before the Congress a 5-year plan to \nreduce the deficit. We passed that plan. It was done with all votes on \nthis side of the aisle. Not a single Republican voted for that plan. \nNot one. That plan has reduced the deficit each and every year of the 5 \nyears of the plan. In fact, now we are seeing a slight surplus.\n  What did that plan contain? It cut spending. It cut spending and it \nraised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. The \nSenator from Texas who was talking earlier opposed that plan. He said, \nas did many on that side of the aisle, that it would not work. In fact, \nthey said it would increase the deficit. They said it would increase \nunemployment. They said it would increase inflation. They said it would \nbe an economic disaster. They were wrong. They were not just a little \nbit wrong, they were completely wrong.\n  The fact is that plan worked and worked extremely well, and the proof \nis in the pudding. We can see what happened to the deficit after that \nplan passed in 1993. Each and every year the deficit came down. In this \nlast year, we ran on a unified basis a $70 billion surplus, and we are \nheaded for much larger surpluses if the projections come true.\n  On a unified basis, we ran a surplus last year. But remember, that \ncounts all revenues and all expenditures. If we take out Social \nSecurity, because that is a separate trust fund, we will see we still \nran a deficit last year of $29 billion--if we take out Social \nSecurity--because it was in surplus by about $100 billion.\n  The good news is, we are very close to balancing without counting \nSocial Security this year, and in 2001, we anticipate we will balance \nwithout counting Social Security. That is an enormous, enormous \ndevelopment and enormous progress.\n  You can see back in 1992, if we were not counting Social Security, we \nhad a $340 billion deficit. That is the kind of progress that has been \nmade, and it has been made because, as I indicated, we had a 1993 5-\nyear plan that cut spending, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, \nraised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, and in 1997, we had a \nbipartisan deal. In that case, we came together and agreed on a budget \nplan to finish the job of balancing the budget.\n  This chart shows what the 1993 plan did and what the 1997 plan did. \nYou can see most of the savings are the result of the 1993 package. \nAgain, our friends on the other side of the aisle--all of them, to a \nperson--voted against it. The bipartisan agreement was 1997, but most \nof the work has been done by the 1993 5-year plan and that, in \ncombination with the 1997 plan, has put us in this very favorable \ncircumstance we face now.\n  I thought just for the record we should look back on what the \ndeficits were under each of the last three Presidents.\n  With President Reagan, from 1981 through 1988, we saw the deficits \nexplode.\n  They went from $80 billion a year--that is the deficit he inherited--\nand very quickly he shot it up to $200 billion. Then we, at the end of \nhis term, saw some improvement--back down to about $150 billion.\n  When President Bush came in, the deficits exploded again, and went \nfrom $150 billion, as I indicated, up to $290 billion a year by 1992.\n  Under President Clinton, as I indicated, in 1993 we passed a 5-year \nplan; and we can just look at the results. In 1993, the deficit was \n$255 billion. And you can see each and every year thereafter the \ndeficit went down under that 5-year plan. We almost achieved unified \nbalance under that 5-year plan.\n  So the proof is in the pudding. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle talk about ``sham'' and ``hoaxes,'' and all the rest of it. The \nproof is in the pudding. My friends, Democrats passed a plan in 1993, \nwithout a single Republican vote. Democrats did the heavy lifting to \nget this country back on a fiscally responsible course. Facts are \nstubborn things. And the facts show, without question, that the \nDemocrats passed a plan that, in fact, restored fiscal health to this \ncountry.\n  It is true in 1997 we did get together on a bipartisan basis to \nfinish the job. I wish it could have been bipartisan in 1993. But our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle said then that if you pass this \nplan, you are going to make the deficit worse. They said if you raise \ntaxes, even if it is on just the wealthiest 1 percent, that is going to \ncollapse the economy.\n  They were wrong. Their economic prescription for this country was \nwrong. And the facts clearly show that they were wrong. Thank goodness \nthere were people who were willing to stand up and cast very tough \nvotes to cut spending and, yes, to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 \npercent so we could get this country back on course. It worked; and it \nworked splendidly. The results are dramatic. Not only have we reduced \nthe red ink and eliminated it--no more running of deficits--but we also \ngot remarkable economic results.\n  We now have an unemployment rate that is the lowest in 41 years. The \nother side said, when we passed the 5-year plan in 1993, if you pass \nit, unemployment is going to go up. Unemployment went down. \nUnemployment went way down, the lowest it has been in 41 years.\n  The other side said, the inflation rate, if you pass this plan, will \ngo up. They were wrong. The inflation rate has gone down. We have the \nlowest rate of inflation in 33 years.\n  But the good news does not end there.\n  In addition, we passed welfare reform. In fairness and in truth, that \nwas done on a bipartisan basis. We came together on welfare reform. And \nthe result, coupled with the good economy that came from the 1993 \nbudget plan, that coupled with welfare reform, has led us to the lowest \npercentage of our people on welfare in 29 years. Look at this dramatic \nimprovement in terms of the percentage on welfare in this country.\n  As well, Federal spending has come down because, as I indicated, in \n1993, part of that package was to cut the growth of spending in this \ncountry. And we did even more in the 1997 bipartisan plan. So the two \ntogether, the 1993 plan and the 1997 plan, have brought down Federal \nspending as a percentage of our national income to its lowest level \nsince 1974. So now we are spending, as a percentage of our national \nincome, the lowest level in 25 years of the Federal Government.\n  Because we have reduced deficits and gotten our fiscal house back in \norder, debt held by the public has also declined. We reached a debt, in \nrelationship to our gross domestic product, of\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n50 percent in 1993. We saw, through the Reagan and Bush years, that the \ndebt was climbing in relationship to the size of our gross domestic \nproduct. In 1993, when we passed that plan, we stopped the growth of \nthe debt in relationship to the size of our income and reversed it. So \nnow we have seen the debt come down to a level of 44 percent of our \ngross domestic product. And we anticipate, if we stay the course that \nwe are currently on, we will get the debt down to only 9 percent of our \ngross domestic product in 2009.\n  The budget before us threatens that course. Because the colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are so fixated on a massive tax-cut scheme, \nthey would rather do that than to make this progress in reducing our \nnational debt. I think that is precisely wrong. I think what we did in \n1993 demonstrates that taking debt burden down gives a greater lift to \nthis economy than any tax-cut scheme that anybody can come up with. \nThat is not to say we should not have tax reduction, because we should.\n  The question is one of priorities and proportion. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle say--we have $2.6 trillion of surpluses \nprojected over the next 10 years--there are only two priorities. Their \ntwo priorities are to safeguard $1.8 trillion of that for so-called \n``retirement security''--I don't know exactly what that means. That \nentire $1.8 trillion is generated by Social Security. It should be set \naside for Social Security. That is the plan we Democrats offered in the \nBudget Committee. We offered to safeguard every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus for Social Security. That is $1.8 trillion.\n  In addition, we said we also ought to put about $400 billion aside \nfor Medicare. The budget that is before us does not provide one penny \nof these projected surpluses for Medicare --not one penny. These are \nnot the priorities of the American people.\n  Instead, our Republican colleagues say all the non-Social Security \nsurplus, or virtually all of it--because you have about $800 billion of \nnon-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years--they say, use \nvirtually all of it for a tax-cut scheme. And the best description we \nhave of what they do with it is a 10-percent, across-the-board tax cut. \nThat is what the chairman of the Finance Committee has said he thinks \nshould be done. That is what their leadership in the House have said \nthey think should be done.\n  We have a different view of what the priorities for the American \npeople are. For that $2.6 trillion, we say every penny that comes from \nthe Social Security surplus ought to be reserved for Social Security. \nInterestingly enough, that is what was passed here in the Senate. But \nit went to the conference committee, and somewhere in the dead of night \nthey backed away from that commitment; they backed away from that \ncommitment and they came up with this very clever, very complicated \nlittle scheme. And this very complicated and very clever scheme says, \non one page, yes, we are going to devote the Social Security surpluses \nto Social Security, but in the very next line they undermine it all--\nthey undermine it all--they create a big loophole so that on a simple \nmajority vote here the Social Security fund can be raided, can be \nlooted, just like it has been done for the last 15 years. That is \nwrong. That is not the priority of the American people.\n  The American people want to preserve every penny of Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security. That is what the Democrats offered in the \nSenate Budget Committee. In addition to that, we said the next $400 \nbillion of surplus ought to be reserved to strengthen and protect \nMedicare. Our friends on the other side have not provided one penny of \nthe projected surpluses to strengthen Medicare. Instead, they say, \nlet's have this massive tax cut scheme to benefit primarily the richest \nand wealthiest among us.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Texas says, you cannot love investment and not \nlove the investor. That is true. I think we all respect those who \ninvest. We respect those who save. We respect those who are successful. \nThe question is, how do we use Government policy? Who do we benefit \nwhen we make decisions? Do we use governmental power to benefit the \nwealthiest among us? Is that what we do?\n  That is not what I favor. As I said, I believe the first priority \nought to be every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security; \nthat is, $1.8 trillion of the $2.6 trillion we now estimate will be in \nsurplus over the next 10 years. But the next $400 billion we say ought \nto be used to strengthen and protect Medicare. That leaves another $400 \nbillion that would be available for high-priority domestic needs under \nour plan, like education, like health care, and, yes, defense and tax \nrelief for the American people.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have a different view. \nThey say, yes, reserve the $1.8 trillion, but not just for Social \nSecurity, no, not just for Social Security. They call it ``retirement \nsecurity.'' If they want to reserve every penny for Social Security, \nwhy don't they say Social Security? Why have they come up with this new \nterm ``retirement security''? I think most of us know why they have \ndone that--because the Senator from Texas has a scheme to privatize \npart of Social Security, and he wants the money reserved for his plan. \nHe doesn't want to say reserve every penny of Social Security surplus \nfor Social Security. Instead, he wants to make people believe he is \ngoing to do that, but then he provides a big loophole so that later on \nthis year he can come along and raid the Social Security trust fund for \nhis plan to create private accounts. That is what is really going on \nhere.\n  None of us is fooled. They do not provide anything, not a penny of \nthese projected surpluses, to strengthen and protect Medicare, when we \nknow Medicare is in the most imminent danger of being insolvent. We say \nthe priority ought to be Social Security and ought to be Medicare and, \nafter that, we also ought to have some money for high-priority domestic \nneeds like education and health care, and, yes, tax relief. But it is a \nmatter of priority, and our friends on the other side of the aisle say \nthe priority ought to be a massive tax cut.\n  This is the comparison for what happens. Let me focus on the 10 \nyears. The blue column represents what the Republicans would do to pay \ndown debt, and the red column shows what we offered as Democrats in the \nBudget Committee to pay down debt. A lot of people might be as \nsurprised by this, because the Democratic plan paid down more debt than \nthe Republican plan. We paid down more debt over the next 10 years, by \nnearly $400 billion over and above what is in the Republican plan, \nbecause we believe that is a key priority for the country.\n  Again, our Republican friends think there is a different priority. \nThey want to have this massive tax cut scheme. That is really what is \nmost on their mind. Unfortunately, because of this, they do not have, \nas I have indicated before, one penny of the surpluses set aside to \nstrengthen Medicare, not a dime. They have what I call ``the Republican \nbroken safe.'' Here it is. You look in it and what do you find? There \nis nothing there.\n  Now, with what they have done in the conference committee, we ought \nto have this up for Social Security, too, because, goodness knows, we \ncould find, after the clever game they have played here in this budget \ndocument, that we may go into the Social Security trust fund in the \nfuture and open the vault door and find there is nothing there, either. \nBecause they have this set up so that they can raid every penny of the \nSocial Security trust fund surplus and put it over into private \naccounts. They could do that. They could use it for a tax cut and call \nit retirement security. Who knows what that means, ``retirement \nsecurity''? If they wanted to reserve the money for Social Security, \nwhy didn't they say it?\n\n  Well, I guess if we wanted to be fair to them, they do say it, don't \nthey? On one line they say they are going to reserve the money for \nSocial Security, but they say, by a simple majority vote, you can \noverturn that. Before it was a supermajority vote. Now in the dead of \nnight they changed it, simple majority vote, and now you can loot \nSocial Security. You can raid it, because in the very next line, \nsection 202, they created another reserve fund. It is clever.\n  I don't think it is going to work for them, because the American \npeople are too smart. They know the kind of games that get played here \nin Washington.\n  This is one of the most cynical games I have seen yet. In the Budget \nCommittee, when we vote and the people\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\nare there watching and the reporters are there watching, we vote to \nprotect every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. \nThat is the vote when everybody raised their hands in the Budget \nCommittee. Maybe that is the reason, when we held the conference \ncommittee meeting between the House and the Senate, the Members were \nthere, but there was no budget there. How can you have a meeting about \na budget and not have the budget there? It was very interesting. There \nwere no TV cameras there. We were there, the Members representing the \nHouse and the Senate, but there was no budget document there.\n  I think I now know why there was no budget document there--because \nthey did not want this little trick revealed. They did not want this \nlittle loophole found out. They were hoping they had buried this so \ndeep in the document that nobody would find it in time for this \ndiscussion and this debate and this vote. But we are going to vote, and \nwe are going to see who is ready to protect Social Security and who has \na mind to raid it later this year. We are going to see, by Members' \nvotes, who is committed to protecting Social Security and who is \ncommitted to protecting Medicare and who isn't. We are going to see \nwhose priority is a massive tax cut scheme for the wealthiest among us, \nbecause that is really what is afoot here. That is really what is \nafoot.\n  What happens if you give a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut? For \nthose in this country who earn less than $38,000 a year, they are going \nto get $99. That is going to be their tax cut. But for folks who are \nearning over $300,000, they are going to get $20,000 of a tax cut. The \nSenator from Texas thinks this is a fair deal. I don't think this is a \nfair deal. I don't think this represents the priorities of the American \npeople.\n  The other side is saying the priorities of the American people are to \nhave a massive tax cut that would give a $20,000 check to those earning \nover $300,000 a year in this country, send $99 to those who have an \nincome of less than $38,000, and not have one penny of the surplus \navailable to strengthen Medicare, and to leave vulnerable the Social \nSecurity trust fund that everybody says ought to be inviolable, ought \nnot be touched, that every penny ought to be set aside to redeem the \npromise made by Social Security.\n  That is what I thought we were going to do. That is what the \nDemocrats offered in the Senate Budget Committee. We offered a plan \nthat said of the $2.6 trillion of surpluses, take the $1.8 trillion \nthat comes from Social Security and dedicate every penny to Social \nSecurity.\n  Take the next $400 billion and use it to strengthen Medicare. Take \nthe final $400 billion and use it, yes, for tax relief, but also for \nhigh-priority domestic needs such as education and health care and, \nyes, defense. Those are America's priorities.\n  But that is not what is in this budget resolution. These are not \nAmerica's priorities. These are the priorities of, frankly, those who \nare getting ready to get a $20,000 tax break, and they are salivating. \nOf course, for the very wealthy, it is much more than this. For those \nwho have had good fortune in this country--and we are grateful for \nthat; it is one of the great things about America, that people have had \nenormous advantages. The priority of this country isn't to make those \nwho have had great success even more comfortable; the priority of the \nAmerican people is to strengthen Social Security, strengthen and \nprotect Medicare, provide for high-priority domestic needs such as \neducation and health care and, yes, defense, and also to provide tax \nrelief. My Republican friends have just focused on a tax cut scheme. \nThat is what is wrong with this budget at the most fundamental level.\n  I see that my colleague from the State of Washington is here. How \nmuch time would she like?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment with the budget we are going to be voting on today. And \nwhile I applaud the efforts of the Republican leadership to have a \nbudget resolution, I believe that in the haste to get something out by \nApril, we have put together a budget that really lacks any sense of \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this conference \nreport. This report before us fails our families and it fails our \nchildren. This is the first budget for a new century, but it does very \nlittle to prepare us for the challenges we are going to face. It \nignores key investments in education, health care, environmental \nprotection, and child care. Regrettably, it ignores our obligation to \ncurrent retirees and those who will retire within the next 20 years.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to many of my colleagues who talk \nabout returning the people's money to the people, and I could not agree \nmore. We should allocate part of the surplus to saving Social Security \nand Medicare. Hard-working Americans have paid their FICA and Medicare \npayroll taxes with the understanding that when they reach the age of \n65, or become disabled, they will be guaranteed Social Security \nbenefits and Medicare. Social Security and Medicare allow the elderly \nindependence and dignity in the years spent after a lifetime of work. \nWe must reserve part of today's surplus to honor this commitment, and \nthis budget does not do that.\n  We all know that Medicare is in real crisis. Yet, the only \nrecommendations this budget offers are vague statements about reform. \nThere is no talk about investing in prevention benefits that ultimately \nwill save Medicare dollars. There is no language to improve the program \nso that senior citizens and the disabled can take advantage of new \nadvances in biomedical research to improve the quality of their lives \nand their health. The priority of this budget before us appears to be \nto simply raid the Federal Treasury for an across-the-board tax cut.\n  We need to follow the example of working families. We have a budget \nsurplus for the first time in decades because of tough fiscal \ndiscipline and wise economic investment. Just like families, we \ntightened our belt and restored fiscal soundness to the Federal \nGovernment. We should now use this surplus to save for and invest in \nthe future. These are simple choices: Invest in our children and save \nfor our retirement. That is the goal of most families.\n  I also point out to my colleagues the unfortunate fact that the \nconferees, in the middle of the night, behind closed doors, stripped \nout important language we had passed in the Senate regarding women and \nSocial Security. Based on my reading of the conference report, it \nappears that my language was dropped. At the end of the report, there \nis a listing of all sense-of-the-Senate amendments adopted during \nconsideration of the budget, but there is no explanation from the \nmanagers as to the status of these amendments. In addition, these \namendments are clearly not part of the conference report pending before \nus.\n  Mr. President, an amendment I offered in committee and on the floor \nput every Senator on the record as being committed to protecting the \nsafety net for women and making real change, to pull more older women \nout of poverty as we move forward with Social Security reform. My \namendments were aimed at expressing our support of maintaining a \nguaranteed inflation-protected benefit for women and working to reform \nbenefit calculations for Social Security. The amendment I offered on \nthe floor made it clear that, through the process of Social Security \nreform, we would recognize the sacrifices women make to take care of \ntheir families.\n  I was proud to offer these amendments and had hoped that instead of \njust talking about taking care of women in the course of Social \nSecurity reform, there would be a solid, bipartisan commitment to \naddressing the unique economic situation faced by most women today. But \nit seems that, once again, the needs of women have been ignored or \nforgotten. With no women on the Senate Finance Committee, I wanted a \nstrong statement from the Senate that the real interest of women who \ndepend on Social Security would not be negotiated away. I wanted to be \nsure that all Members understood the changing dynamics of the workforce \nand the difficult choices women must make every single day.\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\n  Women make decisions in their thirties and forties for the welfare of \ntheir families, like raising children, only to find out in their \nsixties and seventies that this sacrifice has cost them their economic \nsecurity in old age. A surviving spouse can also face a dramatic change \nin her standard of living immediately following the loss of her \nhusband.\n  Women, on the average, give 11 and a half years of their working \nlives to their families. They jeopardize their long-term economic \nsecurity and retirement income to meet the immediate needs of children \nor aging parents. A surviving spouse can see a reduction of as much as \n50 percent of her Social Security income following the death of her \nhusband. Is this the reward women deserve for caring for their \nfamilies? Social Security reform gives us the chance to make things \nright for working women and protect their guaranteed benefit. We owe \nthis to all families.\n  Unfortunately, when given the chance to assure women that their \ninterests and real economic situation would not be forgotten, it would \nappear that the Republicans have now turned their backs. The failure to \ninclude my amendments will only make me work harder to educate women \nand to fight for women during the debate on Social Security reform.\n  I will not let the administration or Members of the Senate off the \nhook. There is no greater threat to women and families than a Social \nSecurity reform proposal that ignores the economic disadvantages still \nfaced by working women and older women. I hope that all working women \nand older women are watching the debate on Social Security reform and \ntaking note.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say again how disappointed I am in this \nbudget process. When I decided to serve on the Budget Committee, I \nwanted to return some common sense to our fiscal policy. I wanted to \nbring the voice of working families to the table, and I don't think \nthis budget passes the test. It is seriously flawed when it comes to \nthe issue of education.\n  When I talk to my constituents about education and the efforts of \nCongress, most people are very surprised and angered to learn that less \nthan 2 percent of overall Federal spending goes to education. They \nthink education should be a higher priority, that we should improve and \nincrease education spending, and so do I.\n\n  Instead, other than an increase for the Individuals with Disabilities \nin Education Act--an important $500 million increase that I think we \nall support--we will see cuts in education funding, and cuts in other \nimportant areas in social services and job training.\n  Even with the increase for IDEA, this budget agreement assumes $200 \nmillion in other funds--or $700 million if IDEA is included--in cuts \nbelow a freeze that would have to come from other discretionary \nprograms in education, social services and job training.\n  Where will the axe fall? The Senate's budget specifically focused on \nsubfunction 501--K-12 education. But after working with the House, this \nconference proposal now is silent on K-12 education as a specific \nsubfunction. Can we then assume that our public schools will bear the \nburden of these cuts? Or will the cuts be in other important areas? The \nlist is long. Will it be Head Start or national service, job training \nor juvenile justice, student aid or nutritional programs?\n  The American people in overwhelming numbers support increased funding \nfor education. The Congress of the United States has not yet heard the \nmessage. This budget conference agreement does not place education as a \nhigh enough priority. Among other things, this budget completely \nignores the pressing need to continue in the national effort to help \nlocal school districts hire 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers.\n  In the classroom, when students wonder why their teacher is not \nprepared to help them learn math and science--they can look to this \nbudget. When they are stuck in an over-crowded classroom, they can look \nto this budget. When they learn that there will be less student aid \nthis year than last year, they can look to this budget. When the \nAmerican people see that fewer children are graduating with the skills \nthey need to participate in our fast-changing economy, they can look to \nthis budget and the short-sighted priorities of the 106th Congress.\n  A small bright spot in this otherwise bleak budget is the important \nexpansion to child care funding. The Senate overwhelmingly supported \nthe Dodd child care amendment to the budget resolution. I cosponsored \nthat amendment, and while only part of it was retained, I think we have \nthe beginnings of real, bipartisan progress on child care funding.\n  What the Senate supported yesterday in an overwhelming 66-33 vote, \nwas a historic first step that would have increased child care funding \nby $12.5 billion over 10 years--nearly doubling our federal investment \nin quality child care.\n  What the Senate is being asked to support today is not the complete \nDodd amendment, but with a $3 billion investment in the child care and \ndevelopment block grant, and $3 billion in tax incentives, we are \nmaking a good start.\n  Child care questions are becoming more and more pressing for more \nparents every day. With concerns about affordability, quality, and \naccess--and with more low-income parents going into the workforce--the \nneeds are changing and increasing. More child care is needed during \n``off hours''--such as evenings and weekends. More child care is needed \nin rural settings, impacting transportation, work schedules, and the \namount of licensed family child care providers.\n  It is vital that we make improvements for child care; the provisions \nof this conference agreement are a beginning to real progress.\n  But Mr. President, the glimmer of hope offered by the language on \nchildcare is not enough reason to support the FY2000 Budget before us \nand I urge a no vote on the Conference Report. Under the unrealistic \nlimits set under this budget, as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I know we will be unable to protect the real concerns of \nworking families. Our hands will be tied when it comes time for us to \ninvest in important priorities like education, health care, \nenvironmental protection, agriculture, biomedical research, and early \nchildhood development.\n  Mr. President, finally, I commend Senator Lautenberg for his \nleadership in attempting to work for real progress and for a true \nfiscal plan that will guide us in the new millennium. I know he shares \nmy disappointment in this resolution. But I thank him for the \ntremendous amount of work and leadership he has given us on the Budget \nCommittee as we move forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that it \nbe equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield whatever time the Senator \nwants.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to support the budget \nconference report. Before I speak on the report, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to commend the Senate Majority Leader and Chairman \nDomenici for their outstanding leadership in crafting and delivering \nthis well-balanced budget proposal.\n  I believe this budget blueprint is a great achievement of this \nCongress, and it will ensure our continued economic growth and \nprosperity in the new millennium.\n  Protecting Social Security, reducing the national debt and reducing \ntaxes are imperative for our economic security and growth. Our strong \neconomy has offered us a historic opportunity to achieve this three-\npronged goal.\n  This budget conference report has showed us how we can provide major \ntax relief while preserving Social Security and dramatically reducing \nthe national debt, as well as providing sufficient funding for all \nnecessary Government functions.\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\n  President Clinton has proposed to spend over $158 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus in his budget over the next five years for \nunrelated Government programs, instead of protecting Social Security. \nRemember the phrase, ``Save Social Security first''? That is not in the \nPresident's budget.\n  This budget conference report includes a safe-deposit box to lock in \nevery penny of the $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus earned in the \nnext 10 years to be used exclusively for Social Security.\n  Stopping the Government from raiding the Social Security Trust Funds \nis an essential first step to ensure Social Security will be there for \ncurrent beneficiaries, baby boomers and our children and grandchildren.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Abraham and others to offer an \namendment during the Senate floor consideration that made this our \nnumber-one priority under this budget.\n  It is also notable, that under this budget, the debt held by the \npublic will be reduced dramatically, much more than what President \nClinton has proposed in his budget.\n  This budget conference report reserves nearly $800 billion of the \nprojected non-Social Security surplus--those are the tax overpayments \nof working Americans--earmarking $800 billion for tax relief. This is \nthe largest tax relief enacted since President Reagan's tax cuts in the \nearly 1980s.\n  As one who has long championed major tax relief, I am pleased all \nSenators supported my resolution to protect this tax relief in the \nBudget Resolution.\n  My language offers options for middle-income tax relief such as \nbroad-based tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings \nincentives, death tax relief, health care-related tax relief, and \neducation-related tax relief.\n  The purpose of the provision is to assure the American people that we \nhave made a commitment to major tax relief, and that there is room in \nthis budget to fulfill this commitment while protecting Social Security \nand Medicare, providing debt relief and respecting some new spending \npriorities.\n  I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, that this budget conference \nreport has retained my proposal which could allow us to lock in for \nimmediate tax relief any additional on-budget surplus as re-estimated \nin July by the Congressional Budget Office for fiscal year 2000.\n  I believe this is solid protection for the American taxpayers. I \nthank the Senate majority leader and, again, Chairman Domenici for \nretaining this important provision in the budget conference report.\n  As the economy continues to be strong, we may have more revenue \nwindfalls to come in the next 10 years that are above and beyond the \nSocial Security surplus. We must return these tax overpayments to hard-\nworking Americans. They should benefit from the surpluses they are \npaying in rather than allowing Washington to stand first in line \nsaying, ``Let's spend your money rather than giving it back.''\n  The logic for tax relief is fairly simple. Despite a shrinking \nFederal deficit and a predicted onbudget surplus, the total tax burden \non working Americans today is at an all-time high. Americans today have \nthe largest tax burden ever in history--even larger than during World \nWar II--and the tax burden is still growing.\n  Federal taxes today consume about 21 percent of the total national \nincome. A typical American family now pays about 40 percent in total \ntaxes on everything they earn. That is more than it spends on food, \nclothing, transportation, and housing combined. So they are spending \nmore to support Uncle Sam than they do on the basic necessities of \nlife. It is still imperative to provide tax relief for working \nAmericans and address our long-term fiscal imbalances.\n  Not only does this budget fund all the functions of the Government, \nbut it also significantly increases funding for our budget priorities, \nsuch as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture, and others.\n  Although I have reservations about some new spending increases, \nincluding this conference report, I think overall the report is well \nbalanced.\n  This conference report also retains the Senate-passed amendment that \nSenator Grassley and I offered. This provision would reserve up to $6 \nbillion for crop insurance reform. Including this funding increase in \nthe budget conference report is an important step, I believe, in \nrealizing our goal of real crop insurance reform to help ailing \nfarmers.\n  One of the promises made during the debate of the 1996 farm bill was \nthat Congress would address the need for a better system for crop \ninsurance. Last year, we witnessed devastating circumstances come \ntogether in my home State of Minnesota to create a crisis atmosphere \nfor many of our farmers and for farmers around the country, as well. We \nalso saw the current Federal Crop Insurance Program fail for far too \nmany farmers. Funds for crop insurance reform are the best dollars we \ncan spend to help American agriculture, and this is a far better way to \nassist farmers than any of the spending that we have included in the \nemergency spending bills. We need to pass this.\n  Finally, Mr. President, unlike President Clinton's budget, which, \nagain, has broken the spending caps by over $22 billion, this budget \nmaintains the fiscal discipline by retaining the spending caps. There \nare those who claim we cannot avoid breaking the caps as we proceed to \nreconcile this budget. I say if we do our job to oversee Government \nprograms, we will know which areas can be streamlined and which program \nfunding can be shifted to new priorities. Let's make sure we do our job \nto justify all Government funds are wisely spent.\n  In closing, cutting taxes, reducing the national debt, and reforming \nand protecting Social Security and Medicare at the same time are all \npossible. It is not either/or. It is not either Social Security or \ngiving tax cuts. We can do all with what we have in the budget. This \nbudget conference report has showed us how we can do it.\n\n  The bigger challenge facing us now is that we must have the strong \npolitical will to follow through on this budget. We must defend the \nprinciples and priorities highlighted in this budget blueprint through \nthe entire appropriations and reconciliation processes, as well as in \nother legislative initiatives during the first session of this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nachieve the goals set forth in this budget. Again, I commend the Senate \nmajority leader and also committee Chairman Domenici for putting this \nbudget together.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes of our time to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the Senate \nBudget Committee, Senator Frank Lautenberg, who has announced his \nretirement. He is headed for the last budget roundup. This is the \nsecond to the last stop. I have one more year with Frank Lautenberg as \nspokesman on that committee who has made an enormous contribution to \nthe committee, his State, to this Nation, and certainly this budget \ndeliberation. We are going to miss him. He has done a great job for \nAmerica.\n  I have known for many years the chairman of this committee, Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico. When I was a member of the House Budget \nCommittee, his reputation was well known. He has been a deficit hawk \nfor as long as I have known him. I am sure he has some sense of relief \ntoday dealing with a budget that is in much better circumstances than \nit was a few years ago. That is due in no small measure to his \ncontribution. Though I may disagree with him on this particular budget \nresolution, it does not diminish my respect for what he has done in \nthis budget process in demanding honesty. I hope he will continue on \nthat pursuit, and I hope we will share goals in the near future. I am \nlooking forward to doing just that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I \nappreciate his comments very much.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, having said all these wonderful things \nabout Senator Domenici, I am going to tell you what is wrong with his \nbudget resolution, and he is not going to be a bit surprised by all \nthat.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  There are a few things where we do disagree. As Senator Grams of \nMinnesota just mentioned, there is overriding concern by all of us \nabout the future of Social Security. I think Senator Conrad on the \nDemocratic side offered a very novel, imaginative, and positive \ncontribution to this debate when he suggested we lock up the Social \nSecurity surplus for Social Security.\n  This would be done by requiring that an extraordinary vote of 60 \nvotes would be required to spend the Social Security trust fund surplus \nfor anything other than Social Security. We understand Social Security \nis a solid covenant between generations. Without it, 16 million more \nAmericans would live in poverty, and Social Security is the principal \nsource of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the only source \nof income for nearly one-fifth of our seniors.\n  This trust fund will go bankrupt in the year 2034 when people like \nmyself, if we are lucky to be alive, will be part of the huge baby-boom \ngeneration looking to a smaller pool of American workers to sustain us. \nThat is why the actions we take today for the future of Social Security \nare so critically important.\n  I am afraid the Republican alternative in this budget resolution is \nnot nearly as good as Senator Conrad's suggestion of a 60-vote lockbox. \nI am afraid we have fallen short of the mark when coming to \nguaranteeing the future of Social Security in this budget resolution.\n  There is another element, though, that is even more mystifying. There \nis an old poem that goes something like this:\n\n       As I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't \n     there. He wasn't there again today. I wish that man would go \n     away.\n\n  The man I am talking about is Medicare. The problem with Medicare \nwill not go away. The Medicare trust fund is expected to go bankrupt in \nthe year 2015. If that is not bad enough, as baby boomers like myself \nretire, the strain will become even greater. By 2034, the number of \nMedicare beneficiaries is expected to double to almost 80 million \nAmerican seniors.\n  The Democrats had a proposal to deal with that. The Democrats came \nforward and said we should dedicate a substantial portion of any future \nsurplus to go to Medicare so that in addition to reforming Medicare, we \nwould be putting our surplus funds into it so that it would be strong \nfor many years to come. Our lockbox proposal for Medicare would save \n$376 billion of the budget surplus for the next 10 years, and it would \nextend Medicare solvency by 12 years to the year 2027.\n  By locking these funds away, we make sure the country will have time \nfor a serious debate on the future of Medicare reform while we are \ncertain that it is going to be solvent. Unfortunately and sadly, and \nalmost without explanation, the Republican budget proposal before us \ntoday does not put away a single penny--not one cent--for Medicare. It \ndoes not extend the life of the trust fund by a single day. That, I \nthink, is an abdication of responsibility, not just to the 40 million \nseniors who depend on Medicare but to their children who want their \nparents and grandparents to live in dignity and without worry about \nmedical bills.\n  If we ignore Medicare, we are ignoring a looming crisis. This budget \nresolution does not address it. We will be hearing from the other side \nabout how this budget resolution ``fully funds Medicare.'' But a fully \nfunded Medicare is still going to go bankrupt in just 16 years. The \ntruth is, this budget does not do anything substantial for the Medicare \nsystem. It could leave it withering on the vine from neglect.\n  This chart indicates the difference in approach between the \nRepublican side in blue and the Democratic side in red about the \ndedication of surpluses for Social Security and Medicare.\n  You can see a substantial difference between the two; in the years \n2000 to 2004 composite--the first graph--and then later the 2000 to \n2009 composite. It indicates the different dedication of funds to make \ncertain Medicare is included in any plan that is a part of this budget \nresolution.\n  Let me speak for a moment about tax cuts, too. As I have said many \ntimes, there is just no more appealing phrase for a politician than, \n``I favor a tax cut.'' People cheer, ``Oh, we love you. This is \ngreat.'' But we have to be honest with the American people. Some \npoliticians in the past have talked about, ``Read my lips: No new \ntaxes.'' The American people learned a lesson there. They want honest \ntalk about taxes. They do not want promises that cannot be kept or \npromises that we should not keep. The Democratic plan has targeted tax \ncuts, after we dedicated funds for Social Security, after we dedicated \nfunds for Medicare. We kept a substantial portion aside for tax cuts \ntargeted for the American families truly in need.\n  That would include USA accounts, the President suggested, so that \nmore working families can save for retirement.\n  Long-term care tax credits, think of how many people are worried \nabout their parents and grandparents now in nursing homes or in need of \nspecial care. This $1,000 tax credit would be a helping hand to \nliterally millions of Americans in that predicament.\n  The child and dependent care tax credit, we proposed $6.3 billion to \nhelp pay for child care. We want Americans to work. But while they \nwork, we want their children to be in safe and loving hands. And that \nmeans quality day care and stepping in to help low-income families so \nthey can pay for that day care. And a tax credit for work-related \nexpenses for people with disabilities. This will defray special \nemployment-related costs incurred by those people with disabilities, \nsuch as transportation and technology costs.\n  Our tax cuts are geared to make certain that we meet our obligations \nfirst to Social Security and Medicare, and then to the American working \nfamilies who most deserve them. It is still a mystery as to what the \nRepublican tax cut will be. I am not sure. Perhaps we will have an \nexplanation of it sometime later today before we vote on this budget \nresolution.\n  But, in fact, we have heard one proposal from John Kasich, the \nchairman of the House Budget Committee, about a 10-percent, across-the-\nboard tax cut. What would that tax cut mean? It is a good day to ask \nthe question--on April 15.\n  For those with incomes under $38,000 a year, the Republican tax cut \nof Mr. Kasich is $99 a year. That is almost $8.25 a month that people \nwill have to spend under the Republican tax cut, if they happen to be \namong the 60 percent of working Americans who make less than $38,000 a \nyear. Think of it--a Republican tax cut that might pay half of your \ncable TV bill each month. Isn't that something to look forward to?\n  But if you happen to be in an income category in the stratosphere--\nover $300,000 a year--a 10-percent tax cut is $20,697.\n  So the people with the money are given the tax cuts. The folks who \nare working to raise their families and pay their bills, under this \nRepublican tax-cut plan, get $99 a year. I do not think that is fair. \nApril 15 is a good time to talk about taxes. I want to remind my wife \nto get the forms in the mail before midnight back home. We want to make \nsure we do file our taxes on time, as all Americans should. But I hope \nthat we will take a minute to reflect on the tax burden in America and \nwhat has happened to it.\n\n  The median family income in America--that is the average--is $54,000. \nIf you look at the tax burden on working families in America over the \nlast 22 years, you will see an interesting thing has occurred. The \ntaxes had gone up in the early 1980s, and then started coming down; and \nthen look where they have dropped by 1999--the lowest tax burden in 23 \nyears.\n  Anyone writing a check today will say, ``I wish it was even lower,'' \nbut the fact is it has been coming down. The U.S. Treasury reports a \nfamily of four, with the median income of $54,900, will pay the lowest \npercentage of its income in taxes since 1976. It shows that many \nfamilies with half the median income--these are folks making about \n$27,000 a year--let me show this chart here--some of our hardest \nworking families, I might add--will actually pay no income tax at all \nor get a check back from the government. They have an average income \ntax burden of a negative 1 percent. Their overall tax burden is the \nlowest in more than 30 years. This chart indicates it is the lowest in \n35 years. A family of four can make up to as much as $28,000 and not \nowe a dime in taxes.\n  Incidentally, one of the reasons many of these family tax burdens are \nlower is\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\nbecause of our expansion of the earned income tax credit in 1993. This \ntax credit focuses on helping working families.\n  What a contrast: A Republican proposal by a Congressman from Ohio for \na tax cut to benefit the wealthiest; the earned income tax credit \ndesigned to help working families. It really tells a world of \ndifference in philosophy when it comes to tax cuts.\n  The interesting thing is if you look at those who are doing pretty \nwell in America, those making twice the median income; that would be \nover $109,000 a year. Their tax burden is also declining. The average \nFederal tax burden of a family of four with twice the median income is \nthe lowest it has been since 1988, and the second lowest since 1977.\n  We back these figures up by an analysis, not from some Democratic \nParty organ but, rather, the accounting firm Deloitte and Touche, a \ngroup recognized as reputable in the field. Their analysis shows that \nthe average Federal tax rate is lower today than it was 20 years ago \nfor virtually every type of taxpayer.\n  We want to continue that, target the tax cuts to the families that \nneed it the most, but it is not in this budget resolution--an approach \nwhich is so general as to suggest we would be giving tax cuts to the \nwealthiest among us instead of those who work the hardest, the working \nfamilies struggling to put their kids through school.\n  We are going to face a crisis here on this budget debate, and it will \ncome soon. I am afraid when we take a look at the Republican budget \nresolution, with tax cuts for wealthy people, we are going to find \nourselves cutting back on a lot of spending. Some on the Republican \nside have stood up and very honestly said that is OK, ``We believe that \ncutting back on Federal spending is good at any cost.'' I have second \nthoughts about that, because some of the programs which we will cut \nwith this budget resolution are critically important to many American \nfamilies.\n  As a result of this resolution, as many as 100,000 fewer American \nkids would have access to Head Start--Head Start-- that early childhood \ndevelopment program where kids get a chance to prepare themselves for \nkindergarten and first grade. One-hundred thousand more kids in America \nwould be off the program as a result of this budget resolution.\n\n  Another program, that is near and dear to my heart, the WIC Program--\nWomen, Infants, and Children Program--brings in pregnant mothers, \nmothers with young children, and helps them with nutritional assistance \nduring the pregnancy and after the children are born. One out of four \nAmerican babies is in this program. Lower-income families need this \nhelping hand to make sure their kids get nutritious food and so that \nthe mother is healthy when she delivers the baby.\n  Is there any better investment of money in this country than doing \nwhat we can to make sure that our pregnant mothers and their children, \nat their earliest age, are off to a healthy, nutritious start? This \nRepublican budget resolution will cut over 1.2 million low-income \nwomen, children, and infants from the WIC Program. How can that make \nthis a better country?\n  And when it comes to some basic things, we all abhor drugs in America \nand drug crimes, and yet with this budget we will be forced to cut the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents who are trying to ferret out those \nsmuggling narcotics into America. So 1,350 fewer Border Patrol agents, \n780 fewer drug enforcement agency personnel out there fighting the war \non drugs--think about that for a second. Does that make any sense? More \ndrugs in America, so we would have more people ultimately committing \ncrimes and going to prison because we give a tax cut to the wealthiest \npeople in this country. This is upside down thinking and a reason why \nmany of us question its wisdom.\n  Funding eliminated for 21 Superfund sites; 73,000 summer jobs and \ntraining opportunities cut.\n  The list goes on.\n  Cuts in food safety. You ask the American people, what do you expect \nof your Federal Government? In the State of Iowa a poll said: The first \nthing is to make sure the food we eat is safe to eat. People are \nconcerned about that. They hear about scandals where children eat \ntainted food, or the elderly do, and get seriously ill, if not die, and \nyet we cut back in the Department of Agriculture in areas of food \nsafety. How can we possibly rationalize and explain that in the name of \ngiving greater tax cuts to wealthy Americans?\n  Let me close by saying that I respect the hard work that has gone \ninto this budget. I respect the serious difference of opinion between \nthe Republican side and the Democratic side.\n  I think ours is a more balanced and rational approach. It takes care \nof the future of Social Security. It provides help for Medicare where \nthe Republican budget resolution provides none. It provides tax cuts \nfor families that really need it and doesn't give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest among us. It also provides that we will have the money \navailable to meet the basic needs of America when it comes to educating \nkids, feeding pregnant mothers and children, providing for the kind of \nlaw enforcement that is essential for the security of this country.\n  I hope that before this is all said and done, President Clinton can \nbring the leaders on Capitol Hill, the Republican leaders in the Senate \nand the House, together and that we can work out some reasonable \nbipartisan compromise. I am afraid this budget resolution does not \nreflect that, and that is why I am going to respectfully oppose it and \nvote against it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I use.\n  First, let me speak to those who are wondering what the time \nsequencing is and when we might vote. We know of only one additional \nSenator on our side who wants to speak, and that will be Senator Slade \nGorton. I understand that we know, in fact, where he is. He is at a \ncommittee hearing, but as soon as he comes, he will be our last \nspeaker. We are anxiously waiting to see how many more there are on the \nother side, and we are hoping that in all events we will be through \ndebating this budget resolution within an hour or less. That will set a \ntime certain that is accommodating to the leaderships in terms of when \nwe vote.\n  Having said that, let me just comment a bit with respect to a few \nthings that have been said by the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak a few words to the \nSenate and anybody interested with reference to some of the comments \nmade by my good friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin. I do mean that. \nHe is a very new member of our committee, and I find him to be a very \ndedicated and hard-working Senator. I reciprocate with my compliments \nto his work and effort.\n  I do believe we have a propensity on the floor to argue and, in many \ncases, to exaggerate so as to prove our point. Let me make sure that \nthe American people understand the tax cut we are talking about.\n  It is projected that in the next decade we will have $2.5 trillion in \nsurplus money coming into the Federal Government. Let's for a moment \nunderstand basically what that means, $2.5 trillion. The entire budget \nof the United States for everything is about $1.8 trillion a year. We \nwill have a surplus that dramatically and extensively exceeds the total \namount we are spending annually for all programs of government.\n  Where did that $2.5 trillion come from? It did not drop on us from \nouter space, nor did a big rain cloud come over and rain came down and \nit was full of dollars and that is where the $2.5 trillion in surplus \ncame from. I think most people, if given three or four things they \ncould choose from, would choose the right answer--the taxpayers paid it \nin. The taxpayers pay $2.5 trillion more in the next decade in taxes \nthan we need to run government based upon a reasonable program.\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\n  Obviously, if you believe there is a never-ending need for government \nspending, then you can whisk away that $2.5 trillion and say, let's \nspend it. Frankly, for all of the desires of the American people, they \nare not crazy. In fact, they understand implicitly what is going on. \nWhen, in fact, you have this kind of excess taxes being paid in, there \nis a difference, dramatic difference, between the two parties. The \nRepublicans say don't grow government, give the money back to the \ntaxpayer.\n  That is what all this argument is about. What do you do with that \nexcess, which is more money per year and per the next decade from the \ntaxpayers, all taxpayers, than we need for our current budget plans?\n  You could invent new budget plans, I say to the occupant of the \nChair, and spend every cent of it. Or you can do something as wild as \nthe President has recommended, which not even the Senate believes is \nresponsible--indeed, both sides. You can take a huge chunk of that \nmoney and put it into the Medicare trust fund without reforming or \nchanging Medicare, just put it in there and put out, as the President \ndid, 15 percent of that surplus in IOUs. The IOUs have value, because \nwhat are the IOUs? The IOUs are postdated checks which are going to \ncome due at some point.\n  Who is going to pay for them? It is the American taxpayer who is \ngoing to have to redeem them in 10, 15, or 20 years, because it is just \na postdated check. You understand that, but if they understood it, they \nwould say: What is this all about? We thought we were fixing Medicare, \nreforming it and making it more efficient. Sometime out there in the \nfuture, those IOUs are going to come due, and we are going to have to \npay them. New taxes are going to have to be imposed.\n  What do the Republicans think? Republicans think that during the next \ndecade you ought to take every single solitary penny of Social Security \nsurplus, which is part of that $2.5 trillion that I have been talking \nabout, and put it in a position in the budget where it can't be spent \nfor anything other than senior needs.\n  There are arguments that isn't enough for Medicare, that we don't \nprovide for Medicare in this budget. Let me just tell you what we do \nprovide. We provide $462 billion more in that trust fund than the \nPresident did, and he heralded his budget as being responsive to the \nproposition that every single penny of trust fund money would be \ndeposited in the trust fund for Social Security, excepting he had a \nnice little funny thing in there. That was over 15 years--we never have \nbudgeted like that--which meant that he only put 62 percent of the \nSocial Security surplus into a Social Security accumulating trust fund, \nand then he did this IOU business with Medicare. Essentially, it is as \nif there is a plan, an intentional approach to say to the American \npeople: Don't worry about the taxes you are paying in and the excess; \nwe have it all taken care of; we are going to spend it.\n  As a matter of fact, it is most interesting; the President of the \nUnited States spent in the first 10 years $158 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus for programs.\n  Unequivocal. Nobody denies it. The President's OMB people don't deny \nit. They say that doesn't matter because over many years we are going \nto save the money for Social Security, but we will spend some of it in \nthe first decade. In fact, that $158 billion is in the first 5 years of \nthe budget--it is going to be spent.\n  Having said that, the other issue that seems to always come up is, if \nyou are going to give tax cuts, it just has to be that the Republicans \nare going to take care of the rich people and not the middle income and \nfamily people, because there have been various Senators and House \nMembers speaking about what they might want. I will remind everybody \nlistening to that kind of stuff on the floor, you should know that that \nbudget resolution, by operation of law, does not say how the taxes will \nbe cut. It says how much. And in the processes of the Congress, later \non--in fact, under this budget, it is in July of this year--the tax-\nwriting committees, after hearings, after citizen input, after talking \nwith Senators from both sides of the aisle, will produce the tax bill. \nThat will be the time to decide what is in it. And it is actually a red \nherring to talk about what is in that tax bill--because we don't know--\nas a justification for not having any tax cuts. But that doesn't sound \nright, does it? Well, it is right.\n  Those who use the argument that it is going to be a bad tax bill, so \ndon't have any tax cut, are essentially saying we don't want to give \nyou a tax cut because we don't know what will be in it. But I will tell \nyou what the budget resolution says. That is the best I can do. It \nrecommends that such tax relief could include any or all of the \nfollowing: an expansion of the 15-percent bracket, marginal rate \nreductions, a significant reduction or elimination of the marriage tax \npenalty, retirement savings incentives, estate tax relief, an above-\nthe-line income tax reduction for Social Security payroll taxes, tax \nincentives for education, parity between the self-employed and \ncorporations with respect to tax treatment of health insurance \npremiums, capital gains taxes, and fairness for family farmers.\n  Now, that is what we are discussing. Do we want to allow some or all \nof that to be debated and looked at? That is why we have a tax \nprovision in this budget resolution.\n  Let me just quickly go through one other thing and then summarize \nwhat we have done. First, in the Medicare program, by virtue of a good \neconomy, meaning high unemployment, a lot of people paying into these \ntrust funds, we have extended the life of Medicare, Part A--that is the \nhospitalization part in the trust fund--for 8 years without Congress \ndoing a thing. The current program lives for 8 years longer than \nexpected just 6 months ago because the economy is powerful.\n  Now, almost everyone knows we have to reform, change, make better, \nmake more efficient the Medicare program. There are some who would like \nto deposit $400 billion in the trust fund of Medicare and let it sit \nthere as IOUs for the future, without first determining what does \nMedicare need or, to put it another way, without any reform or changes \nin Medicare. None. That is what it contemplates. And an extension of \nthe trust fund is contemplated by just pouring that money in and taking \nIOUs. It isn't spent. It extends the life of Medicare some 8 or 9 \nyears, and it doesn't contemplate or envision reform. It doesn't pay \nfor prescription drugs. And, incidentally, as an aside, anybody who \nwould like to ask the OMB of the United States, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the Comptroller \nGeneral, ask them if the President paid for prescription drugs in his \nbudget--zero. He suggests we might want to do that sometime as part of \nreform.\n\n  Now, one Democrat Senator said, ``Republicans want to raid the \nFederal tax treasury for a tax cut.'' Now, isn't that an interesting \nconcept? Raiding the Federal Treasury for a tax cut. What is the \nFederal Treasury? What is the Federal Treasury into which the taxpayers \nare paying $2.5 trillion more than you need for Government? What is the \nFederal Treasury?\n  My friends, the Federal Treasury belongs to the American people. It \ndoes not belong to the Government. If we reduce the size of Government \nand there is money left over and we say let's give it back to the \npublic, are we raiding the Treasury of the United States, or are we \ngiving back to our citizens the overpayment they have paid in income \ntaxes that is lodged temporarily, or housed in the U.S. Government?\n  I wonder how the people who are hurrying today to the post offices \ntrying to get their tax returns in would feel if they knew that over \nthe next 10 years as they file their returns, they are overpaying the \nGovernment; and, as a matter of fact, if you add it all up, they are \npaying $2.5 trillion over current expenditures. I think they would be \nwondering, what is the U.S. Treasury? We thought maybe it was ours.\n  In summary, we think we have a very good plan to enter the \nmillennium. If the President would like to enter that millennium with \nus, that would be great. Everybody listening and everybody who follows \nbudgets should know that there has not been a vote in this Congress, or \nin our Committee on the Budget, on a Democratic budget. They don't have \nto produce one. When I was in the minority, I didn't produce a budget \nevery year. So everybody will know, we didn't vote on a Democrat\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nbudget; we voted on the President's budget. While there was a lot of \nargument about whether we were voting on it or not, that is what it \nsaid--that we were voting on it. Now it will be interesting to know \nwhat results from that vote: No, every member of the committee; Yes, \nzero members of the committee.\n  Now, if in fact it was a great budget on Social Security, a great \nbudget on Medicare--just those two--if it was great on those, Democrats \nwould have voted for it because, after all, it is pretty clear that is \nwhat they believe to be the biggest issue going. They didn't vote for \nit.\n  Now, what this budget does is save Social Security and puts in a \ntrust fund $462 billion more than the President put in, and the number \nis $1.8 trillion. You can't spend it. It is there. You can't use it for \ntax cuts, that is for sure. As a matter of fact, we will soon vote on \nlegislation to lock it up so that it can't be used without 60 votes.\n  Save the Social Security trust fund first. That is the No. 1 plank, \nthe No. 1 priority in the budget. Second, make sure we have done \neverything we can to promote Medicare reform and see to it that we do \nhave the resources for it. We have done that. I am not going to repeat \nthe three or four things in the budget and just say those were No. 1 \nand No. 2. Three, we have dramatically increased national defense. \nEverybody understands that. If they didn't understand it 2 weeks ago, \nthey ought to understand it now. The costs that we are incurring in \nKosovo now, over and above defense spending we contemplated year \nby year, are astronomical. We soon may have to add to that, in an \nemergency, as much as $5 billion. And if we went on for a whole year, \ndepending upon which kind of activity we have had, the number could be \nmore than twice or three times that amount. So we have increased it \nsubstantially.\n\n  In our prioritizing, in our setting forth what we think should be \npaid for first, we have increased education $3.8 billion in the first \nyear, $38 billion over the next 5, beyond that requested by the \nPresident. Our only hope is that none of that money will be used unless \nwe have a new approach to public education funding, and that we would \nsend the money down to the locales with ``flexibility and \naccountability.'' Those are the two new words we want to attach--to \ngive them flexibility and make them accountable. Don't tell them how to \nuse it because one shoe doesn't fit everything in the school districts \nfrom East to West and North to South in this great land.\n  We have sustained and added to all of our criminal justice \nactivities, and we have added $1.7 billion to veterans' hospital care, \nsubstantially more than the President, because we think that is one of \nour real values in this country--to take care of veterans' health \nbenefits.\n  I may have missed one thing or two. But I will summarize the effect \nof all of that.\n  We will have cut the national debt in half by creating that surplus \nand setting it there. We have reduced the national debt in half, \nsubstantially more than the President reduced the national debt. We \nthink that is very, very good for our future.\n  I might say it is obvious that a number of our domestic accounts, \naside from those that we treat with priority and that I have just \nstated, will go up. It will be very difficult to do all of the things \nGovernment is currently doing and meet this budget. In the appropriated \naccounts of our Government, between defense and nondefense, it is now \nabout 30 percent of the budget, and it is going to be hard for those \naccounts to fit within this very tightly and stick to the balanced \nbudget numbers. But it was my opinion, with the Senate of the United \nStates, with one Democrat supporting us and the rest of us on our side \nunanimously voting for this, that we thought the best way to approach a \nsuccessful American economy was to stick to the balanced budget plan in \nterms of people believing we meant what we said--that we were going to \n``ratchet down'' Government and make sure we had a credible plan to do \nit.\n  Having said that, if Senator Gorton does not arrive shortly, I will \nbe able to tell Senator Lautenberg that we don't have any other \nspeakers. We will check with him right now so I can inform the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a few minutes so that the \nSenator from California can have 10 minutes now while we are waiting \nfor Senator Gorton?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. Of course.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman, Senator Domenici, and \nmy ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, for yielding me 10 minutes of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I have served on the Budget Committee since I came to \nthe Senate. That was almost 7 years ago. In the House I served for the \nmaximum period allowable on the House Budget Committee, 6 years. So I \nhave seen budgets come; I have seen budgets go. I have seen good ones, \nbad ones, middle-of-the-road ones. And I have to say that my heart is \nheavy as I look at this budget. My heart is heavy because I think it is \nnot a good roadmap for our future.\n  I say that because I think this budget fixates on tax cuts to the \nwealthy, to the exclusion of other important critical priorities such \nas Social Security, Medicare solvency, and the environment. Under this \nproposal, virtually all of the onbudget surplus would be used for tax \ncuts. Tax cuts are good and I certainly do support targeted tax cuts to \npeople who need it, such as the kind of program we unveiled yesterday \nat the White House with the President, the USA accounts, the Universal \nSavings Accounts that will go to people with $100,000 a year and less, \nand give them incentive to save by having matching funds from the \nFederal Government. It will make life good for our people. That is the \nkind of tax cut we ought to be talking about.\n  But that is not an across-the-board tax cut that we hear talked \nabout. And my friend from New Mexico says it is premature to criticize \nthe tax cut portion of this; we don't know what it will look like.\n  I have listened to Congressman Kasich and others wax eloquent about \nthe importance of an across-the-board cut, and we know what that means. \nIt will mean $99 back for most of the people earning approximately \n$40,000 a year or less. But for those in the very high brackets, those \nwho earn $800,000, we are talking about $20,000 a year back.\n  Mr. President, $20,000 back to some who earn more than $300,000, the \ntop 1 percent, is that something that we can truly say is going to \nbring the American dream to the people who do not have it? I don't get \nit. That is more than people make on a minimum wage, who sweat and toil \nevery day--at the minimum wage. And we have had great objection every \ntime we tried to raise the minimum wage.\n  I don't even get into the people who make $1 million a year. High-\nwage earners are good people. They have worked hard. But I don't find \nwhen I talk to them that they are saying to me, ``Senator, you have to \ngive us more money back.'' They are doing well. They are doing well in \nthe stock market. They understand that this country does well when you \nbring everyone along.\n  So I have a problem.\n  Let me give you another clue as to why I believe these tax cuts will \ngo to those at the very, very top of the ladder. If you look carefully \nin this budget proposal and they talk about taxes, they go out of their \nway to mention cuts in estate taxes--taxes that are paid when someone \ndies. Mr. President, almost ninety-nine percent of the people in this \ncountry will never have to pay an estate tax. In other words, we have \nexempted much income from the estate tax. Here we see the Republican \nmajority fighting again for the top 1 percent of income earners.\n  Mr. President, I offered a very simple amendment in the committee. Do \nyou know what it said? If there are going to be tax cuts, the \nsubstantial benefit should go to the first 90 percent of income \nearners. The Republicans didn't want to vote on that. As a matter of \nfact, my chairman, whom I respect and like and admire, said, you know, \nlast year that was a good idea; this year it is not a good idea. They \nwouldn't take that. They substituted some other language. Then when we \ngot to the floor of the Senate, guess what. They didn't want to vote on \nit. They accepted it only to drop it in the conference.\n  So this budget fixates on tax breaks for the people who do not need \nthem.\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nAnd even bipartisan votes were dropped in the conference. It is hard \nfor me to understand how this is a good roadmap for our future. \nEducation, yes there is a good increase needed in education. But every \nsingle amendment that was moved forward, such as the one from our \nranking member on school modernization, was dropped in the conference.\n  My language on after school, which we know works for our children--\nand we have so many local districts that want that program--was dropped \nin the conference. Why? The new thing: We don't want to tell local \ndistricts what to do. Mr. President, these programs don't tell local \ndistricts what to do. We simply make funding available if they believe \nafter school is a priority, if they believe school modernization is a \npriority, if they believe putting more teachers in the classroom is a \npriority.\n  The new words are ``flexibility'' and ``accountability.'' How is it \nholding anyone accountable if you give them money and you don't even \ntell them you think they ought to look at after school, or you think \nthey ought to look at lowering the number of children in the classroom? \nWe were elected because we have views on these subject matters, not \njust to simply write a blank check and say, ``Oh, take the money. We \ndon't care.'' Do with it what you will: Put a new carpet in the \nadministrator's office, have him hire a new assistant, put a shower in \nhis office. I don't think that is the way we ought to legislate. We ran \non these issues. We understand them. If we don't, we don't belong here.\n\n  I am not going to give a blank check to some school administrator. I \nam going to say, look, this is what we have available for you if you \nfeel these are your priorities. Do Members know who set that standard, \nthat kind of model? Dwight David Eisenhower, Republican President in \nthe 1950s who authored the National Defense Education Act, who said \nthere is a shortage of math teachers and science teachers; the Federal \nGovernment will help you pay to train those teachers--a Republican \nPresident. He didn't say, ``Here, take the money, we don't care what \nyou use it for.'' He said there is a national problem here, let's \naddress it.\n  We know there is a national problem, as the Senator from New Jersey \nknows, fixing up the schools. We know there is a national problem, no \nafterschool programs, our kids get in trouble. We know there is a \nnational problem, too many children in the classroom. We simply try to \nput some language in and it gets dropped in the conference.\n  Yes, my chairman is right: There is a huge difference between \nDemocrats and Republicans. More and more I realize this. All you need \nto do is look at this budget to find it. They don't save Social \nSecurity. They put it in a lockbox for 1 year. They have language that \nmandates that the Social Security surplus be used only for the payment \nof Social Security benefits, retirement security, or to reduce the \nFederal debt.\n  What does retirement security mean? It could mean anything. You could \nargue you give a tax cut to someone earning over $300,000, that will \nhelp him with his retirement. Not only that, if we want to break out of \nthe lockbox, it looks to me like they only need 51 votes to do it. They \ndon't save Social Security. They do nothing for Medicare.\n  I was surprised to hear my chairman say, ``Without doing anything, \nthe economy is good, Medicare is doing great.'' Medicare needs \nattention. We are living longer--that is the good news; the bad news is \nthere are strains on Medicare. We should have put money into that \nprogram.\n  My chairman was right, we never offered a Democratic alternative \nbudget. We had amendments on every one of these issues. My ranking \nmember offered them on every one of these issues. We know where we \nstand. We said we want Medicare funding from the surplus put into a \nlockbox, too, because we think Medicare, as well as Social Security, \nare safety net issues that need to be addressed.\n  The point is they don't do in this budget what they should do for \nSocial Security and Medicare. They don't do in this budget what they \nshould do for working men and women. They don't do anything for the \nenvironment.\n  Senator Chafee, a Republican Senator, had his language dropped. Yes, \nthey put $200 million in from one account to another but the language \nthat directing that the money be used for land and water conservation \nstateside spending was dropped. There is no instruction here.\n  Senator Johnson, who will be speaking shortly, and I worked together \non a very important amendment to set up mandatory spending for the \nenvironment, for a land and water conservation fund, for the purchase \nof open space. It was bipartisan, adopted in the committee and was \ndropped in the conference.\n  I point out Senator Murkowski has a bill on this matter, I have a \nbill on this matter, several other Republicans and Democrats have bills \non this matter. We were simply making room for the environment in this \nbudget and it is gone. This is a roadmap that I do not think is a good \nroadmap for America today. I am very sorry to stand here and say that \nbecause I believed we had an opportunity to do some very good things \nbecause we are on such strong fiscal ground. We had a chance to do some \nimportant things. We are going to see huge cuts in domestic spending as \nthese numbers go over to appropriations. They are hidden in this budget \nright now, but as soon as you get over to appropriations it is going to \nbe very, very difficult. There will be cuts in domestic priorities.\n\n  I will vote against this budget. We had an opportunity to work \ntogether; we didn't do it. We didn't save Social Security, we didn't \nsave Medicare, we didn't talk about the real needs in education, we \nturned our back on the environment. This is a budget that I do not \nbelieve the American people will support.\n  I don't hear the American people saying give tax breaks to the people \nwho earn over $300,000, $500,000 or $1 million a year. I don't hear \nthem saying that. Do you know what I hear them saying--keep up fiscal \nresponsibility and give help to the people who really need that help so \nthey can climb up that economic ladder and this country can truly be \nall it can be.\n  I yield back my time to Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request \nthat the list of those who are going to speak on the budget be \nidentified as follows: Senator Wellstone, Senator Gorton, Senator \nHutchison, Senator Johnson, and Senator Lautenberg.\n  Once these Senators have spoken, I ask unanimous consent that all \ndebate time on the pending conference report be yielded back. I ask \nfurther consent that the vote occur on adoption of the conference \nreport at 2 p.m. today. I include in that unanimous consent request \nthat after those Senators have spoken, the request then include a \nperiod of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield such time as needed to the Senator from South \nDakota, up to a maximum of 15 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg for his \nleadership on this budget resolution. As a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, it has been an honor and, I have to say, also, \nunfortunately, somewhat of a frustration to have participated in this \nprocess in the committee and to see now what has come to the floor.\n  I am saddened that what could have been a watershed opportunity for \nthe American people--to lay out a budget that makes sense, which \nestablishes the proper priorities for the coming years--apparently is \ngoing to be missed and profoundly missed in a very unfortunate way.\n  It is remarkable how we arrived at this point. When I first came to \nthe Congress as a Member of the other body some 12 or 13 years ago, I \nhad some doubts that I would ever see the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nthe fall of the Berlin Wall, or debate how to utilize a Federal budget \nsurplus, but here we are. We do have that opportunity, last year having \nbeen a surplus year, at least under a unified budget. And this year, \nwhich ends September 30, the projections are that we will be at least \n$130 billion in the black for this coming fiscal year. Again, let me be \nclear that in the unified budget, all of those surplus dollars are \nattributable to Social\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\nSecurity, lest anyone gets too carried away about spending the \nsurpluses that are here in the near term.\n\n  It seems to me that throughout this debate that there are four \nprinciples that ought to be followed as we craft a roadmap for where we \ngo from here, from this fork in the road that we thankfully have come \nto. This crossroads follows on the heels of the 1993 budget agreement \nand was supplemented by the 1997 budget agreement, both of which I \nvoted for. It seems to me we ought first protect Social Security and \nMedicare--not just Social Security, but protect them both.\n  It seems to me that a significant portion of resources that we come \ninto ought to be used to pay down already-existing debt. When Jimmy \nCarter concluded his Presidency, this Nation had an accumulated debt of \naround $1 trillion. That exploded to $5.5 trillion, mostly through the \nborrow-and-spend policies of the 1980s. Now we have an obligation to \npay that debt down, reduce debt service, reduce the cost of money, and \nfree up resources for the private sector so buying a house, buying a \ncar, sending a kid to college, and expanding a business become more \naffordable.\n  Third, we do need to look at tax relief, but we need to do so in a \ncareful manner. We should not commit dollars that we do not have, those \nthat are only projected far, far into the future. There is talk on this \nfloor about how we are going to spend surpluses available to us 15 \nyears down the road, surpluses of massive proportions. We have seen in \nthe past what has happened with budget projections from both the OMB \nand CBO. We know the availability of those dollars may or may not \noccur. It seems to me a great deal of restraint ought to be used on the \npart of both political parties, for both spending and tax relief, when \nmaking plans premised on dollars that may or may not be available in \nthe future.\n  But I do believe over the near term we ought to try to design a \nbudget package that will provide some level of tax relief for people in \nthis country, primarily for middle-class and working families. There is \na very legitimate role to be played for a tax relief package, but it \ncan only be part of an overall strategy.\n  Last of the four items that I think we need to take into \nconsideration are the key investments that need to be made. I think the \nAmerican people feel the same way. The American people want some tax \nrelief, but they also want to see Social Security and Medicare \nprotected. They also want to do some things for our schools, \nenvironment, kids, and communities. It is that kind of balanced agenda \nthat makes some sense. To repudiate the ability to make the key \ninvestments that need to be made, I think, reflects an ideological \norientation to this budget that is far away from where the American \npeople are.\n  There is little wonder in my mind, frankly, why poll after poll shows \nthe American people overwhelmingly rejecting what has become the \nRepublican budget agenda in the House and the Senate. The Republican \nagenda is lopsided--not balanced, thoughtful, or progressive--and it \ndoes not do the things the American people want to see happen. All of \nthe money essentially goes toward tax relief, aside from an increase in \ndefense and a couple of other assorted very narrow increases. Because \nof this budgeting, we are going to wind up by the year 2004, which is \nonly 5 years down the road, with cuts growing from 11 percent this year \nto some 27 percent. These are, in effect, shutdown types of cuts for \nprograms like Head Start and Meals on Wheels and toxic waste cleanup \nand for Women, Infants, and Children, and Border Patrol, not to mention \ncommunity health clinics, environmental initiatives, funding for our \nnational parks and rural development. All of these programs are at \ntremendous jeopardy because of the very one-sided, very lopsided, and, \nI think, unthoughtful approach that we are being presented on the floor \nof the Senate today.\n\n  On top of that, while there is some provision for an increase in \neducation funding in this budget resolution, it is far smaller than \nthat included in the Senate budget resolution; the increase of $2.6 \nbillion is now only $259 million for fiscal year 2000. This budget puts \nout of reach our ability to deal constructively with the need to \nrenovate and build new schools, to provide the numbers of new teachers \nwe need, and to supply the technology we need in our schools.\n  In my State of South Dakota we are seeing bond issue after bond issue \ngo down all across the State because people find they simply do not \nhave the resources to make the investments in school facilities that \nneed to be made. Yet we are walking away from what could be a very \nconstructive and commonsense partnership--where the decisionmaking is \nleft at the local school level but the financial partnership is among \nFederal, State, and local governments--that could make quality \neducational opportunities for our kids a realistic possibility in the \nnext century.\n  The situation is similar for child care. While the Senate accepted \nthe amendment of Senators Dodd and Jeffords that provided an additional \n$12.5 billion over 10 years for existing childcare and development \nblock grants, the conference report cuts that by $9.5 billion. So, \nagain, we are denied the ability over the long haul to make the \ninvestments needed, even in a block grant fashion. It leaves the \ndecisionmaking and flexibility to the States to invest in the kinds of \nprograms that I think every American sees need to be made for our \nkids--afterschool programs, day-care programs. These are the things we \nneed to do if we are going to invest in the minds of children so they \ncan go on to have successful lives and take care of their own needs.\n  I am pleased because the amendment that Senator Wellstone and I \noffered on the Senate floor, which would have resulted in a total \nincrease of $3 billion in VA health care funding and which was accepted \nhere, has been, for the most part, retained. This conference report \ncalls for a $2 billion level of increase. That is not as much as I \nwould like to see or Senator Wellstone would like to see. It is not \nwhat our veterans' groups would like to see. It is an improvement, \nhowever, over where this body was earlier. It will make a significant \npositive difference. We will come back and see what we can do in future \nyears to augment funding for veterans' health care. But I think getting \n$2 out of $3 billion when we started with zero is progress. It is a \nstep in the right direction, I would have to say.\n  I want to share with Senator Boxer my profound disappointment at the \ndeletion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Reserve Fund. This was \nan opportunity we had. We had bipartisan support in the Budget \nCommittee and bipartisan support on the floor of the Senate to have the \nopportunity to set aside offshore drilling resources to be utilized for \nthe benefit of the environment and our National Park System in this \ncountry. Yet we are going to be denied that opportunity because of the \ndeletion of that provision from this budget resolution. No matter how \nwe come together in future debates, authorizing legislation about \nreinvigorating our park system with some additional resources from oil \nrevenues, we are not going to have the opportunity to be as effective \nas we could have been. So I am disappointed about that portion of the \nconference report as well.\n  It is remarkable that we arrived at this point where we can talk \nabout surpluses. There are many people who are no longer with us \nbecause they voted, with courage and with integrity, for past budget-\nbalancing legislation--most notably the 1993 budget agreement that \npassed with no support from any Republican in either the House or the \nSenate. A great many Democrats lost their seats because of that vote. \nYet now we find ourselves not with the $292 billion annual deficit that \nthis country had 6 years ago but with a $131 billion surplus.\n\n  President Bush, to his credit, supported the 1990 budget agreement. I \nhave to say, in all candor, a contributing factor to his loss of the \nPresidency was the fact that he supported the precursor to our 1993 \nbudget agreement. Again, in politics sometimes, no good deed goes \nunpunished, and that has been the case with some of our past budget \nlegislation.\n  I will have to say now we are at this watershed opportunity. There \nare some positive provisions in the budget resolution, and I applaud \nthe sponsors for that. I applaud Senator Domenici for that. But there \nare so many missed opportunities; a roadmap to where the\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nAmerican people want to go simply is not there. This is not a \nRepublican or Democrat issue. I think commonsense, moderate, mainstream \nAmericans know where they want to go--providing some tax relief but \nalso paying down some debt; making key investments in our kids, our \ncommunities, and our schools. Those opportunities, unfortunately, in \nthis roadmap are lost.\n  I yield such time as I may have.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as the majority \nhas as I may utilize.\n  Mr. President, here in the Congress of the United States, this April \n15 can be a day for modest congratulations for us. We will have passed \na budget resolution on the day mandated by the Budget Act for only the \nsecond time in more than 2 decades.\n  Moreover, we will be adopting a budget resolution that balances the \nbudget not only for the 1 year in which it is firmly binding, fiscal \nyear 2000, but we hope for at least a decade to come.\n  We will be adopting a budget resolution that does more to secure the \nfuture of our Social Security safety net than has any budget resolution \nsince the Budget Act itself was passed, first, by assuring that the \nentire Social Security surplus is used to pay down the debt and not to \nbe spent on a wide range of other matters, as was recommended by the \nPresident's budget itself and, second, by calling for a lockbox to see \nto it that the condition of preventing the Social Security surplus \nbeing used for any other purpose is permanent and not temporary only.\n  Second, this budget resolution offers real tax relief to the American \npeople. In that connection, it is especially appropriate that we will \nbe adopting this budget resolution on time.\n  Today, of course, is tax day. April 15 is the day that the complexity \nand incomprehensibility of our mammoth Federal Tax Code hits home to \nalmost every American. Today, my constituents in Washington State and, \nof course, citizens all across the United States rush to the post \noffice, as I did myself this morning, to get their income tax \npostmarked on time.\n  I think it is appropriate to address my own hopes and the intentions \nof this budget resolution that this Congress will act on tax relief and \nperhaps begin to look forward to an even more fundamental tax reform.\n  Families whom I represent in the Northwest deserve a rebate from the \nFederal budget surplus in the form of tax relief, allowing them to \ndecide how best to use their hard-earned dollars. I also believe that \nit is time to scrap the current Federal income tax code as being far \ntoo complicated, too burdensome, and too unfair.\n  Let me discuss for a few moments the reasons for providing tax relief \nto American taxpayers. I would like to share with the Senate a few \ntelling facts about the nature of that tax burden today.\n  A recent Congressional Research Service study found that an average \nAmerican family will pay $5,370 more in taxes over the course of the \nnext 10 years than the Federal Government needs to operate under the \nbudget resolution that we adopted just a year ago and this even after \nassuring that all our obligations to Social Security and Medicare have \nbeen met.\n  Next, the Independent Tax Foundation found that this year Americans \non average will work 129 days to pay off their total tax bill imposed \nat Federal, State, and local levels, while my Washington State \ntaxpayers will have to work even longer, 132 days on average.\n  Third, American workers now pay more in Federal, State, and local \ntaxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined.\n  And fourth, the Federal Government collects more in taxes than ever \nbefore, currently nearly 21 percent of America's gross domestic \nproduct, the highest percentage since World War II.\n  These are simply facts, not arguments. Reasonable people can agree \nthat Americans are having to turn over too much of their hard-earned \ndollars in taxes. Tax relief is not a question of need, it is a \nquestion of justice. Is it right and just for citizens from Wenatchee \nto Woodinville to Walla Walla to work more than a third of the year \njust to pay their taxes? I think not.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton and his Vice President Gore proposed \nin their budget to increase--that is right, a net increase in taxes of \n$96 billion over the next 10 years. You might wonder why a President \nand Vice President want to raise taxes when we already have the highest \nburden since World War II. Why do they want to raise taxes when the \nFederal budget is operating in a surplus? It should be no surprise \nconsidering that ever since they were sworn into office in 1993, they \nhave not proposed a net tax cut. In spite of the fact that President \nClinton and Vice President Gore campaigned in 1992 on the promise of a \nmiddle-class tax cut, they ignored that promise and promptly increased \ntaxes by as much as any administration in the history of the United \nStates.\n\n  Why? It is very simple. In his State of the Union Address, President \nClinton proposed 77 new Federal programs. Why does this administration \nbelieve that the Government needs to spend more money on so many new \nprograms? Because the President and the Vice President do not trust the \nAmerican people to spend their own money wisely. They believe that they \ncan spend it better.\n  I disagree. To the taxpayers in towns across my State and across the \nUnited States, I say that the Republicans who are adopting this budget \ndo so because they trust you and your family and your neighbors better \nto spend your own money on your own needs and priorities than \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, will ever be able to do.\n  This is one reason that I so strongly favor this budget. This budget \nsets aside every penny of the Federal budget surplus generated from \nSocial Security into a lockbox for the purpose of strengthening that \nSocial Security system for the future, but it provides that we will \nreturn any additional surpluses in the form of tax reductions, up to \n$142 billion over the next 5 years and $778 billion over ten years, to \nthe people who have paid those taxes.\n  What form of tax relief are we talking about? I must confess that I \ndo not know. Congress will debate that later this year. Four major \nproposals, however, are: eliminating the marriage tax penalty, ending \nor reducing the death tax, reducing capital gains taxes, and an across-\nthe-board cut in income tax rates.\n  While I certainly am not able to predict what the final tax relief \nbill will look like, I hope that it will include some elements of all \nfour of these proposals. But the important point is that this budget \nresolution allows that debate to take place, allows the Congress to \npermit the American people to spend their own money, return it to them \nin the form of tax relief, as against the proposal of the President and \nthe Vice President to increase taxes so that they can determine where \nthat money is spent.\n  I must also say, incidentally, at least that I am every bit as \ncommitted to replacing our current Federal income tax code as I am to \nreducing that tax burden. It is time to scrap it. It is too \ncomplicated, too burdensome, too unfair. We need to focus our attention \nin Congress on developing an alternative. That alternative needs to be \nfair, simple, uniform and consistent. It is that support on my part \nthat has led me to cosponsor the Tax Code Termination Act. The bill \nwould sunset the current income tax code, except for those funding \nmechanisms for Social Security and Medicare, by December 31 of the year \n2002. It would require a simple majority vote by Congress to reinstate \nthe current code if agreement on a replacement code cannot be reached. \nBut the real points are two: It makes absolutely certain the need to \nscrap the current Tax Code, and it will act as a catalyst to jump-start \ndebate on a new one.\n  Mr. President, Americans deserve a Tax Code they can understand and \npredict. Today, about the only thing Americans can predict about the \nTax Code is that they will send a big check off to Uncle Sam by April \n15, and about the only thing they understand is that the IRS will find \nthem if they do not.\n  This should change, and it is why I am working to help pass a tax \nrelief bill and why I will be working in favor of a new Federal Tax \nCode that is fair, simple, uniform, and consistent. But a true debate \non tax relief, a chance to\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nsay exactly what it is we want, depends on a budget resolution which \ncalls for or requires it.\n  This budget resolution does so, Mr. President. This budget resolution \nis on time. This budget resolution says to the American people: We will \nsecure Social Security for you; we will balance the budget so the \neconomy can keep growing; but the money that is not needed to meet the \nrequirements of the agreements that we made a year ago or 2 years ago \nis going to be returned to you in the form of tax relief.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I think what I will do is pick up on the comments of my colleague \nfrom Washington because otherwise you just come to the floor and you \nhave something that is well rehearsed; and it is better, I think, to \nrespond to what other Senators have said. That makes for more of a \ndebate, though I find it frustrating to speak on the floor of the \nSenate because it is sometimes hard to engage in debate.\n  On the question of spending money more wisely, the tax cuts that my \ncolleague talks about, he mentioned the first 5 years, $143 billion \nover 5 years. It will be $778 billion over 10 years. It is backloaded. \nIt is really not what I would actually call fiscally responsible or \nvery conservative.\n  The theory is to get the money back to the people. ``You can spend it \nmore wisely.'' Here is my question. I do not know about Illinois, but \nin the State of Minnesota, only 35 percent of senior citizens, 35 \npercent of Medicare recipients--there are probably close to 700,000 \nMedicare recipients in our State--have any prescription drug benefit \ncoverage at all, only 35 percent.\n  It is not uncommon to talk to an elderly woman or a couple and find \nthat they are spending up to 30, 40 percent of their monthly budget \njust on prescription drugs. They cannot afford it. So we have a budget \nresolution here that says to the senior citizens in Minnesota, ``Spend \nyour money more wisely. If you can't afford prescription drug costs, \nspend your money more wisely.'' There is a disconnect here. This is why \nthis Republican budget resolution is going to be in big-time trouble \nwith people in this country. It does not make any sense to people.\n  To senior citizens in Minnesota, this budget resolution says, ``When \nit comes to prescription drug costs that put you under, spend your \nmoney more wisely.'' When it comes to family farmers who have been \nbuffeted about, and many of them destroyed by the ``freedom to fail'' \nbill--a great bill for multinational corporations, a terrible bill for \nfamily farmers--when we come to the floor and say we have to get farm \nincome up, we have to take the cap off the loan rate, and then it gets \nscored by CBO, we are told we cannot afford to do it. The Republican \nresponse to the family farmers in Minnesota who are going under is, \n``Spend your money more wisely, because we're going to give you a tax \ncut that will enable you to spend your money more wisely,'' while \npeople go under.\n  Mr. President, I meet families in Minnesota and families all across \nthe country when I get a chance to travel. And one of their top issues, \none of the most important issues they have, is affordable child care. \nIt is a huge issue, not just for low-income, not just working-income; I \nam talking middle-income families. He is 30; she is 28; they have two \nchildren. It costs them $12,000, $13,000 a year for child care--not to \nmention the fact that way too high a percentage of these child-care \ncenters really are not that great. Some of them are downright \ndangerous. The care is not necessarily developmental child care, and \nthe people who work there are severely underpaid.\n  So what are we saying to working families in our country, in \nMinnesota, in New Jersey, or in Illinois, who can't afford child care? \nWe are saying, ``Spend your money more wisely.'' I have news for you: \nFor a typical family, a young couple making $35,000 a year, with \n$12,000 child care expenses, this does not work.\n\n  What about for the children? What about for the children? I am glad \nto hear of my colleague's concern for Social Security. And I am glad to \nhear that the Democrats are also focused on Medicare, unlike my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. But in all due respect, it \nis our children who are going to be in the next century. The next \nmillennium is going to belong to our children. And we have close to one \nout of every four children under the age of 3 growing up poor in our \ncountry, and one out of two children of color under the age of 3 \ngrowing up poor in our country today; and because of this budget \nresolution, with all of these tax cuts and all of these caps, we are \ngoing to see a lot of these domestic programs taking a hit of about $43 \nbillion.\n  So what are we saying? We are going to cut Head Start? We are going \nto cut child nutrition programs? We are going to cut the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program? Where are we going to cut? I do not \nunderstand the distorted priorities of this budget resolution. There is \nan old Yiddish proverb that says: ``You can't dance at two weddings at \nthe same time.'' You can't have all of these backloaded tax cuts, the \nvast majority of which are going to flow to people with very high \nincomes--that has always been the record of my Republican colleagues--\nand make your investment in the Pentagon, and do what you say you are \ngoing to do for Social Security, and at the same time make any \ninvestment in the health and skills and intellect and character of \nchildren. We are going to cut programs for children.\n  By the way, as to ``Spend your money wisely,'' do not tell some child \nwho is poor--the poverty being involuntary--that he or she should spend \ntheir money more wisely. They do not have any money to spend wisely. I \ndoubt whether we are going to cut the National Institutes of Health \nbudget, but we are certainly not going to increase it.\n  So to my colleague, who is no longer on the floor, talking about \n``Spend your money wisely,'' you say to people who are struggling with \nAlzheimer's or breast cancer or Parkinson's disease or diabetes--and I \ncan list many other illnesses as well--all sorts of people come to \nWashington, and they try to get more money spent for research for the \ncure to these diseases, to the point where we have one group of people \nstruggling with an illness pitted against another group of people \nstruggling with an illness. It is just horrible. And we are saying to \nthese people, we are going to have these backloaded tax cuts over the \nnext 10 years--``Spend your money more wisely.''\n  In all due respect, I think, even though the Chair of the Budget \nCommittee is one of the Senators whom I have the most respect for--he \nis really kind of my working partner when it comes to the mental health \nwork--this budget resolution and the priorities of this budget \nresolution are not consistent with what I would call the sort of basic \ncore values of the American people, of people in this country, of \npeople in Minnesota.\n  People want to see some investment in children. They do not want to \nsee Head Start cut. They do not want to see WIC cut. They do not want \nto see backloaded tax cuts over the next 10 years, most of it going to \nhigh-income, wealthy people. And people get it; they know that we have \nto be fiscally responsible. They want the deficits gone. They want to \nsee us focus on Social Security to make sure it is solvent. We know we \nabsolutely should be committed to Medicare. And then with what we have, \nwe ought to make the kind of investments that make sense for our \nNation.\n  Where do we want to be in the year 2050? If you want to have a \nsolvent Social Security system, then you want to have the children who \nare small today as adults who are independent, productive, highly \ntrained, morally caring men and women. And you are not going to get \nthere if you are going to leave one-fourth of the children of America \nbehind.\n  Where is the investment in these children? Where is the investment in \nthese families? Where do we want to be in the year 2050? On every \nsingle issue I can think of, Social Security, Medicare, our country \ndoing well in the international economy, economic performance, economic \ngrowth, reducing crime, reducing violence, you would want to make sure \nthat we do our very best by all of our children in the United States of \nAmerica. And you know what? This budget resolution fails that test, and \ntherefore I will vote against it.\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, understanding the order, I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak on the budget for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the budget resolution. I extend my sincere congratulations to \nthe chairman of our Budget Committee for the work that he and that \ncommittee have so successfully completed in the last number of weeks. \nIn fact, I am extremely pleased with where we are as a Senate at this \nmoment in time.\n  Many of our constituents around the country were frustrated as the \nSenate convened this year to start with an impeachment process of the \nPresident, fearing that we would be so bogged down in that that we \nwould not get to the work of our people and get to the work of \nGovernment and to processes like the budget resolution.\n  Quite the opposite has happened. The Senate responded in a timely and \nconstitutionally proper manner to the impeachment issue and then moved \nrapidly into its work. As a result, we are here today voting on a \nbudget resolution which will be adopted as a conference report. It will \nbe the second earliest date of adoption of a budget resolution in the \n23 years of the Budget Act. That is why I think the chairman of our \nBudget Committee deserves the congratulations of the Senate and why the \nAmerican people ought to at least be assured that we are here and at \nwork and doing what we should be doing in behalf of them to make sure \ntheir Government responds appropriately to the needs of all of our \ntaxpayers.\n  This budget demonstrates that we can and should have a balanced \nfiscal program that addresses our Nation's major priorities. If we and \nfuture Congresses and the President follow the plan that is now laid \nbefore us in this budget resolution, we will pay down the public debt. \nThere will be $463 billion more in debt reduction than the President's \nbudget offered us over the next 10 years.\n  I have had the privilege of serving in Congress for a number of \nyears. I tell my colleagues, I have watched the debt grow, and I voted \nagainst most of that growth. Today to be able to vote for debt \nreduction is a very positive move for this Congress and laying the \ncourse for future Congresses to do the same. One-half of the debt held \nby the public can be paid off in the next decade if we follow the \ngeneral outlines of the budget that Senator Domenici has put before us. \nWe will make sure Social Security revenues are reserved exclusively for \nSocial Security benefits. We will safeguard the current Social Security \nsystem for today's seniors and for those who plan to retire in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I, like you, have just returned from my State and from \nthe Easter recess. While I was there, I held what I think is the \nbeginning of a series of town meetings that I will hold across the \nState on Social Security and its need for modernization. I invited \nseniors in high school and senior citizens to attend, and they did in \nlarge numbers. I was extremely pleased not only by their turnout but by \ntheir willingness to listen and react and give me ideas about what they \nsee the Social Security system being and what it ought to be.\n  I told them that we, by our budget here and by balancing the budget \nand producing surpluses, are providing the country with a generational \nopportunity to maintain a strong Social Security system while at the \nsame time offering a modernization package that can take young people \nentering the workforce and paying Social Security through a lifetime of \ndeveloping an annuity program that would be much like a positive \nretirement program that they could take with them when they retired and \nwould be substantially more than if they were in the current Social \nSecurity system. More importantly, it would not have to address \nsubstantial tax increases in Social Security in the outyears beyond \n2034 and 2035.\n  So for the first time since 1960, the budget will be balanced without \ncounting Social Security surpluses. We will provide a reasonable and \nnecessary amount for tax relief for working Americans and their \nfamilies. You heard the Senator from Washington and others in just the \nlast few hours talk about an American taxpayer that is paying his or \nher taxes today, being taxed at the highest level ever in the history \nof our country. We are turning that around.\n  I am pleased to be able to be here on the floor today, on a day when \nmost people are going to the post office to pay their taxes, or at \nleast to file their tax returns, to say that we are going to change \nsome of that. While this is a tax cut, I also agree with my colleague \nfrom Washington, Senator Gorton, that we ought to be looking at tax \nreform in the near future that will simplify the Tax Code and make it \nmuch less intimidating than it is today to all of us; those who are \nrelatively sophisticated and those who are less sophisticated find it \nall very intimidating and difficult to comply with.\n  All tax relief will be provided out of the onbudget surplus, that is, \nthe non-Social Security surplus. And $778 billion over 10 years sounds \nlike a lot of tax relief, but it is a tax reduction of less than 3.5 \npercent. So when some of our colleagues come running to the floor \nwringing their hands about giving tax breaks when we ought to be \nspending all this money, as the President wants to do for new programs, \nlet me say to them that we are only offering a 3.5-percent tax \nreduction against the highest taxes in the history of our country, and \nwe are offering it over a 10-year period. Frankly, it is nowhere near \nwhat I hoped it would be, but it clearly moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  This budget continues. The American people demanded fiscal discipline \nand responsibility in 1994 when they changed the character and culture \nof the Congress and they said quit building deficits and get your \nfiscal house in order and control the size of Government. So we abide \nby the budget caps adopted in 1997 in a bipartisan balanced budget \nagreement. It continues the spending restraints we began in 1995, a \nproduct of that 1994 election and the 1994 Congress--the first \nRepublican Congress in 40 years, which has helped produce the balanced \nbudget and the projected surpluses.\n  This budget fully funds and protects the solvency of Medicare. In \nthat respect, it stands in clear contrast to what the President has \nproposed, which actually proposed to cut Medicare funding and promised \nonly General Treasury IOUs for the future. I am amazed that that has \nmissed the attention of the press and a lot of the American people \nsince our President proposed it. But it really was a first-class shell \ngame, probably one of the best I have seen produced by this \nadministration, when they said they were doing one thing when, in fact, \nthey were actually doing another.\n  To hand this next generation a whole fist full of IOUs after mounting \nthe hugest debt in the history of our country just doesn't make a lot \nof sense. So we are not doing that in this budget. We won't do that. It \nwould not be fair, and most important, it would not be responsible. Of \ncourse, Medicare still needs the attention in the long term, and \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats alike--have stepped up and said we \nought to do so. Democrat Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Democrat \nSenator Breaux of Louisiana worked hard to work with us on a \nbipartisan, long-term Medicare plan, and it is necessary. Congress \nought not to go home this year without doing it. But my guess is that \nwe will because of the politics of it. That should not happen.\n\n  The fact that a bipartisan Medicare Commission broke down because the \nPresident's appointees would not walk up to the line and do what was \nright--I am not sure why, but my guess is they would like to perpetrate \nanother ``medi-scare'' as a tactic going into the next political cycle. \nIt is pretty unconscionable that anybody would want to do that. But \nthere is really no other explanation for why they failed to do what had \nto be done because those of us who face the electorate and understand \nthe complications of Medicare\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\nstepped to that line and said reform is necessary and offered a reform \npackage, Democrat and Republican alike. I have mentioned several of \nthose Democrats. So that work is yet to be done. Medicare reform is yet \nto be dealt with, and I hope we can do it because it is necessary.\n  This budget strengthens America's defense forces too long neglected \nunder this administration. Yet, this is an administration that has used \nour defense forces more than nearly any other President in a peacetime \nera. It is time that we make sure that America's sons and daughters who \nput themselves in harm's way in the protection of our Nation have their \ninterests served. When I speak of their interests being served, I mean \nmaking sure that we back them up with equipment and technology, \ncompensate them adequately, and give them the dignified quality of life \nthat anybody in that service deserves. This budget meets the challenges \nof the 21st century with positive initiatives in agriculture, child \ncare, and education.\n  What I am telling you, Mr. President, is I think this is a pretty \ndarn good budget. It is sound and it is a conservative budget. It \nrecognizes the value of balancing, and it recognizes the reward to the \ntaxpayers that a balanced budget ought to offer. It is good for the \neconomic security of the American family by recognizing that we are \ngoing to let them keep some of their hard-earned dollars instead of \ncycling them to Washington and try to get them back.\n  All of the money that we spend here comes from somebody's hard work, \nsomebody who gets up every morning bright and early and goes to work \nand works hard for 8, 10, 12 hours a day. They willingly pay a very \nlarge chunk of their income to Government. Now that we have balanced \nthe budget, why should we be chasing new Government programs, or bigger \nGovernment programs, or programs that ultimately take freedom away from \npeople and their choice? Why should we not be rewarding the taxpayer by \nsaying that we have enough and we are going to send some of it back to \nyou, and we are not going to take it away from you in the future, \nunless we come to you and ask you for it because there truly is a \nnational need. That is the way good Government works and, very frankly, \nI think this is a pretty good Government budget. I strongly support it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with us for it, and I urge my colleagues \nto work with the Finance Committee and with the Senate to devise a tax \npackage that is fair and equitable across the board, that recognizes \nissues such as the marriage penalty, that recognizes an issue such as \nsmall family business owners who grow too old to operate their business \nand want to pass it through to their children and are being denied that \nbecause the children would have to sell it to pay the taxes on it.\n  That is a great tragedy in the American dream--how our Government \never got crosswise with the idea of a family being able to pass down \nthrough the generations a business that they have built and has grown \nover the years and now have to sell to pay the inheritance tax, the \ndeath tax.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that if it doesn't move in the family and it \nis simply sold at the end of a generation, it ought not to receive some \ntax. But when we are talking small, privately held businesses, farms \nand ranches, Main Street small businesses that make our country work so \nwell, and then find out that mom and dad can't hand it to a son or \ndaughter without the Government taking nearly all of it, or the son and \ndaughter then spending their lifetime to buy it back, frankly, that is \nwrong. I and others have worked a long time to reduce the death tax. We \nhave been able to do some of that. Why don't we just eliminate it, or \ndeal with it in a way which says that if that asset moves out to be \nsold in the marketplace as an asset for sale then it comes under the \nnormal tax of the income of an individual with the proper \nconsiderations against depreciation and all of that? That would be \nfair. That would be just. We should deal with our countrymen in a way \nthat says we recognize that those who work for the American dream ought \nto be allowed to pass that dream forward to the next generation. That \nis one of those kinds of tax reforms I hope we can get at this year.\n\n  There are a good many others that our colleagues are working on and \nthat will be embodied in the tax relief package that is placed in this \nto this budget resolution.\n  Once again, let me praise the chairman of our Budget Committee, and \nthat committee and the will of the Republican Congress that says that a \nbalanced budget is something we will keep and continue to work for and \nthat surpluses should be handed back as rewards to the American \ntaxpayer instead of spent. That is what this budget does. I am proud to \nhave been a part of it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe everyone knows that today is \ntax day in America. I think we have been talking about it. And I think \nit is very appropriate that we have a budget resolution on the floor \ntoday that we can say will give tax relief because that is set aside in \nthis budget.\n  The tax burden on Americans is too high. The average American family \npays 38 percent of its income in taxes to some government--the Federal \nGovernment, the State government, and the local government. As a \npercentage of gross domestic product, taxes are higher today than they \nwere at any time in this country since World War II.\n  That is why the budget resolution that we are going to pass is \nsignificant. The American people should know that on April 15 this \nCongress is going to pass a plan that provides a $770 billion tax cut \nover the next 10 years. There couldn't be a clearer message from this \nCongress about what our priorities are, and that is tax relief for \nhard-working American families.\n  There are some, including the President, who oppose our plan. They \nsay that Washington will save money for working Americans. But we know \nthat is not going to happen. We have heard that before. And we know \nthat we haven't had a budget surplus nor tax cut in this country--until \nthis Republican Congress was elected--for 40 years. So we know who \ncares about tax cuts for the American family.\n  I think we have chosen the right course. Giving the extra money to \nthe Government would not ever get it back to the people. But we believe \nthat people who earn the money have the right to it. And that is why we \nwill have a tax bill when this budget is passed.\n  There are many tax proposals that come before the Senate, many of \nwhich I support. Certainly reducing capital gains taxes would be good \nfor our country. Reducing or eliminating the estate taxes would be good \nfor this country; and across-the-board tax relief, 10 percent across \nthe board, so that when you are writing your check today, you can just \ntake 10 percent of the check you wrote and know that would not be in \nyour tax bill next year and you would be able to spend that money the \nway you think it is best for your family.\n  But there is one that is my priority, and it is to eliminate what I \nthink is the worst transgression we have in our Tax Code. That is the \nmarriage tax penalty. Right now, 21 million American families pay up to \n$1,400 on average more just because they are married. So we say to \npeople, you have to choose between love and money in our country.\n  If you want to get married, start a family, and build up your savings \nto make a downpayment on a new home, we will make you $1,400 less able \nto do that. That is a lot of money to the hard-working couples who are \nhardest hit by this tax.\n  I have introduced legislation to eliminate this penalty. We could \nallow couples to split their incomes evenly or we could double the \nstandard exemption to widen the tax brackets for married couples so \nthey match those of single filers. We could also let people choose if \nit is better for them to file as singles or as married couples. That \nway, no one would pay a penalty for getting married. I hope it will be \nour highest priority with the tax cuts that are provided in this \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\n  I read in USA Today an op-ed piece this morning on the marriage tax \npenalty. Their contention is that this only affects the higher-income \ncouples. They say that the bulk of those suffering this marriage tax \npenalty are dual-income families at the middle-income level, $50,000. I \nhave a legislative correspondent in my office and his combined family \nincome is $50,000. He makes about $25,000 and his wife must work for \nthem to be able to make ends meet. She makes about $25,000. They are a \nyoung couple. I don't think that people who make $25,000 a year are \nwealthy, and I most certainly think if they have to have two incomes in \norder to make ends meet that we are not increasing the standard of \nliving in this country. To go forward and say two people who make \n$25,000 a year should owe Uncle Sam $1,400 more, I think is absolutely \nwrong, particularly a young couple that is trying to get started, to \nmake a downpayment to buy a home.\n  I hope we can correct this inequity. I think two-income earners at \nthe $25,000 level deserve some help. I am going to try to get it for \nthem.\n  This is a red letter day. This is the day that we see how much it \ncosts for us to support government. All of us want to do our fair \nshare. I would never say we should have no taxes because we do enjoy \ngood service--hopefully--for the taxes that we pay. However, 38 percent \nof a person's income in taxes is hard to explain. It is hard to explain \nthat you are getting that much service for your dollars. I think you \ncould get a lot less service and a lot more choice if we lower the \ntaxes for everyone in this country so that hard-working Americans could \nsee the benefits of working harder and doing better. That is the \nAmerican dream. That is what made this country great--that we would say \nto people, if you work harder you can do better and you can give a \nlittle more to your family or your children. That is why adding on some \nof these taxes is so important.\n  Today, we are going to pass a budget resolution that will do that, \nthat will say to the hard-working American that help is on the way. I \njust hope we can come to terms with the President so that we will be \nable to pass a tax bill that really will go to the hard-working \nAmerican who is struggling to make ends meet.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Domenici and Senator \nLautenberg for putting this budget resolution forth. I think it is a \ngood one. It is a responsible spending of our hard-earned tax dollars. \nMost important, on tax day, I hope people realize that we are going to \ntry to cut that burden. This budget resolution is a start in the right \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are coming to ``H'' hour here. That \nis not happy hour, as far as I am concerned. I can think of other words \nthat start with an H--like horrific, horrendous, horrible, hurtful--but \nI won't use that vocabulary. I will just infer it.\n  The occupant of the Chair has been in government for some time, and I \nam sure he has seen it from a different perspective. We see good people \nsincerely believing in what they are doing at odds with one another, in \nsuch contrasting views that it is hard to reconcile the difference of \nwhat is and what isn't the reality. This is no suggestion of \nprevarication or fabrication. I am not talking about that. I know there \nis genuine belief.\n  I differ sharply with my friends and colleagues on the other side \nregarding this budget. Few people have I more respect for than the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. Boy, we have some \nscraps. They are really good ones. The fact of the matter is, he is a \nbright guy. He understands a budget as few here do. He is one of the \nfew Senators who has to teach his staff what it is all about. That is \nintended to be a joke.\n  The rest of us do it differently. I hope the public doesn't take that \ntoo seriously, Mr. President.\n  The fact of the matter is Senator Domenici very well knows \n``budgeteering,'' but I think in this case it is fair to say there is \nan error in the approach. I think the policy as proposed by the budget \nconference report is fiscally dangerous. I think if we go the way it \nappears that we will go, we could be approaching in the not-too-distant \nfuture a shutdown of the Government. Everybody who has been around for \nany length of time remembers how painful the last shutdown was: People \nwere not getting Social Security checks, veterans' benefits were not \nbeing paid, services people count on for their everyday existence were \njust unavailable. Other matters that seemed to be routine, such as \nentrances to national parks, families planning for a year to visit one \nof our national parks and finding out they were closed. Became \nimportant. Airplanes, trains, buses, cars--all that planning, gone.\n  I predict we are going to be playing Russian roulette to see who \npulls the trigger on whether or not we have a Government shutdown \nbecause this budget ``ain't for real,'' to use the language, when we \nlook at what happens as a result of the intent to give a tax cut across \nthe board--a lot of it to wealthy people--and we know that some time \nago Senator Domenici said we were taking people's word for what the \nintention is without seeing it clearly spelled out.\n  Few people have as much authority around here as the distinguished \nSenator of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. He was speaking to \nReuters and he said he was very much in favor of using bigger than \nexpected budget surpluses to fund an across-the-board income tax of 10 \npercent or more. That is what Reuters reported:\n\n       ``I don't think it is too big,'' the Delaware Republican \n     said of the 10 percent income tax cut. ``If anything, I would \n     like to have it bigger.''\n\n  That is a pretty good indicator of where we are going. We are not \nprotecting Social Security in the way that we proposed here on the \nfloor of the Senate 2 days ago. We had a vote. I offered the amendment. \nI said no Social Security surplus shall be used for anything other than \nSocial Security, pure and simple.\n  The language is very direct. Mr. President, 98 people voted for it. \nWe had zero opposition, 98-0. It went to conference with the House. For \nthose who don't understand the arcane process here, the House and the \nSenate get together and have a conference to decide on what the various \nlegislative programs will be, we agree between us on a conference \nreport, and that is what we are voting on today.\n  As it happens, there is a Republican majority in the Senate. There is \na Republican majority in the House. As was noted, we, the Democrats, do \nnot participate. That is the game. It is understood. Next year, when we \nare in the majority, I expect to be more forgiving and perhaps we will \neven invite one of the Republicans to the conference meeting.\n  But the fact is, the product that came out is one that is a \nRepublican delivery. Make no mistake about it. And the consequence of \nthat is the bill we have in front of us with huge tax breaks for \nwealthy people. If you make $800,000, you will get a $20,000 tax break. \nIf you make $800,000, you get $20,000 worth of extra spending money. \nThat can buy, perhaps, a nice little boat or a downpayment on a summer \nhome or something of that nature. But the person who makes $38,000: \n$99, that is what he or she is going to get in terms of a tax break, \n$99. Don't spend it all in one night, friends, because it is supposed \nto last for a whole year. That is a tax cut: $99.\n  So when we look at it, it is obvious that we are not dealing with the \nneeds of the average working person, the hard-working person, a family \nmaking $38,000. We have heard the distinguished Senator from Texas talk \nabout a person working in her office who, with his spouse, put together \nan income of $50,000. That is not a lot of money today. Those are the \nkinds of folks to whom we have to be sensitive, to target tax cuts for \nthem and make sure the woman who wants to work can get some decent \nchild care and get some credit on her taxes for it. If you have an \nelderly parent who needs long-term care, get a tax credit for that; a\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\ntax credit for education; those are the kinds of tax credits or tax \nbreaks I think we ought to be giving. That is what the Democrats are \nproposing.\n\n  One of the things we are doing is proposing a tax cut that, in the \ncourse of 10 years, will be three-quarters of a trillion dollars--$750 \nbillion in round terms. The consequence of that, the result of that, is \ngoing to be that we will not have sufficient funds to pay for \nGovernment services. We will not have enough funds to pay for full \nstaff for the FBI. We will not have enough funds to pay for full \nstaffing of drug enforcement agents. We will not have enough funds to \ninclude 800,000 low-income women, infants, and children in programs for \nnutrition assistance.\n  We are not talking about extra money to take a trip to Europe; we are \ntalking about food. Mr. President, 800,000 of those people are going to \nlose assistance from the Government. The number of students in work/\nstudy programs decreases by 12,000 people. Head Start is designed to \ntake children who come from poverty-ridden homes to start to learn--\nHead Start. It is preschool. It is before they get to kindergarten or \nfirst grade. We are going to take away services for 100,000 children. \nFor those who need energy assistance, 600,000 low-income families could \nlose that energy assistance.\n  The FBI, the cut to the FBI could result in the reduction of 2,700 \nFBI agents. Mr. President, 73,000 summer jobs lost. And the list goes \non: More than 2,200 air traffic controller positions would be cut. I am \nvery active in air transportation matters and very concerned about \nwhere we go. Y2K, will we have the right kind of personnel to handle \nthe shift? Here we are, getting a budget in front of us. It is there in \nprint for everybody to see. It is designed by the majority. We are \nsaying that more than 2,200 air traffic controller positions would be \ncut and $255 million.\n  The IRS customer service: Today everybody is probably as angry at the \nIRS as can be, but when they see what it is we are paying for, we are \npaying for a country designed to give everybody opportunity. We are \ndoing better at it. Jobs are more available, there is low unemployment, \nour national health is better than it has ever been. That is what you \npay your taxes for. You do not pay it for some idle bureaucrat sitting \nin a chair. We pay for services. Do we get 100 cents on a dollar? \nProbably not. I ran a big corporation and it was a successful \ncorporation. We didn't get 100 cents' worth of value on every dollar \nthat we spent, but that's life.\n  Mr. President, we now are preparing ourselves to vote for a budget \nthat I think is shameful, that could be called a sham. Again, there is \nno accusation here of dishonesty or skullduggery. What it is is a \nmisinterpretation of what things are about. It is playing dice with our \nnational economy. It says if you give tax cuts, it is going to generate \nsomething else and it will be good for us. Baloney.\n  What happened under President Reagan's regime, when we gave tax cuts? \nI will tell you what we got for it. Some of the biggest debt this \ncountry ever had, and it grew by leaps and bounds. When President \nClinton took over, there was a $290 billion deficit in front of us, and \nthis year we are looking at a surplus of about $100 billion. Things \nhave changed materially in the 7 years that have passed.\n  So I am hoping we will get a vote that reflects what is best for the \nAmerican people, and that would be to deny acceptance of this budget \nreport that is in front of us. I hope we will perhaps be able to \nconvince some of our Republican friends to come over, take another look \nat the budget and see what we can do to improve the situation, because \nright now we are headed for a potential fiscal disaster just when \nthings are really going good.\n  I want to say something in response to an earlier argument I heard \nfrom the other side when it was said there is going to be more money \nput into Social Security than the Democrats are proposing. It is not \ntrue, because hidden in there is some arcane language that says \n``retirement security.'' They want to put the money away that can be \nused for retirement security--not Social Security. They are both two \nwords but they have different significance. One is a Government program \nestablished for people who are dependent on the Government for their \nretirement and their pension. The other could be Heaven knows what.\n  So I caution everybody, as we prepare to vote, which is imminent, \nthat the American public ought to be looking very closely at what it is \nwe are going to do. I hope they will respond as they see it, to those \nSenators who are casting a vote at this moment. I hope the vote will \nwind up with a majority saying no.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    land and water conservation fund\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to engage my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator Domenici, in a \ncolloquy, with their indulgence. As my colleagues are aware, the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund is the primary vehicle through which the \nFederal Government funds the acquisition of land and water resources \nthroughout the Nation. It does so through two programs, one allowing \nfor Federal land acquisitions and one providing for matching grants by \nState and local governments. However, funding for the LWCF has been \nsporadic, and for the State-side program, funding has been non-existent \nsince 1995.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would like to emphasize that the State-\nside program of the LWCF receives widespread support across the Nation, \nparticularly from State and local governments.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention an \namendment I offered, with great assistance by Senator Smith of New \nHampshire, as well as Senators Leahy and Feingold, that increased \nFunction 300 by $200 million, with a commensurate decrease from \nFunction 370. The amendment included language that this increase was to \nfund the State-side program of LWCF.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Accompanying the amendment were floor \nstatements expressing our intent that the offset be derived from within \nthe Department of Commerce, and specifically within Function 370. After \nnegotiations with Senators Leahy and Feingold and other Democratic \ncolleagues who cosponsored the amendment, we reached a bipartisan \nagreement that the $200 million would come from within the Commerce \nDepartment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to ask the distinguished manager of the \nbudget resolution whether these assumptions still apply, even if they \ndo not appear in the resolution?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As far as the Senate is concerned, these assumptions \nare still valid. Although the conference report is silent with respect \nto the $200 million being directed to the State-side program, there is \nnothing to assume that the money is not for the State-side program. \nIndeed, the best indication of the Senate's intent with respect to the \nLWCF is the Senate-approved resolution.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Is the same true with respect to the \noffset?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. In fact, as my friends, the Senators from New \nHampshire and Rhode Island may have already noted, the House receded in \nits disagreement with the Senate numbers for function 370. The Senate \nnumbers were $200 million lower in both budget authority and outlays \nfor this function than the House.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Is there a presumption that the Senate, in accepting the \nHouse-passed, higher funding level for Function 300, is also adopting \nthe assumptions that may have been used by the House in reaching its \nFunction 300 spending levels?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no such presumption. The Senate assumptions \nare as equally valid as the House assumptions. The real challenge lies \nahead when the Appropriations Subcommittees begin marking up their \nseparate appropriations bills. Since our budget assumptions are just \nthat--assumptions--and do not bind appropriators to specified funding \nlevels for individual programs, Senators must vigorously continue to \nmake their case for funding favored programs with the relevant \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I do\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nknow that the State-side land acquisition program could not have better \nadvocates than the Senators from Rhode Island and New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire, as well as the \ndistinguished manager of the budget resolution, for engaging in this \ncolloquy. I also wish to wholeheartedly thank the manager for his \nsupport on this issue throughout the consideration of the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind \nremarks. I would add that the inevitable challenges of moving a budget \nresolution through the Senate to final passage were made far less \ndifficult by the hard work of Senator Chafee and his staff, whose \nunderstanding and accommodation allowed us to complete our work in a \ntimely fashion. It is a great pleasure to work with him again on the \nconference version of the resolution.\n\n\n      technical correction to section 104 of the budget resolution\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to alert my colleagues in \nthe Senate to a technical error which occurred during the drafting of \nsection 104 of the Conference Report to accompany H. Con. Res. 68--the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  Section 104 of the resolution sets out the reconciliation \ninstructions for the Committee on Finance in the Senate. This \ninstruction calls for a net reduction in revenues over the 10-year \nperiod of fiscal years 2000 through 2009. As is always the case with a \nreconciled revenue reduction, the amounts contained in the instructions \nto both the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees are \nintended to be the same. However, due to a technical drafting error \nwith respect to the instruction to the Finance Committee, the amounts \nare not the same. Three ``zeros'' were omitted from the instruction \nsuch that the amount for fiscal years 2000 through 2009 is $777.868 \nmillion instead of $777.868 billion.\n  If my colleagues look to other sections of the budget resolution and \nthe statement of managers which accompanies it they will see that the \nconferees clearly intended the amount in the instruction to the Finance \nCommittee be $777.868 billion not $777.868 million. In addition to the \nlanguage found in the statement of managers, this intent is evidenced \nby the figures set out in section 101(1)(B) of the resolution (which \nstates on a year-by-year basis, the amount by which the aggregate \nlevels of Federal revenues should be changed--the sum of these figures \nis $777.868 billion) and the figures set out in section 101(5) of the \nresolution (which displays the appropriate levels of the public debt).\n  Moreover, I have consulted with the Parliamentarian of the Senate and \nhave been assured that for the purpose of determining whether or not \nthe legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance complies \nwith the reconciliation instruction contained in section 104 of the \nbudget resolution the Parliamentarian will honor the intent of the \nconferees--that the 10-year figure is $777.868 billion, not $777.868 \nmillion. I am gratified that the Parliamentarian will support a \nrational result.\n\n\n   Corrections to FY 2000 Budget Resolution Senate Committee Budget \n    Authority and Outlay Allocations and Reconciliation Instructions\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for \nthe Record corrections of typographical errors on tables that \noriginally appeared in the April 13, 1999 Congressional Record on pages \nH1963 and H1964 in the Statement of Managers to accompany the FY 2000 \nCongressional Budget Resolution, H. Con. Res. 68. I further ask that \nthese corrected tables be considered to be the allocations required by \nsection 302 (a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  On the table titled ``Senate Committee Budget Authority and Outlay \nAllocations Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, \nBudget Year Total 2000 (in millions of dollars),'' the figure for \nAppropriations Outlays, General Purpose Discretionary should be \n$536,701. Appropriations Outlays, Total should be $875,243.\n  Direct spending jurisdiction, Budget Authority for the Finance \nCommittee should be $683,102. Direct spending jurisdiction, Outlays for \nthe Finance Committee should be $676,153.\n  Direct spending jurisdiction, Budget Authority Total should be \n$1,426,720. Direct spending jurisdiction, Outlays Total should be \n$1,408,082.\n  On the table titled ``Senate Committee Budget Authority and Outlay \nAllocations Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, 5-\nYear Total: 2000-2004 (in millions of dollars),'' the figure for Direct \nspending jurisdiction, Budget Authority for the Finance Committee \nshould be $3,389,039.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \ncorrected tables, which I now send to the desk, be printed in their \nentirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSENATE COMMITTEE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAY ALLOCATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         Direct spending     Entitlements funded\n                                                                          jurisdiction            in annual\n                                                                    ------------------------  appropriations act\n                             Committee                                                      --------------------\n                                                                       Budget      Outlays     Budget\n                                                                      authority              authority   Outlays\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                             BUDGET YEAR TOTAL: 2000\n                           Appropriations\n                                                                                                     0         0\nGeneral Purpose Discretionary......................................    531,771     536,701           0         0\nViolent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.................................      4,500       5,554           0         0\nHighways...........................................................          0      24,574\nMass Transit.......................................................          0       4,117\nMandatory..........................................................    321,502     304,297           0         0\n                                                                    --------------------------------------------\n    Total..........................................................    857,773     875,243           0         0\n                                                                    ============================================\nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry...............................     10,843       7,940      26,696     9,419\nArmed Services.....................................................     49,327      49,433           0         0\nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs................................      4,676      (1,843)          0         0\nCommerce, Science, and Transportation..............................      8,420       5,774         721       717\nEnergy and Natural Resources.......................................      2,336       2,258          40        63\nEnvironment and Public Works.......................................     36,532       2,041           0         0\nFinance............................................................    683,102     676,153     156,910   157,096\nForeign Relations..................................................      9,354      11,976           0         0\nGovernmental Affairs...............................................     59,501      57,941           0         0\nJudiciary..........................................................      4,759       4,235         234       234\nLabor and Human Resources..........................................      9,023       8,363       1,309     1,309\nRule and Administration............................................        114         289           0         0\nVeterans' Affairs..................................................      1,106       1,381      23,667    23,540\nIndian Affairs.....................................................        151         150           0         0\nSmall Business.....................................................          0        (155)          0         0\nUnassigned to Committee............................................

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that for \nthe purpose of executing and enforcing the Senate's reconciliation \ninstruction set out in section 104 of the conference report to \naccompany H. Con. Res. 68--the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution --\nthat the dollar amount of the revenue reduction for the period of \nfiscal years 2000 through 2009 be considered to be $777,868,000,000 \nrather than $777,868,000.\n  This corrects a technical drafting error (three ``zeros'' were \nomitted) in the resolution and conforms with the instruction for the \nHouse of Representatives and the description of section 104 that is \ncontained in the statement of managers which accompanies the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I congratulate the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, for producing an on-time budget for \nonly the second time in the 24-plus-year history of the Budget Act.\n  I rise today to support the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution now \nbefore the Senate. I am pleased that this budget will pay down the \nFederal debt, boost\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\neducation spending, and increase veterans health care spending. I am \ndisappointed that budget conferees could only fund $6 billion of the \n$10 billion proposed by myself and Senator Dodd in child care grants \nfor low-income families and child care tax cuts. However, I appreciate \nthe hard work Senator Domenici and others put into getting these funds.\n  While I realize that our amendment would not have guaranteed an \nincrease in child care spending, Congress needs to face up to the \nreality that low-income mothers need to work, and to make work pay they \nneed child care assistance. As Chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, I can assure supporters of child care \nsubsidies that this will not be the last word on this issue during the \n106th Congress.\n  On a more positive note, this budget adheres to the historic Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, while at the same time, over the next ten years, \npays down $1.8 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held debt and \nprovides for modest tax cuts until larger on-budget surpluses emerge.\n  Additionally the Republican budget will fence off the portion of the \nsurplus generated through Social Security payroll taxes. I would like \nto reassure all Vermonters that not a dollar of these funds will be \nused to fund tax cuts. Instead, Social Security payroll taxes will go \ntowards shoring up the program and possibly go toward providing capital \nfor an overhaul plan. While this alone will not ensure the long-term \nfinancial health of the program, it will have the effect of reducing \nFederal debt and extending the solvency of the program.\n  Mr. President, the budget before the Senate also protects Medicare \nfor our Nation's seniors. Funding for Medicare is increased \nsignificantly, but like Social Security, the long-term health of the \nprogram is dependent not on providing additional funds, but on enacting \nneeded structural changes. As the resolution indicates, Medicare \nbeneficiaries must have access to high-quality skilled nursing \nservices, home health care services and inpatient and outpatient \nhospital services in rural areas. The availability of these services is \nat risk, especially for rural populations, and I will do all I can to \nensure that they are addressed as a part of any Medicare legislation. I \nam particularly pleased that the resolution includes a Medicare drug \nbenefit reserve fund. The availability of a drug benefit for seniors is \none of my highest priorities, and I plan to work with other members of \nthe Finance Committee to have it included as a part of any Medicare \nreform effort.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the budget resolution adopts my \nSenate-passed language that will provide funding to foster the \nemployment and independence of individuals with disabilities. I am also \npleased that the resolution contains Senator Collins' and my Sense of \nthe Senate in support of increased funding for the Pell grant program, \nthe campus based programs, LEAP and TRIO. These programs have helped \nmake the dream of college a reality for many of our Nation's neediest \nstudents. Providing an increase in funding for these tested and proven \nprograms will open the doors of higher education to more educationally \nmotivated young people, specifically those who have the most financial \nneed.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, given world events and the ever-increasing \ndemands we place on our military, I am pleased that this budget calls \nfor an increase in military pay. We need to do more to alleviate the \nquality of life concerns of our men and women in uniform. However, I am \nconcerned that some of the military increases in this budget are not \ngoing to the things that the military needs most, as evidenced by the \ncurrent crisis in Kosovo.\n  This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of \npolitical intent and a starting point for bargaining. Much work remains \nto be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that actually fund the \ngovernment. In areas where I disagree with the budget resolution, I \nplan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending levels and turn \nthis budget into reality.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with some degree of regret that \nI rise to oppose this budget resolution conference report.\n  Thanks to continued economic growth and the tough choices we made on \nthe budget in 1993, this year, for the first time in a generation, we \nhave been given the opportunity to structure a budget which is \nbalanced, fiscally responsible, and makes important investment in \nAmerica's domestic priorities.\n  When I first came to the Senate some 6 years ago, we faced $200 \nbillion annual deficits as far as the eye could see. Now, thanks to the \ntough choices we made in 1993, then fiscal discipline we imposed on the \nbudget, and a vibrant economy, we are able to reap the benefits of the \ndifficult choices. Now we are running surpluses--projected to be as \nmuch as $4.7 trillion over the next 15 years by the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Thanks to these surpluses we have an unparalleled opportunity to set \nour budgetary house in order and meet the challenges of the future.\n  We have the opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare. To \ninvest in education, environment, and health care. To provide for a \nstrong national defense.\n  And I also believe that we have an important opportunity to provide \nresponsible tax relief for working families--and I intend to introduce \nlegislation to provide just such a tax cut with my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley.\n  But this conference report ignores these opportunities. It fails to \nmeet the test of saving Medicare. It fails to make the important \ninvestments in health care, education, and child care. And it endangers \nother programs vital for law enforcement, environment, and continued \neconomic growth.\n  This conference report does not do anything to meet Medicare's \nsolvency crisis or extend the life of this vital program beyond the \nprojected 2015 bankruptcy. I agree with those who say that we must \nreform Medicare, but we also must provide it with the additional funds \nit needs. The President has proposed allocating 15 percent of the \nsurplus for Medicare to add 12 years to life of program. This budget \nrejects that initiative, creates some vague ``reserve'' which may or \nmay not help Medicare, but really uses the money that should go to \nMedicare for tax cuts instead.\n  This budget does not do enough to extend Social Security. Again, I \nwould agree with those who say we need to adopt Social Security reform \nto strengthen the Social Security system and assure it is on sound \nfooting. But this budget allows some of the Social Security surpluses \nto be used for purposes other than Social Security, and, frankly, I do \nnot think that that is wise.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted by 98-0 to instruct our conferees to use \nall Social Security surplus funds for Social Security. This conference \nreport, however, creates a ``lockbox'' for Social Security, but then \nproceeds to remove the lock by allowing any legislation that ``enhances \nretirement security'' to raid Social Security surplus funds..\n  Finally, although this conference report protects some important \ndomestic priorities, such as transportation, it cuts other essential \nbut ``unprotected'' programs, such as the border patrol, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, job training programs, child care assistance, \nhead start, and on and on. The strictures of this budget--driven by an \noverlarge tax cut--may necessitate cuts of 11 percent in many of these \nimportant programs.\n  Mr. President, I think our current economic strength has presented us \nwith a unique opportunity--we can save Social Security and Medicare, \nmake important investments in domestic priorities, provide for a strong \nnational defense, and also provide the American people with tax relief.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report, by adopting unrealistic tax \ncuts, puts at risk all these goals, and may well set us down a path of \nfiscal irresponsibility that will endanger all our gains of the past \nfew years. I urge my colleague to oppose this conference report.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the FY2000 \nbudget conference report we are now considering and to urge for its \nadoption.\n  I would first like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Pete Domenici, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced \nbudget and fiscally responsible decision-making\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nover the years. Thanks, in part, to his leadership and efforts, the \nturbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debt have been \ntemporarily calmed. And, by maintaining these principles in the House-\nSenate budget conference report, we may be able to maintain the current \nbudgetary calm for many years in the future.\n  The conference report not only maintains fiscal discipline, but it \nalso ensures that critical priorities are protected and addressed in \nfiscal year 2000 and beyond.\n  Specifically, the conference report contains the following key \nprovisions:\n  First, it sets-aside every penny of the Social Security surplus, \nunlike the President's budget proposal.\n  Second, by retaining an amendment I offered to the Senate budget \nresolution, it provides monies from the on-budget surplus for a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit--something that President Clinton \nfailed to include in his own budget proposal after touting the need for \nthis benefit in his State of the Union address.\n  Third, it adheres to the spending levels established just two years \nago in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while increasing funding for \ncritically needed priorities including education and defense.\n  Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the \ntypical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. And by retaining language from an amendment I offered \nto the Senate budget resolution, it highlights marriage penalty relief \nas being one of the forms of tax relief that could be accommodated in \nany forthcoming tax cut package. When considering that 42 percent of \nall married couples incurred a marriage tax penalty averaging $1,400 in \n1996, I think of no tax cut that would be more appropriate in any \nupcoming tax package.\n  Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those \nof most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's \nmonies. Accordingly, I believe this conference report deserves broad \nbipartisan support by the entire Congress.\n  Mr. President, to appreciate the provisions in this conference \nreport, I believe it is appropriate to compare it to the only other \nmajor budget proposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by \nPresident Clinton on February 1. In particular, I believe the manner in \nwhich these proposals treat the Social Security surplus should be \ncarefully compared.\n  As mentioned, the first priority that is protected in the Republican \nconference report is Social Security and the annual surpluses it is \ncurrently accruing.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Social Security surplus was \nresponsible for the unified budget surplus of $70 billion we accrued in \nFY98. In fact, without the Social Security surplus, the federal \ngovernment actually ran an on-budget deficit of $29 billion last year.\n  By the same token, Social Security's surpluses will account for the \nbulk of our unified budget surpluses in coming years as well. \nSpecifically, over the coming 5 years, Social Security surpluses will \ntotal $769 billion and account for 82 percent of CBO's projected \nunified surpluses--and over 10 years, they will total $1.7 trillion and \naccount for 69 percent of unified surpluses.\n  To protect Social Security's surpluses, the budget resolution sets \nthe stage for ``lock-box'' legislation that will accomplish what many \nof us have desired for years: a bonafide means of taking Social \nSecurity off-budget. Put simply, this resolution ensures that Social \nSecurity surpluses are set aside and not raided to pay for other \nfederal programs.\n  In contrast, President Clinton's budget offers no protection for the \nSocial Security surplus and, in fact, proposes that it be spent on \nother federal programs in upcoming years.\n  Specifically, over the coming 5 years, the President proposes we take \na $158 billion ``bite'' out of Social Security surpluses and spend \nthese monies on other federal programs. That means that, under the \nPresident's budget, fully 21 percent of Social Security's upcoming \nsurpluses would be spent on other programs over the next 5 years.\n  Although the President has proposed that we spend a portion of the \nSocial Security surplus on other programs, I was pleased that an \noverwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget \nCommittee voted for an amendment I offered during markup of the Senate \nresolution that rejected the President's proposed use of Social \nSecurity's surpluses.\n  Specifically, my amendment outlined the fact that the President's \nbudget would spend $40 billion of the Social Security surplus in \nFY2000; $41 billion in FY01; $24 billion in FY02; $34 billion in FY03; \nand $20 billion in FY04. Furthermore, the amendment called on Congress \nto reject any budget proposal that spent Social Security surplus monies \non other federal programs. Appropriately, after my amendment was \nadopted by a vote of 21 to 1, the President's budget proposal--which \nspends Social Security's surplus monies--was unanimously rejected by \nthe Budget Committee when offered as an amendment later in the markup, \nand by a vote of 97 to 2 by the full Senate later on the floor.\n  Mr. President, the manner in which Social Security surpluses are \ntreated is but one of the ways in which these two proposals could be \ncompared, but the bottom line is that the House-Senate conference \nreport is simply superior to the Clinton plan. By maintaining fiscal \ndiscipline, protecting Social Security surpluses, providing funds for a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared \npriorities such as education, I believe this conference report deserves \nstrong support by the full Senate.\n  Ultimately, while members from either side of the aisle may disagree \nwith specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the \nsimple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that \nestablishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on \nthese individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions \nwill initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, \nand ultimately by members on the floor.\n  Therefore, I urge that my colleagues support this carefully crafted \nand fiscally responsible FY2000 conference budget report --and work to \nensure that the parameters it establishes are used to protect and \nadvance the priorities we share.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport now before us on the budget resolution.\n  The Congressional budget process as we know it is 25 years old this \nyear. Silver anniversaries such as this one are important milestones, \nbut this year's budget resolution provides no cause for celebration. \nFor a number of reasons, I am deeply disappointed in the resolution \nthat my Republican colleagues appear determined to adopt today.\n  First are issues of process. As a member of the Budget Committee, I \nhave been disappointed in the amount of time that we have had available \nto study the budget proposals before us. Consideration in committee, on \nthe Senate floor, and now in relation to this conference report has \nbeen marked by the absence of detailed, written proposals that would \nprovide the basis for sound decisions.\n  Indeed, I understand that at the conference on this resolution, there \nwas not even a draft resolution to which members could react. After \nless than 6 hours of consideration, and with no text available, the \nconference committee hurriedly approved this report early Wednesday \nmorning. The Senate has not had the chance to give the measure a proper \nreview, yet here we are the very next day asked to approve a $1.4 \ntrillion budget. It is troubling that the majority's desire to beat \ntoday's statutory April 15 deadline has prevailed over thoughtful \nconsideration and debate. The result of this haste and the deficient \npolicy making process will be quite clear to the American people once \nthey understand this budget's real implications.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this budget will take the country in \nthe wrong direction. We are now in the 96th month of the longest \npeacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. We are truly in a \nvirtuous economic cycle, as growth reached 6.1 percent in the last \nquarter of 1998, and 3.9 percent for the year. 1998 was the sixth year \nof such steady growth, a pattern of robust increases that many \neconomists once thought unsustainable over such long periods.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the effort in 1993 that helped to \ncreate this\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\npositive economic climate. Working together, President Clinton and \ncongressional Democrats crafted a package that finally brought the \nfederal deficit under control. By making difficult but critical \ndecisions to cut federal programs and raise revenues, we tamed the \ndeficits that plagued the Nation throughout the 1980s, placed enormous \npressure on important federal initiatives, and hampered our economic \ngrowth. Most Republicans argued at the time that this responsible \npackage would ruin the economy and send markets tumbling. They were \ndead wrong.\n  Thanks to the strong economy and the fiscal discipline begun in 1993, \nthe country is in a fiscal position no one dreamed possible even two \nyears ago. In 1997, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and nearly everyone else were predicting \nsubstantial budget deficits far into the next decade--as high as $159 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000, $153 billion in fiscal year 2002, and \ncontinuing for the foreseeable future. Earlier in the decade, OMB \nestimates for the 2002 deficit ran as high as $576 billion. This year, \nthose forecasts have been turned upside down. CBO's recent projections \ncall for unified budget surpluses rising from $131 billion in fiscal \nyear 2000 to $381 billion if fiscal year 2009.\n  The budget resolution before us will seriously endanger this hard-won \nprogress, and will short-change national priorities that the American \npeople have clearly indicated they want to see addressed. Depending \nupon one's point of view, this is either the last budget of the old \nmillennium, or the first of the new. In either case, it is an \nopportunity for us to think seriously about our Nation's needs and \npriorities as we look into the next century, and chart an appropriate \ncourse for the future. This budget, however, is less a forward-looking \npolicy blueprint than a political document aimed at short-term gain.\n  This is unfortunate, because as we look toward the future we face \nsome very real challenges, the most significant of which will come in \nMedicare and Social Security. Together, these are two of the crowning \nachievements of American government, and have lifted literally millions \nof older Americans out of poverty. These programs have worked, and \ncontinue to work every day for our senior citizens and their families.\n  To prepare the country for the future, any budget that we pass must \nmeet several criteria. It must extend the solvency of Social Security \nand Medicare. It must recognize the magnitude of these obligations in a \nforthright way, and include a mechanism to boost national savings and \neconomic growth, so that we are in a better position to meet them. It \nshould be designed to reduce, not increase, the growing income \ndisparities that can fray our social fabric. Finally, it should protect \nother important national priorities. Support for communities, \nscientific research, veterans benefit, education, environmental \nprotection, and the like should not be sacrificed for tax breaks for \nthe well-to-do.\n  This proposal fails to meet any of these criteria. Instead, it \nappears tailor-made to accommodate the majority's priority of huge tax \ncuts for the wealthy. While the total available for tax cuts starts off \nat $15 billion in fiscal year 2000, that mushrooms to $142 billion over \n5 years and $778 billion over the next 10 years. Who will benefit from \nthese tax cuts? If past is prologue, lower and middle income Americans \nwill not. Capital gains cuts, repeal of estate taxes, and more \ncorporate loopholes all give tax relief where it is least needed--to \nthose already at the top of the income scale. These have been part and \nparcel of previous Republican tax cut packages, and there is no reason \nto suspect that this year will be any different.\n  The Republican budget would require devastating, unsustainable cuts \nin critical programs that serve millions of Americans. In order to \nprovide massive increases in defense outlays while trying to stay under \nthe discretionary caps passed 2 years ago, this plan makes dramatic \ncuts in almost every other area of government. According to estimates \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget, the combination of defense \nincreases, protection of a select few programs, and retention of the \nbudget caps would force spending reductions in non-defense \ndiscretionary programs of $26.9 billion in fiscal year 2000 alone. This \nwould require an unprecedented across-the-board cut of over 11 percent \nin real terms from fiscal year 1999 levels across a broad array of \nimportant government functions.\n  On top of these huge cuts, this budget will cripple important \nprograms far into the future in order to fund the majority's tax cuts. \nAfter the current spending caps expire, any future increases would be \nheld to well under the rate of inflation. This means that every year, \nimportant functions will continue to suffer real cutbacks amounting to \nbillions of dollars. Incredibly, discretionary levels in 2009--10 years \nfrom now--will be just 2.6 percent over those enacted this fiscal year, \n1999. This will not even begin to make up for losses to inflation, to \nsay nothing of increased needs caused by a growing population.\n  I also must note that the conference report does not specifically \ncall for continuation of the traditional parity in pay increases \nbetween military and civilian government employees. I successfully \nsponsored an amendment to maintain this parity in S. 4, the military \npay increase bill passed by the Senate earlier this session, and I urge \nthe Senate to continue its support for this principle as the \nappropriations process moves forward.\n  Mr. President, this budget proposal falls far short of the mark in \nalmost every important respect. It would harm important programs \nranging from Head Start to the FBI, from air traffic control to food \nsafety inspections, while providing a huge tax cut for the wealthy.\n  The plan utterly fails to meet the most fundamental tests--it does \nnot extend the solvency of Social Security in any way, and does nothing \nmeaningful to address the more immediate problems in Medicare. When \nDemocrats introduced amendments in the Budget Committee and on the \nfloor that would specifically put saving Social Security and Medicare \nahead of the Republican tax cut, the measures were defeated. \nRepublicans opposed Social Security and Medicare at their inception, \nand this budget resolution shows that they still do not see how \nimportant these programs are to millions of individuals. The Republican \npriorities evident in this resolution simply are not shared by most of \nthe American people.\n  I strongly oppose this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to reject \nit.\n\n\n                           AVIATION BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to draw my colleagues' attention \nto an opinion piece in today's Washington Post on air safety. The \narticle, titled ``Yes to Air Safety'' by Congressman Shuster, Chairman \nof the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, talks about \nthe critical need to fully fund our air traffic control system and to \nbuild our nation's airports. It is a simple proposition that is being \nput to Congress--if you take money from airline passengers, you must \nuse that money to build and sustain the system.\n  We all leave here every weekend, journeying across the country. Each \nof us encounters delays at Reagan National. Right now, the FAA operates \nthe safest air transportation system in the world. Maintaining this \nhigh standard requires money--plain and simple. We can underfund the \nagency and we can take the airline passenger money and give people a \ntax cut. If we do this, then we can not complain about delays--it is \nour fault for the shortchange. If we take the Trust Fund money and use \nit for a tax cut or other purposes, it is our fault, not Jane Garvey or \nRodney Slater's, but ours alone.\n  We have an opportunity to restore the ``Trust'' in the Airport and \nAirways Trust Fund, and to give to our constituents what they need and \nhave paid for--a safe, and efficient air transportation system. We \nshould not let it pass us by. Congressman Shuster has got it right.\n  Here are the facts:\n  From Fiscal Year (FY) 1982 through 1999, Congress appropriated more \nthan $27 billion for the modernization program. FAA estimates that the \neffort will need an additional $14 billion for FY 2000-2004. The FAA \nrequested $2.3 billion for FY 2000, which represents an increase of 11 \npercent over the FY 1999 appropriation level of $2.1 billion. But it is \nnot enough to fully modernize the national air system (NAS).\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\n  Accident rates for the U.S. air transportation system, compared to \nother areas of the world or other modes of transportation, all indicate \nthat the U.S. aviation system remains the safest in the world. For \nexample, aircraft hull loss rates for the U.S. and Canada are 0.5 per \nmillion departures, compared to 3.8 per million for Asia and the \nPacific islands. For 1998, there were no commercial passenger \nfatalities within the U.S.\n  As the FAA aviation forecast information, released just a few weeks \nago, indicates, there will be almost 1 billion passengers (up from 607 \nmillion in 1998) and an increase in the total number of flights from 65 \nmillion to about 82 million by 2010. Today, the FAA, in many instances, \nis using outdated equipment that must be replaced in order to meet the \nexpected demand.\n  In 1997, the Congressionally created National Civil Aviation Review \nCommission (NCARC) found that gridlock in the skies is a certainty in \nthe near future unless the ATC system is modernized. According to the \nreport, an increase in delays of just a few minutes per flight would \nseriously inhibit the ability of carriers to operate hub and spoke \nsystems. I must note that one DOT study suggests that adding 48 more \nflights at Reagan National would create approximately 3 to 4 minute \nmore delays per aircraft. This report was further supported by an \nAmerican Airlines study detailing how a four minute increase in delays \nwould seriously impact the ability of carriers to operate hubs. The FAA \nestimates that if demand increases as expected, no new runways are \nadded to major airports, and no advances are made in air traffic \ncontrol, then 15 of the U.S.'s major airports will be severely \ncongested by 2006. In January 1997, the White House Commission on \nAviation Security and Safety recommended that we expedite the \nmodernization of the ATC system and complete the project by 2005, ten \nyears earlier than originally planned.\n  If we do manage to fix the air traffic control system to make it more \nefficient, we still need to have more runways and terminals to \naccommodate the expected growth. Again, it is simple, if one has too \nmany planes trying to land on one runway, one will have delays. Runways \ndo not come cheap. The runway in Seattle, which we agree is sorely \nneeded, will cost more than $830 million. A new runway in Atlanta, \nChicago, or Dallas likewise will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \nWithout that added capacity, delays will increase. We know this. No one \ndisputes this. It gets back to money--we have a Trust Fund which will \nhave $79 billion by 2008 just sitting there. The General Accounting \nOffice has also told us of the looming funding crises for airports. We \nsimply can not ignore our duty--we can not use that $79 billion for \nanything other than funding our air transportation system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Yes to Air Safety\n\n                            (By Bud Shuster)\n\n       Although the safest in the world today, America's aviation \n     system is hurtling toward gridlock and potential catastrophes \n     in the sky. Unfortunately, The Post's April 2 editorial ``A \n     No to Mr. Shuster'' did not accurately describe the efforts \n     of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \n     during the budget debate to unlock the ticket taxes paid by \n     airline passengers into the Aviation Trust Fund so they could \n     be used for their intended purpose of improving America's \n     aviation system.\n       Contrary to the editorial's assertions, our bipartisan \n     proposal would not cut one penny from other federal programs. \n     Rather, it would provide that the ticket taxes be used for \n     aviation improvements instead of being used to pay for a \n     small part of the $800 billion tax reduction proposed over \n     the next 10 years. In fact, we provide for an open debate and \n     floor vote on whether the money going into the trust fund \n     should be used for aviation improvements (which we support) \n     or for a reduction in the aviation ticket tax. It is grossly \n     unfair to take airline passenger ticket taxes and then give \n     them away as part of a general tax cut.\n       The Post was absolutely correct, however, in acknowledging \n     that ``no one disputes a need to increase aviation \n     spending.'' Since airline deregulation, passenger travel has \n     increased from 230 million annually to 600 million last year \n     and is projected to be 660 million this year and more than a \n     billion annually in the first decade of the next century. A \n     30 percent increase in aircraft operations is forecast for \n     our top 100 airports in the next decade, with a 50 percent \n     increase in the number of commercial jets in our skies. Air \n     cargo, which increased 74 percent in the last 10 years, is \n     growing even faster.\n       Airport congestion is already skyrocketing. The FAA reports \n     that our 27 largest airports each are experiencing more than \n     20,000 hours of recorded flight delays annually, costing the \n     airlines $2.5 billion and the American people more than $7 \n     billion in lost productivity. But that's only the tip of the \n     iceberg. Airlines are building delays into their schedules. \n     For example, Washington to New York should be only a 45-\n     minute flight, but it's scheduled for an hour. The actual \n     cost of congestion may be approaching $20 billion annually. \n     One study estimates that we need a 60 percent increase in \n     airport infrastructure investment just to maintain the \n     current levels of delay.\n       The General Accounting Office states that $17 billion will \n     be needed during the next five years just for air traffic \n     control modernization. Last year our air traffic control \n     system experienced more than 100 significant system failures. \n     Dulles went down for more than 10 hours just a few weeks ago. \n     The National Civil Aviation Review Commission states that \n     ``without prompt action, the United States' aviation system \n     is headed toward gridlock . . . [and] a deterioration of \n     aviation safety [which would] harm the efficiencies and \n     growth of our domestic economy, and hurt our position in the \n     global market place.'' Last month, two jet cargo planes came \n     within a hundred feet of a mid-air collision over Kansas \n     because the Kansas City Air Traffic Control Center lost radio \n     contact with them.\n       The good news, however, is that the ticket taxes flowing \n     into the Aviation Trust Fund can provide a substantial \n     increase for aviation improvements. Specifically, more than \n     $10 billion is going into the trust fund annually, while \n     spending is around $7 billion. If nothing changes, during the \n     next 10 years more than $90 billion will accumulate in the \n     Aviation Trust Fund.\n       The speaker has agreed to bring our ``Aviation Investment \n     and Reform Act for the 21st Century''(AIR 21), which passed \n     our committee unanimously; to the floor for a fair and open \n     debate. It will unlock the Aviation Trust Fund so the ticket \n     taxes paid into it can be used for aviation improvements, \n     provide for increased capacity at our airports, modernize our \n     air traffic control system and ensure continued safety for \n     the world's best aviation system. Increased airport capacity \n     will mean more airline competition, which is part of the \n     long-term solution to better customer service.\n       The Post can't have it both ways, saying we should spend \n     more on aviation while opposing using the money paid into the \n     trust fund for that purpose. But I'm beginning to get it: The \n     Post thinks it's good government to spend $900 million out of \n     the Highway Trust Fund for one Woodrow Wilson Bridge in the \n     Washington area but bad to use the Aviation Trust Fund to \n     improve aviation across America.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote today, somewhat reluctantly, \nin support of the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Resolution. I say reluctantly \nbecause I am very concerned about the inadequate level of funding \nprovided in this resolution for national defense.\n  On the positive side, this budget resolution establishes a road map \nfor this Congress to enact the largest tax cut since the Reagan \nAdministration, lock up the Social Security surplus, shore up Medicare, \nsubstantially reduce the public debt, and still keep spending within \nthe limits established in the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement. It also \nprovides the largest increase in history, $1.8 billion above the \nPresident's budget, for veterans' health care, which has been \nconsistently underfunded for years.\n  Most important, the resolution takes an important step toward \npreserving Social Security for current and future recipients. It \nreaffirms the 1990 law, now expired, that prohibited using the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund surpluses to offset other spending, and it \nestablishes a new point of order against spending any of the Social \nSecurity surplus on anything other than payment of Social Security \nbenefits or reforming the system. This resolution walls off the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund so that money paid in by taxpayers for their \nretirement cannot be stolen by spendthrift politicians to pay for their \nfavorite pork-barrel projects or new government programs of dubious \nmerit.\n  Saving Social Security and providing greater retirement security for \nour citizens should be our first priority. We must find a viable \nsolution to the impending bankruptcy of Social Security which \nrestructures the system in a manner which provides working Americans \nwith the opportunity, choices, and flexibility necessary to ensure \ntheir future retirement needs are fully met. Everyone who has worked \nand invested in the Social Security system must be guaranteed to \nreceive the benefits they were promised, but reform must not\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nplace an unfair burden on today's workers. Until we find that solution, \nhowever, it is imperative that we shore up the system to ensure payment \nof benefits will continue, on time and in full, to everyone who has \nearned them.\n  To do this, we must not only protect the existing Social Security \nsurplus, as this resolution does, but ensure that additional funds are \navailable, if needed, to shore up the system in the absence of \nmeaningful reforms. The President's ``smoke and mirrors'' budget \npromised to save 62 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to shore \nup Social Security, but that has been shown to be a baseless claim when \nhis budget is carefully analyzed. Unfortunately, this budget resolution \ndid not dedicate additional funds to save Social Security either. I \nbelieve we should set aside a significant portion of the additional \nsurplus to extend the fiscal viability of the system and ease the fears \nof our senior citizens, and I intend to work to see that happen.\n\n  Locking up the Social Security Trust Fund surplus and setting aside a \nsignificant portion of the non-Social Security surplus does not mean we \ncannot also provide significant tax relief to those who need it most--\nlower- and middle-income Americans and their families. The Budget \nResolution provides for $142.3 billion in tax relief over the next five \nyears, amounting to $779.9 billion over ten years. The tax cuts are \nappropriately targeted toward eliminating the marriage penalty, \nexpanding the lowest 15% tax bracket, estate tax relief, more favorable \ntax treatment of health insurance cost for the self-employed, and \ncapital gains tax fairness for farmers.\n  But Americans need and deserve an even bigger tax cut. Federal taxes \nconsume nearly 21% of America's gross domestic product, the highest \nlevel since World War II. A recent Congressional Research Service study \nfound that, over the next ten years, an average American family will \npay $5,307 in taxes over and above what the government needs to \noperate. Congress did not balance the budget so Washington spending and \ngovernment bureaucracy could continue to grow at the taxpayers expense. \nLetting the American people keep more of their own money to spend on \ntheir priorities will continue to fuel the economy and help create more \nsmall business jobs and other employment opportunities.\n  The tax cuts in this Budget Resolution are significant, but I think \nwe should return even more of the surplus back to the taxpayers. I \nbelieve we should reserve part of the non-Social Security surplus to \nshore up the system and give a bigger tax cut to American families, \nwhich would be paid for partially by closing tax loopholes and \neliminating inequitable corporate subsidies to offset the cost.\n  Saving Social Security, cutting taxes, providing for our veterans, \nand many other aspects of this Budget Resolution are sufficient reason \nto vote for it. However, the shortfall in defense spending in this \nbudget raises very serious concerns.\n  It is no secret that there are serious readiness, retention and \nrecruiting problems throughout the military. The Service Chiefs \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in September last \nyear, and again in January, that they require an additional $20 billion \nover the fiscal year 1999 budget in fiscal year 2000 to stop declining \nforce readiness. The President, after promising an additional $12 \nbillion, only added $4 billion in his budget request. Then, during this \nyear's budget hearings, the Service Secretaries and Chiefs confirmed \nthat readiness unfunded requirements still exist and submitted lists to \nmeet their readiness requirements. Yet the Budget Resolution does not \nprovide sufficient funding to meet the minimum requirements of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff to adequately fund critical readiness, personnel \nand modernization programs.\n  The Conference Report veils its underfunding of vital defense \nprograms by putting an additional $8.3 billion for Fiscal Year 2000 in \nthe Pentagon's bank in the form of increased budget authority, but \nbecause of the arcane scorekeeping rules of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Services would not be able to actually spend that money \nbecause it would exceed the outlay cap. Fortunately, the conference \nagreement provides $2 billion more in outlays than the Senate version, \nbut the spending limit is still $6.7 billion less than the President's \nbudget when estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. And the \nresolution shortchanges defense next year and every year thereafter.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed legislation of which I was a \nprimary architect, along with Senator Roberts, Majority Leader Lott and \nSenator Warner. This legislation, the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, \nand Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999'', would restore military \nretirement benefits to a full 50 percent of base pay for 20-year \nretirees, includes a 4.8 percent pay raise effective January 1, 2000, \npay table reform, Thrift Savings Plan proposals, and a Special \nSubsistence Allowance to help the neediest families in the Armed Forces \nwho now require federal food stamp assistance. This Budget Resolution \nputs all these recruitment and retention tools in jeopardy because it \ndoes not provide the dollars needed to fulfill these promises to our \nservice members and their families.\n  Mr. President, the nuclear carrier U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN-65) is \ncurrently deployed in the Persian Gulf, undermanned by some 800 \nsailors. We are losing pilots to the commercial airlines faster than we \ncan train them. The Navy has one-half the F/A-18 pilots, one-third of \nthe S-3 pilots, and only one-quarter of the EA-6B pilots it needs. Only \n26 percent of the Air Force pilots have committed to stay beyond their \ncurrent service agreement. The Army says that five of its ten divisions \nlack enough majors, captains, senior enlisted personnel, tankers and \ngunners.\n  The military's problems do not stop at recruiting and retention \nissues. For example, the Army's number one modernization program, the \nComanche helicopter, is undergoing flight testing with just one asset. \nIf that helicopter has a serious malfunction or is lost, who knows how \nlong the program will be delayed. The Army has another test platform \nbut has testified that they simply cannot afford to fly it.\n  With the recent deployment in the Balkans, the world watched night \nafter night as the Air Force's main bomber, the B-52, was once again \ncalled to duty to deliver air launched cruise missiles in combat. How \nmany times has the Air Force called upon this 40-year old workhorse to \ndeliver devastating firepower? The B-52 bomber was already old when I \nsaw it fly in Vietnam, and yet the Air Force plan will carry the \ncurrent bomber fleet through the next 40 years, with a replacement to \nthe B-52 tentatively planned in 2037.\n  The Navy is struggling to maintain a fleet of 300 ships, down from \nover 500 in the early 1990s. The fiscal year 2000 budget will not \nsupport a Navy of even 200 ships. The Marine Corps saves money in spare \nparts by retreading light trucks and Humvees, so as to afford small \narms ammunition for forward deployed Marines.\n  The list goes on and on, but what we must recognize is that it \nillustrates very serious readiness problems that continue to grow and \nmust be stopped if we hope to preserve the world's finest military and \ncontinue to support the men and women in uniform, many of whom are in \nharm's way in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo today.\n  Mr. President, I could go on, but suffice it to say that the military \nneeds more money to redress the serious problems caused by more than a \ndecade of declining defense budgets. Those of us who have been \ncriticized for sounding alarm bells about military readiness now have \nthe empty satisfaction of seeing that there is more to maintaining a \nstrong defense than a politician's history of falsely promising to do \nso. What is at risk, without exaggeration, are the lives of our \nmilitary personnel and the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. President, for many years, the Services have struggled to make do \nwith the funding we provide to them, as Congress persists in draining \naway resources for low-priority, wasteful, pork-barrel spending \nprojects. After hearing from the Service Chiefs in testimony this year, \nI hope my colleagues are prepared to halt the long-standing practice of \nearmarking funds for home-state programs and special interest items. If \nnot, we will exacerbate the dangers of failing to provide the resources \nnecessary to maintain military readiness and our war-fighting \ncapability.\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this Budget Resolution because it \nprovides a measure of tax relief, additional veterans funding, and, \nmost important, locks up the Social Security Trust Fund for Social \nSecurity. But I am gravely concerned about the defense spending levels \nin this budget, and I intend to do everything I can to ensure that \nevery dollar in the Defense and Military Construction Appropriations \nbills is used for high-priority defense requirements, like recruiting \nand retention incentives, operations and training, and urgent \nmodernization programs. I urge my colleagues to put aside their \nparochial interests and join me in that effort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact around here \nthat budget resolutions are frequently seen as little more than \nmeaningless manipulations of numbers. They are perceived by some to \nhave no real impact on Congress and even less on the American people. \nWhether you agree or disagree with this perception of previous budget \nresolutions, I think we can all agree that the budget resolution before \nus is different.\n  What we have been debating and are about to vote on, is our nation's \nfirst budget of the 21st century. The FY 2000 budget resolution \nrepresents a blueprint for our future. The decisions made on this \nresolution could determine how we live--not just next year--but for a \ngeneration--maybe longer.\n  Before getting into the specifics of the budget proposals before us, \nlet me say a few words about what a budget resolution should do. In my \nview, a budget resolution should be visionary. It should look at \ntoday's circumstances, assess where improvements are needed and apply \nthe appropriate amount of resources.\n  A budget resolution must be fiscally responsible. Prior to 1993, \nprevious Presidents and Congresses have frequently failed to live \nwithin their means. The result was large annual deficits and a $4 \ntrillion national debt. Since 1993, we have reduced the deficits 7 \nyears in a row. Future budget resolutions must continue this pattern.\n  A budget resolution must save money to keep promises we've already \nmade. The federal government has legally binding commitments on \nMedicare, Social Security, child nutrition and student loans to name a \nfew. A budget resolution must live up to the federal government's legal \nobligations in these areas.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a budget resolution must invest in the \nfuture--in things like education, transportation, technology, and \nhealth care--so we can pass the promise of America onto our children.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution before the Senate today does \nnone of these things. This resolution is deceptive and fiscally \nirresponsible in the extreme. It claims to protect Social Security and \nMedicare. It claims to live within our means. In reality, this budget \nfails on both scores. It does not adequately lock away Social Security \ntrust funds and fails to add any resources to Medicare. It also \nincludes hundreds of billions of exploding tax cuts that are paid for \nwith projected surpluses. There is a huge problem with this approach. \nThe tax cuts come and keep on coming whether or not the surpluses ever \nappear.\n  This approach adopted by my Republican colleagues represents a \nradical departure from the policies that lifted America out of \nrecession in the late 1980s and early 1990s and created the strongest \neconomy in a generation. After a decade of massive deficits caused \nprimarily by ballooning tax breaks, President Clinton and a then \nDemocratic Congress embarked on a new path, a path that coupled \nspending cuts with targeted investments and tax cuts for working \nfamilies. This budget abandons that successful approach and will return \nthis country to the large deficits of the 1980s.\n  Even more distressing to me, if we follow this plan, we will squander \nthe best opportunity--perhaps in our lifetimes--to keep our commitments \non Medicare and Social Security and effectively deal with some of the \nmost serious social and economic needs facing our country--now, before \nthey become crises.\n  It is my impression that debate on this year's resolution has been \nshort, indeed, perhaps the shortest in my memory. The reason may well \nbe that there are not a lot of small details to debate. Instead, we \nface a single major question: What should we do with the $4.6 trillion \nin surpluses projected over next 15 years? Without a doubt, this is the \nmost important fiscal decision confronted by Congress in generations. \nWith this budget resolution we face real choices with real \nconsequences. Every family, every business, in America will be \nprofoundly affected by how we answer this one question.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution conference agreement \nmakes too many wrong choices. It is wrong on Social Security and \nMedicare. It is wrong on debt reduction. It is wrong on tax relief with \nits emphasis on tax breaks that favor the wealthiest over working \nfamilies. It is wrong on education, health care, and other critical \ninvestments. Therefore, I've concluded this resolution is wrong for \nAmerica. And I will vote against it.\n  I would like to say a few words about the choices we face in the \nfuture. However, first, I think it's important to take a brief look \nback. When President Clinton took office in 1993, the budget deficit \nwas a whopping $290 billion--the highest level in this nation's \nhistory. And, it was projected to grow to more than $500 billion by \nthis year. In that year, 1993, President and Democratic Congress--\nwithout a single Republican vote--took action; together we passed the \nlargest deficit reduction package in our nation's history.\n  Our political opponents condemned our plan; they predicted economic \nruin. They said it would destroy our economy and trigger a second Great \nDepression. Many who made those predictions are still here today. Many \nwho bravely voted for our plan are not. They knew they were risking \ntheir careers when they voted for our plan. But they did it anyway, \nbecause they believed we could not continue the ruinous economic \npolicies of past.\n  Today, the results of Democrats' 1993 economic plan should be clear \nto all. The deficit has declined 7 years in a row--the first time \nthat's happened in our nation's history. Last year, this nation enjoyed \nthe first unified balanced budget in 30 years. This year, we expect a \n$111 billion unified surplus. In addition, we are experiencing the \nstrongest economy in a generation. Eighteen million new jobs have been \ncreated since 1993. We have the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 30 \nyears--4.5 percent. We have the lowest core inflation rate in more than \n2 decades--2.5 percent. We have witnessed a 2.5 percent rise in wages--\nthe fastest growth in wages in more than 20 years. We are living during \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. Largely as a \nresult of this string of economic good news, the Congressional Budget \nOffice is now projecting budget surpluses for as long as the eye can \nsee--a total of $4.6 trillion over the next 15 years.\n  So Mr. President, we faced the tough questions in 1993. The question \nfacing Congress this year ought to be easy. Then the question was: how \ndo we reduce the deficits? How do we get America working again. Now, \nthe question is: what should we do with the surplus? How do we keep \nAmerica working?\n  We've already proved tough decisions don't have to be cruel \ndecisions. We can continue to make economic progress today, without \nsacrificing our economic future. With the plan we offered this year, \nDemocrats balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--\nwithout gutting our investments in our children's education. We \nbalanced the budget--and cut taxes on working families--without raiding \nSocial Security and Medicare. We balanced the budget--and cut taxes on \nworking families--without sacrificing our ability to protect our \nenvironment. We balanced the budget--and cut taxes on working \nfamilies--without adding more Americans to the rolls of the uninsured. \nIn fact, we found a way to help parents who work full-time, but don't \nhave insurance, to provide health insurance for their children.\n  Our budget plan builds on our past success. We make tough decisions. \nBut we also make smart decisions. We honor the commitments our nation \nmade in the past, and we invest in the future. The Democratic vision \nfor our fiscal future is based on 4 principles. First, we protect and \npreserve Social Security and Medicare. The Democratic plan locks away \nevery penny of the $2.9 trillion Social Security surplus, plus an \nadditional $700 billion for\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nMedicare. We are first to admit: our plan doesn't solve all the issues \nfacing these two important programs. We know we also need to make \nstructural reforms. But, by locking away every penny of Social Security \nand saving 15 percent of the unified surplus for Medicare, we can avoid \na crisis--which dramatically reduces chance of having to make radical \nchanges.\n  Second, our plan pays down the national debt. In 10 years, we can \nreduce our public debt from $3.5 trillion, to $1.6 billion. In 18 \nyears, under our plan, we can eliminate the debt entirely. By 2018, \nAmerica could be debt-free. Debt reduction keeps interest rates down. \nThis means lower mortgage rates, lower rates on car loans, lower \nmonthly credit card bills, and lower student loan bills. It also means \nmore investments for businesses, more economic growth, more jobs, and \nmore opportunity for the future.\n\n  Third, our plan cuts taxes for America's working families. Our plan \nprovides $400 billion in targeted tax relief to help families save for \nretirement and pay for child care. Our plan also includes a $1,000-a-\nyear tax credit for elderly and disabled Americans who need long-term \ncare--or the family members who provide that care. It cuts the marriage \npenalty tax. And, it provides tax credits for research and \nexperimentation.\n  Fourth, our plan invests in America's future--over $400 billion in \nkey priorities. These resources can be used to provide for more \nteachers for our kids, more pay and better housing for our troops, and \nmore law enforcement agents. It provides more for job training, more \nfor safe drinking water and clean air quality. It will result in better \nroads and safer airports and rail lines.\n  The Republicans are offering a very different plan. It makes very \ndifferent choices. Their plan sets aside nothing for Medicare. As I \nsaid earlier, we save 15 percent of the surplus--$700 billion--for \nMedicare. We put it in a real lockbox; these funds can't be used for \nanything but Medicare. Their plan does not save one penny specifically \nfor Medicare. Moreover, when Senate Republicans introduced their budget \nresolution, they said they were setting aside $133 billion for \nMedicare. Later, they revised that figure down to $100 billion. In the \nconference agreement before us today, there's nothing to preserve the \nexisting Medicare program. The truth is Republicans are not setting \naside any money specifically for Medicare. Their budget resolution \nrecommends we extend the solvency of Medicare through benefit cuts \nalone.\n  If we act as this resolution proposes and fail to set aside real \nmoney for Medicare now, and fail to enact real reforms soon, the \nMedicare trust fund will go broke. That would be an emergency of \nstaggering proportions. And the Republican budget does nothing--\nnothing--to prevent it.\n  Their plan does not guarantee one additional day of solvency for \nSocial Security. Under the Democratic plan, Social Security's solvency \nis extended until at least 2055--23 years longer than what's now \nprojected.\n  Now, Republicans say they will set aside 62 percent of the surplus \nfor Social Security--the same as our plan. But nowhere in their plan do \nthey say what they intend to do with that money. While they say they \nwill put every dime of Social Security taxes in the Social Security \ntrust fund, nowhere in their plan do they promise to keep the funds \nthere. Nowhere do they guarantee that Social Security will continue to \nprovide a monthly benefit. Nowhere do they commit to preserve \nunemployment benefits workers now get, or death benefits for their \nsurvivors. In fact, the conference report before us specifically allows \nRepublicans to divert Social Security resources out of Social Security \nand use them to pay for private retirement accounts or additional tax \ncuts.\n  If the Republican majority believes the federal government should \nkeep the commitments it has made, they should say so, clearly, in \nwriting. Social Security taxes for Social Security benefits is not a \ndifficult concept to grasp, and an even easier one to say. Despite all \ntheir rhetoric during the budget debate, the Republican budget \nresolution chooses not to say it. And even worse, it does not do it. \nInstead, the Republican resolution treats Social Security as just \nanother piggy bank to pay for their tax breaks or private retirement \naccounts. That is its second major failing.\n  The third major problem with Republican budget resolution is the \nchoice it makes about who gets tax relief. Our budget targets tax cuts \nto the needs of working families. Republicans say their plan is better \nbecause it contains tax cuts for everyone. That's not true! Under the \n10 percent across-the-board tax cut endorsed by many in their party, \nnearly two-thirds of benefits would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of \nAmericans. If you earn $800,000 a year, you save $20,000 a year in \ntaxes. But if you earn $38,000 a year or less --like 60 percent of \nAmerican families--you'll save $99 a year--27 cents a day. That's if \nyou're lucky. According to the Joint Tax Committee, Congress's official \ntax-estimating body, 48 million middle-class families would get nothing \nunder a 10 percent tax cut. Not a nickel!\n  What would that 27 cents cost America's families? It means there will \nbe nothing left over to protect and preserve Medicare. It also means \ncrippling cuts in education, health care, environment, agriculture, \nfood safety and countless other critical areas. According to an \nanalysis by the Office of Management and Budget, the Republican budget \nwill cut domestic investments by 11 percent across-the-board this year. \nBy 2004, these cuts will grow to 27 percent. The Republican budget \nresolution would eventually force the federal government to cut more \nthan one out of every four dollars it now spends on critical domestic \npriorities. Frankly, it's amazing to me that some of the same people \nwho only weeks ago said Congress would be forced to break budget caps \nthis year can now claim, with a straight face, that they can cut \nfederal spending by 27 percent over next five years.\n  Their tax cut plan is unfair and unworkable, and we all know it. The \nlast time we tried their tax plan--the last time we tried to grow the \neconomy by cutting trillions of dollars in taxes and giving most of the \nmoney to wealthiest Americans--we quadrupled the national debt and ran \nthe economy into the ground.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, there are terrible problems with the \nRepublican budget resolution. Democrats tried to correct these problems \nin the Budget Committee. We tried to make adjustments on the Senate \nfloor. In both places, we were defeated on party-line votes. So, we \nwill pass this conference agreement in a few minutes.\n  And while we may disagree on its merits, we all know, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, this plan will never become law. So, we have a lot \nof work ahead of us in the next several months. Democrats will listen \nto any reasonable, responsible plan anyone wants to propose. We're \nwilling to negotiate across the aisle, and make compromises, to come up \nwith budget proposals that can be signed by the President. However, we \nwill not compromise on our commitments. We will not repeat mistakes of \nthe past. We cannot squander this opportunity.\n\n\n                         the discretionary caps\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to add one response to those who \ncriticize this budget resolution as necessary resulting in all manner \nof dreamed-up, horror-story kind of cuts in federal border agents, food \nsafety inspections, and other programs selected for the maximum scare \nvalue.\n  Here is the truth instead. In 1997, just 2 years ago, the bipartisan \nbudget agreement, and the law that implemented it, set out caps on \ndiscretionary spending for 1998 through 2002. And yes those caps were \nexpected even then to be tight as they were encountered each year. In \nhis budget request for 2000, the President appeared to pledge fealty to \nthose caps for 2000, claiming that the caps could be complied with even \nas CBO demonstrated the President could not deliver on all his spending \npromises without exceeding the caps by at least $17 billion.\n  Further, the respective minority leaders of both the House and the \nSenate castigated the congressional majority for even exploring the \nidea of increasing the caps in this resolution and instead the minority \nleaders reiterated their devotion to the caps set 2 years ago. So this \nbudget resolution does comply with the caps, just as the President and \nthe Democratic congressional leadership insist it should.\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\n  But a fair question would be: how do we fund all the discretionary \nappropriation needs while complying with the discretionary cap \ndiscipline? As always, that will be up to the appropriations process. \nThe budget resolution never dictates to the appropriations committee \nhow individual programs or bills should be funded. What the budget \nresolution does do is suggest in broad categories what some spending \npriorities ought to be, and in some cases, it suggests, as sort of a \nmenu, some spending reductions or other offsets that the appropriators \ncould consider in constructing the 13 appropriation bills. For example, \nthe Senate-passed resolution indicated that repeal of the Davis-Bacon \nAct and the Service Contract Act would save significant construction \nand contract dollars that could be applied to increases in education or \ndefense. Other sources of savings mentioned include food safety \ninspection fees and spectrum lease fees to encourage more efficient use \nof spectrum by both private and government users. And in certain \nspecific budget functions, to offset discretionary spending, some \nfunctions call for the sale of certain federal assets and other assume \nspecific savings amounts in mandatory programs, which include requiring \nsecurities registration for five government-sponsored enterprises and \nother incentives to encourage competition and rededication to their \nmissions. Other functions call for reducing excessive flood insurance \nsubsidies and imply reactions in certain grants to local governments \nthat are often misdirected to those not the most financial needy. If \nthe appropriations fairly consider these as well as many other savings \nitems contemplated in this budget resolution, they will have \nopportunities to provide the increases demanded by some and avoid the \ndecreases in vital programs imagined by others, while still complying \nwith the caps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that completes our work. I \nwant to thank everyone, whether they were with the budget that I \nprepared or whether they were against it, for their cooperation. And I \nthank our leadership for getting that budget down here, and the \nminority leader and the majority leader for helping expedite it.\n  This is the 15th. We know it is a very ominous day out there in \nAmerica. It is tax day. But on a smaller scale, the Budget Act of the \nUnited States says the budget shall be finished in both Houses on this \ndate. I do not think it had anything to do with tax day, but they occur \ntogether every year. Only twice in the 25-year history of the Budget \nAct have we produced budgets in both Houses, the blueprints.\n  They are congressional in nature. They are not Presidential budgets, \nnor does he sign them. It is historic and significant that as we \nattempt to get our work done this year and make sure that the American \npeople understand that we are on target for the issues they are \nconcerned about--Social Security, Medicare, tax reduction, defense \nspending, education and the like--we want them to know that the budget \nis ready to lead us into a new approach for the next millennium.\n  Everyone doesn't agree, but a very large percentage of the Senators \nhere have voted in favor of this new approach, which I believe will add \nsignificantly to the economic future, economic growth and jobs, and at \nthe same time set a pretty good priority for the American Government's \nexpenditures.\n  This does have a philosophical bent to it; that is, if you have \nexcess revenues, you pay down the debt. We have done that. We have \nalmost paid down one-half of the national debt in the next decade--\nrather significant, good for the economy. We believe when you have even \nmore excess than that, some of it ought to go back to the American \npeople by way of tax reductions, tax reform measures and the like.\n  I regret to say that I believe when the American people have \nunderstood all of this, and when they understand these surpluses are \nnot Social Security surpluses, they are over and above that, I think \nthey will agree with us that some of that ought to go back to the \nAmerican taxpayer. I think it is a good balance between the \nGovernment's needs and the taxpayers' rights and the taxpayers' needs.\n  I thank the staff, minority and majority, for the very dedicated \nservice in getting this complicated resolution to the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank everyone for helping.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, I send to the desk S. \nRes. 77 and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 77) commending and congratulating the \n     University of Connecticut Huskies for winning the 1999 NCAA \n     Men's Basketball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is somewhat appropriate, I say to my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut, that the Presiding Officer is \nfrom Ohio. But for Ohio, we would not have made it to the Final Four, \nthe final game.\n  This is a moment of great joy for my colleague and I and for the \npeople of Connecticut. We express our condolences to the delegation \nfrom North Carolina, the home of Duke University. It is a fine \nuniversity with a fine basketball team that led the Nation ranked \nnumber one for a good part of the season. But, unfortunately, on that \nnight of March 29 in St. Petersburg, FL, the Blue Devils met the Husky \nteam from Connecticut in what many have described as one of the best \nnational championship finals in collegiate basketball history. \nUltimately,\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nour team from the University of Connecticut prevailed. To say that \nthere is a great sense of pride in Connecticut and enthusiasm and joy \nover this victory is to understate the case by a considerable margin. \nWe are a State that, over many years, has had to export our allegiances \nin athletics. We have had a hockey team and a women's professional \nbasketball team, both of which have left our State. There is a good \npossibility we will be the home of the New England Patriots in the not-\ntoo-distant future. In the meantime, it has been our men and women's \nbasketball teams at UCONN that have captured the attention of everybody \nin our State, and I might say, as well, beyond our State's borders. I \nthink a good part of the Nation was rooting for this 9\\1/2\\ point \nunderdog on March 29 as they prevailed in this great victory.\n  I want to mention a couple of people if I can. First of all is Jim \nCalhoun, the Head Coach of the UCONN men's basketball team. He has been \nwith the team for 13 years and has had a wonderful, wonderful record, \nincluding capturing the 1988 NIT title and appearing in six ``Sweet \n16's,'' and three ``Elite 8\" rounds. And he has now led the team to \nvictory in the national championship. He is not only a outstanding \ncoach, but also a wonderful human being with great dedication to his \nteam, his players, the university, and our State. As well, his coaching \nstaff is a fine group of people who have also dedicated so much energy \nand time to making this team the success it has been.\n  I would also like to mention some of our UCONN players and commend a \ncouple of the fine athletes who made such significant contributions in \nthe championship game.\n  Our sophomore guard is Khalid El-Amin. We thank the State of \nMinnesota because he was a native and decided to make the University of \nConnecticut his home for basketball purposes. He has been a sparkplug \nfor our team and has done a tremendous job. As many will recall, he \nmade two free throws in that final game with only 5.2 seconds left, \nwhich absolutely iced the victory for UCONN.\n  Richard Hamilton has become one of the great players in collegiate \nhistory. He was the Most Valuable Player of the NCAA tournament, the \nMost Valuable Player in the Big East tournament this year, and is truly \none of the great, great players not only at the University of \nConnecticut, but also throughout the Nation.\n  Other players like Ricky Moore, Kevin Freeman, and Jake Voskuhl did a \ngreat job as well, all contributing when it counted most. Moore and \nFreeman, I think, deserve special recognition for proving that defense \nis valuable. It is not just who can score the most points, but who can \nbe a great defensive player. Both of them did a terrific job in proving \nthe value of that element of this wonderful, unique game now played \nworldwide. Basketball is a game that began in Springfield, MA, \nsomething that we in America take pride in as it is a sport that is \nhome-grown.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, the fans, the student body, the \nadministration, Phillip Austin, President of the university, the Board \nof Trustees, and the faithful alumni were all in that arena to watch \nthe Ohio State game, and then the final game on Monday. They were both \ngreat games. I know the former Governor of that State, the occupant of \nthe Chair, takes great pride in Ohio State. The coach of your team was \nan assistant coach at the University of Connecticut. He was in Florida \nand rooting for Connecticut, I can tell you, during that final game. I \nam sure he would have liked to have been coaching that game instead, \nbut despite not being there himself, and given his former relationship \nwith the University of Connecticut, it is understandable how he felt a \nspecial affection for the UCONN team.\n  Again, Mr. President, as I began, let me end. This was a great moment \nfor our State. The people are very proud of the accomplishments of this \nteam and our university. Senator Lieberman and I wanted to take a \nmoment out of the Senate business to recognize the accomplishments of \nthese fine young men of the University of Connecticut and thank the \npeople of our State who have so faithfully supported them throughout \nthese many years.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to recognize all the coaches \nand players of the 1999 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship team: Head \nCoach Jim Calhoun, Associate Head Coach Dave Leitao, Assistant Coach \nKarl Hobbs, Assistant Coach Tom Moore, Beau Archibald, Justin Brown, \nKhalid El-Amin, Kevin Freeman, Richard Hamilton, E.J. Harrison, \nRashamel Jones, Antric Klaiber, Ricky Moore, Albert Mouring, Edmund \nSaunders, Souleymane Wane, and Jake Voskuhl.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague, an equally fervent champion and \nfan of the UCONN team.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Hear, hear, Mr. President. I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut. I am proud to join with him in introducing \nthis resolution commemorating what was truly one of the most thrilling \nand uplifting moments in the modern history of our State--and I do not \nsay that lightly--the national championship won by the University of \nConnecticut men's basketball team.\n  I think to understand what this achievement means to our relatively \nsmall State, my colleagues have to understand what this UCONN team has \nmeant for the last decade to the people of Connecticut. I don't think \nthere are many teams in the country that have a more rabid following \nthan our Huskies. From their home base in Storrs, clear across the \nState to Stamford, from Stonington in the east to Salisbury in the \nnorthwest, every basketball season, the people of Connecticut are \ngripped with a delirium known affectionately as ``Huskymania,'' which \nmakes every day of the season seem like March Madness in Connecticut. \nThe interest is so intense that the Huskies, hailing from the third \nsmallest State in America, travel with the largest contingent of \nreporters in all of college basketball, referred to simply as ``the \nhorde.''\n  Now, Mr. President, over the last decade, Huskymania has been \nheightened by the enormous success of our great coach, Jim Calhoun and \nathletic director, Lew Perkins. UCONN has dominated the storied Big \nEast Conference, winning six regular season championships, \ndistinguishing itself in NCAA tournament play, advancing to the Elite \nEight three different times. The one thing missing was a trip to the \nfabled Final Four and a national championship, and that dream was \nrealized on March 29 with the victory over the Duke Blue Devils in what \nhas to have been, not just for Connecticut fans, but for basketball \nfans all over the country, one of the great games in recent history of \ncollege basketball.\n  The Huskies' thrilling victory touched off a joyous celebration in \nour State, which is normally known as ``the land of steady habits,'' an \nexhilaration which I experienced literally firsthand that night. I \ncould not go to Florida to see the game, but I did the next best \nthing--I went to Coach's Bar and Grill in Hartford, CT, which is \npartially owned by Coach Calhoun. Let me just say to my colleagues on \nthe floor, I was, by far, the senior citizen in the bar that night. It \nseemed like about half of the State's under-30 population was there. \nThe fervor was intense and the joy extreme when the game was over.\n  Let me say that we are proud of this victory, but we are also really \nproud of the values that are part of it--the teamwork, the sacrifice, \nthe sportsmanship, the determination and the dignity this team and its \ncoach showed in scrapping and hustling their way to the pinnacle of \ncollege basketball. The character of this UCONN team is an apt \nreflection of their great coach, Jim Calhoun, who is a great coach \nbecause he is a great man, a man of indomitable spirit, tremendous \nvalues, and a great pursuit of excellence. I am thrilled that Coach \nCalhoun is finally getting his due as one of the Nation's great \ncoaches.\n  For now, I am grateful for the wonderful gift that Jim and his \nplayers have given the people of Connecticut, for the way they brought \nsuch a diverse State together and reaffirmed our sense of community, \nfor living up to our highest ideals of sport and--if you will allow me \na pun in the name of the Huskies--for showing that every dog does \nindeed have their day.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, if I may close somewhat unusually, at Coach's Bar \nand Grill on the night of the game, one of the young men there, at a \ncritical moment in the first half, turned to me and asked me if I would \nlead the UCONN cheer, and I did that. I was\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\ncriticized the first time because they said my N's were not too good. \nYou will see what I mean in a moment. As the game went on, I was called \non repeatedly to lead this cheer, and of course, we in Coach's Bar and \nGrill feel that made the margin of difference in the victory that \noccurred in Florida that night.\n  If you will allow me, Mr. President, here is the cheer: U-C-O-N-N, \nUCONN, UCONN, UCONN.\n  Thank you. I urge adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 77) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 77), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 77\n\n       Whereas the University of Connecticut men's basketball team \n     capped a remarkable season by defeating the top-ranked Duke \n     Blue Devils 77-74, on March 29, 1999, in St. Petersburg, \n     Florida, to win its 1st national championship in its 1st \n     ``Final Four'' appearance;\n       Whereas the Huskies finished with a regular season record \n     of 34-2, the best in the program's proud 96 years of \n     competition;\n       Whereas the Huskies firmly established themselves as the \n     dominant team of the decade in the storied Big East \n     Conference, winning their 6th regular season title and their \n     4th tournament championship of the 1990s;\n       Whereas UConn's Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton distinguished \n     himself in the championship game and throughout the season as \n     one of the premier players in all of college basketball, \n     winning his 2d Big East Player of the Year award, earning 1st \n     team All-America honors, and closing out a spectacular \n     offensive performance in the NCAA tournament by being named \n     the most valuable player of the Final Four.\n       Whereas UConn's senior co-captain Ricky Moore distinguished \n     himself as one of the Nation's top defensive players, \n     personifying the grit, determination, and fierce will to win \n     that carried the Huskies throughout the year;\n       Whereas UConn coach Jim Calhoun instilled in his players an \n     unceasing ethic of dedication, sacrifice, and teamwork in the \n     pursuit of excellence, and instilled in the rest of us a \n     renewed appreciation of what it means to win with dignity, \n     integrity, and true sportsmanship;\n       Whereas the Huskies' thrilling victory in the NCAA \n     championship game enraptured their loyal and loving fans from \n     Storrs to Stamford, taking ``Huskymania'' to new heights and \n     filling the State with an overwhelming sense of pride, honor, \n     and community;\n       Whereas the UConn basketball team's national championship \n     spotlighted one of the Nation's premier State universities, \n     that is committed to academic as well as athletic excellence: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends and congratulates the \n     Huskies of the University of Connecticut for winning the 1999 \n     NCAA Men's Basketball Championship.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the president of the University of \n     Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3758-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3758-S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNIFORMED SERVICES FILING FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me explain for a moment where we \nare here. We have, by unanimous consent, 1 hour equally divided on S. \n767.\n  S. 767 is cosponsored by Senators Levin, Roth, Torricelli, Abraham, \nCleland, McCain, Allard, Helms, Collins, Brownback, Frist, Johnson, \nHagel, Bryan, DeWine and Grams. Senate bill 767 is identical to the \nlegislation that passed unanimously in the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, and which will be here later this afternoon at about 4 \no'clock. When that gets here, we will vote on the House version rather \nthan the substitute that I just described because there has been an \nobjection on the other side. It is a bit perplexing. But we have had an \nobjection. We don't want internal differences to in any way for one \nmoment delay the intent of this bill. I think everybody will understand \nthat in a moment. So we are just simply setting the objection aside and \nwe will accept the House version. I am sure it will be an overwhelming \nvote.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the clerk to report the bill by title.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 767) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to provide a 2-month extension for the date for filing a tax \n     return for any member of a uniformed service on a tour of \n     duty outside of the United States for a period which includes \n     the normal due date for such filing.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport legislation that will help our men and women serving in \nOperation Allied Force.\n  I might point out that part of the reason we are accepting this House \nversion, due to this skirmish on the Senate floor yesterday afternoon, \nis because we only have some 12 hours left. This is April 15. These \nfamilies needed to get this message, frankly, yesterday. But today I am \nconfident that this relief, this comfort, that we are offering to the \nmen and women who are on the front line today in Kosovo will be of \nenormous comfort and assistance to their spouses and to their families.\n  In short, the legislation does three things.\n  I might point out that the Senate substitute was identical in \nlanguage to the House version that will be coming here later this \nafternoon on which we will vote.\n  The legislation does three things.\n  First, it exempts all U.S. troops serving in the Yugoslav theater of \noperations from being taxed on their hazardous duty pay. That is the \nadditional pay they receive over their regular pay for being a \nhazardous operation. That will not be taxed when this passes. The \ndanger pay that you receive on the periphery of the combat theater will \nnot be taxed.\n  Second, it grants our troops a 180-day filing extension for their \n1999 income tax return. The 180 days begins when they return from duty \nin the combat zone.\n  Third, it exempts our troops from the 3 percent excise tax levied on \nlong-distance telephone calls to reduce somewhat the burden of a long-\ndistance call home whenever they have a chance to do that.\n  Several days ago, the President signed an Executive order declaring \nYugoslavia and certain areas surrounding it a combat zone. This \ndeclaration in turn provides troops serving in the zone with certain \ntax breaks which this legislation will codify and expand. It will \nexpand it, for example, to troops like those in Georgia who are \nfulfilling the refueling missions in the combat zone. The bill takes \nthe President's order a step further by providing these same level of \ntax breaks and filing extensions to those personnel who have been \nrelocated to the combat zone area and are receiving imminent danger \npay.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe this is an important additional provision \nthat the President by law cannot extend through an Executive order. At \na time when our men and women are putting their lives on the line in \nthe name of freedom, we should do what we can to relieve some of the \nworries associated with income tax burdens and filings associated with \nthe timing of the conflict occurring within 2 weeks of income tax day, \nApril 15.\n  Mr. President, we have several other Senators who are here to speak \non the measure. Before they get here, let me briefly say that we are \ndeeply appreciative for the enormous bipartisan support--and I named \nthe coauthors on both sides of the aisle--to get this done. My one \nregret is that we have been delayed a day by ``internal process.'' That \nis the most polite way to describe it. But we are going to get this \ndone.\n  I hope anybody who is watching or listening to this who is related in \nany way to the families and spouses of those troops for whom we think \nof every minute of every day will tell them that their significant \nincome tax relief burden is being lifted so that they ought not have to \nstand in that long car line sometime tonight trying to get this in. \nThey have been granted an extension, and a significant one. Depending \non the pay grades of those involved, there is rather substantial tax \nrelief, because, as I said a moment ago, with the passage of this act, \nthose additional pays that are received by these troops for hazardous \nduty or imminent danger will not have an income tax applied against \nthem. So it should be very meaningful.\n  Let me quickly say that this is no windfall. If anybody listening to \nme has ever been around a serviceperson\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nwho was called away for combat, just stop and think about it. All kinds \nof new costs come into play. You have a breadwinner that is somewhere \nelse. You are trying to communicate. You have many associated costs.\n  So what we are doing here is not a windfall. It is a move to help \nthose families deal with the inordinate kinds of problems that are \nassociated with taking care of the family when only half the parents \nare still there. In all practicality, this probably doesn't do enough. \nBut I hope that for anybody listening this will be a reminder that the \nCongress is trying to do everything it can to be of assistance to those \ntroops.\n  I see I have been joined by my distinguished colleague from Maine. I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I commend the leadership of my good friend from \nGeorgia in taking the initiative in this area. It is typical of his \nleadership on so many issues. I am very pleased to join him today on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I rise today as a cosponsor of the Uniformed Services Filing Fairness \nAct of 1999 introduced by my good friend, Senator Coverdell, and as a \nsupporter of H.R. 1376, which we will vote on shortly. These measures \nare intended to demonstrate concretely and clearly our support for the \nmen and women serving our country in the region of Yugoslavia by \nproviding them with tax relief on their hazardous duty pay, excise tax \nexemptions on their long-distance telephone calls, and an extension to \nallow them to file their tax returns after the April 15 deadline.\n\n  Today is tax day, a day when millions of Americans rush to their \nlocal Post Offices to mail their tax returns. However, today some brave \nAmericans find themselves thousands of miles away from their hometowns \nengaged in a conflict rather than concerned with a tax filing deadline. \nToday and every day, our troops put their lives on the line. The \nsacrifices they make in serving our Nation both here at home and abroad \nprompt our gratitude. For those forces stationed overseas, the toll is \nespecially great. Our troops now serving in the operations in Kosovo \nface tremendous burdens in trying to carry out their missions while \nprotecting themselves and their comrades. Our service men and women \nabroad face the additional hardships and stress of being separated from \ntheir loved ones, their families, their homes, and their friends. These \ntroops deserve the opportunity to concentrate on their dangerous \nmission without having to worry about government paperwork at home.\n  This legislation is an opportunity to demonstrate our support for our \ntroops by our actions, not just with our words. My thoughts and my \nprayers are with those brave men and women and their families here at \nhome. I urge my colleagues to support this modest but important \nmeasure. Again, I commend the Senator from Georgia for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom Maine for her statement and all of her energy, which I appreciate \nand enjoy so much, on so many subjects. I thank her very much for \nspeaking on the importance of this measure.\n  We deal with so many varied issues that sometimes a very simple, \nclean-cut act like this gets overlooked in the thrashing about that \ngoes on in Washington.\n  I am pleased that the Congress has been able to do this, and do this \nexpeditiously. I just asked my young assistant to make sure that the \nminute this passes, probably between 4 o'clock and 4:30, the Pentagon \nmakes sure all of our troops get this message quickly. They need to \nhelp us make sure the comfort represented by this legislation is \nunderstood as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are all keenly aware of the demands that \nwe place on our troops, the circumstances in which they must live and \nwork, and the unique sacrifices that they make to serve our country. \nFiling tax returns is a duty we all must bear to support our nation, \nbut it is particularly difficult for service members overseas, who face \nthis burden thousands of miles from home and without the resources and \nassistance available to the rest of us. When those troops are placed in \nharms' way, the burden becomes immeasurably greater.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Coverdell and I introduced S. 767, the \nUniformed Services Filing Fairness Act of 1999. This bill would have \nextended by two months the date by which members of the uniformed \nservices on duty abroad must file their Federal income tax returns. \nCurrent Treasury regulations provide for an automatic two month \nextension for U.S. citizens and residents on military duty outside of \nthe United States. S. 767 would have codified this regulation into law, \nthereby ensuring that members of the military would not be subject to \nfines and penalties when they avail themselves of this relief.\n  This week, the President addressed the same problem by issuing an \nexecutive order designating the Kosovo area of operations as a ``combat \nzone'' for the purpose of tax relief benefits. This designation will \nprovide the following benefits:\n  The deadline for filing and paying taxes will be extended;\n  Military pay for months served in the combat zone will be exempt from \nincome taxes; and\n  Telephone calls out of the combat zone will be exempt from the \ntelephone excise tax.\n  Today, the Senate will pass and send to the President a House bill \nthat is a companion measure to bill that Senator Coverdell and I \nintroduced earlier this year. This bill shows Congress' support for the \nPresident's decision by codifying this executive order into law. In \naddition, the bill extends the area covered by the exemption to include \nnot only aircrews flying missions into the combat zone, but also \nmembers of the armed forces supporting those operations in the area of \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the \nAdriatic Sea, and the northern Ionian Sea. I think we all know the \ndangers and hardships that our troops in these areas are facing on a \ndaily basis, and want to support them in any way we can.\n  I am pleased that Congress, by enacting this bill, will join the \nPresident in showing support for our men and women in combat. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the enactment of this legislation.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have been joined by the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Georgia for recognizing me \nand for bringing this bill forward.\n  It was 2 weeks ago yesterday that I was at McConnell airbase in \nWichita, KS, meeting with troops that afternoon heading out to run \nrefueling missions and other activities in support of the Kosovo \noperation. They were in their working uniforms with a number of spouses \nand some children present. They were determined and ready to go. They \nsaid, ``This is our job,'' and they were saluting and saying they were \noff to do it even though they had questions: What is the objective? How \nwill we get this done? How long will it last? We did not have good \nanswers for them, but I said we would press for those answers.\n  In speaking with a couple of the spouses afterwards, they noted their \nhusbands had been deployed more than 200 days last year and they were \nhaving difficulty with that length of time of deployment. Also, they \nsaid: We love being part of the military, we want to do our job, but we \nfeel we are being hamstrung by some of the things required of us.\n  They don't believe some of the pay is quite enough, and I don't think \nit is enough for them.\n  What I see in this bill of Senator Coverdell is a statement to some \nof the people at McConnell airbase, and others throughout Kansas who \nare serving in the military, that we want to help and do what we can in \ntough situations because you are going into the toughest situation that \na nation could possibly send you. You are going in to face a hostile \nenemy, putting your lives on the line, your blood on the line. We are \nasking you to do it and you are doing it. The least we can do--God \nbless you, we want to help any way we can--is to do something to help.\n  This 2-month extension for the due date for filing a tax return for \nany member of a uniformed service on a\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\ntour of duty outside the United States for a period including the \nnormal due date for such filing is a small statement. It is a small \nact, but it is a good act. It is an important act and an important \nstatement for us to tell those people in uniform and their families \nthat we do care, we do hear you, and we want to try to respond in any \nway we possibly can.\n  We need to do a lot more. We need to up the pay to people in the \nmilitary. We need to be questioning all the places we are sending our \nmilitary around the world, how many times we are deploying them. We \nneed to upgrade the military's hardware. I think that is important. One \nthing we recently did for the Nation's defense was to pass on the \nnational missile defense bill. We need to do that.\n  I noted to those at McConnell airbase and those attending the nine \ntownhall meetings I had across Kansas last week a chart showing the \npercentage of the Federal budget going to military defense spending. \nAbout 17 percent of our budget is now going to military defense \nspending. In 1962--not all that long ago--it was nearly 50 percent \ngoing into our military budget.\n  I noted that the amount we invest in the military--which does the \nvery basic thing we are called on to do, which is to provide for the \ncommon defense--is going to need to go up if we are going to continue \nthe far-flung operations that the United States is involved in around \nthe world. We cannot maintain this pace in this many places on this \nbudget.\n\n  That is all they are asking. They are saying: I will put my life on \nthe line, I will subject my family to this, I believe in the United \nStates, and I believe in our cause, but, gosh, can't you help us out a \nlittle bit? Can't you make sure that people aren't on food stamps? \nCan't you address some of these issues? And we should.\n  This is a bill to help some of those people. Some Members may have \nconflicting opinions on our involvement in Kosovo, but we can all agree \nthat our service men and women should not be penalized for their \nservice to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude for risking \ntheir lives to represent our country. Our soldiers defend the liberties \nwe hold dear, and we should not be arbitrarily penalizing them in our \nTax Code for their work to protect our country.\n  With that, I say to my colleague from Georgia I am very appreciative \nof the bill the Senator has put forward, of the effort to recognize the \nneeds of our people in uniform. I support wholeheartedly this bill and \nsay God bless to our soldiers who are in uniform and in harm's way \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nsupport and for his observations of his visit with the troops about to \ndepart. That is always an emotional time.\n  I think it is worthy to note that of every discussion--and there has \nbeen considerable debate about this operation--one thing for which \nthere is no debate is the loyalty, the dedication, and the precision \nwith which these troops have exercised what their Government told them \nto do. That loyalty and that desire to do it, do it well, and do it \nright, cannot go unnoticed by anybody who is in their presence. I am \nglad the Senator referred to that particular incident.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will not need the 12\\1/2\\ minutes. I do want to \nreiterate that this legislation does three very specific things to \nbring comfort to our troops in the combat zone. It exempts all U.S. \ntroops serving in the Yugoslavian theater of operations from being \ntaxed on their hazardous duty pay. They will not be taxed on that. \nHopefully, that will help them deal with the extra costs related to \nperforming this duty.\n  No. 2, it will grant a 180-day filing extension for their 1998 income \ntax return, and the 180 days begins on the day they leave the combat \nzone.\n  Third, it exempts our troops from the 3 percent excise tax levied on \nlong-distance telephone calls.\n  We will notify the Pentagon, as I said, later this afternoon, and \nhope they will assist us in making sure the troops in the operation \ntheaters are aware of this so it can help bring some comfort. I know \nall of us in America understand the confusion that surrounds tax day. I \nhave been on the phone about five times. So, I hope mitigating that \npressure will be of help and make it a little easier for them as they \nperform the missions they have been assigned by the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nbe yielded back with respect to S. 767.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is allocated on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is the Senator asking that all time is yielded?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It was my understanding all time was to be yielded on \nthe measure. I am sorry. I yield back all of our time.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the House bill will arrive at \napproximately 4:15. A rollcall vote will occur on passage of this bill \nas soon as it arrives from the House.\n\n  In the meantime, following the statement of the Senator, I ask \nunanimous consent there be a period of morning business with Members \nlimited to 10 minutes each, with the exception of Senator Roth for up \nto 30 minutes and Senator Grams for up to an hour.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Parliamentary inquiry. When the Senator refers to ``this \nbill,'' is he referring to the House-passed bill?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just wanted to make a brief statement in \nsupport of this move to help our service men and women and to point out \nthat I tried to amend the Senate bill with a very straightforward sense \nof the Senate which just said we should ask the Pentagon to ensure, if \nthere are parents of minor children called up and both are sent to \ncombat, that they do everything in their power to ensure that one of \nthose parents is not actually in combat.\n  Unfortunately, as the Senator from Georgia said, there was objection \nfor some reason to this approach. I just want to say again, I do not \nunderstand that. We passed something very similar during the gulf war. \nWe care about the tax burden of our men and women in uniform, and we \nshould. How about caring about their families, their children?\n  Many of us have seen ``Saving Private Ryan,'' or know the story. I \ncannot understand why we could not simply amend the Senate version of \nthis bill with this very simple sense of the Senate asking the Pentagon \nto do what they could to ensure a mother and father were not sent into \ncombat leaving behind a small child.\n  Having said that, I hope I can bring that up in the future as a \nfreestanding measure, and I certainly do support the House bill that is \ncoming over to give our people relief. They deserve it and they also \ndeserve protection for their children, should a husband and wife be \ncalled into combat.\n  Mr. President, I will not object to us yielding back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased the House Ways and Means \nCommittee began to act on this issue by passing this bill and the bill \npassing the full House will come over to the Senate, which we can also \nthen pass. Clearly, our service men and women, particularly those in \nharm's way, deserve all the support we can possibly give them. The \nprovision we are now discussing which releases them of income tax \nliability during the time they are serving in a zone of danger, \nparticularly in Kosovo, is the very least we can do.\n  Similarly, the provisions in the bill coming over from the House \nwhich provide for all men and women on active duty wherever they may be \nserving overseas to get the 60-day extension, and also have penalties \npotentially against them for late filing waived--that, too, is very \nimportant. Mr. President, I think it is the very least we can do at \nthis point.\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\n  In addition to our service men and women, there are also other \nAmericans in harm's way in the war zone, performing above and beyond \nthe call of duty. I am talking about employees of the State Department. \nI am talking about other groups of people over there, serving, doing \ntheir utmost, who are in equally dangerous situations. At some future \npoint I believe they also deserve due recognition in the same way as \nour military. We support our Americans. We deeply support our fellow \nAmericans serving in the Balkans. I am very pleased the House has \nacted, and the Senate will be acting very soon.\n  I might say, I am also pleased the House approached this matter in \nthe proper way. That is, they brought it up in the House tax-writing \ncommittee, the Ways and Means Committee, where the bill was discussed. \nIt was marked up in the committee and then went to the House floor. \nThat is the preferable way of doing business.\n\n  In this case, there was an attempt for a bill to be filed at the desk \nand then brought up directly on the floor on this issue, not going \nthrough the Senate tax-writing committee, the Senate Finance Committee. \nI hope we go back to the usual course of business as a general rule \nwhere tax bills go through the Finance Committee before they are \nbrought to the floor. I say that because the legislation will be much \nbetter. It will be thought through. There is a chance to correct \nmistakes. There is a chance to add on measures that should be added on \nor subtract out measures that should be subtracted out.\n  Having said that, obviously time is of the essence in this case, and \nthe House Ways and Means Committee has acted; that is, the authorizing \ncommittee in the other body did act so we did have at least that \nassurance this has been looked at with some considerable examination.\n  I will be very pleased when the House bill comes over. We will be \nable to vote on it. That will probably be within the hour. As I said, I \nhope after we do that we can give also the same kind of thought to \nother Americans who are also serving in the zone who are also \nsacrificing to a great degree in serving our country.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  (Pursuant to the order of April 14, 1999, the bill (S. 767) was \nreturned to the Calendar.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3761-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, it is my privilege to speak on the \nquestion of Kosovo and our military and political goals there. In \nworking with my staff to put together some background and understand \nthe history of that region, I came across an interesting fact, because \nI value history. What is it Winston Churchill once said? How do you \nknow where you are going unless you know where you have been?\n  I find it fascinating, after 146 B.C., the Roman Republic was the \nworld's only superpower--that sounds familiar--following the \ndestruction of its long-time superpower rival, Carthage. This Roman \ntriumph created a tremendous expansion of Roman territory, wealth, and \ninfluence and, not coincidentally, an expansion of Roman involvement in \nlocal conflicts far removed from Italy.\n  One such intervention involved the Northern African kingdom of \nNumidia, where Rome became entangled in a seccession struggle in 112 \nB.C., with the Roman Senate declaring actually war against Jugurtha, \nthe leading contender for the Numidian throne. What followed is \nfascinating. It is described in a book called the ``Anatomy of Error: \nAncient Military Disasters and Their Lessons for Modern Strategists.''\n  I think there are some lessons here for us, particularly as we view \nKosovo today.\n  Viewed from a modern perspective, North Africa in the age of Jugurtha \nwas in many ways Rome's Vietnam. The Jugurthine War is the story of the \nfailure of the Romans to find a strategy that would determine the \nappropriate level of force needed to maintain sound and stable foreign \npolicy.\n\n       The Romans should have learned to operate according to the \n     rules that Clausewitz later laid out in his book ``On War'': \n     that war is always to be regarded as the pursuit of policy by \n     other means and that strategy is the art of using exactly the \n     appropriate amount of force to accomplish the ends of the \n     policy. The Romans never had a clear policy in Numidia.\n\n  This is something we have to avoid in Kosovo. We need a clear policy.\n\n       Thus the Romans never had a rational strategy for winning \n     the war.\n\n  Another mistake we have to avoid.\n\n       As a result, they poured a massive amount of military force \n     into the region and accomplished worse than nothing.\n\n  Mr. President, we can't accomplish worse than nothing in Kosovo. We \nhave to accomplish something of which we can be proud. The horrifying \nscenes unfolding in and around Kosovo today are indeed a sad recap of \nmany of the worst images of our 20th century: Massive refugee flight to \nuncertain futures, civilian casualties, large numbers of destroyed \nhomes and shops and communities, ethnic intolerance, and hostilities \nfanned by demagogic political leaders.\n  The hearts of Americans and people around the world have been truly \ntouched by the incredible tragic plight of the Kosovar Albanians who \nhave been the primary victims of the incredible, reprehensible, so-\ncalled ethnic cleansing policies of Milosevic.\n  This is also a difficult situation. There are no easy answers, and \nany choice the President makes and, indeed, any choice the Congress \nmakes is fraught with danger. Part of this, I think, is the world in \nwhich we live, not a new world order but a new world disorder.\n\n  The post-cold-war order is one of disorder. The two administrations \nwhich have confronted the post-Soviet Union world, the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations, have grappled mightily with the complexities of this \nnew age in foreign places, much like the Roman Empire, foreign places \nlike Iraq, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Haiti, and now Kosovo. \nAlmost every step in these areas has been subjected to questioning and \ncontroversy before, during, and even after the operation in question.\n  The decision to authorize the use of airstrikes against Serbia was \none of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make. I have \nfelt in the weeks since much like President Kennedy described himself. \nHe said he was an optimist with no illusions. I am an optimist. I am an \nidealist. I want to take the high ground. I thought that NATO and \nAmerica needed to act, and act then, and airstrikes was our best \noption. Maximum impact on Milosevic, minimum impact on us. But it was a \ntough decision to make, and I am under no illusion that this is going \nto automatically get us to where we want to go in terms of our policies \nin the Balkans.\n  May I say that we have a major humanitarian interest in providing \neffective relief for the refugees and preventing further atrocities \nagainst civilians by the Milosevic regime. We certainly have a strong \ninterest in stopping the spread of this conflict to the surrounding \ncountries in this historically unstable region.\n  I find it interesting that the century opened in 1914 with a Serb \nnationalist assassinating Archduke Ferdinand and that led to the guns \nof August in 1914. We have to make sure that the current Milosevic-\nmisled nationalism does not lead to the guns of 1999.\n  Unfortunately, I think that no real military, or so far diplomatic, \napproach we have come up with can really fully guarantee our goals in \nthe Balkans. Despite my concern about our long-term policy in Kosovo \nand the Balkans, the Senate was asked to vote at a point when NATO had \nalready united in favor of airstrikes. American troops were poised to \nembark on their mission and the credibility of American commitments was \non the line.\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\n  Under these circumstances, I felt that we must not send a signal of \ndisunity to Milosevic, to our NATO allies, to the President, to our own \npeople.\n  While these circumstances dictated my vote for airstrikes, by no \nmeans--and I have made this clear--by no means does this indicate my \ngiving a green light for an open-ended, ill-defined, deeper commitment \nof American military force in Kosovo, especially the introduction of \nAmerican ground troops.\n  Mr. President, I was on the ground in Vietnam 31 years ago. I don't \nwant this generation to repeat that experience. We do not need an open-\nended, ill-defined commitment of American ground forces in the Balkans. \nI hope and pray that we can avoid that.\n  I hope and expect that any such future expansion of military might \nthere would be thoroughly discussed and debated in our country and \nwithin NATO before it is undertaken, not after the decision has been \nalready made. I oppose American ground troops in Kosovo. I think this \nwould represent further intervention in that civil war within \ninternationally recognized borders, Yugoslavia. I think it would be in \npursuit of objectives which are not vital to the United States or NATO \nand would do little, frankly, to secure the long-term interests that we \ndo have in the Balkans--stability and economic prosperity.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, has often cited \nthe following quotation from one of my personal heroes, Senator Richard \nRussell. It is an honor I cherish that I hold his seat in the Senate \nand his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator Russell 30 \nyears ago in this Chamber, while I was in Vietnam, said this:\n\n       While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we \n     should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards of life and \n     limb in pursuing them. As for me, my fellow Americans, I \n     shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a \n     single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat \n     unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our \n     country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a \n     commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support \n     and protection of which we are capable.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been my honor to visit some of the troops and \nfacilities in Georgia that are supporting our efforts in Kosovo and the \nBalkans and in western Europe, some of the troops in Fort Stewart, \ntroops at Robins Air Force Base. I know what it means to be a troop out \nthere committed on behalf of this country and to have this country \ndivided. It is not fun. It is not what we want to repeat. And with air \noperations now ongoing, with Americans soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines in harm's way, our thoughts must turn to them as they tackle a \nvery complicated and very risky mission. Our prayers are with them, and \nwe pray for their safe return in every way.\n  As with every American military deployment, there are risks. That is \nwhy I have chosen to visit some of the places in Georgia that have sent \nyoung men and women into harm's way, including the 93rd Air Control \nWing of JSTARS Aircraft out of Robins Air Force Base; the 19th Air \nRefueling Group of KC135R Aircraft--which participated, by the way, in \nthe rescue of our downed stealth fighter pilot--also out of Robins; and \nthe 94th Airlift Wing of the C-130 transports out of Dobbins Air \nReserve Base, not to mention the numerous other Georgia citizens \nserving in our deployed forces in the Balkans.\n\n  My primary purpose today is to look beyond the military phase at our \nBalkans policy and ahead to the elements which I believe we must \nconsider if we are to have a truly successful exit strategy. I said \ntoday in our hearings that there is one thing a Vietnam veteran does \nnot like to hear and that is ``no win.'' There is another thing and \nthat is ``no exit.'' Put those together and that becomes a tragedy: \n``no win, no exit.'' We can't have that situation in the Balkans. We \nneed a successful exit strategy which produces a long-term, stable, and \nhumane outcome, one which also will allow our service men and women to \ncome home safely from the Balkans without having to return again. I \nbelieve we ought to have a full debate on our exit strategies now, and \nnot just on exit strategies, but on what constitutes victory. I think \nwe still have to nail that down. But certainly we ought to talk about \nnot just how we get in and what we do there, but how do we get out.\n  Even while military operations are still underway, we must not repeat \nthe mistakes the Romans made in the Jugurthine war, or the mistakes we \nmade in the Vietnam war--pursuing both ``no win\" and ``no exit'' at the \nsame time.\n  In spite of substantial disagreements about the appropriate ways to \ngo about our goals in the Balkans, I think there is some consensus in \nthis country and in NATO regarding our ultimate goals:\n  1. An end to atrocities in Kosovo.\n  2. Effective relief for refugees.\n  3. A negotiated political settlement, in terms of the status of \nKosovo.\n  4. Stability throughout the Balkans, including Kosovo, Bosnia, \nMacedonia, Albania and Montenegro.\n  Another important goal, it seems to me, is an end to the U.S. and \nother NATO country force deployments in the Balkans, in other than a \nlegitimate peacekeeping rather than warmaking role.\n  Any effective exit strategy must indicate how we can achieve these \nends, including the costs for doing so and also the costs for not doing \nso. Our involvement in Bosnia has cost us $10 billion already. I \nunderstand that the price tag, through October, for our involvement now \nin Kosovo will cost some $8 billion. We owe it to both the people in \nthe region, as well as to our own service men and women, to determine \nwhat price we are prepared to pay in order to make their sacrifices in \nthe military operations they are involved in worthwhile in the long \nrun. Otherwise, we may actually ``win the war,'' but ``lose a peace'' \nby failure to pursue the nonmilitary policies necessary to attain our \nkey objectives.\n  I think it is important for me to quote one of my heroes, Walter \nWhitman, who said about the Vietnam experience that the battles we \nfight we may win, but the battles we fight can't win the war. One of \nthe things I fear most about Kosovo and further military action in the \nBalkans is that we win those battles, but those battles can't help us \nbring about the ultimate goals we seek. I am afraid there is a massive \ndisconnect there between the two, and I am afraid that is going to pull \nus into a deeper and more prolonged war.\n\n  In that spirit, I want to offer some preliminary ideas, some key \nelements that I believe must be part of an exit strategy.\n  First of all, we must develop a comprehensive, long-term plan for \nrefugee relief and resettlement. I am not sure if I were a Kosovar \nAlbanian that I would ever want to go back to that part of the world. I \nwould certainly probably not want to go back as long as Milosevic was \nin power. It is one thing to announce the appropriate goal of the \nreturn of all the Kosovar refugees to their homes, but how many will \nreally want to go back? Is it really possible to put Humpty-Dumpty back \ntogether again? Is it possible to put together Kosovo as it was before \nthe war? It may not be possible. It is another thing to realize reality \nand put together a set of policies necessary to deal with the real life \nsituation in which many--perhaps most--of the Kosovar Albanians exist \ntoday:\n  1. They don't have homes.\n  2. In many ways, they are dispossessed and don't have a country.\n  3. They don't have jobs.\n  4. They don't have functioning communities to return to.\n  While the European members of NATO and other nearby nations have a \ngreat stake in the refugee population resettlement, it is the greatest \nobligation we have here in the United States, too. We have a \nsignificant responsibility. I believe the administration and Congress \nmust develop a substantial aid package now to demonstrate clearly that \nwe are fully committed to successfully working on the refugee crisis. \nIt may be years before that crisis is resolved. The sooner we get to \nwork on it, the better.\n  Secondly, in terms of a successful exit strategy out of the Balkans, \nwe must be prepared to address, as part of any lasting solution to the \nproblems in Kosovo and the Balkans, the economic devastation which \nexists in much of the entire Balkan region, much of which has been \nbrought about by Milosevic himself in making war on the Slovenians, the \nCroats, the Muslims, and now on the Kosovars. Much of this devastation \nhas been at his\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\nhands and under the barrel of his guns. This devastation is not \nsomething that can be overcome overnight. It is my view that there is \nlittle prospect for lasting reconciliation between the peoples and \nnations of the Balkans until there is some degree of economic recovery. \nPeople aren't going to return to homes that exist in communities that \ndon't function. They are not going to return to places where there are \nno jobs, no schools, no education, and no hope. So much of the Balkans \nnow is in that condition.\n  Given the depth of the problem, we are looking at a project which is \nalmost certainly to be far more lengthy than the financially costly \nrefugee problem. Again, Europe must take the lead, but the United \nStates has to play a part as the international community leader, which \nit is. We have a stake in the stability of the Balkans, and this is one \nof the areas that we need to address. We need to begin now considering \nunder which conditions we will offer economic reconstruction aid to the \nBalkans.\n  Third, in terms of a successful exit strategy, we have to begin \nlaying the groundwork for an international conference to determine a \nmechanism for a final settlement not just of the Kosovo problem and \nallowing the will of the people in the Balkans to determine their fate, \nbut we have to do that for Bosnia as well. I think the only way out of \nour dilemma in the Balkans is negotiating a settlement acceptable to as \nmany parties as possible. It is the only outcome I can see that would \nhelp us achieve some lasting peace in the region.\n\n  Fourth, in terms of a successful exit strategy, all of these efforts \nthat, as I mentioned, revolve around Kosovo have to be applied to \nBosnia as well. American forces have been enforcing an uneasy peace in \nBosnia since 1996. Many of those refugees displaced in the Bosnia war \nhave not returned to their homes. The costs continue to mount to this \ncountry and NATO, and no clear end is in sight.\n  I find it fascinating that the great powers of Europe, after World \nWar I, in 1918, help set up the Balkans, help structure it as it is \ntoday. As a matter of fact, in terms of Kosovo, the Russians helped \nprevail upon the great powers of Europe to take Kosovo away from \nAlbania and give it to Serbia. It is now part of Serbia. I think we \nneed an international conference to resolve some of these dilemmas that \nhave resulted from a century-old set of solutions that may not any \nlonger apply.\n  Fifth, for any successful exit strategy, and for any settlement or \nresettlement to stick, Serbia must be reconciled to its neighbors and \nto the NATO countries. Clearly, the chief source of the most immediate \nproblems in the Balkans, the massive human rights violation in Kosovo, \nis the Serbian regime led by Milosevic. He stands condemned before \nhistory and humanity.\n  I am confident that he will ultimately be held accountable for his \nactions--not just by an international tribunal but by the civilized \nworld. However, we must be very careful that, in painting Milosevic as \nthe enemy, we not demonize the Serbian people. After all, Serbia is the \nonly part of the former Yugoslavia which fought as our allies in both \nof the world wars of this century. We must make a concerted effort to \nreach out to the Serbians to make it clear that our quarrel is not with \nthem; it is with Milosevic and his actions.\n  Sixth, as a vital part, a key part of an exit strategy, we must thank \nthose who fought the war. We must redeem our pledges to the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces who are, once again, being asked to put their \nlives on the line to implement American foreign policy. Our service men \nand women, and their families, are, once again, the ones paying the \nprice for the policies we make here in Washington. They are on the \npoint of the sphere. If we policymakers are going to continue to put \nthem in harm's way, surely we can appropriately provide for the men and \nwomen and their families who depend on them.\n  This body passed overwhelmingly S. 4, a marvelous measure to increase \npay and improve pension benefits under the G.I. bill. I was proud to be \npart of that effort, and we need to make sure that the effort passes \nthe House and is signed into law.\n  It is interesting, as we find ourselves exiting the 20th century and \ngoing into the 21st with another situation in the Balkans. Hopefully, \nwe can a avoid the guns of 1999 and move towards a more peaceful \nresolution of our problems. Hopefully, we have learned some things \nthrough the years. But, interestingly enough, we have a new role going \ninto the 21st century and will face very few self-imposed restraints on \nour actions. Therefore, perhaps more than at any time in our Nation's \nhistory, it is imperative that both Congress and the executive branch \nfocus clearly on defining our national interest and developing policies \nto effectively and appropriately protect and promote those interests. \nEven with our current unparalleled power and influence, I think it \nwould be wise to heed the words of President Kennedy in 1961. He said \nabout us in this country:\n\n       And we must face the fact that the United States is neither \n     omnipotent or omniscient, that we are only 6 percent of the \n     world's population, that we cannot impose our will upon the \n     other 94 percent of mankind, that we cannot right every wrong \n     or reverse every adversity, and that therefore there cannot \n     be an American solution to every world problem.\n\n  Mr. President, I was laying on a beach in Miami getting ready to go \nto basic training at Fort Benning in the summer of 1963 and heard a \nmarvelous speech on my little transistor radio. I can remember the \ntechnology in those days. That was high tech in those days.\n  I remember that President Kennedy spoke at American University on \nJune 10, 1963, in a marvelous address. And he said, ``We don't want a \nPax Americana.'' That is not what we want to look for as we enter the \n21st century. We don't want a Pax Americana. We don't want America to \nkeep the peace all over the world. It is not our role. It is not our \njob. And we have to realize that it is not necessarily an American \nsolution to every problem in the world.\n  But the challenge for the post-cold war world for us is to learn from \nthe Jugurthine War that, consistent with our national interests and our \nvalues, we ``find a strategy that would determine the appropriate level \nof force needed to maintain sound and stable foreign policy.''\n  The post-cold-war world of disorder makes the development of a \nbipartisan national security consensus especially relevant. We have \noften said, and really meant, I think, that politics must stop at the \nwater's edge. But we need more now. I believe we need to redouble our \nefforts to open real dialog here within the Congress and with the \nadministration and with the American people to discuss the fundamental \nrole of America's power in the world as we begin the 21st century. \nKosovo challenges us to define that policy now. For the dialog to be \nmeaningful, we must be sure that policymakers, including Members of \nCongress, have timely and sufficient information to actually allow us \nto make informed decisions before we get so deeply committed in a \nmilitary excursion that challenges American credibility.\n  I had a hand last year in working with the wonderful Senator Olympia \nSnowe and Pat Roberts in some efforts to enact in the last Congress and \nto seek to require the administration, the President whenever the \nPresident committed some 500 troops abroad, or asked for money for a \ncontingency force to be sent somewhere in the world, this requirement \nthat Senator Snowe and I put together and Senator Roberts put together \nin the appropriations bill and in the authorization bill, requires the \nadministration, when they do those kinds of things, when they make \nthose kinds of commitments, to come before the Congress up front and \nearly and explain why we are committing our forces abroad, what the \nmilitary application is, and what the exit strategy is.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid these amendments went by the wayside and \nwe don't have the kind of information up front and early that we need. \nI will be working with Senator Snowe and Senator Roberts to strengthen \nour legislation so that the Congress can get in, in terms of military \ncommitment, on the take off as well as a potential crash landing.\n\n  Let me just say that we need to adhere to the basic dictum of \nClausewitz that we must know in terms of military commitment, the last \nstep we are going to take before we take the first step. If I had any \none red-letter piece of advice to give our policymakers here in\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nWashington, that will be it. Let's make sure we fully understand the \nlast step we are going to take before we take the first step. It is so \neasy to get into war; it is so difficult to get out.\n  There is, obviously, much more to be done in formulating an effective \napproach to defining the proper guidelines, objectives, and policies \nfor American foreign policy in today's world. We must successfully \nresolve the debate about NATO's mission statement: Is it going to \nparticipate in more offensive operations, or is it going to continue to \nbe a defensive alliance primarily? Are we going to admit more members? \nIs this a good idea, or a bad idea?\n  The members of NATO are coming to Washington in a few days. I think \nwe ought to engage in that discussion with NATO, because we have to \nfigure in the relationship with our friends and our allies, because \nthose relationships affect our relationship with other countries.\n  Our relationship with Russia, for instance--Russia, for all of its \ntroubles, is still the only nation possessing the means to really \nthreaten our physical security. And China? What about China? China, I \nthink, might pose perhaps the greatest policy challenge to us as we \nenter the 21st century.\n  Clearly, there is much work to do. But it all starts with the correct \narticulation of national interests--what is vital to our national \ninterest and what is not, and particularly in terms of the commitment \nof American young men and women abroad.\n  For all the challenges and difficulties facing us today, I would like \nfor us to consider the other words spoken by President Kennedy in that \n1963 address, on June 10, at American University. He spoke during the \nheight of the cold war. President Kennedy put it this way:\n       World peace, like community peace, does not require that \n     each man love his neighbor; it requires only that they live \n     together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a \n     just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that \n     enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last \n     forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the \n     tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes \n     in the relations between nations and neighbors. So let us \n     persevere. Peace need not be impracticable and war need not \n     be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making \n     it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all \n     peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move \n     irresistibly toward it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, on tax-filing day, it is customary for \nSenators to note the many difficulties that taxpayers have complying \nwith a complex and unwieldy tax system. I plan to highlight some \nproblems with the system later today. But I do think it is important, \nhowever, to note that some aspects of our system have worked very well.\n  Since the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1913, the tax system \nhas provided a deduction for mortgage interest. The mortgage interest \ndeduction is one of the simplest, most widely available, and most \nwidely understood of all the provisions in the Code.\n\n  What is important about the deduction is the support it provides for \na goal that is of paramount importance to all Americans--Homeownership. \nJust five years ago, the rate of homeownership was declining in our \ncountry. Beginning in late 1997, however, the rate of homeownership \nbegan to climb, so that now, a record number of American families own \ntheir own homes. For the first time in our history, two-thirds of all \nhouseholds own their own homes. Where has the growth in homeownership \nbeen most evident? Every age group has expanded its ownership, and, \neven more importantly for the future of our country, the two categories \nof homeowners that have seen the greatest rates of growth are first-\ntime homeowners and minorities. It is also notable that within 6 years \nof naturalization, foreign-born individuals achieve the same rate of \nhomeownership as the nation at large. This is a great achievement that \nshows that the American Dream is alive and well.\n  When asked why they want to own their own homes, Americans in all \nparts of the country note that ``Owning my own home is the American \ndream. That is what it all boils down to, that I own my own home.'' \nThey do not buy a home to get tax breaks. They buy a home to attain a \nsense of community. Neighborhoods that have a high rate \nof homeownership have high rates of voting, participation in schools, \nand lower crime rates.\n\n  It seems that we all complain a great deal about the complexity of \nthe tax system. I think that a great deal of this tax code ridicule is \njustified. The U.S. Tax Code now consumes more pages than eight Bibles. \nIt is generally too complicated and unfair for most taxpayers. I too \nbelieve that the tax code must be streamlined but only while preserving \nimportant taxpayer deductions such as the home mortgage deduction. It \nis important to note that, as far as the tax code goes, one of the \neasiest steps in the computation process is the mortgage interest \ndeduction. Unlike many more recently created tax breaks, the mortgage \ninterest deduction presents no difficult formulas, calculations, or \nincome limits for taxpayers who utilize the deduction. The lender \nsimply provides the interest and property tax amounts to the homeowner \non a Form 1098. The taxpayer then simply transfers these two numbers \nfrom the form on to their tax return.\n  Among the taxpayers who itemize their deductions, 28 million used the \nmortgage interest deduction in 1995, the most recent year for which \nstatistics were available. In that group, 71% had incomes below \n$75,000, and 42% had incomes below $50,000. Clearly, the mortgage \ninterest deduction is a significant benefit for middle class taxpayers.\n  Homeownership is a cornerstone of American life. The tax code has \nalways supported that goal and facilitated the great achievements we \nhave made. The stability and simplicity of the tax policies supporting \nhomeownership have played a crucial role in the progress we have made \nin keeping the American Dream alive.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1376) to extend the tax benefits available \n     with respect to services performed in a combat zone to \n     services performed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (Serbia/Montenegro) and certain other areas, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the military tax-\nfiling fairness bill that passed the Senate earlier today. This is an \nimportant signal of support to send to our troops in the Balkans as \nthey fight against the forces of ethnic cleansing, mass murder, and \ngenocide. All Americans should be proud of the dedication and \nprofessionalism shown by our military personnel in the ongoing NATO \noperation.\n  While I am very pleased that we were able to pass this legislation, I \nam disappointed that I was unable to offer an amendment that would call \non Secretary Cohen to do everything in his power to ensure that both \nparents in dual military couples are not deployed into a combat area.\n  As the number of United States personnel slated for the Balkans \nincreases--and as there is an increased possibility of a Reserve call-\nup--I am concerned that situations may arise where children will have \nto watch both of their parents deployed in combat. It is difficult \nenough for children to watch one parent go off to war. It is \nunacceptable that they should have to see both of their parents put in \nharm's way.\n  I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss this matter \nfurther\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\nand to come up with a solution that protects our children while \nmaintaining our military effectiveness.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

They are saying that \nprinciples like duty, honor and freedom are more important than \npersonal gain and personal comfort. Any reasonable action the Congress \ncan undertake to ease the Federal burden weighing on our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines is one that should be considered and acted \nupon quickly.\n  Recognizing the area around Kosovo, where our military is deployed \nunder orders from the President, as a hazardous duty area for Internal \nRevenue code purposes will grant service members a small degree of \nrelief. Allowing service members an additional 180 days to file their \nfederal income tax return, and exempting a portion of their income from \ntaxation may be only a small gesture of support, but it is one that has \nalready been earned.\n  I will continue to keep the men and women participating in Operation \nAllied Force in my thoughts and prayers, and I look forward to their \nsafe and speedy return.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I just want to take a little time to talk \ntoday, because today is, of course, the infamous April 15 tax day. I \nknow a lot of Americans are out there still working at the kitchen \ntable at this time, working the pencils, trying to wade through \nthousands of pages, or at least dozens of pages, or all of the forms \nthat they have trying to figure out their income tax by tonight. There \nare going to be long lines as people use every last minute to try to \nget this tax that they owe to the Federal Government in order. So that \nis the day that I think most Americans dread. That is April 15.\n  For many American taxpayers, it is this usual routine. By this time \nthere are only a few hours left to complete their tax form before \nmidnight. They are going to be rushing to the Post Office. They are \ngoing to find themselves on the late night news as their local TV \nstations are showing footage of all these last-minute filers dropping \nthe envelope into the mail slot to at least meet the filing deadline \nand finally be done with this.\n  But even for those who file early, those who aren't going through all \nof this turmoil tonight, tax season, of course, is full of stress. Not \nonly do we wade through endless paperwork but we also come face to face \nwith the reality of just how big a bite Uncle Sam takes from us every \nyear.\n  Mr. President, have we ever really stopped to wonder why it needs to \nbe this way? Do we stop to consider better alternatives to the current \ntax system? It sure doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because our \ncurrent Tax Code is outdated. It makes our tax system among the least \nefficient. It makes our tax system among the most oppressive in the \nworld. Everyone knows this. And, yet, it seems to get worse every year, \nand we don't do anything about it.\n  When we have tried to give a little tax relief, or reform some of the \nTax Code, what we have done is made it more complicated and added \nhundreds of pages. So we have made the tax system even worse in an \neffort to try to reform it and make it better.\n  Congress, of course, is the first in line to blame because of this. \nThanks to a Government that does not know when to stop spending, tax \ncollections have grown faster than our economy has grown in the past 5 \nyears. And tax collections have grown twice as fast as the income of \nworking Americans. So the Government is growing faster than Americans' \nworking income. Hikes in the personal income tax--and particularly the \nincrease in the effective tax rates--have propelled this increase in \nrevenue.\n  As Americans are working harder to try to earn a little bit more \nmoney, our tax system is taking more away from them in doing so because \nour tax system pushes more of them into the higher tax brackets.\n  Since 1993, just 6 years ago, Federal taxes have increased for \naverage workers 54 percent, which for the average taxpayer translates \ninto about a $2,000 per year tax increase. So, if you look back at what \nyou were paying on average in 1993 compared to what you are paying in \ntaxes to the Federal Government today, the Federal Government is taking \n$2,000 a year more in taxes. As a result, Americans today have the \nlargest tax burden, even more than in World War II, and it is still \ngrowing.\n  Federal taxes now consume nearly 21 percent of the national income. \nTwenty-one percent of everything produced in this country goes to \nFederal taxes. That is compared to just over 18 percent in 1992. So, \nagain, over the last 6 years, Government has taken 3 percent more of \nnational income than in 1992.\n  A typical American family today, when we say they are at the highest \ntax rate in history--even more than paying off and fighting in World \nWar II--the typical American family today is paying 40 percent of its \ntotal income in taxes, more than the family spends on food, clothing, \ntransportation, and housing combined. So they are spending more to \nsupport Uncle Sam than they are supporting their families with the \nnecessities. And compare that to the average tax rate of only 2.75 \npercent in 1916 when Congress first got the\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\nauthority to level income taxes from 2.75 percent in 1916 to over 40 \npercent for the average family today taken by Government.\n\n  Another comparison worth noting is that Tax Freedom Day, the day that \nAmericans can stop working for the Government and begin working for the \nfamilies: If you start working on January 1, how long into the year do \nyou have to work to make enough money to pay the taxes that you will be \nresponsible for for that year? For families, it was May 13 last year. \nAmericans that started working January 1, worked until May 13 to pay \ntheir taxes, the latest date ever in history. In 1915, in comparison, \nTax Freedom Day was April 3. It will probably set another record this \nyear.\n  Despite a huge budget surplus over the next 10 years, the President, \nin the White House budget, has failed to offer even a single \nsignificant tax cut for working Americans. Instead, this \nadministration's most recent budget proposes to increase taxes by at \nleast $50 billion over the next 5 years. Even during a time of \nprosperity and surpluses, that is not enough for the appetite of this \nadministration when it comes to spending. They are going to increase \ntaxes by at least a net $50 billion over the next 5 years, $90 billion \nover the next decade.\n  The good news is that the budget blueprint that we passed today on \nthe Senate floor is reserving nearly $800 billion of the nonSocial \nSecurity surplus. That is important. We are not taking any money out of \nSocial Security dollars to use for any kind of tax relief but $800 \nbillion of nonSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years for tax \nrelief.\n  There are basically two streams of surplus coming into Washington: \nOne is from payroll taxes, the Social Security money; the other is from \novercharging on income taxes. We are setting aside in our lockbox the \n$1.8 trillion in overpayment on payroll taxes or Social Security and \nlocking that away so it can't be spent or used for anything but Social \nSecurity.\n  The big debate is over what we will do with the other $800 billion, \nabout 38 percent of this budget surplus. Again, the President wants to \nspend it, and more, over the next 10 years. We are saying it is an \novercharge that should go back to the taxpayers. For Washington, this \nis a surplus. This is not money that Washington is entitled to. It is \nlike finding a wallet on the sidewalk. If it has $100 in it, you can do \none of two things: You can keep the money, and that would be stealing; \nor you could find the rightful owner and give it back. That is what \nWashington has done. It found the surplus and it can do one of two \nthings: It can keep it and spend it, which would be stealing it from \nthe taxpayers; or it can send it back to the rightful people, the \ntaxpayers.\n  Our $800 billion of nonSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years \nfor tax relief would be the largest tax relief since the Reagan tax \ncuts of the 1980s. The Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s were about $1.4 \ntrillion over 5 years in today's dollars. This is about half and it is \nover twice as long. This is about 25 percent of what the Reagan tax \ncuts were in the 1980s, but it is something that we need to make an \ninvestment in in our society. It is like investing in research and \ndevelopment. We need to invest money into the economy in order for the \neconomy to continue to grow and to produce the better jobs and the \nbetter wages that we need. We have had this unprecedented expansion in \nour economy over the last 18 years and most of the credit goes to the \nseeds that were planted with the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s \nthat spurred this economic growth.\n\n  I think that our commitment to set aside another $800 billion over 10 \nyears to go back into the form of tax relief, investment in consumers, \ninvestment in the economy proves that this Congress is committed to \nproviding meaningful tax relief in 1999 and, again, providing tax \nrelief while protecting Social Security, protecting Medicare, reducing \nthe national debt, and also funding important national priorities as \nwell.\n  Whatever form the tax relief eventually takes, whether it is my 10-\npercent, across-the-board income tax cut which I have proposed in \nSenate bill 3, a 10-percent, across-the-board reduction in all the \nrates--in other words, if you owe the $4,000 in taxes this year to the \nFederal Government, take 10 percent off from that, keep $400 and send \nin $3,600. If it was $5,000, you get a $500 tax break. If it was \n$1,000, you get a $100 tax break. It is even, across the board 10 \npercent.\n  Other tax-cut provisions on the table being debated include the \nelimination of the marriage penalty. Again, the average couple in this \ncountry spends about $1,400 or more in taxes just because they are \nmarried. We think that is unfair. Another option is the death tax or \nthe dreaded estate tax--cut or eliminate that. Also, a cut in the \ncapital gains tax. Or it could be a combination of all of these or some \nof these. It is a fact that Washington is finally focused on tax \nrelief. I think that is good news for Americans.\n  In our budget, we provided meaningful tax relief, earmarking $800 \nbillion in surplus over the next 10 years to go to tax relief. Again, \nthe $800 billion in nonSocial Security surplus represents a tax \noverpayment. We have to stress that. This is a tax overpayment by hard-\nworking Americans, a tax overpayment that should be returned to them. \nAnother way to say that, in a restaurant if your bill is $17 and you go \nto the counter and give $20, you expect to get the change back; if you \nhave overpaid, you expect to get the change back. But Washington is \nsaying, you overpaid but, jeez, like the President said in Buffalo, NY, \nin January, we could give the surplus back, but what if you don't spend \nit right? In other words, you are smart enough to earn the money, but \nyou are too dumb to know how to spend it. The Government knows how to \nspend it better than you do. The Government will spend it on better \nthings than what you could spend it on for your family--maybe braces \nfor your children, dance lessons, to begin a college education fund, \nmaybe repairing the furnace. Somehow, that priority does not fit into \nWashington's scheme, because Washington thinks maybe you won't spend it \nright; Washington can spend it better.\n  I believe that Americans know what is best for their families and \ntheir lives. If it is their money, they should be given the right to \nspend it the way they see fit to support their families.\n  A new study by the Congressional Research Service reports if we don't \nprovide tax relief, the average household will pay $5,307 more in taxes \nthan is needed to fund the Government. Think of what the average \nhousehold can do if they could keep $5,300 more of their money, rather \nthan sending it to Washington. Of course, maybe some believe Washington \ncan spend it better, but the people I talk to in my home State of \nMinnesota believe that they would have a better place to put that money \nthan Washington.\n  Tax relief may temporarily relieve our pain, but the Tax Code, as I \nsaid, I believe is the root of all our tax evils. It is not the \nemployees at the IRS, it is not the agents. They are trying to labor \nunder some very, very complicated rules and regulations of the IRS Tax \nCode. Again, that is Congress over the last 50 years, with one layer on \ntop of another, on top of another, on top of another, of Tax Codes, \nregulations, tax breaks, incentives, special interests or whatever it \nmight be. The IRS is trying to dig out from underneath this or at least \nprovide the information for us to file the taxes. It is Congress that \nneeds to get its act in gear and do something to change it.\n  We held hearings last year in the Finance Committee. Senator Roth did \na great job on showing some of the abuses in the IRS and how the code \nreally is oppressive. It is antifamily, antigrowth, antieconomy. We did \nmake some changes. But a few changes is like putting lipstick on a pig. \nThe IRS still is not pretty. We need to do something more than make a \nfew changes.\n  The Federal Tax Code stretches on for more than 7 million words. It \nis made up of four huge volumes, each thicker than the Bible, with \nanother 20 volumes of regulation and thousands and thousands of pages \nof regulations. The Declaration of Independence took only 1,337 words \nto set the entire American Revolution in motion.\n  Today, we have 7 million words in our Tax Code that state how the \nFederal Government will collect taxes. The Government publishes 480 \nseparate tax forms. The IRS mails out over 8 billion pages of forms and \ninstructions\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nevery year. Congress has revised the tax law a total of 5,400 times \njust since the 1986 Tax Reform Act. In 13 years, 5,400 times the Tax \nCode has been revised. Who could possibly keep track of all those \nchanges? Not even the best tax lawyers and CPAs in the country \nunderstand the Tax Code completely. Not even the experts at the IRS \nitself can understand the Tax Code completely. Taxpayers today spend \nbillions of dollars a year trying to comply with its dizzying rules and \nregulations.\n  The IRS today employs over 102,000 agents to collect taxes. Now, \n102,000 agents to collect taxes, that is more agents than the FBI and \nthe CIA have combined. So I think that is just proof that tax \ncollection has become the primary function and goal of the Federal \nGovernment. That is the largest agency in Government, the IRS--102,000 \nagents to collect taxes. I guess you put the people where your \npriorities are. So we can see the Federal Government's priority is to \ncollect as much in taxes from you as it can.\n  Our current tax system is antifamily, anti-economic growth; by any \nstandards, it encourages abuse, it encourages waste, it encourages \ncorruption. To solve this problem forever, we have to do one thing and \nthat is uproot the current tax system. We need to replace it with one \nthat promotes freedom, that promotes economic opportunity. We must \nrepeal the income tax and other taxes, and we have to abolish the IRS--\nagain, not because of the people there, but because of the system that \nis so complex we cannot understand it anymore. We must create a new tax \nsystem, one that is fair, a system that is simple and a system that is \nfriendly to the taxpayers--not an adversary. There is an increasing \nnational consensus that the current system is unfair, a system that we \nmust end, and that the Tax Code as we know it has to be eliminated.\n  But the unresolved question is: How should we replace the Tax Code? I \nam a cosponsor of a bill in the Senate called the Tax Code Elimination \nAct, which would sunset the current Tax Code by January 1 of the year \n2003--in other words, get rid of it, pull it out by the roots, say it \nis all done, repeal the 16th amendment, and we will start all over from \nscratch.\n  The White House said: That is irresponsible. How could you eliminate \na Tax Code before you have something to replace it? I think we all know \nthat Congress would never let one day go by that it did not have the \nability to collect taxes. So if we had the ability to pass this bill \ntoday, Congress would work overtime, or on weekends, if it had to, in \norder to put a new system in place to collect that first dollar of new \ntaxes in the year 2003. So I do not have any worries about that.\n  The biggest job is going to be finding the political will to get rid \nof the Tax Code we have today. There is an increasing national \nconsensus that the current system is unfair. Ask your neighbor if he \nthinks this is a fair code. We must end the Tax Code as we know it \ntoday. But, again, the unresolved question is: What to do to replace \nthe code?\n  I have been exploring alternative tax systems for quite awhile and, \nafter considerable study of the issue, I believe the national sales tax \nplan is the best solution to our problems. I used to support a flat \ntax. I think most Americans would say a flat tax would be a good \nalternative. That is the one that has gotten probably the most \npublicity. But it needs to have a lot of examination. In fact, a couple \nof Congressmen in the House, Congressmen Dick Armey and Billy Tauzin, \nwent on the road last year to about 30 different cities, doing what \nthey called townhall meetings on tax issues and what to do to replace \nthe current Tax Code with something else. Representative Dick Armey of \nTexas supported the flat tax, Congressman Tauzin of Louisiana supported \na national sales tax. They played to crowds of about 5,000 people or \nmore at some of their stops.\n  So Americans are interested in this. They want to have some \ninformation, they want to know what some of the alternatives would be \nand how they would work. But when you talk about flat tax versus \nnational sales tax--which are probably the two leading alternatives--\ngoing into the meetings, about 75 percent said they would prefer a flat \ntax--again, because they have heard it most, it sounds like the most \nsimple plan--but after an hour and a half or 2 hours of this townhall \nmeeting, as they came out, 75 percent favored a national sales tax.\n\n  What we need to do is begin the debate. We need to do more than just \n30 town meetings around the country. We need to do this here in the \nSenate. We need to be part of the campaign, to start talking about Tax \nCode relief or reform, so the American public at least gets some \ninformation on what the Tax Code is today, how oppressive it is, and \nwhat we can do to replace it, what are some of the alternatives. I \nthink that is the way we need to lead in order to get some tax relief.\n  Any new tax system, I think, has to do a couple of things. First, it \nmust restore the fundamental principles of taxation upon which this \nwhole country was founded, and they are low taxes and limiting the \ntaxing power of Government. It must fairly and efficiently distribute \nthe burden of funding our Government. It must promote economic growth, \nnot be anti-economic growth. It must present less of a compliance \nburden, and that is, again, not having to spend billions of dollars a \nyear, every year, just to be able to fill out the tax forms and meet \nthat requirement. And it has to offer every American better economic \nopportunity. The national sales tax would do that.\n  The national sales tax system, which I intend to introduce soon, with \nother Senators, I think meets these very important criteria. It is \nfairer, more simple, it is friendlier, it will increase economic \ngrowth, it will increase investment, it will help with capital \nformation, and it will create new jobs and savings.\n  Under the national sales tax system, working Americans will be able \nto keep 100 percent of their pay, their pension, or Social Security \ncheck. They no longer need to file a tax return with the IRS. Their \nfamily's finances are not revealed to Government bureaucrats. They will \nnot be penalized for getting or staying married, and they will not be \npenalized, by the way, for dying either. Everyone will pay the same tax \nrate without loopholes, without any special interest groups. There will \nnot be any hidden taxes, and everybody will easily understand the tax. \nThey will be able to understand exactly how much they are paying in \ntaxes. And, finally, it will abolish the IRS completely.\n  Does this sound too good to be true? It may sound that way, but \nbelieve me, it is real. Let me briefly highlight how the national sales \ntax legislation would be able to achieve this.\n  First, the legislation will call for the repeal of the constitutional \namendment that created the tax nightmare that we find ourselves in \ntoday. Mr. President, the 16th amendment is the root of the tax evil. \nIt abandoned our Founding Fathers' original principle of taxation by \ngiving the Government unlimited power to tax the private income of \nAmerican people. Without the repeal of this amendment, any tax system \nwill eventually become abusive and intrusive. First and foremost, get \nrid of the 16th amendment.\n  Second, the legislation will repeal the income tax. It will get rid \nof the payroll tax, the estate tax, the gift tax, the capital gains \ntax, the self-employment tax, the corporate tax, and all the other \ntaxes out there.\n\n  Third, the legislation will impose a single rate on all new goods and \nservices at the point of final purchase, the final point of purchase \nfor consumption, and it will provide a universal rebate in the amount \nequal to the sales tax paid on essential goods and services such as \nfood and medicines.\n  So, in other words, for low-income or whatever the income is, if you \nare saying you cannot do this because you are going to be charging more \non foods and medicines and necessities, that is not true. There will be \na rebate for that. But it is a single rate on all new goods and \nservices at the point of final purchase for consumption. Every American \nwill be better off under the national sales tax system. I believe it \nwill create expanded economic opportunities for our Nation and for our \npeople.\n  The process of implementing the national sales tax system is going to \nbe a long one. There is going to be a lot of debate. So in the interim \nwe must reduce the tax burden on overtaxed Americans. I think a lot of \nus would like to go to eliminating the IRS tomorrow if we could, and \ncement in\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nplace a new tax system. But what do we do in the interim, until that \ndebate is completed, before we can make that happen, before we can \nbegin putting in a fair, simple, friendly tax system? I think that is \nwhy our budget includes the $800 billion of tax relief now. This is \ninterim tax relief, but we have to make sure our residents, our \nworkers, at least have some relief from the burden they are paying--\nagain, the highest in the history of taxes.\n  For those taxpayers who are satisfied with the current system, I wish \nthem the best of luck in preparing their taxes this year. For others, \nlike the hundreds of Minnesotans who tell me they are tired of filling \nout the complex and endless tax forms, who tell me they do not think it \nis fair that the Government takes so much of their hard-earned dollars, \nI invite you to join me in rethinking our tax system. I think we can \nwork together now to create a new and more fair way to fund the Federal \nGovernment, one that ultimately makes April 15 just another day, just \nanother day of the year, and not this day that everybody dreads and \nhates and is now spending many hours, tonight, trying to figure out \nexactly what they owe in taxes.\n  Again, I do not know if 40 percent is a fair amount of income to pay \nto the Federal Government. I do a lot of town meetings, or talk with \nstudents. I always like to ask a question to start with: What do you \nthink is a fair percentage of your income that should go to support \ngovernment? We all need a good government. This is not about getting \nrid of the government. This is not getting rid of the Federal, State, \nor local governments. But what is an adequate amount of money to fund \nthe Government, and what kind of services should we demand the \nGovernment provide with those tax dollars, not the waste and abuse that \nis in the system today. Today, if the system runs out of money, they \njust add more money to it, not look at where the abuse is, whether the \nmoney is being spent right. Are we overpaying for services we do not \nget?\n  This Government has never had to do what business has to do, and that \nis, look at how we can provide a service at the least possible cost. If \nthey run out of money, they just want to raise taxes again, raise taxes \nagain, raise taxes again.\n  When I ask this question at townhall meetings or at town meetings in \nhigh schools, of course some will say zero percent. That is not \nrational. But then we get into the basics, and it usually comes out, \npeople say around 15, 20, maybe 25 percent of their income should go to \nsupport all levels of government--Federal, State, and local. But then \nyou tell them they are spending, today, 40 percent of their income to \nsupport government.\n  So, for all of those who are filling out their taxes tonight or have \ntime to take a look at your pay stubs, take a look at exactly how much \nyou are spending on taxes, and then you can figure in the sales tax, \nyour property tax, all the other taxes that you pay, and just find out \nhow much of your income is going to support government.\n  Again, for the average family in this country, they are spending more \nto support Uncle Sam than they are spending on the necessities; That \nis, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and even, in most \ncases, recreation combined. So the Government is taking a bigger bite \nout of their paycheck than their family is getting. I think it is time \nwe look at this and find how we can reduce this and allow hard-working \nAmericans to keep a little bit more of their money in their pockets \nrather than sending it to Washington.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 822 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, before the Senator from Pennsylvania gets away, \nI wish I had been able to hear all of his remarks. But it will be in \nthe Record. It was very intriguing. I could not agree more with any \nconcept that envisions simplicity, equity. I think a lot of taxpayers \ntoday think somebody else is getting a better deal, and there is a lot \nof cynicism as a result.\n  But with a proposal such as you are talking about, everybody knows \nwhat the rules of the road are. I think in addition to the many \naccomplishments that you are suggesting your proposal would achieve \nwould be a confidence among the American people and a reduction in \ncynicism about somebody getting a benefit that somebody else does not, \nand that sort of thing. So I commend the Senator for his work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia for those very complimentary remarks. I wonder if it would be \ntoo presumptuous to list him as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is not presumptuous to let me think about it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let the Record show the request has been made. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President. Today is April 15, Tax Day, and I would \nlike to remind my colleagues how many Americans define this day.\n  On May 10, 1773, the British parliament authorized the East India Tea \nCompany to export a half a million pounds of tea to the American \ncolonies for the purpose of selling it without imposing upon the \ncompany the usual duties and tariffs. It was their intention to try to \nsave the corrupt and mismanaged company from bankruptcy. The effect was \nthat the company could undersell any other tea available in the \ncolonies, including smuggled tea. The disruption to American commerce \nwas unacceptable to many, including Sam Adams of Boston.\n  On November 27, 1773, three ships loaded with such tea landed at \nBoston and were prevented from unloading their cargo. Fearing that the \ntea would be seized for failure to pay customs duties, and eventually \nbecome available for sale, Adams and the Boston Whigs arranged a \nsolution. On the night of December 16, 1773, a group of colonists, \ndisguised as Mohawk Indians, snuck aboard the ships and dumped 342 \nchests of tea into Boston Harbor.\n  The King's response was the passing of the Intolerable Acts which \nprecipitated the forming of the First Continental Congress to consider \nunited resistance. As we all know, this was the beginning of what is \ntoday the longest standing Democracy in the history of civilization.\n  It is important to reflect on the actions taken on that day in that \nharbor. It is also important to recognize today is not very different \nfrom that historic day. Generally speaking, governments are short-lived \nand short-sighted. It is the responsibility of Congress to represent \nthe wishes of the people. It is the responsibility of Congress to \nensure the people are not abused by the federal government. Acts of \narrogance will not be tolerated. Acts of aggression will be punished.\n  It has long been instilled in our land to criticize the Internal \nRevenue Service. Last year, Congress had the opportunity to address \nmany of these criticisms. But I need to ask the question--Is the IRS \nlistening?\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\n  Over 123 million families will file 1040 returns this year. I have \nheard from many of these families. I have spoken with Montana families \nabout their trials with the IRS. I have spoken with Montana families \nabout the difficulty of scratching out a living on modest wages and \nthen being forced to pay a significant amount of that on taxes.\n  Where does the blame lie? Federal spending is the gorilla on the \ntaxpayer's back. The problem also lies with our Nation's Tax Code. How \ncomplicated is the Tax Code? Complicated enough to require significant \nrevision--in fact, I think we should scrap the code for a simpler \nversion providing equitable treatment. Here are the facts on the \nconfusing nature of our Nation's Tax Code:\n  The IRS employs 96,000 workers to collect Federal taxes amounting to \n$1.8 trillion and to administer the 1.5 million word income tax code.\n  The IRS expects to receive 120 million phone calls for assistance \nthis year.\n  A new Associated Press poll finds that the percentage of Americans \nwho say that Federal taxes have gotten too complicated is up to 60 \npercent.\n  The Federal Tax Code is so complex that about half of American \nfamilies now require the services of tax professionals to file their \ntax returns.\n  The IRS estimates that taxpayers will spend an average of 11 hours \npreparing their 1040's this year.\n  At a minimum, the cost of collecting the federal income tax, \nincluding the value of the billions of hours that taxpayers spend \nfilling forms, is at least 10 cents for every dollar of tax revenue \ncollected.\n  After the hearings we held last year, I admit I continue to be \ndismayed over what I consider to be a continuation of the arrogant \nattitude conveyed by the actions of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  While the IRS expects taxpayers to fill out their tax forms \naccurately, the General Accounting Office has just released a report \ncriticizing the agency for poor bookkeeping and failing the same sort \nof audit that the agency imposes of American taxpayers.\n  IRS management must recognize that they have a difficult job--\npromoting quality customer service. Not an easy task considering the \nhistoric attitude toward the IRS.\n  The founding of this great Nation's history begins with the Boston \nTea Party--a revolt against tyrannical rule and unfair taxation. Taxes \nare a necessary evil but, if kept in check, important to all levels of \ngovernment.\n  Taxes have created the world's greatest highway infrastructure, \ncontributed to the protection of our nation's borders, and supported \nthe most successful democratic government in history.\n  But waste and abuse of tax dollars have burdened the American \ntaxpayer with one of the highest levels of taxation in recent years.\n  Tax collection needs to reflect it's controversial history--the IRS \ndoes not have the right to use harassment and extortion as tax \ncollection methods. In blunder after blunder, the IRS is flailing in a \ndismal fall from effectiveness--wasting those same taxpayer dollars \nthey are collecting.\n  The IRS hearings during the 105th Congress were a very solemn wake-up \ncall. Customer service will never be considered as an IRS attribute, \nbut that's what the IRS needs to pound into their employees--the people \nwho need to learn to work with American taxpayers--not against them.\n  Perhaps part of the blame lies with Congress. We should not be fooled \nby IRS reports telling us ``we're working out the problems.'' As the \nrepresentative body of our Nation, Congress must hold the IRS to a zero \ntolerance standard.\n  I have been contacted earlier this tax season, by numerous Montana \nconstituents bearing complaints about the IRS. Most of the constituents \nare very disgruntled with the length of time it takes to have a \nresolution processed. They send me folders and files of correspondence. \nDuring the lengthy bureaucratic process, debts grow fantastically high \nwith interest and penalties.\n  One of those cases involves the IRS's denial of due process of legal \nchallenge for past tax years'. But it is not just one--it is many--too \nmany. A fairer less complicated tax system may help to clear up some of \nthe IRS abuses. By simplifying the tax system, one can only think we \nwould simplify our revenue collection system.\n  Mr. President, tax collectors have a long history of public \npersecution. Today, my colleagues and I stand here not to tar and \nfeather the tax collector, but to put an end to the abusive culture \nthat has spread like a bacteria throughout the IRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3769-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today is April 15. It is Tax Day. This is \nthe deadline by which we must file our 1040 Form and pay any additional \ntaxes we might owe on top of what was withheld during the year.\n  Unfortunately, typical Americans will work well beyond April 15, to \npay their taxes. This is because Tax Freedom Day does not come until \nMay 11.\n  Tax Freedom Day is the day in the year to which the typical American \nfamily must work just to pay the combined state, federal, and local tax \nburden. For many Americans the total tax burden now exceeds one-third \nof family income.\n  The Tax Foundation just announced today that Tax Freedom Day will \nmove one day further into the year in 1999.\n  Last year it was May 10, this year it will be May 11. This is the \nlatest day ever, and it marks the sixth straight year that Tax Freedom \nDay has advanced a day or more further into the year.\n  As the Tax Foundation has reported year after year, in a typical \nhousehold the tax bill now exceeds the cost of housing, food, \ntransportation and clothing combined.\n  In fact, in 1999 the federal tax burden will reach a peacetime high. \nNearly 21 percent of the Gross Domestic Product--that is the wealth \ncreated in the country this year--will go to the federal government.\n  As we approach the end of the 20th century it is useful to look back \non the history of the tax burden.\n  The Joint Economic Committee of the Congress estimates that in 1900, \nthe average federal tax burden on a family was 3 percent, and the \naverage state and local burden was 5 percent, for a combined total of 8 \npercent.\n  As the century closes the JEC estimates the average federal tax \nburden on a family is 24 percent, and the average state and local \nburden is 11 percent, for a total of 35 percent. Mr. President, we have \ncome a very long way.\n  The IRS estimates that 123 million families will file their tax \nreturns this year. The tax code is so complex that nearly half of these \nfamilies require the service of some type of tax professional in order \nto file their tax returns.\n  This means that on top of the actual tax owed to the government, \nthere is a hidden tax for millions of Americans in the form of tax-\ncompliance and professional services fees. Even for simple tax returns, \nthis can add another $100 to the tax bill each year.\n  For small businesses the tax compliance costs run into the thousands \nof dollars.\n  Mr. President, it is time for fundamental tax reform. We should begin \nthis process by reducing income tax rates across the board.\n  We should also eliminate complex and punitive taxes such as the \nestate and gift tax, and we should continue to build on our successful \nreform of the IRS by making it possible for most Americans to comply \nwith the tax system with minimal expense and effort.\n  The federal government is too big, and it costs too much. We should \nuse the budget surplus for two things, reduction of the federal debt, \nand tax relief.\n  The surplus belongs to the American people, it does not belong to the \ngovernment. For decades the cost of government has risen, Tax Freedom \nDay has moved later and later into the year.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to begin rolling back Tax Freedom \nDay. Let's give the American family a well earned break.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3769-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3769-S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO MR. LYNN W. HENINGER, NASA DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR \n                        FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the outstanding work of Mr. Lynn\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\nW. Heninger as NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Legislative \nAffairs. Having served in this position since December 1987, Mr. \nHeninger is leaving to pursue other opportunities in the private \nsector. He definitely will be missed by many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I have enjoyed working with Mr. Heninger on a wide range of matters \naffecting NASA. I always found him to be extremely knowledgeable and \nvery effective in representing NASA's views. He has always maintained a \nfriendly and constructive approach to his work which has served NASA \nvery well.\n  Mr. Heninger had the difficult task of coordinating the NASA \nlegislative agenda. He deftly balanced a wide range of NASA issues \nincluding the International Space Station, Rocket Propulsion Programs, \nEarth Science and Remote Sensing initiatives. Because Mr. Heninger \nearned the trust and confidence of those with whom he worked, he was \nable to promote NASA's views very effectively in Congress.\n  After graduation from Utah State University with a Bachelor of \nScience, he served in the U.S. Army for three years as an artillery \nofficer and helicopter pilot, including duty in Vietnam with the 1st \nInfantry Division. He returned to Utah State University, after briefly \nworking with NASA Johnson Space Center as a Program Analyst, to earn a \nMasters in Business Administration. In 1970, he joined the Department \nof Transportation to work as a Budget Analyst.

Mr. President, today's New York Times contains an \nexcellent article by William L. Hamilton on the city of Northampton in \nMassachusetts and the remarkable revitalization that has taken place in \nthe city in recent years. Northampton is also the subject of a soon-to-\nbe published book, Home Town, by Tracy Kidder, in which the author \ncaptures the spirit and essence of community that has turned this \nformer small mill town into the cultural, historic and economically \nrevitalized city it is today.\n  I also commend the woman responsible for much of this successful \nrevitalization, Mayor Mary Ford. For the past 8 years, Mayor Ford has \nbrought a new spirit to the city with her many successful initiatives. \nNorthampton's schools are renovated, its streets are safer, its water \nis cleaner, its housing is more affordable, and its roads are more \naccessible.\n  Mayor Ford has also demonstrated impressive leadership in making \nNorthampton a leading cultural center of Western Massachusetts. The \ncity is home to the Massachusetts International Festival of the Arts, \nParadise City Arts Festival, the Northampton Film Festival, and the \nnewly restored historic Calvin Threatre.\n  Mayor Ford is on the front lines every day, making an important \ndifference in the lives of families in Northampton, and she's done a \nremarkable job. The people of Northampton and all of us in \nMassachusetts are proud of her outstanding leadership, and we commend \nher for making Northampton the vital city that it is today. Well done, \nMayor Ford, and keep up the great work!\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article by William L. \nHamilton in today's New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 15, 1999]\n\n                  Northampton, MA--a Revitalized City\n\n                        (By William L. Hamilton)\n\n       Northampton, a city of 30,000 in western Massachusetts, has \n     been raising issues of community for more than 300 years--\n     charity, self-interest, tolerance and division. They are \n     issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th century, when \n     Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas Cole and \n     described with affection by Henry James in his first novel, \n     ``Roderick Hudson.'' They were raised when it hanged two \n     innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and \n     when it tried a police officer, a native son, for the rape of \n     his own child, during the four years that Tracy Kidder spent \n     reporting his new book, ``Home Town'' (Random House), to be \n     published in May.\n       Mr. Kidder, 53, lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, \n     Frances, a painter, but considers Northampton his home, too. \n     As he proudly showed it to a visitor recently, the city give \n     him a parking ticket. No place is prefect.\n       Like ``The Soul of a New Machine,'' his Pulitzer Prize-\n     winning account of the development of a new computer and the \n     advent of the computer age, ``Home Town'' is the portrait of \n     a cultural phenomenon, seen through the lies of the people \n     creating it. It is also the story of a particular town, and \n     how it has made itself a home. The citizens whose experiences \n     are observed in literary detail, from a local judge to a \n     cocaine addict, could be members of a family, sheltered by a \n     civic roof.\n       In this decade, in a successful reverse of the demographic \n     direction of the century, more Americans are now moving from \n     big cities to small towns than from small towns to big \n     cities. A 30-year migration by young professionals, baby \n     boomers and retirees from cities and suburbs to rural, \n     exurban areas has produced a new generation of what are being \n     called ``boomtowns.'' Two hour by car from Boston and three \n     hours from New York, Northampton, an ex-industrial mill town, \n     pretty and preserved, is now the product of settlement like \n     this.\n       Despite an annual decrease in the city's birth rate, the \n     population has remained steady, which city planners attribute \n     to ``income migration.'' said Wayne Feiden, the director of \n     planning and development. ``Who's coming? A lot of well-\n     educated professionals, attracted by a town that's amenity-\n     rich and very comfortable to live it.''\n       Mr. Kidder, who moved to the area in 1976, is part of the \n     trend. Now, he has filed his report: a firsthand look at life \n     in the type of peaceful place that many find themselves \n     sorely tempted to try. Not everyone stays--native or new \n     arrival. In portraying Northampton, Mr. Kidder has \n     attempted to assemble a set of natural laws, and sides of \n     human nature, that explain what makes any town work, or \n     how it can fail those who love it the most.\n       To those making the move, cities like Northampton are dots \n     on a map chosen on a Sunday visit for their size, their \n     safety, their qualities of life and their nostalgia. They are \n     the garden cities of childhood--the kind of hometown they \n     don't build anymore, the kind they may never have.\n       ``I was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island,'' \n     Mr. Kidder said recently, ``in a place, Oyster Bay, that kind \n     of vanished as I was growing up. Whole towns disappeared, it \n     would seem, under cloverleafs.''\n       He was walking down the gentle slope of Northampton's Main \n     Street, away from the tiny, turreted city hall, past the \n     Academy of Music, a Moorish 106-year-old municipally operated \n     theater, now showing ``Shakespeare in Love.'' A woman in a \n     floral skirt that brushed the tops of her cowboy boots was \n     offering strollers copies of her book on tape. A squat \n     signboard for the Fire and Water Vegetarian Cafe and \n     Performance Space sat like a toad by the curb. There was a \n     branch office of Dean Witter Reynolds across the street.\n       Northampton is blessed by confluence and circumstance. \n     Bounded by the Mount Tom and Holyoke hills and threaded by \n     the Connecticut and Mill rivers, it is also circled by\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\n     institution: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount \n     Holyoke College, the University of Massachusetts and, sitting \n     at the head of Main Street, the Smith College campus, \n     designed in 1875 by Frederick Law Olmstead. The 19th-century \n     state mental hospital is now abandoned. The poet Sylvia \n     Plath, an undergraduate at Smith in the 1950's, wrote to her \n     mother of walking in the evening to a professor's house for a \n     cocktail party, ``listening to the people screaming.''\n       Main Street bends slowly through the town, side streets \n     flowing into it, like a third river. ``There are some magical \n     things about this that couldn't have been planned,'' Mr. \n     Kidder said, speaking of the setting's majestic gait. ``This \n     broad sweep that Main Street makes, it makes simply because \n     of the topography, before you had earth-moving equipment.''\n       Northampton's recent history has a familiar plot--a \n     downtown rescued in the 1970's by creative real estate \n     developers and resident pioneers who discovered and \n     reinvented its historic infrastructure. It is an \n     architectural routine: with restoration and new, \n     entertainment-oriented businesses, the low brick buildings, \n     Victorian clapboard houses, Art Deco theater and a Gothic \n     chess set of city hall and courthouse become an animated Main \n     Street. In Northampton, there are apartments above the \n     shops, stimulating street life at night. The crosswalks at \n     the intersection of Main and King streets, where the town \n     converges, are wired with speakers that signal sonically \n     for the blind and stop traffic in four directions, letting \n     strollers spill momentarily into the square.\n       To the casual eye, it can look more like a marketing \n     concept than a place to live--a factory town retooled by the \n     wish list of the latte generation. A bookshop's magazine \n     display offers an informal census of Northampton's new \n     citizens and visitors: Raygun, Natural History, Birdwatcher's \n     Digest, American Craft, Bike, Fine Homebuilding, Interview, \n     The Writer, Outside, Macworld and Out. The town has been the \n     subject of a ``20/20'' segment because of a large gay and \n     lesbian population.\n       ``It's tempting to parody, but it's too easy,'' Mr. Kidder \n     said, crossing the intersection of Main and King as the \n     crosswalks beep-beeped like Saturday cartoon characters. To \n     the citizenry, it appeared to produce genuine wonderment--\n     rainbow-haired teen-agers, mothers in Polartec, men in linen \n     sweaters and loafers without socks crowded the open \n     intersection, as cars on four sides sat muzzled like dogs, \n     waiting for the lights. ``What you see is pretty motley, but \n     there is a solid mainstream, an almost invisible background \n     to it,'' he said.\n       Like any town, Northampton is many town, including a town \n     with a native population. As Mr. Kidder writes, the \n     ``Gentrification Is War'' graffito, written prominently on a \n     building downtown, is now softly faded. But two particular \n     towns live together like a couple in a brokered marriage that \n     may or may never grow into love. ``Hamp,'' or native \n     Northampton, shops on the strip of King Street as it leaves \n     town at Main Street, not in ``NoHo,'' or the revitalized \n     downtown, for which Main Street provides the artery.\n       ``In all of downtown, I don't think you can buy a socket \n     wrench,'' Mr. Kidder said. ``When you look at old pictures, \n     there were nothing but hardware stores.''\n       Because of its newcomers, Northampton is a big, little \n     place, pressured by the demands of the present on the past. \n     ``Without argument, a place begins to go dead,'' Mr. Kidder \n     said, walking on Pleasant Street, where many single-room \n     occupancy houses remain--a short block from Main Street's \n     consumer circus. Local government has kept them there to \n     enforce the town's economic heterogeneity. ``You've got to \n     have this tension. You've got to find a way to let lots of \n     different kinds of people in, and keep them there.''\n       Mr. Kidder is not ambivalent about Northampton, but he is \n     not foolish, either, ``It's got problems, of course,'' he \n     said, reciting the national roster of gang crime and \n     homelessness and a drug problem in the local schools that is \n     conspicuous for the state. He was at the bar of the Bay State \n     Hotel, a favorite spot opposite the restored train station, \n     now Spaghetti Freddy's, drinking a Diet Coke. Sitting in the \n     dimly lighted, yellow-wood-paneled tavern, with its etched \n     Budweiser mirror, painting of Emmett Kelly and silent \n     blinking jukebox was like being inside a Christmas tree at \n     night. ``And what limits the size of the town is jobs,'' said \n     Mr. Kidder, who is self-employed. ``The largest employer, \n     which was the state mental hospital, closed its doors years \n     ago.''\n       Wayne Feiden, the planning director, concurred. ``Whenever \n     you see polls in Money magazine and the rest, about the best \n     towns, we never make it,'' he said. ``The jobs aren't \n     there.'' Mr. Feiden added that the danger of being a boomtown \n     was that well-paid professionals like doctors and lawyers, of \n     whom there are many in Northampton, who moved there for its \n     charms, would move on, frustrated from feeling underpaid. \n     ``It's why they don't stay.''\n       If Northampton does not, despite restored facades, present \n     an unblemished picture, Mr. Kidder makes a strong case that \n     the beauty of a place is not in its skin--it is in its \n     people. They are the simple and dramatic acts and the \n     descriptive faces of his book. They are, he contends, the \n     genius of a place.\n       Mr. Kidder's ``Home Town'' hero is a native, who, as the \n     book concludes, leaves Northampton for the wider world, freed \n     of his ``nick-names,'' as Mr. Kidder characterized the linked \n     chain of time spent growing up in the same small town.\n       ``It seemed to make too much wholesome sense, from a \n     distance,'' Mr. Kidder said, speaking of Northampton. ``And \n     then I ran into this cop,'' he said. ``Tommy O'Connor, at the \n     gym that I go to.''\n       Mr. Kidder was back at his house, not the home built for a \n     professional couple in Amherst and chronicled in his 1985 \n     book, ``House,'' but a converted creamery on a mill river \n     that runs beneath the dining room windows. He greeted his \n     daughter, Alice, 20, who walked into the kitchen with a bag \n     of groceries from Bread and Circus, a natural-foods \n     supermarket. She pulled mixing bowls from the cupboards to \n     make dessert for dinner--profiteroles, for guests.\n       ``Tommy's a very gregarious guy,'' Mr. Kidder recalled. \n     ``He said, `You don't remember me, do you?' I said no, He \n     said, `Well, I arrested you for speeding five years ago.' '' \n     An electric mixer began clattering in a bowl. ``This guy with \n     a shiny dome had been a curly-haired cop then.'' Mr. Kidder \n     said. ``I remember that after he gave me the ticket, he said, \n     `Have a nice day.' ''\n       Mr. Kidder smiled at the recollection; Mr. O'Connor, who \n     now lives in Washington and works for the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, remains a friend.\n       ``Anyway, he said, `Why don't you come out and ride with me \n     some night?' He said he'd show me a town I never imagined \n     existed.'' It was, of course, Northampton.\n       Mr. Kidder said, ``And he was right.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3771-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3771-S3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PROTECT ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to ``Promote \nReliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade,'' the \nPROTECT Act. This legislation seeks to promote electronic commerce by \nencouraging and facilitating the use of encryption in interstate \ncommerce consistent with the protection of United States law \nenforcement and national security goals and missions.\n  During the last Congress, there was a very intense debate surrounding \nthe encryption issue. That debate, as with any discussion regarding \nencryption technology, centered around the challenge of balancing free \ntrade objectives with national security and law enforcement interests. \nThere were various proposals put forward. None, however, emerged as a \nviable solution. In the end, the debate became polarized, as many \nbecame entrenched upon basic approaches, losing sight of the overall \npolicy objectives upon which everyone generally agreed.\n  It was my objective to get outside the box of last year's debate. In \nthe past, balancing commercial and national security interests has been \ntreated as a zero sum game, as if the only way to forward commercial \ninterest was at the expense of national security, or vice versa. This \nis simply not the case. Certainly, advanced encryption technologies \npresent a unique set of challenges for the national security and law \nenforcement community. However, these challenges are not \ninsurmountable.\n  What the PROTECT Act does, is to lay out a forward-looking approach \nto encryption exportation, a course that puts into place a rational, \nfact-based procedure for making export decisions, that places high \npriority on bringing the national security and law enforcement \ncommunity up to speed in a digital age, and that ultimately provides a \nnational security backstop to make certain that advanced encryption \nproducts do not fall into the hands of those who would threaten the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  Title I of the legislation deals with domestic encryption. The bill \nestablishes that private sector use, development, manufacture, sale, \ndistribution and import of encryption products, standards and services \nshall be voluntary and market driven. Further, the government is \nprevented from tying encryption used for confidentiality to encryption \nused for authentification. It is established that it is lawful for any \nperson in the United States, and for any U.S. person in a foreign \ncountry, to develop, manufacture, sell, distribute, import, or use any \nencryption product.\n  The PROTECT Act prohibits mandatory government access to plaintext. \nThe bill prohibits the government from standards setting or creating \napprovals or incentives for providing government access to plaintext, \nwhile preserving existing authority for law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies to obtain access to information under existing law.\n  Title II of the legislation deals with government procurement \nprocedures.\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nThe bill makes clear that it shall be the policy of the Federal \ngovernment to permit the public to interact with the government through \ncommercial networks and infrastructure and protect the privacy and \nsecurity of any electronic communications and stored information \nobtained by the public.\n  The Federal government is encouraged to purchase encryption products \nfor its own use, but is required to ensure that such products will \ninteroperate with other commercial encryption products, and the \ngovernment is prohibited from requiring citizens to use a specific \nencryption product to interact with the government.\n  Title II of the PROTECT Act authorizes and directs NIST to complete \nestablishment of the Advanced Encrytion Standard by January 1, 2002. \nFurther, the bill ensures the process is led by the private sector and \nopen to comment. Beyond the NIST role in establishing the AES, the \nCommerce Department is expressly prohibited from setting encryption \nstandards--including U.S. export controls--for private computers.\n  A critical component of the PROTECT Act is improving the government's \ntechnological capabilities. Much of the concern from law enforcement \nand national security agencies is rooted in the unfortunate reality \nthat the government lags desperately behind in their understanding of \nadvanced technologies, and their ability to achieve goals and missions \nin the digital age.\n  This legislation expands NIST's Information Technology Laboratory \nduties to include: (a) obtaining information regarding the most current \nhardware, software, telecommunications and other capabilities to \nunderstand how to access information transmitted across networks; (b) \nresearching and developing new and emerging techniques and technologies \nto facilitate access to communications and electronic information; (c) \nresearching and developing methods to detect and prevent unwanted \nintrusions into commercial computer networks; (d) providing assistance \nin responding to information security threats at the request of other \nFederal agencies and law enforcement; (e) facilitating the development \nand adoption of ``best information security practices'' between the \nagencies and the private sector.\n  The duties of the Computer System Security and Privacy Board are \nexpanded to include providing a forum for communication and \ncoordination between industry and the Federal government regarding \ninformation security issues, and fostering dissemination of general, \nnonproprietary and nonconfidential developments in important \ninformation security technologies to appropriate federal agencies.\n  Title V of the legislation deals with the export of encryption \nproducts. The Secretary of Commerce is granted sole jurisdiction over \ncommercial encryption products, except those specifically designed or \nmodified for military use, including command and control and \nintelligence applications. The legislation clarifies that the U.S. \ngovernment may continue to impose export controls on all encryption \nproducts to terrorist countries, and embargoed countries; that the U.S. \ngovernment may continue to prohibit exports of particular encryption \nproducts to specific individuals, organizations, country, or countries; \nand that encryption products remain subject to all export controls \nimposed for any reason other than the existence of encryption in the \nproduct.\n\n  Encryption products utilizing a key length of 64 bits or less are \ndecontrolled. Further, certain additional products may be exported or \nreexported under license exception. These include: recoverable \nproducts; encryption products to legitimate and responsible entities or \norganizations and their strategic partners, including on-line \nmerchants; encryption products sold or licensed to foreign governments \nthat are members of NATO, ASEAN, and OECD; computer hardware or \ncomputer software that does not itself provide encryption capabilities, \nbut that incorporates APIs of interaction with encryption products; and \ntechnical assistance or technical data associated with the installation \nand maintenance of encryption products.\n  The Commerce Department is required to make encryption products and \nrelated computer services eligible for a license exception after a 15-\nday, one-time technical review. Exporters may export encryption \nproducts if no action is taken within the 15-day period.\n  A formal process is established whereby encryption products employing \na key length greater than 64 bits may be granted an exemption from \nexport controls. Under the procedures established by this legislation, \nencryption products may be exported under license exception if: the \nSecretary of Commerce determines that the product or service is \nexportable under the Export Administration Act, or if the Encryption \nExport Advisory Board created under this Act determines, and the \nSecretary agrees, that the product or services is, generally available, \npublicly available, or a comparable encryption product is available, or \nwill be available in 12 months, from a foreign supplier.\n  As referenced, the PROTECT Act creates an Encryption Export Advisory \nBoard to make recommendations regarding general, public and foreign \navailability of encryption products to the Secretary of Commerce who \nmust make such decisions to allow an exemption. The Secretary's \ndecision is subject to judicial review. The President may override any \ndecision of the Board or Secretary for purposes of national security \nwithout judicial review. This process is critical. It ensures that the \nmanufacturer or exporter of an encryption product may rely upon the \nBoard's determination that the product is generally or publicly \navailable or that a comparable foreign product is available, and may \nthus export the product without consequences. However, a critical \nnational security backstop is provided. Regardless of the \nrecommendation of the board, or the decision of the Secretary, the \nPresident is granted the absolute authority to deny the export of \nencryption technology in order to protect U.S. national security \ninterest. However, a process of review is established whereby market-\navailability, and other relevant information may be gathered and \npresented in order to ensue that such determinations are informed and \nrational.\n  Any products with greater than a 64 bit key length that has been \ngranted previous exemptions by the administration are grandfathered, \nand decontrolled for export. Upon adoption of the AES, but not later \nthan January 1, 2002, the Secretary must decontrol encryption products \nif the encryption employed is the AES or its equivalent.\n  Finally, the PROTECT Act prohibits the Secretary from imposing any \nreporting requirements on any encryption product not subject to U.S. \nexport controls or exported under a license exception.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated, my purpose in putting this \nlegislation together was to get outside the zero sum game thinking that \nhas become so indicative of the debate surrounding the encryption \nexport controls. I would like to commend the outstanding and creative \nleadership of Senator Burns on this issue. He is a leader on technology \nissues in the Senate, and has played an invaluable role in developing \nthis approach. I look forward to working with him, and our other \noriginal cosponsor in building the support necessary to see the PROTECT \nAct signed into law during this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3772-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3772-S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE YEAR 2000 TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I rise today to insert into the \nCongressional Record an analysis by the noted economist, Michael Evans. \nThis information regards the poorly considered effort by the \nInternational Monetary Fund to sell all or part of their gold reserves \nto ostensibly help poor countries. Dr. Evans is a professor of \neconomics at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University of Illinois. \nIn this detailed analysis, Dr. Evan's reviews the history of recent \ngold sales and cautions that selling gold often degrades economic \nperformance. Based on this empirical research, Dr. Evans states that \ncountries that have resorted to gold sales have found their currency \ndepreciated, their real growth rate down and their unemployment up \nrelative to countries that did not sell gold.\n  The IMF has established a policy to ``avoid causing disruptions that \nwould have an adverse impact on all gold holders and gold producers, as \nwell as on the functioning of the gold market.'' The proposal that the \nIMF is now contemplating would directly conflict with this well-founded \nrule. In fact, the suggestion of gold sales has already adversely \nimpacted gold holders and gold producers by causing an alarming drop in \nthe price of gold.\n  Currently, the price of gold is at its lowest point in twenty years. \nThis is significant because the low price of gold is now nearing the \nbreak-even point for even the larger mines. Therefore, these mines will \nbe forced to either operate at loss or shut down entirely. With mining \nand related industries accounting for 3 million jobs and 5 percent of \nthe gross domestic product, this would have a serious impact on our \nnations economy.\n  The IMF should abandon this initiative and pursue alternatives to \nassist these poor nations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 6, 1999]\n\n                           (By Michael Evans)\n\n       In the rarefied atmosphere of Davos, Switzerland, Vice \n     President Al Gore fired his opening salvo in the 2000 \n     Election Year campaign, in an attempt to demonstrate his \n     expertise in international finance.\n       Specifically, Mr. Gore suggested the International Monetary \n     Fund should sell some of its gold reserves and use the funds \n     to reduce foreign debt of impoverished Third World nations, \n     following through with one of his favorite plans discussed in \n     his 1992 magnum opus, ``Earth in the Balance.'' Such a plan, \n     he claimed, would help alleviate ``the insanity of our \n     current bizarre financial arrangements with the Third \n     World.'' (``Earth in the Balance,'' p. 345).\n       Forgiveness of foreign debt would certainly not be a unique \n     step. The United States forgave most foreign debts after both \n     world war for Allies and foes alike. The Brady plan in the \n     1980s reduced Latin American debt. The United States also \n     forgave much of the foreign debt of Eastern European \n     countries after the demise of the Berlin Wall. Forgiveness of \n     debt is not necessarily a bad idea; in many cases it has \n     worked quite well.\n       Yet the Gore plan is questionable on two major counts. \n     First, before these debts are forgiven, these countries need \n     to provide some evidence they have started to improve their \n     own economic programs. Second, selling gold, far from being \n     the best way to proceed, is close to the worst.\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\n       With the IMF throwing $23 billion down the Russian drain \n     because that country failed to institute necessary economic \n     reforms, the case for requiring some moves toward economic \n     stability seems strong enough that an extended analysis is \n     not necessary. On the other hand, the negative impact of gold \n     sales on economic performance is not well understood, and \n     deserves further discussion.\n       Suppose the countries targeted to receive aid from the Gore \n     program do indeed get their economic policies in order. Then \n     it does make sense to reduce their foreign debt, allowing \n     them to improve their economic lot instead of being \n     permanently saddled with debts that, for practical \n     purposes, can never be repaid. But why raise this money \n     through IMF gold sales?\n       The cheap, cynical answer is this method doesn't require an \n     actual outlay of U.S. funds, so it doesn't appear in the \n     budget. However, cheap tricks like that are precisely the \n     reason so many voters have come to distrust their elected \n     officials. If reducing Third World debt is worth doing, let's \n     debate the issue, vote on it, and pay for it, not disguise it \n     in some underhanded way that the average voter won't notice.\n       Yet there is a deeper, more important reason. Selling gold \n     often degrades economic performance. Most countries that have \n     resorted to gold sales have found their currency has \n     depreciated, their real growth rate has declined and their \n     unemployment rate has risen relative to countries that did \n     not sell gold.\n       Now that the inflation rate has remained low in the United \n     States, even with the economy at full employment, and the \n     dollar has strengthened, it has become fashionable to \n     proclaim that gold reserves are no longer needed to stabilize \n     the price level and the value of the currency. In fact, there \n     are many reasons why the inflation rate has remained so low, \n     including a credible monetary policy, the budget surplus, and \n     the beneficial impact of rapid growth in technology. However, \n     the most important factor is the widespread realization that \n     the U.S. government is committed to keeping the rate of \n     inflation low and stable. Massive gold sales would undermine \n     that commitment.\n       In this regard, it is instructive to look back and see how \n     the U.S. economy fared during the last major round of gold \n     sales. The IMF held several gold auctions from 1976 through \n     1980. In the five 1976 auctions, the average price of gold \n     was $122 per ounce. By the five 1980 auctions, the average \n     price had risen to $581 ounce.\n       Of course, one of the reasons gold prices skyrocketed was \n     that the rate of inflation in the United States surged, \n     rising from 4.9 percent in 1976 to a peak of 13.3 percent in \n     1979. While one can argue that higher oil prices boosted \n     inflation, the fact of the matter remains that the inflation \n     rate rose to 6.7 percent in 1977 and 9.0 percent in 1978 \n     before oil prices started to increase. Furthermore, the CPI \n     for all items, excluding energy, also moved up from 4.8 \n     percent to 11.1 percent in 1979, and the continued rising to \n     11.7 percent in 1980.\n       How could a relatively modest amount of gold sales have \n     boosted inflation so much? Most economists now agree that \n     inflation is driven largely by expectations. If labor and \n     business believe fiscal and monetary policy will continue to \n     fight inflation vigorously, the inflation rate will remain \n     low, as is indeed the case today. Conversely, when the \n     government sends the unmistakable signal by selling gold that \n     higher inflation is OK, labor and business quickly raise \n     wages and prices, and inflation is off to the races.\n       Of course, the Carter administration did not come right out \n     and say ``we favor high inflation,'' but their actions \n     convinced private sector economic agents that is what they \n     meant. When the signaled their disdain for a stable price \n     level by selling gold, the U.S. government encouraged prices \n     to rise more rapidly in the late 1970s.\n       Other countries have also had negative experiences \n     following gold sales. On July 3, 1997, the Reserve Bank of \n     Australia announced it had sold 69 percent of its gold \n     reserves of the previous month, resulting in a net gain of \n     $150 million per year in interest. However, it is more than \n     coincidental that the month before this announcement, the \n     Australian dollar was worth 75.4 cents, but it then started \n     to fall steadily to a level of 58.9 cents a year later.\n       Thus in the year following the announcement of goal sales, \n     the Australian dollar lost 20 percent of its value. As a \n     result, Australian consumers had to pay an additional $10 \n     billion per year for imported goods, almost 70 times the $150 \n     million in interest earned from interest-bearing securities \n     purchased with the money generated from the sale of gold \n     reserves.\n       The Canadian economy was also damaged by the decision of \n     the central bank to sell 85 percent of its gold reserves \n     since the early 1980s. The sharp decline in the value of the \n     Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar also led to a \n     lack of investment opportunities by local firms and a \n     substantial rise in the unemployment rate. Indeed, before the \n     gold sales, the Canadian unemployment rate tracked the U.S. \n     unemployment rate closely; in recent years, it has been about \n     5 percent higher. Canada paid a very high price for this \n     decision to sell gold and reduce the value of its currency.\n       It is also worth mentioning that Russia sold most of its \n     gold reserves shortly before the collapse of the ruble last \n     summer. It is likely that if Russia had not sold its gold, it \n     would not have been forced to devalue the ruble. Seldom has a \n     decision to sell gold reserves been more ill-founded and \n     untimely.\n       Thus the weight of the evidence clearly suggests that when \n     central banks decide to sell gold, the currencies of those \n     countries often depreciate and their economies suffer slower \n     growth and rising unemployment, far outweighing any small \n     gain that might occur from the return on interest-bearing \n     securities.\n       Given this track record, it seems remarkable that anyone, \n     let alone the vice president, would suggest weakening the \n     current stability in the U.S. economy by selling gold and \n     raising the expectations that inflation was about to return--\n     which would also result in a degradation of current economic \n     performance.\n       If impoverished Third World nations can demonstrate they \n     have taken steps to put their economic houses in order, fine. \n     Let's reduce their foreign debt, just as the United States \n     has done for so many other foreign countries over the past 80 \n     years. But having made that commitment, there is absolutely \n     no reason to risk boosting the rate of inflation and \n     weakening economic performance by funding debt reduction with \n     ill-advised gold sales.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3774-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3774-S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CARDINAL SILVA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week the hemisphere lost one of its \ngreatest leaders on human rights with the death of Raul Cardinal Silva \nHenriquez of Chile.\n  The Cardinal was a great man, and one of the great voices for freedom \nand justice of our time and of all time. He was a brave and holy man \nwhom many of us were proud to call a friend. The poet Yeats said:\n\n     Think where man's glory most begins and ends,\n     And say my glory was I had such friends.\n\n  Most of all, the Cardinal was a friend to all those who needed \nfriends the most--the oppressed, the frightened, the lost, the \n``disappeared.'' He sheltered the homeless, but he also sheltered those \nwho had homes but dared not go to them. During the dark days of Chile's \nrecent history, when the flame of democracy was nearly extinguished, \nand the noble concepts of freedom and human rights considered \nsubversive ideas by those in power, this courageous man of God would \nnot be silent.\n  Now, God has called home his good and faithful servant, and we \nunderstand that. Only God could still that strong and powerful voice. \nHis enemies may have hoped to silence him through all those years, but \nthey dared not.\n  I first meet the Cardinal in the 1970's, shortly after the coup that \nstifled democracy in Chile. He had come to Washington, and I had been \nholding hearings here in the Senate, year after year, to try to shine \nsome sunlight into the darkness of the human rights abuses in his land. \nHe asked if we could meet privately, away from the glare of publicity, \nand we did so, at a friend's home. As we sat and drank tea, he spoke \ndirectly and intensely about human rights in his country, without \nanger, and with insight and determination.\n  In those years, he had created the Committee for Peace, an ecumenical \nmovement of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews dedicated to providing \nrelief to the victims of human rights abuses.\n  Later, defying the Pinochet regime, he formed the Vicarage of \nSolidarity, to provide legal assistance for the victims of the abuses, \nand to protect the lawyers who championed their cause. Without the \nprotective mantle of the Cardinal and the Church, these organizations \nwould almost surely have been snuffed out. Because of him, many people \nfound the courage to speak out and to continue the long battle for \ndemocracy.\n  We met several more times over the years. When I visited Chile in \n1986, the government refused to meet me. But the people, led by the \nCardinal, welcomed me, and I will never forget that inspiring and \ndeeply moving reception.\n  At another time and place, the poet Gabriela Mistral wrote about the \nwife of a prisoner:\n\n       From the house I grieve, to the fiery thimble of his \n     dungeon, I fly back and forth like a living shuttle, like one \n     who knows no other path, until at last the walls open, and \n     let me pass through iron, pitch and mortar.\n\n  The Cardinal heard the cry of women like that, and their men. Chile's \nAmbassador to the U.S., Genaro Arriagada, was one of those who, because \nof the Cardinal, found the courage to resist. His ``No'' campaign the \n1980's led finally to the shining moment in the National Stadium in\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nSantiago in 1990. None of us who were in the stadium that day will ever \nforget it.\n  President Aylwin had already accepted the sash of office, a symbol of \nthe restoration of freedom and democracy that so many, including the \nCardinal, had worked for so long and so well to achieve.\n  In the stadium, which had been the darkest symbol of fear, \nimprisonment and despair, a beautiful tribute occurred. A young girl \nwalked across the infield, while the great stadium scoreboard scrolled \nthe names of the disappeared. Their families danced to a song about \nfreedom in Chile. When President Aylwin spoke at sunset, thousands of \ncandles burned, and fireworks lighted up the sky above the jubilant \ncrowd. The celebration lasted for hours--and it continues to this day.\n  Many profiles in courage made that glorious day possible. But no one \ndid more to make it possible than that strong, brave man of God, our \nfriend, Raul Cardinal Silva Henriquez. May he rest in eternal peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3775-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to reiterate to my \ncolleagues the need for immediate reform in the Alternative Minimum \nTax. This tax, which was created to stop the very wealthy from ducking \ntaxes through exemptions and tax shelters, looms in the future of \nmillions of unwitting American taxpayers. Economists from the Treasury \nDepartment and elsewhere state that perhaps 12 million American \ntaxpayers will be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax and its higher \nrates over the next 10 years. Now these people, these 12 million, these \nare not millionaires, they are mainstream people. According to the \nTreasury Department if we do nothing to change the AMT there will be a \n638% increase in the number of taxpayers earning between $15,000 and \n$30,000 who will pay the AMT's higher rates. By 2008, 12% of the \ntaxpayers paying the AMT will be earning between $30,000 and $50,000, \n29% will be earners of $50,000 to $75,000. By 2008, 45% of people \npaying the AMT, a tax created for the very wealthy, will have Adjusted \nGross Incomes of less than $75,000. If this alone is not enough to \nalarm this body perhaps we should consider the fact that an estimated \n2000 families making over $200,000 will not pay one red cent in taxes \nthis year. This is an unfair, unjustified, and inaction by this body is \nunreasonable. The AMT is out of sync with its purpose and it must be \nchanged.\n  There are two major factors that have brought the AMT into the lives \nof middle-income taxpayers--first, tax credits created to help families \nand aimed at promoting education and community are considered to be \npreferences in terms of AMT determination. This means that many \ntaxpayers must choose between applying middle-income tax credits and \npaying the AMT or forgoing the benefits of the credits and paying \nregular income tax. The AMT is threatening to prevent millions of \nmiddle-income families from receiving these valuable family tax credits \nsuch as the dependant care credit, the credit for the elderly and \ndisabled, the adoption credit, the child tax credit, and the HOPE \nscholarship. No one, rich or poor, should be forced to pay the AMT, and \nhigher rates, because they use these credits.\n  Second, Mr. President, the AMT has not been adjusted for inflation \nsince 1993. This problem simply speaks for itself. While the cost of \nliving has increased by approximately 43% since the tax code was last \noverhauled in 1986, the AMT has been adjusted only once by 12.5% in \n1993. It is an inevitability that middle-income families will be drawn \ninto the AMT if nothing is done to adjust a tax provision that is \nstructured like the AMT. It is very important that this problem be \naddressed and I am happy that Senator Lugar has brought this issue to \nthe forefront of debate with his bill which would index the AMT \nbeginning in 1993.\n  We can do a great favor to ourselves and our constituents this \nlegislative session by fixing the AMT. Many families are not aware of \nthe AMT. Most, I'm sure don't realize that soon they may be subject to \nthe AMT and its higher rates. I promise, however, that if we do not fix \nthe AMT now there are 12 million people out there that will let you \nknow in the coming years. 12 million people, 45% of which earning less \nthan $75,000 in adjusted gross income. One-million-four-hundred-and-\nforty-thousand Americans earning between $30,000 and $50,000 will be \ncontacting their representatives in Washington in the coming years to \nask, ``how can you people possibly consider me wealthy enough to pay a \nspecial tax for the wealthy?'' They will ask, ``why am I being punished \nfor applying these tax credits that you gave me.''\n  While the bulk of the bulk of the middle-income AMT damage can be \nabated by Congressional action now, the AMT is already starting to take \nits toll on a handful of middle-income voters. I received a letter from \nan accountant in the northwest Arkansas town of Harrison. Jeff Hearn, \nwho has impeccable professional credentials and who I understand to be \na very well-respected practitioner among his peers, wrote me about the \nAMT plight of one of his clients. He wrote, ``Please find enclosed the \ndescription of one of my clients who is a young aspiring farmer with \nchicken houses in northwest Arkansas . . . He and his wife have two \nbeautiful children who both qualify for the new child tax credit this \nyear . . . However, when their return was completed they were subject \nto alternative minimum tax.'' Apparently this family was forced into \npaying AMT due to a combination of the new child tax credit and excess \ndepreciation arising from their budding farm operation. I believe Mr. \nHearn said it best when he wrote, ``It seems quite unfair to me that a \ncouple under the age of thirty, who are trying to build an agricultural \nbusiness in addition to working for a living would have to pay \nalternative minimum tax when individuals who make hundreds of thousands \nof dollars are still not paying alternative minimum tax.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3775-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3775-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 472.

A bill to amend title V of the Social Security Act to provide \nfor the establishment and operation of asthma treatment services for \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE CHILDREN'S ASTHMA RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning a bill that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today that \nwe hope will improve the lives of many of the nation's asthmatic \nchildren.\n  Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the U.S., \naffecting an estimated 14.9 million people, causing over 1.5 million \nemergency department visits and over 5,500 deaths in 1995, and \nestimated to cost over $14.5 billion by the year 2000. Asthma deaths \nhave tripled over the past two decades despite improvements in clinical \ntreatment.\n  Asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem affecting \nchildren. Childhood asthma has dramatically increased by over 160 \npercent since 1980. Currently, 7 percent of the nation's children \nsuffer from asthma. It is particularly prevalent among the urban poor \nbecause of the lack of accessible health care and the high number of \nallergens in the environment. Research supported by the National \nInstitutes of Health demonstrated that the combination of cockroach \nallergen, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers are \nimportant causes of asthma-related illness and hospitalization among \nthe children in inner-city areas of the United States.\n  To combat asthma, innovative community-based programs have been \ndeveloped in some areas to fight this growing public health problem. \nFor example, in Los Angeles the Asthma and Allergy Foundation has set \nup two ``breathmobiles.'' The converted motor homes, staffed by doctors \nand nurses, visit schools to test, treat, and educate at-risk children. \nSince the program began two years ago, there has been a 17 percent \ndecline in the number of children visiting emergency rooms for asthma.\n  Today, I am introducing with Senator DeWine ``The Childhood Asthma \nInitiative'' to help more communities create childhood asthma programs \ntailored to meet their local needs. This bill funds grants for state \nand community-based organizations to support a variety of treatment, \neducational, or preventive programs. The funds are targeted to areas \nwhere childhood asthma and asthma-associated mortality rates are high. \nThis will enable those areas with the most need to provide services \nthat reduce emergency room visits, create healthier environments, \nreduce mortality rates from asthma, and provide overall improved \nquality of life. The bill also helps enroll eligible asthmatic children \nin Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Programs (S-CHIP). \nFurthermore, the bill provides additional funding for S-CHIP to \nincorporate asthma screening, treatment, and education in to their \nprograms.\n  The bill coordinates Federal asthma activities through the National \nAsthma Education Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, and \nincreases data collection by the CDC on prevalence and mortality \nassociated with asthma. These efforts will help link patients to \neffective treatments and disseminate new breakthroughs in asthma \ntreatment.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National Association of Children's \nHospitals and Research Institutions, the American Lung Association, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and the Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs.\n  I hope that many of my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nbill. Nobody should die from asthma. Treatments are available. Let us \nmake sure that every child in America that suffers from asthma has \naccess to those treatments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed, in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Asthma is one of the Nation's most common and costly \n     diseases. It affects an estimated 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 \n     individuals in the United States, including almost 5,000,000 \n     children.\n       (2) Asthma is often a chronic illness that is treatable \n     with ambulatory care, but over 43 percent of its economic \n     impact comes from use of emergency rooms, hospitalization, \n     and death.\n       (3) In Illinois, the mortality rate for blacks from asthma \n     is the highest in the nation with 60.8 deaths per every \n     1,000,000 population. In Ohio, the mortality rate for blacks \n     from asthma is 32.2 per 1,000,000 population and the \n     mortality rate for whites from asthma is 11.7 per 1,000,000.\n       (4) In 1995, there were more than 1,800,000 emergency room \n     visits made for asthma-related attacks and among these, the \n     rate for emergency room visits was 48.8 per 10,000 visits \n     among whites and 228.9 per 10,000 visits among blacks.\n       (5) Hospitalization rates were highest for individuals 4 \n     years old and younger, and were 10.9 per 10,000 visits for \n     whites and 35.5 per 10,000 visits for blacks.\n       (6) From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among \n     children due to asthma increased 74 percent.\n       (7) It is estimated that more than 7 percent of children \n     now have asthma.\n       (8) Although asthma can occur at any age, about 80 percent \n     of the children who will develop asthma do so before starting \n     school.\n       (9) From 1980 to 1994, the most substantial prevalence rate \n     increase for asthma occurred among children aged 0-4 years \n     (160 percent) and persons aged 5-14 years (74 percent).\n       (10) Asthma is the most common chronic illness in \n     childhood, afflicting nearly 5,000,000 children under age 18, \n     and costing an estimated $1,900,000,000 to treat those \n     children. The death rate for children age 19 and younger \n     increased by 78 percent between 1980 and 1993.\n       (11) Children aged 0 to 5 years who are exposed to maternal \n     smoking are 201 times more likely to develop asthma compared \n     with those free from exposure.\n       (12) Morbidity and mortality related to childhood asthma \n     are disproportionately high in urban areas.\n       (13) Minority children living in urban areas are especially \n     vulnerable to asthma. In 1988, national prevalence rates were \n     26 percent higher for black children than for white children.\n       (14) Certain pests known to create public health problems \n     occur and proliferate at higher rates in urban areas. These \n     pests may spread infectious disease and contribute to the \n     worsening of chronic respiratory illnesses, including asthma.\n       (15) Research supported by the National Institutes of \n     Health demonstrated that the combination of cockroach \n     allergen, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and \n     feathers are important causes of asthma-related illness and \n     hospitalization among children in inner-city areas of the \n     United States.\n       (16) Cities outside the United States have developed and \n     implemented effective systems of cockroach management.\n       (17) Integrated pest management is a cost-effective \n     approach to pest control that emphasizes prevention and uses \n     a range of techniques, including property maintenance and \n     cleaning, and pesticides as a means of last resort.\n       (18) Reducing exposure to cockroach allergen, as part of an \n     integrated approach to asthma management, may be a cost-\n     effective way of reducing the social and economic costs of \n     the disease.\n       (19) No current Federal funding exists specifically to \n     assist cities in developing and implementing integrated \n     strategies to reduce cockroach infestation.\n       (20) Asthma is the most common cause of school absenteeism \n     due to chronic illness with 10,100,000 days missed from \n     school per year in the United States.\n       (21) According to a 1995 National Institute of Health \n     workshop report, missed school days accounted for an \n     estimated cost of lost productivity for parents of children \n     with asthma of almost $1,000,000,000 per year.\n       (22) According to data from the 1988 National Health \n     Interview Survey (NHIS), which surveyed children for their \n     health experiences over a 12-month period, 25 percent of \n     those children reported experiencing a great deal of pain or \n     discomfort due to asthma either often or all the time during \n     the previous 12 months.\n       (23) Managing asthma requires a long-term, multifaceted \n     approach, including patient education, behavior changes, \n     avoidance of asthma triggers, pharmacologic therapy, and \n     frequent medical follow-up.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\n       (24) Enhancing the available prevention, educational, \n     research, and treatment resources with respect to asthma in \n     the United States will allow our Nation to address more \n     effectively the problems associated with this increasing \n     threat to the health and well-being of our citizens.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I join with my colleague, Senator \nDurbin, in introducing the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act of 1999.'' \nThis bill would authorize $50 million for each of 5 years for the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible \nentities to develop and expand projects to provide asthma services to \nchildren. These grants may also be used to equip mobile health care \nclinics that provide asthma diagnosis and asthma-related health care \nservices, educate families on asthma management, and identify and \nenroll uninsured children who are eligible for but not receiving health \ncoverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP). The ability to identify and enroll children in these \nprograms will ensure that children with asthma receive the care they \nneed.\n  Research supported by the NIH has shown that the combination of \ncockroach waste, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers \n(among other allergens) contribute to asthma-related illness and \nhospitalization. Children living in urban areas are especially \nsusceptible.\n  Asthma is the most common chronic illness that forces children to \nmiss school. From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among \nchildren due to asthma increased 74 percent. Estimates show that more \nthan 7% of children now suffer from asthma. Hospitalization rates were \nhighest for individuals 4 years old and younger. According to 1998 data \nfrom the Center for Disease Control (CDC) my home state of Ohio ranks \nabout 17th in the estimated prevalence rates for asthma. Nationwide, \nthe most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among \nchildren aged 4 years old and younger.\n  I believe that an important component of this bill is that it \nrequires those receiving grants to coordinate with current children's \nhealth programs such as the Maternal and Child Health Program, \nMedicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, supplemental \nnutrition programs, and child welfare, foster care and adoption \nassistance programs. This type of coordination with other children's \nprograms will help to ensure not just a better targeting of funding, \nbut also will help to identify children in these programs who are \nasthmatic and may otherwise remain undetected and untreated.\n  This bill would authorize $5 million for each of 5 years for the \nSecretary of HHS to award matching grants to states that develop plans \nto carry out asthma-related programs for children according to NIH \nguidelines through the state children's health insurance programs.\n  Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from \nasthma at such alarming rates and that allergens such as cockroach \nwaste contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill adds urban cockroach \nmanagement to the current preventive health services block grant which \ncan currently be used for rodent control. To reduce roach allergens, \nthis block grant could be used to cover the costs of structural \nrehabilitation of public housing, schools, and other public facilities \nto control roach infestation, while minimizing or avoiding the use of \npesticides.\n  This bill would require that NIH give the National Asthma Education \nPrevention Program (within NIH) an additional $5 million for each of 5 \nyears to develop a federal plan for responding to asthma and to submit \nrecommendations to Congress on ways to strengthen and better coordinate \nfederal asthma-related activities.\n  To better monitor the prevalence and determine which areas have the \ngreatest incidences of children with asthma, this bill would require \nCDC to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on \nthe prevalence and severity of asthma and to annually publish data on \nthe prevalence rates of asthma among children and on the childhood \nmortality rate. This surveillance data will help us better detect \nasthmatic conditions so that more children can be treated and we can \nensure that we are targeting our resources in an effective and \nefficient way to reverse the disturbing trend in the hospitalization \nand death rates of children who suffer from asthma.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this very important \ninitiative to help the nearly 5 million children who have been \ndiagnosed with asthma and to help those who suffer from asthma but who \nremain untreated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. \n        Kyl):\n  S. 806. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe 15 percent individual income tax rate to 10 percent over 5 years, \nto provide that married couples may file a combined return under which \neach spouse is taxed using the rates applicable to unmarried \nindividuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on this April 15, I would like to raise \nthe issue of tax freedom and fairness. The American people are paying \nover one-fifth of Gross Domestic Product in taxes--the highest share of \ntaxation since World War II and the highest peacetime levels in \nhistory. Too much of this burden falls on middle-income earners, who \nare struggling to juggle the high tax burden with the more important \ndemands of their own families.\n  It is for these hard-working Americans that I am introducing the \nTaxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act--legislation that is designed to \nreduce the\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\ntax burdens on lower and middle-income taxpayers. This goal can be \naccomplished in two ways, through marginal rate reductions for low and \nmiddle income earners, or by making the payroll tax deductible for \nindividuals. Those individuals and families on the lower half of our \nincome ladder need and deserve tax relief and I am committed to \nproviding them that relief.\n  Tax relief is necessary because many middle-income earners are paying \nlevels of taxes that severely diminish their ability to care for and \nsupport their families. Under current law, single taxpayers will pay \n15% on the first $25,750 of taxable income they earn. Combining this \nwith the 15% payroll tax, those earning under $26,000 are paying 30% of \ntaxable income to the federal government. Those earning a taxable \nincome of $26,000 are by no means rich--and should not be taxed as if \nthey were.\n  Given the burden on workers, it is incumbent upon us to provide them \nwith tax relief. The Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act provides two \nways to deal with these unconscionably high tax levels. The first is to \nprovide these lower and middle income earners with real rate relief. I \nhave proposed reducing the 15% tax rate to 10%. According to Congress' \nJoint Committee on Taxation, reducing the 15% income tax rate to 10% \nover five years would provide taxpayers with $980 billion in tax relief \nover the next decade. That means the average two-income family of four \nwould save $2,200 annually. An individual with a taxable income of \n$25,000 would save $1,250 annually once the rate reduction was fully in \nplace.\n  This is a tax cut designed primarily to benefit hard-working low- and \nmiddle-income Americans. Reducing the rate from 15% to 10% would save \nthe average Missouri households $1,170. This kind of tax relief is \nespecially welcome in Missouri, where, according to the Tax Foundation, \nthe burden of state and local taxes has grown dramatically in recent \nyears. In recent years, the tax burden in Missouri has risen from the \nlow rank of 47th in the nation to the 16th highest.\n  Across the country, nearly two-thirds of the relief would flow to \nhouseholds earning less than $75,000. Less than 4% of the tax relief \nwould flow to households earning more than $200,000. This is real tax \nrelief directed at middle class earners.\n  A second way to accomplish this important goal is through marriage \npenalty relief. It should be our goal as a society to encourage young \ncouples to get married. Marriage is a sacred institution that promotes \nfamily and community stability. More marriage is an unmitigated good \nfor this country.\n  Unfortunately our tax system does not see it as such. The current \nfederal income tax system forces many married couples to pay a \n``marriage penalty.'' That is, they are required to pay more federal \nincome tax than they would have paid had they been single and filed \ntheir taxes separately.\n  This is fundamentally unfair. The tax code should not punish \nmarriage, our society's most basic and essential institution.\n  Under current law, two single taxpayers, each earning $35,000 and \nclaiming standard deductions, will each pay $4,558.50 in federal income \ntax.\n  If those taxpayers marry each other, the tax code would boost their \ncombined tax bill by $1,478 to $10,595. This almost $1,500 penalty is a \nserious disincentive to middle-income couples looking to get married. \nThis disincentive represents an unacceptable attack on the institution \nof marriage. This issue resonates particularly strongly in Missouri. \n1,052,518 out of 2,416,434 Missouri tax filers file joint returns.\n  The marriage penalty has been part of the tax code since 1969. Since \nthen, the burden of the penalty has grown enormously. In fact, the \nJoint Economic Committee estimates married couples now pay $29 billion \nin taxes every year that they otherwise would not have paid had they \nbeen single. It is time to abolish the marriage penalty and create a \nnew day of freedom for American families to keep more of the money they \nwork so hard to earn.\n  I have long advocated elimination of the marriage penalty. In \naddition to the Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act, I am also a co-\nsponsor of Senator Hutchison's bill to eliminate the marriage penalty. \nI also included the elimination of the marriage penalty as a provision \nin my Fair Flat tax proposal. Eliminating the marriage penalty should \nbe one of the Senate's top tax priority for 1999.\n  It is time to provide real tax relief to those who need it most. The \nmiddle class should no longer have to pay 43% of incomes to the federal \ngovernment. Married couples should no longer pay a penalty just for \nbeing married. The best ways to solve these problems are to reduce \nmarginal tax rates and to eliminate this penalty on married couples. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for the Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness bill, \nand bring freedom and fairness to taxpayers this April 15th.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 807. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes \npaid by employees and self-employed individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 working americans wage restoration act\n\n  Mr. ASCHROFT. Mr. President, on today's tax filing deadline, \nAmericans feel the burden of our tax system most acutely. According to \nthe Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of their family \nbudget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and shelter \ncombined. The economic anxiety so many of our Americans feel can be \ndirectly attributed to the federal government's excessive taxation\n  One of the main culprits in this dramatic increase in taxes has been \nthe sharp rise in federal payroll taxes. Payroll taxes have increased \n13.3 percent since 1949, and the maximum taxable income for payroll \ntaxes have risen from $3,000 to $72,600.00 in the same period. As a \nresult, almost three-quarters of all families paying taxes pay more in \nSocial Security taxes than they do in income taxes.\n  In addition to their high rates, the payroll tax is also an unjust \ntax-on-a-tax. When working Americans receive their paychecks--their \ngross income--they pay a variety of payroll taxes, such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, on that gross income. When they pay their income \ntaxes, they pay on the full amount of their paychecks, including the \npayroll taxes previously withheld--money that they never saw and that \nwent straight to the government's coffers. And to add insult to this \ninjury, taxpayers' employers are allowed to deduct their share of \npayroll taxes, but the taxpayers themselves cannot.\n  This constitutes double taxation on the wages of the American people. \nFirst they pay the payroll taxes off their gross income, and then they \nare taxed on the amount of the gross income, as if the payroll taxes \nhad never been taken away.\n  It is because of these high rates and this double-taxation that I am \nintroducing legislation to eliminate the unfair tax-on-a-tax, giving \nthe American people the same tax benefits as their employers. Under my \nproposal, workers will be able to deduct the 6.2 percent of their \npaychecks taken by the government for Social Security taxes. This would \nprovide much overdue tax relief to middle class workers across the \ncountry who get hit hardest by both Social Security and income taxes. \nMy proposal would save the average two-income American family $1,770 a \nyear in taxes.\n  This relief is necessary because many middle-income earners are \npaying levels of taxes that severely diminish their ability to care for \nand support their families. Under current law, single taxpayers will \npay 15% on the first $25,750 of taxable income they earn. After that \npoint, their tax levels jump to 28% on federal tax alone. Combined with \nthe 15% payroll tax burden, our system is structured so that \nindividuals earning between $25,750 and $62,450 are paying 43% of their \nincomes in federal taxes.\n  It is a scandal that Missourians making $25,750 are forced to \nsacrifice to the federal government 43% of each additional dollar they \nearn. Those earning a taxable income of $25,750 are by no means rich--\nand should not be taxed as if they were.\n  In fact, the payroll tax is aimed right at the heart of the middle \nclass. The payroll tax is a direct levy of 15% on incomes up to \n$72,600. After that point, the payroll tax is not in effect. This means \nthat the payroll tax constitutes a much greater burden on the poor and \nthe middle class. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 74% of \nall\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nfamilies pay more in total Social Security payroll taxes than they pay \nin income taxes.\n  In addition to costing the poor and middle class more, the payroll \ntax also burdens individuals more than businesses. Although employers \nand employees both have to pay 7.65% of a worker's income in payroll \ntaxes, this burden strikes individuals disproportionately. Employers \ncurrently have the ability to deduct payroll taxes as a business \nexpense. Employees do not have this same option. In the interest of \nfairness, employees and self-employed individuals--even those who do \nnot itemize--should have the same opportunity.\n  It is for these reasons--the high rates, the double taxation, the \noverall tax burden, the disproportionate impact on lower and middle-\nincome wage earners--that taxpayers need to have a payroll tax \ndeduction. Americans should no longer be forced to pay federal income \ntax on their Social Security payroll taxes.\n  Providing payroll tax relief would not be a tax cut for the rich, but \na tax cut for the poor and the middle class, who are paying payroll \ntaxes from their first dollar of earnings. If taxpayers were no longer \nforced to pay income tax on their Social Security taxes, the average \ntwo-income family would see its annual tax bill slashed $1,400.\n  This change would be extremely helpful to taxpayers in my home state \nof Missouri. 85% of Missouri tax filers, over two million Missourians, \npay payroll taxes and would benefit from this deduction.\n  Employers, who are already able to deduct payroll taxes, \noverwhelmingly support making this change to help their workers. \nAccording to a National Federation of Independent Business survey of \nsmall business owners, 73% support making the employee share of the \npayroll tax fully deductible. These employers know what a burden the \ndouble-tax imposes on workers, and these employers understand better \nthan anyone the importance of making the payroll tax deductible.\n  Preliminary estimates suggest that this proposal would increase the \ngross domestic product of 0.5% and produce 500,000 new jobs. Making the \npayroll tax deductible is good for workers, good for businesses, good \nfor Missouri, and good for the American economy.\n  Mr. President, the case is clear: it is time to make the payroll tax \ndeductible. On this April 15, let us dedicate ourselves to providing \npayroll tax relief to American workers. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 808. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for land sales for conservation purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3781-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3781-S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE CONSERVATION TAX INCENTIVES ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. Jeffords. Mr. President, on this day when Americans must file \ntheir tax returns, I am introducing the Conservation Tax Incentives Act \nof 1999, a bill that will result in a reduction in the capital gains \ntax for landowners who sell property for conservation purposes. This \nbill creates a new incentive for private, voluntary land protection. \nThis legislation is a cost-effective non-regulatory, market-based \napproach to conservation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of it.\n  Our tax code already has a tax incentive to encourage people to \ndonate land for conservation purposes or to donate conservation \neasements. The charitable contribution deduction provides this \nincentive, and this deduction has been instrumental in the conservation \nof environmentally significant land across the country.\n  Not all land worth preserving, however, is owned by people who are \nable to give it away. For many landowners, their land is their primary \nfinancial asset, and they simply cannot afford to donate it for \nconservation purposes. While they might like to see their land \npreserved in its undeveloped state, the tax code's incentive for \ndonations is of no help to them.\n  The Conservation Tax Incentives Act will provide a new tax incentive \nfor sales of land for conservation by reducing the amount of income \nthat landowners would ordinarily have to report--and pay tax on--when \nthey sell their land. The bill provides that when land is sold for \nconservation purposes, only one half of any gain will be included in \nincome. The other half can be excluded from income; the effect of this \nexclusion is to cut in half the capital gains tax the seller would \notherwise have to pay. The bill will enable landowners to permanently \nprotect their property's environmental value without forgoing the \nfinancial security it provides. The bill's benefits are available to \nlandowners who sell land either to a government agency or to a \nqualified nonprofit conservation organization. They are also available \nwhen landowners sell partial interests in land for conservation. Thus \nowners of farms and forests may be able to take advantage of the bill's \nbenefits, yet still continue to harvest crops or timber from their \nland, if they sell a conservation easement on the property. The \npurchaser must provide the seller with a letter of intent manifesting \nthe purchaser's intent that the land acquisition will serve such \nconservation purposes as protection of fish, wildlife or plant habitat, \nor provision of open space for agriculture, forestry, outdoor \nrecreation or scenic beauty.\n  Land is being lost to development and commercial use at an alarming \nrate. By Department of Agriculture estimates, more than four square \nmiles of farmland are lost to development every day, often with \ndevastating effects on the habitat wildlife need to thrive. Without \nadditional incentives for conservation, we will continue to lose \necologically valuable land.\n  This bill provides an incentive-based means for accomplishing \nconservation in the public interest. It helps tax dollars accomplish \nmore, allowing public and charitable conservation funds to go to \nhigher-priority conservation projects. Preliminary estimates indicate \nthat with the benefits of this bill, nine percent more land could be \nacquired, with no increase in the amount governments currently spend \nfor conservation land acquisition. At a time when little money is \navailable for conservation, it is important that we stretch as far as \npossible the dollars that are available.\n  State and local governments will be important beneficiaries of this \nbill. Many local communities have voted in favor of raising taxes to \nfinance bond initiatives to acquire land for conservation. My bill will \nhelp stretch these bond proceeds so that they can go further in \nimproving the conservation results for local communities. In addition, \nbecause the bill applies to sales to publicly-supported national, \nregional, State and local citizen conservation groups, its provisions \nwill strengthen private, voluntary work to save places important to the \nquality of life in communities across the country. Private fundraising \nefforts for land conservation will be enhanced by this bill, as funds \nwill be able to conserve more, or more valuable, land.\n  Let me provide an example to show how I intend the bill to work. \nLet's suppose that in 1952 a young couple purchased a house and a tract \nof adjoining land, which they have maintained as open land. Recently, \nthe county where they live passed a bond initiative to buy land for \nopen space, as county residents wanted to protect the quality of their \nlife from rampant development and uncontrolled sprawl. Let's further \nassume that the couple, now contemplating retirement, is considering \ncompeting offers for their land. One offer comes from the county, which \nwill preserve the land in furtherance of its open-space goals. The \nother offer has been made by an individual who does not plan to \nconserve the land. Originally purchased for $25,000, the land is now \nworth $250,000 on the open market. If they sell the land at its fair \nmarket value to the individual, the couple would realize a gain of \n$225,000 ($250,000 sales price minus $25,000 cost), owe tax of $45,000 \n(at a rate of 20% on the $225,000 gain), and thus net $205,000 after \ntax.\n  Under my bill, if the couple sold the land to the county for \nconservation purposes, they would be able to exclude from income one \nhalf of the gain realized upon the sale. This means they would pay a \nlower capital gains tax; consequently, they would be in a position to \naccept a lower offer from a local government or a conservation \norganization, yet still end up with more money in their pockets than \nthey\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nwould have had if they had accepted the developer's offer. Continuing \nwith the example from the preceding paragraph, let's assume the couple \nsold the property to the county, for the purpose of conservation, at a \nprice of $240,000. They would realize a gain of $215,000 ($240,000 \nsales price minus $25,000 cost). Under my bill, only half of this gain \n$107,500, would be includible in income. The couple would pay $21,500 \nin capital gains tax (at a rate of 20% on the $107,500 gain includible \nin income) and thus net $218,500 ($240,000 sales price minus $21,500 \ntax). Despite having accepted a sales price $10,000 below the \nindividual's offer, the couple will keep $13,000 more than they would \nhave kept if they had accepted his offer.\n\n  The end result is a win both for the landowners, who end up with more \nmoney in their pocket than they would have had after a sale to an \noutsider, and for the local community, which is able to preserve the \nland at a lower price. This example illustrates how the exclusion from \nincome will be especially beneficial to middle-income, ``land rich/cash \npoor'' landowners who can't avail themselves of the tax benefits \navailable to those who can afford to donate land.\n  A real-life example from my home state illustrates the need for this \nbill. A few years ago, in an area of Vermont known as the Northeast \nKingdom, a large well-managed forested property came on the market. The \nland had appreciated greatly over the years and was very valuable \ncommercially. With more than 3,000 acres of mountains, forests, and \nponds, with hiking trails, towering cliffs, scenic views and habitat \nfor many wildlife species, the property was also very valuable \nenvironmentally. Indeed, the State of Vermont was anxious to acquire it \nand preserve it for traditional agricultural uses and habitat \nconservation.\n  After the property had been on the market for a few weeks, the seller \nwas contacted by an out-of-state buyer who planned to sell the timber \non the land and to dispose of the rest of the property for development. \nUpon learning of this, the State moved to obtain appraisals and a quick \nlegislative appropriation in preparation for a possible State purchase. \nIndeed, the State and The Nature Conservancy subsequently made a series \nof purchase offers to the landowner. The out-of-state buyer, however, \nprevailed upon the landowner to accept his offer. Local newspaper \nheadlines read, ``State of Vermont Loses Out On Northeast Kingdom Land \nDeal.'' The price accepted by the landowner was only slightly higher \nthan the amount offered by the State. Had the bill I'm introducing \ntoday been on the books, the lower State offer may well have been as \nattractive--perhaps more so--than the amount offered by the individual.\n  In drafting the bill's language, I was careful to ensure that the tax \nincentive applies to lands that truly serve conservation purposes. \nFirst, only publicly-supported conservation charities and governmental \nentities qualify as purchasers for transactions that make use of this \ntax incentive. Conservation organizations and governmental natural \nresource and environmental agencies have a long and respected record of \nserving the public interest in acquiring and managing land for \nconservation purposes. This bill builds on that record of trust and \nresponsible stewardship, without imposing new and administratively \ncumbersome requirements to ensure that the public purpose is served. \nThe tax code already provides for adequate oversight to guard against a \npotential breach of the public trust by a conservation organization.\n  Second, the bill requires a statement of intent from the purchaser \nreflecting the purchaser's intent that the acquisition will serve one \nof the specified conservation purposes. This language was crafted to \nprotect the public's conservation investment by establishing the \npurchaser's intent, but not creating a tax-driven land use restriction. \nIn essence, I wanted to make sure that the purchaser's intent to \nconserve the land does not rob the land of commercial value, for which \nthe landowner must be justly compensated if this conservation incentive \nis to work effectively. The purchaser's letter of intent should not be \nconstrued to impose new restrictions on the property or covenants \nrunning with the land; to do so would create an appraisal problem that \nwould defeat the very purpose that this bill is designed to address. \nThus, the property being acquired should be appraised at its \nunencumbered, full fair market value. Furthermore, the value of the \nproperty in the hands of the purchasing conservation entity should be \nits full fair market value, notwithstanding both the purchaser's \nintended conservation use of the property and the required statement of \nintent. This principle would apply even when the original conservation \npurchaser, like a land trust, subsequently conveys the property to \nanother cooperating conservation purchaser (e.g., a governmental \nagency) on behalf of which the land trust may have pre-acquired the \nproperty.\n  As this bill also applies to partial interests in land, the exclusion \nfrom income--and the resulting reduction in capital gains tax--will, in \ncertain instances, also be available to landowners selling partial \ninterests in their land for conservation purposes. A farmer could, for \nexample, sell a conservation easement, continuing to remain on and farm \nhis land, yet still be able take advantage of the provisions in this \nbill. The conservation easement must meet the tax code's requirements \ni.e., it must serve a conservation purpose, such as the protection of \nfish or wildlife habitat or the preservation of open space (including \nfarmland and forest land).\n  There are some things this bill does not do. It does not impose new \nregulations or controls on people who own environmentally-sensitive \nland. It does not compel anyone to do anything; it is entirely \nvoluntary. Nor will it increase government spending for land \nconservation. In fact, the effect of this bill will be to allow better \ninvestment of tax and charitable dollars used for land conservation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of the Conservation \nTax Incentives Act of 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 809. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe \nregulations to protect the privacy of personal information collected \nfrom and about private individuals who are not covered by the \nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 on the Internet, to \nprovide greater individual control over the collection and use of that \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 online privacy protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, in introducing a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Online Privacy Protection Act of \n1999. Last year, Congress worked together to protect our most \nvulnerable citizens from unprincipled information gathering online by \npassing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. That law \nprovided online privacy protection for children up through age 13. \nAlthough teens and adults have a greater ability to identify the risks \nassociated with online shopping and browsing, some guidance and \nprotection is needed to ensure that web sites treat information in a \nfair and uniform way.\n  Before I tell you what this bill does, let me first tell you what \nthis bill does not do. It does not bury online companies with \nregulatory paperwork. It does not impose a congressional mandate on \nprivacy policies. It does not force compliance with arcane rules. It \ndoes not regulate the internet.\n  I want to be clear. We are trying to pilot the ship of internet \ncommerce with a very light hand while trying to encourage the efforts \ncurrently underway within the online industry.\n  This bill sets very general guidelines for how an online company \ntreats information it gathers from people interacting with their web \nsites. First of all, there must be a clear and conspicuous posting of \nthe companies information collection policy. They must note what \ninformation is collected, and what they do with it. There must be a \nclear means for people to opt out of providing this information, if the \ndata collected is not relevant to the web transaction. In fairness, we \ndo allow the web site host to cancel the online transaction if the site \nvisitor doesn't provide all of the needed information. For example, if \na person buys a product, but won't give a mailing address, the company \ncan terminate the sale.\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\n  A key provision of this bill allows people access to information that \nwas collected and shared with outside companies. We recognize that \nthere are many web sites that collect information to better serve their \nvisitors. Amazon.com keeps track of book requests to help identify \nother potential books of interest to the customer. We appreciate the \nprosperity of that data and its use and want to protect and encourage \nthat creativity. As long as the company discloses up front what \ninformation it is collecting and keeps that data internal, it won't be \nforced into disclosure and lose its competitive edge. However, all \ncompanies are required to establish and maintain procedures to protect \nthe information that it collects.\n  To the uninformed listener, this may sound like a lot of regulation \nand paperwork for online companies to follow. The good news is that \nthis bill recognizes the continuing progress being made in the \ncommercial sector in providing secure and private transactions for \ncustomers. Concerns about misuse of information can drive many \ncustomers away, and many companies are recognizing the need for \nestablishing some type of privacy rules. It's telling that 60 percent \nof Fortune 500 Chief Information Officers in a recent poll stated that \nthey wouldn't divulge personal information online.\n  Fortunately, we finally got the right balance in crafting privacy \npolicy on the internet. It isn't through congressional or FTC mandates. \nIt's by encouraging private industry to band together to establish \nminimum requirements for a safe haven for consumer information. \nCompanies can meet the intent of this bill by showing that their \nprivacy policy complies with the Safe Haven requirements established in \nindustry. Congress and the FTC are only there to give the Safe Haven \nsome teeth by providing incentives and ensuring compliance with these \nself-established regulations. We also allow states to use existing law \nto challenge and remove irresponsible online privacy behavior. A strong \nteam of business, Congress, States, and regulators will bring a \nbalanced and fair approach to the needs of consumers.\n  The Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999 is an important effort to \nshape the future of online commerce. By getting out front and then \nstaying out of the way, we can create an electronic medium free from \nbig-brother mentality that allows people to move freely through \ncommercial sites without fearing for the data trail they leave behind. \nThis bill is good for industry and good for consumers. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 810.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \ncomprehensive child care bill, the ``Caring for America's Children \nAct''. This legislation recognizes that quality child care is a shared \nresponsibility that ultimately benefits government, communities, and, \nmost importantly, families and their children.\n  Parents know best how to care for their children, and will choose the \nbest if it is affordable and accessible. This legislation increases the \nopportunities for American children and their parents to choose the \nbest care for their children, including the choice to forgo a second \nincome to stay home with their children.\n  But for many families, staying home is simply not an option. Today, \nmore than 12 million children under the age of five--including half of \nall infants under one year of age--spend at least part of their day \nbeing cared for by someone other than their parents. In Vermont alone, \nthere are approximately 22,000 children, under the age of 6, in state-\nregulated child care.\n  There are millions of school-aged children who are in some form of \nchild care at the beginning and end of the school day as well as during \nschool holidays and vacations. And just as many six to twelve year olds \nare latchkey kids--returning home from school with no supervision until \ntheir parents get home from work. Far too many of these children spend \nthat time in front of the television with a soda and a bag of chips.\n  Child care is a necessity for most working parents and high quality \nchild care is a critical investment in our country's future. In the \nfirst three years of life, the brain either makes the connections it \nneeds for learning or it atrophies, making later efforts at remediation \nin learning, behavior, and thinking difficult, at best. The experiences \nand stimulation that a caretaker provides to a child are the \nfoundations upon which all future learning is built.\n  The brain's greatest and most critical growth spurt is between birth \nand ten years of age--precisely the time when non-parental child care \nis most frequently utilized. A Time magazine special report on ``How a \nChild's Brain Develops'' (February 3, 1997) said it best, ``. . . Good, \naffordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe benefit for welfare \nmothers and working parents but essential brain food for the next \ngeneration.''\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' embodies two important goals. First, \nto expand the choices available to parents--including the most basic \nchoice--to stay at home and care for their children. And second, to \nmove child care from babysitting to early childhood education and \npositive youth development.\n  How does the ``Caring for Children Act'' accomplish this? By \nincreasing the tax benefits for all families with children we provide \nmore opportunities for families, whether they stay at home or place \ntheir children in the care of others. We provide families with \nadditional income to spend on child care or to manage the household \nbudget without a second income.\n  Through state incentives to improve the quality and remove barriers \nto higher quality care the legislation provides the opportunity to \nimprove child care for everyone. By creating more after school \nactivities that promote positive youth development and making them more \naffordable for low-income families, the bill increases gives parents \nand their children the opportunity to choose activities that will be \nfun and help in the acquisition of the skills necessary to become a \nproductive, happy adult.\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' is good for families. The legislation \ncreates more equity between the tax benefits received by working \nparents who pay others to care for their children, and parents who stay \nhome to care for their children. It increases the Dependent Care Tax \nCredit (DCTC) for low- and middle-income families who use child care \nwhile they work. It increases current $500 Child Tax Credit to $900 per \nchild. It increases the Dependent Care Assistance Plan (DCAP) for two \nor more dependents and permits DCAP funds to be used to reimburse a \nparent or grandparent who provides full-time care for a child under the \nage of mandatory school attendance. Taxpayers are given the opportunity \nto select the best tax benefit option for each of their children, based \non the individual family's economic and child care circumstances.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' expands current consumer education \nservices so that parents have better access to information on high-\nquality child care and can feel more confident as they make decisions \nabout who will care for their children. It creates new opportunities to \nmeet the needs of school-aged children and their parents during the \nnon-school hours.\n  The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' is good for child care \nproviders. Almost every child care provider that I have talked with \nover the past few years wants the opportunity to expand their services, \nincrease their skills, and improve their facilities. But the child care \nbusiness is a financially unstable endeavor.\n  Child care centers and home-based providers are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, to buy the supplies \nand equipment that will promote healthy child development, and even to \nkeep their doors open.\n  The Shelburne Children's Center in Vermont closed earlier this year \nbecause it could not afford to stay open. Nearly forty percent of all \nfamily-based child care and ten percent of the center-based care close \neach year. Parents can only pay what they can afford, and far too often \nthat is barely enough to keep the child care provider in business.\n  The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' creates the opportunities \nthat will help keep current providers afloat and encourage more people \nto enter the business. It creates a high-tech infrastructure for the \ntraining of child care providers --and makes that training more \naccessible for providers in every community. It establishes a block \ngrant to help states improve the quality of child care.\n  Funds can be used to provide salary subsidies and more training for \nproviders, to improve the enforcement of state regulations, to help \nproviders better care for children with special needs, or to increase \nthe supply of infant care. States will have the opportunity to try \ninnovative approaches designed to improve the quality of child care.\n  The legislation also creates financing mechanisms to support the \nrenovation and construction of child care facilities.\n  The ``Caring for America's Children Act'' is good for business. Child \ncare is a growing concern for businesses, large and small. In my home \nstate of Vermont, companies have learned that being ``family friendly'' \nis good for business. It increases employee retention, improves job \nsatisfaction, and lowers absenteeism. The legislation encourages \nbusinesses to take an active role in the child care needs of their \nemployees and in the community-at-large. It provides a tax credit to \nemployers who contribute to child care arrangements for their \nemployees.\n  The legislation expands the charitable deduction to encourage \nbusinesses to donate equipment, materials, transportation services, \nfacilities, and staff time to public schools and child care providers. \nIn short, it creates the opportunity for companies to make an \ninvestment in their future, by becoming involved in child care.\n  I have divided the ``Caring for America's Children Act'' into four \nsmaller, more narrowly focused bills, which I also am introducing \ntoday. The ``Tax Relief for Families with Children Act'' combines all \nof the tax provisions (Title I and Subtitle A of Title II) of the \n``Caring for America's Children Act.''\n  The ``Child Care Construction and Renovation Act'' focuses \nexclusively on the financing of child care facilities contained in \nTitle VII of the larger bill. ``The ``Federal Employees Child Care \nAct'' deals exclusively with ensuring the safety and quality of child \ncare facilities operated for employees of the federal government.\n  The ``Creating Healthy Opportunities and Improving Child Education'' \nor ``CHOICE'' Act combines the remainder of the ``Caring for America's \nChildren Act.'' It focuses on improving the quality of child care, \nexpanding non-school hours care for older children, increasing \nprofessional development for child care providers, and helping low-\nincome families who will not benefit from the tax provisions.\n  As we all know, quality child care costs money. It costs money to \nparents who bear the biggest burden for the expense of child care. It \ncosts businesses both through the direct assistance that they provide \nto employees to help with the expense of child care, and through their \nability to hire and retain a skilled workforce. It costs government \nthrough existing tax provisions, direct spending, and discretionary \nspending targeted at child care.\n  But we must remember that the costs of not making this investment are \neven higher. Those costs can be measured in the expense of remedial \neducation, the cost of having an unskilled labor force, the increase in \nprison populations, and most importantly, the blunted potential of \nmillions of children.\n  Not only must we engage in a public debate on ``who cares for our \nchildren,'' but we also must take action to better support families in \ndoing their most important work----raising our nation's children. Last \nyear, child care legislation held a prominent place on the \nCongressional agenda. This year, little has been said, although the \nneeds have not diminished. I hope that these bills can put child care \nback on the Congressional agenda where it belongs---because our \nchildren and families cannot wait much longer.\n  As I said on Tuesday night during the debate on the Budget \nResolution, I am not going to let the issue of child care go away. All \nof us here today, and all of the co-sponsors of this legislation are \ncommitted to whatever it takes to help our children maximize their \nopportunities. That is what this legislation is about--Opportunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senators Dodd, Landrieu, \nKennedy, and Kohl, as well as with Congressman Gilman and his House \ncolleagues, in co-sponsoring and supporting this important legislation. \nTo do nothing to improve the quality of child care and provide parents \nwith more opportunities to choose the best care for their children is \ngrossly unfair to the children and far too costly for our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section description of the \n``Caring for America's Children Act'' be placed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3784-S3790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               The ``Caring for America's Children'' Act\n\n     Title I: Tax Benefits for Families with Children\n       Section 101: Increases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) \n     by (a) increasing the amount of allowable expenses to $3,600 \n     for one dependent; $6,000 for two or more; (b) increasing the \n     maximum percentage of the allowable expenses to 40 percent; \n     (c) increases the adjusted gross income level receiving the \n     maximum percentage to $50,000; (d) reduces the allowable \n     percentage by 1 percent for each $2,000 over $50,000, not \n     reduced below 10 percent; (d) permiting educational programs \n     and third party transportation costs to be counted as \n     allowable expenses.\n       Section 102: Increases the Child Tax Credit from $500 per \n     year to $900 per year.\n       Section 103: Makes changes in the Dependent Care Assistance \n     Program (DCAP) by (a) Increasing the dollar contribution \n     limit to $7,000 a year for two or more dependents; (b) \n     Permiting contributions to DCAP accounts during pregnancy, \n     usable for one year after the birth of a child; (c) permiting \n     DCAP funds to be used to pay a spouse or grandparent to care \n     for a pre-school aged child at home; and (d) establishing a \n     DCAP for federal employees.\n       Section 104: Permits parents to choose between the \n     Dependent Care Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and the \n     Dependent Care Assistance Program for each dependent child \n     (each tax benefit mutually exclusive for each child).\n       Section 105: Expands the Home Office tax deduction to \n     permit parents to care for a dependent child within the home \n     office space\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\n     and maintain the ``exclusive use'' designation for the home \n     office tax deduction.\n       Section 106: Requires states to include the cost of child \n     care in the calculation of child support orders.\n       Estimated cost of Title I is $35.1 billion over 5 years.\n     Title II: Activities to Improve the Quality of Child Care\n       Subtitle A--Encouraging Business Involvement in Child Care\n       Section 201: Creates a child care tax credit for employers \n     up to $150,000 a year ($250,000 a year with respect to three \n     or more company child care facilities in different locations) \n     in allowable employee-related child care expenses such as the \n     construction or renovation of facilities and employee \n     subsidies.

Mr. President, today Senator Jeffords, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Landrieu, and I are proposing legislation to expand and improve \nquality child care across the country. The provisions are intended to \nsupport the full range of child care choices that parents make, \nincluding the decision to provide stay-at-home care.\n  Child care is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nation. \nThe need to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of \nchild care is indisputable. Across the country, 13 million children \nunder age 6 spend all or part of their day in child care.\n  Every child deserves high quality care. We know that child \ndevelopment, especially in the early years, is dependent on safe, \nreliable care that offers stable relationships and intellectually \nstimulating activities. Child care that fulfills these goals can make \nall the difference in enabling children to learn, grow, and reach their \nfull potential. This bill will help improve the quality and safety of \ncare by establishing a competitive grant program to help states improve \nthe quality of their care.\n  The bill also gives new incentives to businesses to assist in the \ncare of their employees' children and to strengthen the quality of \ncare. Businesses will be permitted a tax deduction for donations of \nequipment, materials, transportation services, facilities, and staff \ntime to public schools and care providers. Employers who contribute to \nthe child care arrangements of their employees will receive a tax \ncredit of 50 percent of their expenses up to $150,000 a year ($250,000 \na year with respect to three or more facilities in different locations) \nin allowable employee-related child care expenses such as the \nconstruction or renovation of facilities and employee subsidies.\n  The quality of care can also be improved by giving the public more \ninformation about the caliber of the programs in their community. \nWorking parents deserve to know that their children are not just safe, \nbut well cared for. Our bill will provide that reassurance by improving \nparents' access to the information they need to make informed decisions \nabout the selection of child care. Establishing a more effective system \nfor distributing public information will make it easier for parents to \nselect care with confidence, and will also encourage care providers to \nimprove their services.\n  Raising children is expensive, in and of itself, and families who \nplace their children in out-of-home care face the additional burden of \nobtaining quality child care. Millions of families cannot afford the \nchild care they need in order to raise, protect, and teach their \nchildren. Full-day care can easily cost up to $10,000 per year--often \nas much as college tuition for an older child. Too often, the high cost \nof quality care puts it out of reach for many working families, \nparticularly those earning low wages. These parents--working parents--\nconstantly must choose between paying the rent or mortgage, buying \nfood, and providing the quality care their child needs.\n  Our bill provides support to all families with children, whether they \nrely on out-of-home care or not. It increases the Dependent Care Tax \nCredit (DCTC) by raising the amount of allowable expenses to $3,600 for \none dependent and $6,000 for two or more, and by permitting educational \nprograms and third party transportation to count as allowable expenses.\n  Affordable child care is in particularly short supply for young \nchildren and for children who need care during nontraditional hours, \nsuch as during the late afternoon and evening. As more and more parents \nleave welfare for work, the demand for this type of care will continue \nto increase. The General Accounting Office estimates that under the \nwelfare reform rules requiring more parents to work, the supply of \nchild care will meet only 25 percent of the demand in many urban areas. \nWe must ensure that the necessary support systems, such as child care \nand health care, are in place so that low-income parents can \nsuccessfully move from welfare to self-sufficiency.\n  Our bill addresses these concerns by increasing the authorization of \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act from $1 billion \nto $2 billion a year. It requires states to improve the way in which \nsubsidy rates are determined. Parents will have a choice of child care \nproviders, not just the least expensive care. Seventy percent of the \nCCDBG funds are set aside for non-welfare-related low-income working \nparents. The bill also contains a new state grant program to encourage \nthe development of quality child care programs during non-school hours.\n  It is long past time for Congress to give child care the high \npriority it deserves. This bipartisan bill addresses the serious \nchallenges confronting millions of families with children, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in supporting this significant initiative.\n  Mr. President, an excellent column in yesterday's Washington Post by \nJudy Mann eloquently analyzed the hardships facing families seeking \nadequate child care. I believe her analysis will be of interest to all \nof us concerned about the issue, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, April 14, 1999]\n\n                    The Slow Evolution of Child Care\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       I first started worrying about child care more than 30 \n     years ago when I became a single working parent with a 1-year \n     old child. We didn't call it child care back then, because it \n     didn't really exist.\n       We called baby-sitting.\n       Some women took children into their homes and baby-sat them \n     all day. They were a godsend to that first cohort of women \n     who--out of choice or necessity--went into the paid \n     workforce. But out of these homes also came some horror \n     stories of crowding, of children stuck in front of TV sets \n     all day, of germs being passed around with such alacrity that \n     mothers lost jobs because they missed so many workdays having \n     to care for sick children.\n       So how far have we come in 30 years? It's not overly harsh \n     to say; not that far. We have licensed family day-care \n     centers, school-based child care, child care centers in \n     office parks and churches, and we have corporations that run \n     child care centers across the country. The federal government \n     subsidizes child care with vouchers for some low-income \n     families and by allowing people to shelter some money spent \n     on child care from income tax.\n       But for most working parents, child care remains an \n     enormous source of financial stress and emotional anxiety. \n     Even people who can afford live-in nannies aren't spared that \n     bad apple who abuses children or disappears without warning.\n       At best, we have a patchwork of child care that is woven \n     together by a common thread: The people who take care of our \n     children are woefully underpaid and under-trained. Turnover \n     ranges from 25 percent to 50 percent as they succumb to the \n     lure of better-paying jobs. The median income for child care \n     providers is $6.12 an hour; for parking lot attendants, it is \n     $6.38. We pay $6.90 an hour to people who walk our dogs. What \n     do we value most--our kids, our cars, our pets?\n       We are the most prosperous nation on earth, with an economy \n     that is booming like\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\n     the end of the ``1812 Overture.'' We are also the only modern \n     industrial nation that does not have an organized, \n     affordable, reliable system of child care for the people \n     creating those economic success.\n       Child care advocates have been working for more than 20 \n     years to try to get this country to understand that child \n     care isn't just about baby-sitting. It's about giving \n     youngsters a good start in life and reducing stress on \n     working parents. We have lacked the national will to make \n     good child care one of our central responses to the changes \n     in family life for one simple reason: Working parents are so \n     busy trying to survive day-to-day that they have no time or \n     energy for political action.\n       This may be changing, thanks in part to a ``Caring for \n     Kids'' public affairs campaign that Lifetime Television has \n     undertaken with the National Council of Women's \n     Organizations. Begun in March of last year, the campaign \n     now involves about 150 nonprofit organizations. The \n     coalition is targeting April as ``Childcare Month,'' and \n     about 1,500 community campaigns are going to be held to \n     support its central message: Make child care a priority in \n     the 2000 election.\n       Putting technology to good use, the campaign has collected \n     more than 2,000 personal child care stories from families \n     across the country who have faxed, phoned or visited the \n     campaign's Web site at www.lifetimetv.com. These stories have \n     been delivered to Congress, and some have been used in a \n     documentary produced by Lee Grant that will premiere on \n     Lifetime on April 20. ``Confronting the Crisis: Childcare in \n     America'' is the most powerful hour of film on the nation's \n     child care problem that I have ever seen.\n       One of its great sources of strength is in showing that \n     child care is no longer a woman's problem: It now involves \n     fathers as well, and fathers play a starring role in the \n     documentary. We meet Jeff, a widower, and one of 2 million \n     single fathers, who quit a well-paid night job because there \n     was no nighttime child care available. He now works days, and \n     he and his sister share child care responsibilities. \n     ``Everything's rushed,'' he said--as apt a description of the \n     working parent culture as you could find.\n       We meet women in the welfare-to-work programs that 10,000 \n     companies are participating in, Chicora is up at 4 a.m. to \n     get her child to day care so she can go to work. Her mother \n     died, so she is raising her 15-year-old sister as well. She \n     earns $9.50 an hour and is able to make it because she gets a \n     child care voucher. When that runs out, she will face child \n     care costs of about $6,000 a year. ``Education's first,'' she \n     says, and she holds all the hope in the world for her child. \n     She doesn't need a miracle to make it: That she is still in \n     the game is the miracle. What she needs is for that voucher \n     to continue until she can get on her feet financially.\n       We go to France, where child care is ``part of the \n     culture,'' in Grant's words. And we meet Sheriff Pat \n     Sullivan, of Arapahoe County, Colo., a leader of ``Fight \n     Crime: Invest in Kids,'' an organization of law enforcement \n     officials who believe before-school and after-school programs \n     are critical to preventing youth violence. Sullivan is a \n     conservative Republican. The question, he says, is where to \n     put tax dollars. The answer is not in more jails, he says, \n     but in child care, and that includes programs that keep \n     adolescents busy. Idle minds are the devil's playground.\n       Voices from across the political spectrum, from law \n     enforcement to social workers, from brain researchers to \n     pediatricians, are calling for a vastly improved system of \n     child care. Neglect, whether in infancy or adolescence, is \n     the breeding ground of despair, and that, in turn, is the \n     breeding ground for antisocial behavior. The hope here is \n     that the ``Caring for Kids'' campaign and Lifetime's \n     documentary can help galvanize the nation into action.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont and other members of this body in strong support \nof legislation that takes a much needed step on behalf of our Nation's \nchildren. I am very sad to say, however, that Louisiana ranks among the \nworst when it comes to providing for its children. By providing access \nto quality child care that is both safe and affordable the Caring for \nAmerica's Children Act will improve the lives of children in Louisiana \nand across the Nation.\n  As a professional with two young children, I am well aware of the \nchallenges that face working parents as they balance their children's \nneeds with the demands of their careers. I also know first hand how \nexpensive quality child care is, costing anywhere from over $3,000 per \nyear to over $10,000 per year, depending upon where a family resides. \nFor the parents of some 800,000 children in Louisiana who spend most of \ntheir day outside their parent's care, these costs are prohibitive. It \nis especially difficult for over 50 percent of Louisiana families who \nneed child care, but whose incomes fall below the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  To address this dilemma, this legislation would increase the child \ncare and development block grant (CCDBG) from $1 billion to $2 billion. \nBy doubling the funding level for CCDBG, twice as many poor children \nwill receive quality child care. Presently, however, only eight percent \nof Louisiana's poor children are being assisted through this program. \nWith this increase another 40,000 children will receive needed help. \nNevertheless, the demand for assistance will far outweigh funding, so \nthousands of parents and their children will continue to go unserved.\n  In addition to the shortage of funding for low-income children, \nLouisiana, like many other states, must confront two other critical \nissues dealing with child care. First, facilities must be improved and \nexpanded. Secondly, minimum quality standards must be set at the state \nand local levels for child care providers. This like other educational \nimprovements will only occur when we expect more, provide more, and pay \nmore for quality care. If we do not, the status quo will remain the \nsame. For example, the average wage of a child care worker in Louisiana \nin 1997 was only $10,760, barely above what a minimum wage job would \npay annually. Worse yet, the ratio of children to care givers in \nLouisiana far exceeded the recommended ratios.\n  On a national level, safety in child care facilities is another \ncritical issue. Earlier this week the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission announced that it had examined 220 licensed child care \nsettings. They found that most contained at least one safety violation, \nsuch as crib bedding that could suffocate babies or loops on window \nblind cords that could cause strangulation. Moreover, the agency found \nthat 31,000 children, age 4 and younger, were treated in 1997 in \nhospital emergency rooms for injuries they received in child care and \nschool settings. Additionally, at least 56 children have died in child \ncare facilities since 1990.\n  To provide states with additional resources for the purpose of \nimproving the quality of their day care facilities, this bill \nestablishes a quality improvement incentive program. States would \nreceive funds based on the CCDBG formula, which could be used for a \nvariety of activities designed to improve the quality of child care \nwithin each state. Additionally, the bill also provides greater \nprofessional development opportunities for child care workers through a \nnew distance learning program and interactive computer applications. \nThe legislation will also provide states with greater flexibility, so \nthat they can use their community development block grant funds for the \nconstruction and/or renovation of child care facilities.\n  Finally, important tax provisions are included in this legislation \nfor both parents who work or stay home. Toward this end, the bill would \nincrease:\n  the child tax credit from $500 to $900 per year;\n  the dependent care tax credit (DCTC) to $3,600 for one dependent and \n$6,000 for two or more dependents; and\n  expand the home office tax deduction so that parents who work out of \ntheir home will not be penalized.\n\nBy providing parents with these additional benefits, families will have \ngreater options in ensuring their children receive the most appropriate \ncare depending on individual family circumstances.\n  I am also very pleased that appropriate modifications to our Federal \nchild care system are included in this legislation. Most importantly, \nthis bill would allow Federal agencies to use appropriated funds for \nthe purpose of making child care more affordable to low-income Federal \nworkers. Additionally, within six months of the passage of this \nlegislation every Federal child care facility will have to be licensed. \nWithin three years, they must also meet standards established by a \nchild care accreditation entity. The Federal facilities title also \nreauthorizes the Trible amendment that allows Federal facilities to \nprovide on-site care and innovative approaches to expand child care \nservices on a contractual basis.\n  Before the Congress enacts legislation to enhance child care at the \nstate level, it is essential that the Federal Government first address \nthe deficiencies and inadequacies within its own system. While the \nFederal Government has made significant improvements, we must ensure \nthat Federal Government leads by example.\n  Mr. President, improving the availability of quality and affordable \nchild\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\ncare should not be a partisan issue. A recent Carnegie study found that \nchildren in poor quality child care are delayed in language and reading \nskills, and display more aggression toward other children and adults. \nWe should not delay one more year while thousands of children are held \nback because of our inaction in the Congress.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Robb, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grams, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        McConnell, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 815. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe credit for producing electricity from certain renewable resources; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                poultry electric energy power (peep) act\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation that \nwould amend section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax \ncredit to biomass energy facilities that use poultry litter as a fuel \nfor generating electricity.\n  I am pleased to report that my bill has received even more cosponsors \nthan when it was introduced in the 105th Congress. Fourteen of my \ncolleagues are joining me as original cosponsors. They include Senators \nJeffords, Coverdell, Helms, Robb, Mikulski, Biden, Sessions, \nHutchinson, Sarbanes, Leahy, Grams, Shelby, McConnell, and Harkin.\n  Mr. President, I am bullish on poultry's future in America. It is \nhard not to be with worldwide poultry consumption growing at double-\ndigit rates.\n  In the United States, poultry production has tripled since 1975. We \nnow produce almost 8 billion chickens a year to feed the growing \nworldwide demand.\n  In particular, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia produce some of the \nworld's finest poultry. Just last year Delmarva poultry farmers \nproduced over 600 million chickens. Our poultry farmers are among the \nmost productive and efficient in the world.\n  As the amount of chickens we produce as a nation has grown, so too \nhas the need to find creative means for disposing of poultry manure.\n  Due to environmental pressures, spreading manure on land is no longer \nan option in some areas for our rapidly growing poultry industry. In \nthose areas, the nutrient runoff from the manure has been identified as \na contributing factor in surface and groundwater pollution.\n  Addressing these water quality problems will require a range of \ninnovative approaches. One part of the solution may be to use poultry \nmanure to generate electricity.\n  The United Kingdom has two utility plants that use poultry manure to \ngenerate electricity. These two poultry power plants will, when \ncombined with a third scheduled to open soon, burn 50 percent of the \nUK's total volume of chicken manure.\n  The electricity generated by these plants will supply enough power \nfor 37,000 homes. These plants have the support of both the poultry \nindustry and the international environmental community.\n  The way this system works is simple.\n  Power stations buy poultry manure from surrounding poultry farmers \nand transport it to the power station. At the station the manure is \nburned in a furnace at high temperatures, heating water in a boiler to \nproduce steam which drives a turbine linked to a generator. The \nelectricity is then transferred to the local electricity grid for use \nby commercial and residential customers.\n  There are no waste products created through this process. Instead, a \nvaluable by-product emerges in the form of a nitrogen-free ash, which \nis marketed as an environmentally friendly fertilizer.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide a tax credit to \nenergy facilities that use poultry manure as a fuel to generate \nelectricity.\n  It will build on concepts in the Tax Code that provide incentives for \ninnovative alternative energy production.\n  This legislation will provide incentives for electricity generation \nthat will not only help dispose of poultry manure, but will also supply \nour Nation's farmers with a clean fertilizer free of nitrates.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill, the Poultry \nElectric Energy Power Act. It is important for future generations that \nwe continue to explore innovative alternative technologies that will \nhelp protect our environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poultry Electric Energy \n     Power (PEEP) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICITY FROM \n                   CERTAIN RENEWABLE RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Credit for Producing Electricity From Poultry Waste.--\n     Section 45(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (defining qualified energy resources) is amended by striking \n     ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (A), by striking the \n     period at the end of subparagraph (B) and inserting ``, \n     and'', and by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) poultry waste.''\n       (b) Extension of Placed in Service Date.--Section 45(c)(3) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified \n     facility) is amended by striking ``1999'' and inserting \n     ``2005''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to facilities placed in service after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Roth as an \noriginal co-sponsor of legislation to amend Section 45 of the tax code \nfor the production of electricity from environmentally-friendly \nmethods, including poultry litter, the Poultry Electric Power Act.\n  Mr. President, our nation's poultry consumption continues to grow in \nrapid numbers. We now produce almost 8 billion chickens a year in the \nUnited States. My home State of Minnesota is now the nation's largest \nproducer of turkeys, with an estimated 44 million produced last year \nalone. According to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, Minnesota \nturkey producers and processors earned 1997 incomes of $180 million and \nspinoff industries earned $374 million in 1996. In Minnesota, the \nturkey industry includes 2,810 jobs in production and 4,552 jobs in \nprocessing. So, Mr. President, you can see that the poultry industry is \nextremely important to rural Minnesota.\n  I continue to believe that we must explore a wide variety of \nalternative energy sources that provide a number of benefits for our \nnation. First, this bill will provide another market and revenue source \nfor our farmers who so badly need diversified sources of income. \nSecond, the bill will assist our nation in increasing our energy \nsecurity. Third, this bill will help to improve the environment not \nonly by providing a clean energy source, but by assisting in the \ndisposal of poultry manure in an environmentally friendly way. Fourth, \nthis bill will help create spin-off jobs for our nation's rural \ncommunities--jobs many rural communities badly need.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I want to \nthank Senator Roth for leading this important effort in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 816. A bill to amend section 3681 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to the special forfeiture of collateral profits of a crime; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     FEDERAL SON OF SAM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced a bill to correct \nproblems with the Federal ``Son of Sam'' law, as those problems were \nperceived by the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, I am reintroducing this \nlegislation, which deals with a continuing problem. The New York \nstatute analyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute \nwhich I seek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work \nof a criminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the \nperpetrator's crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by \nthe Court, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without \nchanges, it is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, \ncriminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\ncrimes, while victims and families are exploited.\n  The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional \ndeficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son \nof Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court \nfound the state to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over \ninclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter \nhow tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the \nstatute included only expressive works, not other forms of property.\n  To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes \nsignificantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court \ncriticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all-\nencompassing: It includes various types of property related to the \ncrime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized \nthe statute for being over inclusive, including the proceeds from all \nworks, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits \nthe property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property \nattributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the \nstatute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a \nconviction.\n  The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of \nforfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents were once forfeited to the \ngovernment. More recent case law addresses the concept of forfeiting \nany property used in the commission of drug related crimes, or proceeds \nfrom those crimes. I hope that courts interpreting this statute will \nlook to this legal history and find it binding or persuasive.\n  The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to \nforfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds \nare transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if \nthe airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the \nproperty, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be \nforfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State Attorney General \nto proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that \nthere is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit \nat the expense of their victims and the families of victims.\n  One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: \nThe old statute included only crime which resulted in physical harm to \nanother; this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably \nnot included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, \nkidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement.\n  Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals \nnot profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is \nnot used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I \nbelieve victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to \nensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed \ncrimes against them. I asked for your support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SPECIAL FORFEITURE OF COLLATERAL PROFITS OF CRIME.\n\n       Section 3681 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) In General.--\n       ``(1) Forfeiture of proceeds.--Upon the motion of the \n     United States attorney made at any time after conviction of a \n     defendant for an offense described in paragraph (2), and \n     after notice to any interested party, the court shall order \n     the defendant to forfeit all or any part of proceeds received \n     or to be received by the defendant, or a transferee of the \n     defendant, from a contract relating to the transfer of a \n     right or interest of the defendant in any property described \n     in paragraph (3), if the court determines that--\n       ``(A) the interests of justice or an order of restitution \n     under this title so require;\n       ``(B) the proceeds (or part thereof) to be forfeited \n     reflect the enhanced value of the property attributable to \n     the offense; and\n       ``(C) with respect to a defendant convicted of an offense \n     against a State--\n       ``(i) the property at issue, or the proceeds to be \n     forfeited, have travelled in interstate or foreign commerce \n     or were derived through the use of an instrumentality of \n     interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       ``(ii) the attorney general of the State has declined to \n     initiate a forfeiture action with respect to the proceeds to \n     be forfeited.\n       ``(2) Offenses described.--An offense is described in this \n     paragraph if it is--\n       ``(A) an offense under section 794 of this title;\n       ``(B) a felony offense against the United States or any \n     State; or\n       ``(C) a misdemeanor offense against the United States or \n     any State resulting in physical harm to any individual.\n       ``(3) Property described.--Property is described in this \n     paragraph if it is any property, tangible or intangible, \n     including any--\n       ``(A) evidence of the offense;\n       ``(B) instrument of the offense, including any vehicle used \n     in the commission of the offense;\n       ``(C) real estate where the offense was committed;\n       ``(D) document relating to the offense;\n       ``(E) photograph or audio or video recording relating to \n     the offense;\n       ``(F) clothing, jewelry, furniture, or other personal \n     property relating to the offense;\n       ``(G) movie, book, newspaper, magazine, radio or television \n     production, or live entertainment of any kind depicting the \n     offense or otherwise relating to the offense;\n       ``(H) expression of the thoughts, opinions, or emotions of \n     the defendant regarding the offense; or\n       ``(I) other property relating to the offense.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 817. A bill to improve academic and social outcomes for students \nand reduce both juvenile crime and the risk that youth will become \nvictims of crime by providing productive activities during after school \nhours; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                after school and anti-crime act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, every day, millions of working parents are \nfaced with the dilemma of finding constructive activities for their \nschool-aged children to become involved in during the after school \nhours. These parents know that, when unsupervised, the likelihood of \ntheir child becoming involved with drugs, alcohol or criminal activity \nis increased. In fact, juvenile crime peaks during the hours of 3 p.m. \nand 6 p.m.--after school.\n  That is why I am introducing a bill to help assuage the concerns of \nparents, law enforcement and communities to help develop edifying \nactivities for youth during the after school hours. The After School \nEducation and Anti-Crime Act of 1999 will help give our children safe, \nproductive places to go after the school bell rings, which is what \nninety-two percent of all Americans have indicated they strongly \nsupport.\n  Not only do after school programs provide children with activities \nand parents with relief, they also help law enforcement officials \nconnect with their communities and help them reduce incidences of \njuvenile crime. Several law enforcement organizations have expressed \ntheir support of my proposal and for after school programs, including \nthe National Association of Police Athletic and Activity Leagues \n(PALS), Fight Crime Invest in Kids, National Sheriffs Association, \nMajor Cities' Police Chiefs and other law enforcement representing \nCalifornia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Maine and Rhode Island.\n  This legislation would authorize $600 million in funding for after-\nschool programs. These programs, as developed by communities, will \noffer positive alternatives in the after school hours, such as \nmentoring, academic assistance, recreation, technology and job skills \ntraining, and drug, alcohol, and gang prevention programs.\n  If passed, the funding in this bill would enable an estimated 1.1 \nmillion children each year to participate in after school programs. The \ndemand for after school programs is very high. Last year alone, nearly \n2,000 school districts applied for after school federal assistance--of \nthat, only 287 grants were awarded.\n  We have the opportunity in the 106th Congress to answer the call of \ncommunities all across America that understand the importance of--and \nneed for--after school programs for kindergarten, elementary and \nsecondary school students. After school programs are anti-crime, pro-\neducation, pro-community, and make common sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\n                                 S. 817\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``After School Education and \n     Anti-Crime Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to improve academic and social \n     outcomes for students and reduce both juvenile crime and the \n     risk that youth will become victims of crime by providing \n     productive activities during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n     their parents and grandparents.\n       (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n     without supervision, companionship, or activity, than the \n     students spend in school.\n       (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n     12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n       (4) The consequences of academic failure are more dire in \n     1999 than ever before.\n       (5) After school programs have been shown in many States to \n     help address social problems facing our Nation's youth, such \n     as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang involvement.\n       (6) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal/State \n     partnership.\n       (7) Over 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with presidents of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of \n     Police Associations, which together represent 360,000 police \n     officers, have called upon public officials to provide after \n     school programs that offer recreation, academic support, and \n     community service experience, for school-age children and \n     teens in the United States.\n       (8) One of the most important investments that we can make \n     in our children is to ensure that they have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       The goals of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To increase the academic success of students.\n       (2) To promote safe and productive environments for \n     students in the after school hours.\n       (3) To provide alternatives to drug, alcohol, tobacco, and \n     gang activity.\n       (4) To reduce juvenile crime and the risk that youth will \n     become victims of crime during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto conduct a study of the mortality and adverse outcome rates of \nMedicare patients related to the provision of anesthesia services; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3790-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3790-S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE SAFE SENIORS ASSURANCE STUDY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Safe \nSeniors Assurance Study Act of 1999.'' I am joined in this effort by my \ncolleague, Senator Reid from Nevada. This bill would require that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services conduct a study and analyze the \nimpact of physician supervision, or lack of physician supervision, on \ndeath rates of Medicare patients associated with the administration of \nanesthesia services. Since the\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nMedicare program began, the Health Care Financing Adminstration's \n(HCFA) standards for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers have \nrequired that a physician either provide the anesthesia care or \nsupervise the anesthesia care provided by nurse anesthetists. This \nrequirement has also applied to the Medicaid program.\n  The very old and the very young, both covered by these two federal \ninsurance programs, represent the segments of our population that, on \naverage, face the highest anesthesia risks. The two programs cover over \n40 million Americans.\n  In December 1997, HCFA proposed changes to its standards for \nhospitals and surgical centers. Included in these proposed changes was \nthe elimination of the physician supervision requirement, leaving to \nstate governments the decision whether physician supervision of nurse \nanesthetists was necessary. In issuing its proposed changes, HCFA \noffered no scientific data indicating that anesthesia safety would not \nbe impaired as a result of the changed rule, and has offered no such \ndata to this day.\n  In 1992, HCFA considered a similar change, but rejected it. After \nreviewing the studies available at the time showing anesthesia \noutcomes, HCFA concluded: ``In consideration of the risks associated \nwith anesthesia procedures, we believe it would not be appropriate to \nallow anesthesia administration by a non-physician anesthetist unless \nunder supervision by an anesthesiologist or the operating \npractitioner.'' HCFA also declined to adopt as a ``national minimum \nstandard of care, a practice that is allowed in only some states.''\n  In the only comparative anesthesia outcome study published since \n1992, researchers found that outcomes were better in hospitals having \nBoard-certified anesthesiologists on staff. In the Fall of last year, \nan abstract of a University of Pennsylvania study of 65,000 Medicare \nsurgical cases indicated that mortality and `failure to rescue' rates \nsignificantly improved when a nurse anesthetist was supervised by an \nanesthesiologist rather than the operating surgeon. This latter study \nis expected to be published in final form later this year.\n  The Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations \nmeasure recommended that HCFA ``base retaining or changing the current \nrequirement of physician supervision. . .on scientifically valid \noutcomes data.'' The Report suggested ``an outcome approach that would \nexamine, using existing operating room anesthesia data, mortality and \nadverse outcomes rates by different anesthesia providers, adjusted to \nreflect relevant scientific variables.''\n  A bill was introduced in the House in early February by \nRepresentatives Dave Weldon and Gene Green that would require HCFA to \nundertake the congressionally-recommended outcome study of Medicare \npatients, and complete it by June 30, 2000. That bill currently has \nabout 37 cosponsors--Republicans and Democrats. This is not a partisan \nissue, but an issue about safety. The bill that I am introducing with \nmy colleague, Senator Harry Reid today, is very similar to the Weldon/\nGreen bill in the House. Our Senate version would only require that the \nSecretary of HHS consider the results of the June 2000 study in \ndeciding whether or not to implement its 1997 proposal.\n  Physician anesthesiologists personally provide, or supervise \nanesthesia administration by a qualified non-physician, 90% of the \nanesthesia care in this country. In the rest of the cases, supervision \nis provided by the operating practitioner. Under the Medicare program, \nthere is no additional cost for having an anesthesiologist provide or \nsupervise the anesthesia care versus having a non-physician provide the \nanesthesia under the supervision of the operating practitioner. The \nproposed HCFA rule change does not, therefore, generate any cost \nsavings.\n  Anesthesiologists are physicians who, after four years of pre-medical \ntraining in college, have completed eight years of medical education \nand specialized residency training. This is in contrast to the 24 to 30 \nmonths of training received by nurse anesthetists after nursing \nschool--in fact, about 37% of nurse anesthetists have not graduated \nfrom college.\n  The American Medical Association's House of Delegates last December \napproved a resolution supporting legislation requiring that an \nappropriately licensed and credentialed physician administer or \nsupervise anesthesia care. National surveys of Medicare beneficiaries \nperformed by the Tarrance Group in January 1998 and 1999 show that 4 \nout of 5 seniors oppose the elimination of the current physician \nsupervision requirement.\n  Let's err on the side of safety and caution by requiring that the \nSecretary of HHS conduct a study on the mortality and death rates of \nMedicare patients associated with the administration of anesthesia care \nby different providers. Analyzing the impact of physician supervision \non anesthesia care and requiring the Secretary to simply consider the \nresults of that study in determining whether or not to change current \nregulations to allow unsupervised nurse anesthetists to administer \nanesthesia services, is the very least we can do to ensure that we are \nmaking safe changes to existing regulations--changes that HCFA rejected \nin 1992 when studies of anesthesia outcomes were up-to-date and \navailable.\n  If HCFA is going to now change its policy in 1999, we should ask HCFA \nto show us the scientific and clinical data behind its decision to \nensure that the safety of our most vulnerable populations--our children \nand our elderly--are adequately protected. None of us--including HCFA--\nis in a position to judge the merits of this proposed rule change \nwithout first gathering and then analyzing up-to-date scientific \nevidence. Only then can patients be confident in the safety and quality \nof their anesthesia care. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 819. A bill to provide funding for the National Park System from \nouter Continental Shelf revenues; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                     National Park Preservation Act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Member of the Senate, I am today \nintroducing the National Park Preservation Act with my colleague \nSenator Reid of Nevada. This legislation will preserve and protect \nthreatened or impaired ecosystems, critical habitats, and cultural and \nother core park resources within our National Park System.\n  As you are all aware, the National Park Service has a presence in \nvirtually every state in the nation. There are a total of 345 units in \nthe national park system spread throughout the nation. My home state of \nFlorida is home to three National Parks--Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry \nTortugas; two National Preserves--Big Cypress and Timucuan Ecological \nand Historical Preserve; two National Seashores--Canaveral and Gulf \nIslands; two National Monuments--Castillo de San Marcos and Fort \nMatanzas; and two National Memorials--DeSoto and Fort Caroline.\n  Although these National Parks are treasured throughout the nation, \neveryday activities often threaten the resources of our park system. \nFor example, in Yellowstone National Park an inadequate sewage system \nfrequently discharges materials into precious resources such as \nYellowstone Lake. Development surrounding Mojave National Park \nthreatens the park's desert wilderness. Ground-level ozone accumulating \nat Great Smoky Mountains National Park threatens the park's core \nresource--visibility. Manipulation of the natural hydrologic system \nimpacts water quality and water availability in Everglades National \nPark.\n  The Graham-Reid National Park Preservation Act will preserve and \nprotect threatened or impaired ecosystems, critical habitat, cultural \nresources and other core resources within our National Park System. The \nbill will establish a permanent account using Outer Continental Shelf \nrevenues to provide $500 million annually to the Department of Interior \nto protect and preserve these resources. These funds will be made \navailable for projects such as land acquisition, construction, grants \nto state or local governments, or partnerships with other federal \nagencies that seek to combat identified threats to ecosystems, critical \nhabitats, cultural resources, and other core park resources. In this \nlegislation, I\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\nalso continue my longstanding efforts to protect Florida's coastal \nresources by making revenues from any new oil and gas leases or from \ndevelopment of any existing leases in a moratorium area ineligible for \nexpenditure in this account.\n  Thirty percent of the $500 million will be available for park units \nthreatened or impaired by activities occurring within the unit such as \nsewage treatment at Yellowstone Park. Seventy percent of the $500 \nmillion will be available for park units threatened or impaired by \nactivities occurring outside of the unit, such as degradation of water \nresources at Everglades National Park.\n  Of these funds, the legislation specifically provides $75 million to \nthe Everglades restoration effort as the keynote project of the \nlegislation.\n  The Everglades National Park is one component of the Everglades \necosystem which stretches from the Kissimmee River basin near Orlando \nand all the way to Florida Bay and Keys. It is the only ecosystem of \nits kind in the world. It is the largest wetland and subtropical \nwilderness in the United States. It is home to a unique population of \nplant and wildlife. The water in this system is the lifeblood of the \nfreshwater aquifer that provides most of Florida's drinking water.\n  For more than a century, this ecosystem has been altered to \nfacilitate development and protect against hurricanes and droughts. \nToday, almost 50% of the original Everglades has been drained or \notherwise altered. The remaining Everglades, and in particular, the \nregions located within Everglades National Park, are severely \nthreatened by nutrient-rich water, interrupted hydrology, decreased \nwater supply, exotic plants, and mercury contamination.\n  On July 1 the Army Corps of Engineers will submit to Congress an \nEverglades restoration plan, termed the ``Restudy'' by the Water \nResources Development Act of 1996. This plan reviews the original \nCentral and South Florida Flood Control project which was initiated in \nthe 1940s by the Army Corps and has been the source of the ecosystem \nmanipulation that occurred in Florida since that time. The Restudy \noutlines the basic elements of a plan to restore the Everglades as \nclosely to their natural state as possible. This is a difficult and \ncomplex task since the original area of the Everglades was reduced by \n50% with the development of both coasts as large metropolitan areas. \nCosts of execution of this plan will be shared on a 50-50 basis with \nthe state of Florida.\n  There has never been a restoration project of this size in the \nhistory of the United States or the world. This is an opportunity to \npreserve a national treasure that was destroyed by our own actions in \nthe past.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 4.3- cent motor fuel excise taxes on railroads and inland waterway \ntransportation which remain in the general fund of the Treasury; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the transportation tax equity and fairness act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senators Breaux and Jeffords, to correct an inequity that \ncurrently exists with the taxes imposed on transportation fuels.\n  In 1990 Congress extended fuel taxes beyond their traditional role as \ntransportation user fees by introducing a 2.5 cents-per-gallon federal \ndeficit reduction tax on railroad and highway fuels. These taxes were \nenacted as part of legislation that was designed to reduce the federal \nbudget that existed at that time.\n  In 1993, Congress increased these ``deficit reduction fuel taxes'' \nand extended them to inland waterway users and commercial airlines. The \ntaxes imposed on barges went into effect immediately, while those \naffecting the airlines were delayed for 2 years. As a result of these \ntwo pieces of legislation a deficit reduction fuel tax of 6.8 cents per \ngallon was imposed on railroads and trucks, 4.3 cents per gallon on \nbarges, and a suspended 4.3 cents per gallon tax on airlines.\n  Beginning in 1995, however, Congress began to redirect these taxes \nfor other uses. The first step was taking 2.5 cents of the amount paid \nby highway users and transferring it to the Highway Trust Fund. The \nHighway Trust Fund,\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nas many of my colleagues know, is the principal source of money used \nfor highway infrastructure. Taxes paid into this trust fund by highway \nusers results in a direct benefit to them by being recycled back into \nimprovements to our nation's roads and bridges.\n  Recognizing that this transfer would place the railroad industry--a \ndirect competitor of the trucking industry--at a competitive \ndisadvantage, Congress reduced the deficit reduction tax paid by \nrailroads by 1.25 cents. As a result of these changes, then, highway \nusers, commerical airlines and inland waterway users paid a deficit \nreduction tax of 4.3 cents while railroads paid a tax of 5.55 cents.\n  The 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act further disadvantaged the railroad and \ninland waterway sectors by relieving highway users and commercial \nairlines from the remaining 4.3 cent deficit reduction fuel tax. \nInstead of these funds going into the General Fund of the Treasury, the \ntaxes paid by these sectors were redirected to their respective trust \nfunds.\n  I have a chart that I will ask be included with my statement that \nshows the evolution of deficit reduction fuel excise taxes over the \npast decade.\n  Today, two sectors of the transportation industry--railroads and \ninland waterway users--pay ``deficit reduction'' taxes even though we \nno longer have a deficit. Furthermore, these sectors are required to \ncontinue paying these taxes even though their competitors do not.\n  There is absolutely no policy rationale for railroads and barge \noperators to pay deficit reduction fuel taxes while motor carriers and \ncommerical airlines are required to pay nothing.\n  We believe the time has come to correct this unfairness. This bill \nlevels the playing field by repealing the remaining 4.3 cent tax paid \nby the railroads and inland waterway users.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to our legislation. Mr. President, I ask \nthat the chart be included in the Record.\n  The chart follows:\n\n DEFICIT REDUCTION FUEL EXCISE TAXES PAID BY THE VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION\n                             SECTORS BY YEAR\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1990   1993   1995   1997   1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHighway Users........................  2.5    6.8    4.3    0      0\nRailroads............................  2.5    6.8    5.55   5.55   4.3\nBarges...............................  0      4.3    4.3    4.3    4.3\nCommercial Airlines..................  0      0      4.3    0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and \n        Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 821. A bill to provide for the collection of data on traffic \nstops; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               traffic stops statistics study act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill help our nation deal with the problem of racial profiling during \ntraffic stops. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators \nFeingold, Kennedy, and Torricelli.\n  Across the country, too many motorists fear that they will be stopped \nby law enforcement for nothing more than the color of their skin. The \noffense of ``D.W.B.'' or ``Driving While Black'' is well known to \nminorities, and the fact that this term has entered the common \nvocabulary demonstrates the pervasiveness of the problem.\n  In my home state and other states along the Interstate-95 corridor, \nthere have been many serious and credible allegations of racial \nprofiling. For example, statistics recently released by the state of \nNew Jersey, reveal that 73 percent of motorists arrested on the New \nJersey turnpike in early 1997 were minorities. Similarly, a court-\nordered study in Maryland found that more than 70 percent of drivers \nstopped on Interstate-95 were African American though they made up only \n17.5 percent of drivers.\n  Not surprisingly, the practice of racial profiling has led to \nlitigation. In the case of State versus Soto, a state court judge ruled \nthat troopers were engaging in racial profiling on the southernmost \nsegment of the New Jersey Turnpike. That decision spurred the United \nStates Department of Justice to begin a ``pattern and practice'' \ninvestigation, in December 1996, to determine whether the New Jersey \nState Police had violated the constitutional rights of minority \nmotorists. The Department of Justice is also investigating police \nagencies in Eastpointe, Michigan, and Orange County, Florida. \nAdditionally, a number of individuals and organizations have filed \nprivate lawsuits seeking to end the inappropriate use of racial \nprofiling.\n  While litigation may bring about limited reforms, it is clear that \nCongress must develop a nationwide approach. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will help define the scope of the problem, increase \npolice awareness, and suggest whether additional steps are necessary. \nIt would require that the Attorney General collect data on traffic \nstops and report the results to Congress. Because better relations \nbetween police and citizens will help ease racial tensions, the measure \nwill also authorize grants to law enforcement agencies for the \ndevelopment of better training programs and policing strategies.\n  In recent decades, we have made great progress in strengthening the \ncivil rights of all Americans. Many dedicated law enforcement officials \nhave contributed greatly to this effort by applying the law fairly and \nworking to strengthen the bonds of trust in the communities they serve. \nTo their credit, some police agencies have spoken out against the \npractice of racial profiling. In New Jersey, the State Troopers \nFraternal Association, the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers \nAssociation, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association have \nstated that ``anyone out there using racial profiling or in any way \nmisusing or abusing their position, must be identified and properly \ndealt with.'' But we cannot allow the actions of some police officials \nto undermine these achievements, and we should work to ensure that \nminority motorists are no longer subjected to unwarranted traffic \nstops.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and help protect the \ncivil rights of all Americans. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Traffic Stops Statistics \n     Study Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CONDUCT STUDY.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall conduct a \n     nationwide study of stops for traffic violations by law \n     enforcement officers.\n       (2) Initial analysis.--The Attorney General shall perform \n     an initial analysis of existing data, including complaints \n     alleging and other information concerning traffic stops \n     motivated by race and other bias.\n       (3) Data collection.--After completion of the initial \n     analysis under paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall then \n     gather the following data on traffic stops from a nationwide \n     sample of jurisdictions, including jurisdictions identified \n     in the initial analysis:\n       (A) The traffic infraction alleged to have been committed \n     that led to the stop.\n       (B) Identifying characteristics of the driver stopped, \n     including the race, gender, ethnicity, and approximate age of \n     the driver.\n       (C) Whether immigration status was questioned, immigration \n     documents were requested, or an inquiry was made to the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service with regard to any \n     person in the vehicle.\n       (D) The number of individuals in the stopped vehicle.\n       (E) Whether a search was instituted as a result of the stop \n     and whether consent was requested for the search.\n       (F) Any alleged criminal behavior by the driver that \n     justified the search.\n       (G) Any items seized, including contraband or money.\n       (H) Whether any warning or citation was issued as a result \n     of the stop.\n       (I) Whether an arrest was made as a result of either the \n     stop or the search and the justification for the arrest.\n       (J) The duration of the stop.\n       (b) Reporting.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall report the \n     results of its initial analysis to Congress, and make such \n     report available to the public, and identify the \n     jurisdictions for which the study is to be conducted. Not \n     later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Attorney General shall report the results of the \n     data collected under this Act to Congress, a copy of which \n     shall also be published in the Federal Register.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       In order to complete the study described in section 2, the \n     Attorney General may provide grants to law enforcement \n     agencies to collect and submit the data described in section \n     2 to the appropriate agency as designated by the Attorney \n     General.\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON USE OF DATA.\n\n       Information released pursuant to section 2 shall not reveal \n     the identity of any individual who is stopped or any law \n     enforcement officer involved in a traffic stop.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Law enforcement agency.--The term ``law enforcement \n     agency'' means an agency of a State or political subdivision \n     of a State, authorized by law or by a Federal, State, or \n     local government agency to engage in or supervise the \n     prevention, detection, or investigation of violations of \n     criminal laws, or a federally recognized Indian tribe.\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' means any \n     Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, \n     or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges \n     to exist as an Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend the \nsenior Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg) in introducing the \nTraffic Stops Statistics Act of 1999. This legislation represents a \nsubstantial step toward ending an insidious form of discrimination that \nis plaguing African-American and Hispanic drivers on our roadways--\nracial profiling. Most law enforcement officers do their best to \nrespect and protect the rights of their fellow citizens, but it has \nbecome undeniable that racial profiling has become a disturbingly \ncommon practice.\n  Racial profiling is the practice of pulling over African American, \nHispanic, and other minority drivers for routine traffic stops as a \npremise for conducting a search for drugs. They might be driving just \nlike any ordinary driver, and so they might be surprised to be pulled \nover. ``Was I speeding?'' they ask. Often, they are told that they have \ncommitted some minor traffic infraction that most people are not even \naware of--sometimes, the infraction is just a pretext--they might be \ntold that their tire tread is not of the correct depth, or that they \nhave a bumper sticker affixed incorrectly. Any such infraction can be \nalleged in order to pull over a target of racial profiling, and as a \npremise to ask for a search. Many people are not aware that they have \nthe right to refuse a search, and many innocent people are afraid that \nsaying no will make them look guilty.\n  The reality is, if they do refuse a search, victims can sometimes \nlook forward to being detained anyway while a canine unit comes out to \nsniff for drugs. That is what happened to attorney Robert Wilkins and \nhis family as they returned to Maryland by car from his grandfather's \nfuneral in Chicago. Mr. Wilkins was fortunate enough to be an attorney \nwho knew his rights, and proceeded to join with the ACLU and other \ngroups to sue the Maryland State Police. As a result of that lawsuit, \nMaryland has conducted its own study of traffic stops, and the results \nindicate that over 75 percent of those people stopped and search on I-\n95 are African-American, even though African-Americans make up only 17 \npercent of the state's population. The innocent people who are \ninevitably caught in these racially motivated stops feel like they are \nbeing punished for what is now called ``DWB''--``Driving While Black,'' \nor ``Driving While Brown.''\n  Mr. President, by and large when minorities are stopped by law \nenforcement officers, they are not attorneys, and they may not know or \nassert all of their rights--they are scared and they are resentful. And \nrightly so, when they have been the victim of racial profiling. Is this \nthe way we want to stop the flow of drugs in America? By randomly \ntargeting racial and ethnic minorities who are doing nothing more \nsuspicious than driving their cars? Do we want law-abiding American \ncitizens to feel as though they are living in a police state, scared \nand reluctant to travel in their cars for fear of being stopped and \nsearched for no reason?\n  While African-Americans make up under 20% of the American population, \nseveral local studies like the Maryland one I mentioned earlier \nindicate that they make up a much greater percentage of all routine \ntraffic stops, and are far more likely to be searched and subsequently \narrested. In my own home state of Wisconsin, a 1996 study by the \nMadison Capital Times revealed that African-Americans receive 13% of \nMadison's traffic tickets, despite the fact that they make up only 4% \nof the city's population, In Florida, the Orlando Sentinel newspaper \nobtained more than 140 hours of videotapes from police patrol cars \nshowing drivers being stopped on Interstate 95. About 70% of the \ndrivers stopped were black or Hispanic, even though they made up only \n5% of all drivers on the road. And in New Jersey, a recent study \nsuggests that African Americans are almost five times as likely to be \nstopped for speeding as drivers of other races.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that ``injustice anywhere is a \nthreat to justice everywhere.'' As Americans, we should all feel \nthreatened when any one of us is denied our personal liberty. Just last \nweek, the United States Supreme Court took yet another step toward \neradicating our Fourth Amendment rights against the invasion of our \nprivacy. It held in Wyoming versus Houghton that police can search the \npersonal belongings of all passengers inside a car when looking for \ncriminal evidence against the driver. I fear that this will send a \nmessage to some law enforcement officers that they can now expand \nracial profiling to include not only the driver of a passing car, but \nalso the passengers. And if you happen to be a passenger in a car that \nwas pulled over because of the color of the driver's skin, you can now \nlook forward to having your personal belongings searched through and \npored over.\n  The Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act of 1999 will begin to shed \nlight on the practice of racial profiling. By analyzing the data that \nthe Justice Department obtains over the next two years, we will get a \nclear picture of the prevalence of the practice of pulling people over \nbecause of their skin color or apparent ethnicity. A version of this \nbill passed the House last year, but died in the Senate. The \nsimultaneous introduction of this bill in the Senate and the House \nshows that we are serious about sending this to the President's desk. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to join with us to enact this \nlegislation.\n  It is high time to put a stop to this blatant and offensive practice, \nwhich is taking some law enforcement officers, and the rest of us, down \na dangerous and discriminatory road.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 822. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on individual taxable earned income and business taxable \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          flat tax act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation on a flat tax. This, of course, is a famous day, April 15, \nthe day when Federal income tax returns are due. Across this land for \nmany days, many weeks, some months, Americans have been struggling with \ntheir tax returns. As we speak, some may have on C-SPAN2 quietly while \nthey are working on their returns at this very moment.\n  I recall seeing long lines at the Philadelphia post office near \nmidnight on income tax day when cars were lined up and people were \ndropping off their tax returns at the post office to beat the filing \ndeadline.\n  This is a good occasion to talk about the flat tax which permits \ntaxpayers to report their income on a postcard. It can actually be done \nin the course of some 15 minutes. I filed my tax return and sent it off \nyesterday. It is very complicated. They say it takes a Philadelphia \nlawyer to fill out a tax return. I think it takes more than a \nPhiladelphia lawyer to fill out a Federal income tax return, and we \nhave labored under the complexities of the Internal Revenue Code for \nfar too long.\n  I first introduced this legislation in March of 1995. I was the \nsecond one in the Congress of the United States to introduce flat-tax \nlegislation. The majority leader, Dick Armey, had introduced the flat \ntax in the House of Representatives the preceding fall. I studied it. I \nstudied the model of Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka, two \ndistinguished professors of economics and tax law at Stanford \nUniversity, and concluded that America ought to have a flat tax and \nthat we could, in fact, have a flat tax if the American people really \nunderstood what a flat tax was all about.\n  The Hall-Rabushka model was revenue neutral at 19 percent. I have \nadded 1 percent in order to allow for two deductions: one on charitable \ncontributions up to $2,500 a year and a second on interest on home \nmortgages of\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nborrowings up to $100,000 to take care of middle-class Americans, \nbecause I think without those two deductions, it would be a political \nimpossibility to have a flat tax enacted.\n  The advantage of the flat tax is that it does have the flatness with \nonly those two deductions, so it is a very simple matter to return the \ntax return.\n  Here is a sample tax return. You fill in your name and your address. \nYou list your total wage, salary, or pension. There is a personal \nallowance, for a family of four. Up to $27,500 pays no tax at all. That \nconstitutes about 53 percent of Americans. It has the two deductions \nfor mortgage interest on debt up to $100,000 for an owner-occupied home \nand charitable contributions up to $2,500; total compensation \nmultiplied by 20 percent, and that is that.\n  The tax burden costs Americans about $224 billion a year of our gross \nnational product, which is mired in complexity and unnecessary \nregulation.\n  The flat tax seeks to bring equity into the tax payment by taxing \nonly once so that the flat tax eliminates tax on net dividends, capital \ngains or estates because all of those items have already been taxed.\n  It would enable Americans to accumulate a great deal more in capital \nwhich would help business expansion which would help the economy. And \nit is projected that the gross national product would be increased by \nsome $2 trillion over 7 years by virtue of this flat tax proposal.\n  The flat tax is a win-win situation all up and down the line because, \nby eliminating the loopholes, it eliminates the opportunities of very \nwealthy Americans to avoid paying taxes at all. When you take a look at \nthe returns of the very, very rich, with the practices of deductions \nand tax shelters, all of which is legal, the very, very wealthy avoid \npaying any tax at all.\n  But this flat tax would have the advantages of capital accumulation, \nwould have the advantage of increasing the gross national product, but \nmost of all would have the simplicity of being able to file a tax \nreturn on a postcard.\n  I think that as I speak--it is always problematic as to how many \npeople are watching C-SPAN2--but I think as I speak there are many \nAmericans across the land tonight who would like to be able to fill out \na tax return in 15 minutes. And my view is that if it were better \nunderstood, that there would be a great public clamor to have a flat \ntax enacted.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to provide for a flat 20% tax on individuals and \nbusinesses. In the 104th Congress, I was the first Senator to introduce \nflat tax legislation and the first Member of Congress to set forth a \ndeficit-neutral plan for dramatically reforming our nation's tax code \nand replacing it with a flatter, fairer plan designed to stimulate \neconomic growth. My flat tax legislation was also the first plan to \nretain limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable \ncontributions.\n  As I traveled around the country and held town hall meetings across \nPennsylvania and other states, the public support for fundamental tax \nreform was overwhelming. I would point out in those speeches that I \nnever leave home without two key documents: (1) my copy of the \nConstitution; and (2) a copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I soon \nrealized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat tax \npostcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see \nwhat life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only \ntake 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer \nburdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest, capital \ngains and estates.\n  Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans \nembrace the simplicity, fairness and growth potential of flat tax \nreform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing \nthat 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current tax \ncode. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat \ntax preferred my flat tax plan with limited deductions for home \nmortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered \nthe 1996 Republican presidential primary, publisher Steve Forbes opined \nin a March 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the tremendous appeal and \npotency of my flat tax plan.\n  Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was \nappointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform and the Commission soon came out with its report recognizing the \nvalue of a fairer, flatter tax code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat \ntax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the 1996 Republican \npresidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat \ntax or a consumption-based tax system.\n  Unfortunately, the politics of that Presidential campaign denied the \nflat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I \nintroduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling on my colleagues to \nexpedite Congressional adoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which \nwas introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted.\n  I reintroduced this legislation in the 105th Congress with slight \nmodifications to reflect inflation-adjusted increases in the personal \nallowances and dependent allowances. While my flat tax proposal was \nfavorably received at town hall meetings in Pennsylvania, Congress \nfailed to move forward on any tax reform during the 105th Congress. I \ntried repeatedly to raise the issue with leadership and the Finance \nCommittee to no avail. I think the American people want this debate to \nmove forward and I think the issue of tax reform is ripe for \nconsideration.\n  In this period of opportunity as we commence the 106th Session of \nCongress, I am optimistic that public support for tax reform will \nenable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and \nnecessary legislation. That is why today I am again introducing my Flat \nTax Act of 1999.\n  My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax \ncode, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This \nlegislation would institute a simple, flat 20% tax rate for all \nindividuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file their \nApril 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal is not \ncast in stone, but is intended to move the debate forward by focusing \nattention on three key principles which are critical to an effective \nand equitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness and economic \ngrowth.\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the \nstudy of the complexities of the tax code 40 years ago as a law student \nat Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in \nmy early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I \npublished a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension \nand Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held \nCorporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, \nwhich in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement \nbenefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was \napparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal \nRevenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some.\n  Before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th Congress, I \nhad discussions with Congressman Richard Armey, the House Majority \nLeader, about his flat tax proposal. In fact, I testified with House \nMajority Leader Richard Armey before the Senate Finance and House Ways \n& Means Committees, as well as the Joint Economic Committee and the \nHouse Small Business Committee on the tremendous benefits of flat tax \nreform. Since then, and both before and after introducing my original \nflat tax bill, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at some length, \nand have engaged in a host of discussions with economists and tax \nexperts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to \nevaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax. Based on \nthose discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to us, I have \nconcluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20% on all business and \npersonal income can be enacted without reducing federal revenues.\n\n  A flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow ordinary \ncitizens to have more influence over how their money is spent because \nthey will spend it--not the government. By creating strong incentives \nfor savings and investment, the flat tax will have the\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nbeneficial result of making available larger pools of capital for \nexpansion of the private sector of the economy--rather than more tax \nmoney for big government. This will mean more jobs and, just as \nimportant, more higher-paying jobs.\n  As a matter of federal tax policy, there has been considerable \ncontroversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate \nparticular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be \nneutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely \neconomic point of view. Our current tax code attempts to use tax policy \nto direct economic activity. Yet actions under that code have \ndemonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis \nfor tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic \npurposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to \npromote. Even when the government responds to particular tax shelters \nwith new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax \nexperts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats \nby changing the structure of their business transactions and then \nclaiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach \nand the revised IRS regulations and precedents.\n  Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle \nbetween $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close \nloopholes is a battle the government can never win. Under the flat tax \nbill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through \nclever manipulations will become a thing of the past.\n  The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by \nProfessors Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at \nStanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no \ndeductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to \ninclude in the legislation limited deductions for home mortgage \ninterest for up to $100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions \nup to $2,500. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of \nthe flat tax by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying \nand charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions are \nso deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American families that \nthey should be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and \nalso political practicality. With those two deductions maintained, \npassage of a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, \nprobably impossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19% \nrate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19% to \n20% to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and \ncharitable deductions. A preliminary estimate in the 104th Congress by \nthe Committee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home \ninterest deduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable \ndeduction at $13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated \nbecause the Hall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to \nbusiness taxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis \nfor concluding that the 1% increase in rate would pay for the two \ndeductions. Revenue estimates for tax code revisions are difficult to \nobtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from fact \nsituations with myriad assumed variables. It is possible that some \nmodification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue \nneutrality.\n  This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Armey and in the Senate late in \n1995 by Senator Richard Shelby, which were both in turn modeled after \nthe Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for \nenormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so \nwell by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their \nsource, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, \ncapital gains, gifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code \ncan become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which \ntranslates into economic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, \nand raising the standard of living for all Americans.\n  In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing \nthe size and cost of government, and this work is ongoing and vitally \nimportant. But the work of downsizing government is only one side of \nthe coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and \ncare, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs \nand government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace \nthose programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of \nAmerican society through private investment and job creation--which can \nhave the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans \nas economic expansion adds to federal revenues. Just as Americans need \na tax code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws \ndesigned to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer \ntoday embodies those principles.\n  My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-\nRabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan \nin four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20% flat tax rate. \nSecond, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage \ninterest and charitable contributions (which will require a 1% higher \ntax rate than otherwise). Third, my bill would maintain the automatic \nwithholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Lastly, my bill is \ndesigned to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine our vital \nefforts to balance the nation's budget.\n\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are three-fold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts, and as interest rates drop.\n  Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20% \non all income they earn from wages, pensions and salaries. Individuals \nwould not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on savings, or \ndividends--since those items will have already been taxed as part of \nthe flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also eliminate all \nbut two of the deductions and exemptions currently contained within the \ntax code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to ``personal \nallowances'' for themselves and their children. The personal allowances \nare: $10,000 for a single taxpayer; $15,000 for a single head of \nhousehold; $17,500 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,000 per \nchild or dependent. These personal allowances would be adjusted \nannually for inflation after 1999.\n  In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low \nincome families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are \nmuch higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed \nunder the current tax code. For example in the 1998 tax year, the \nstandard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, $6,250 for a head \nof household and $7,100 for a married couple filing jointly, while the \npersonal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,700. Thus, \nunder the current tax code, a family of four which does not itemize \ndeductions would pay tax on all income over $17,900 (personal \nexemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100). By contrast, \nunder my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal \nexemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that \namount.\n  My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of \ncharitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage \ninterest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key \ndeductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this \nlegislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a \ndecision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could \nbe used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20%.\n  With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of \n20%. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of complicated \ndepreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nother complexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-\nsimplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, \ndirect expenses and purchases--a system with much less potential for \nfraud, ``creative accounting'' and tax avoidance.\n  Businesses would be allowed to expense 100% of the cost of capital \nformation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures and \nland, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. The \nbusiness tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company in \nthe form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing revenue \nat the business level and making it inappropriate to re-tax the same \nmonies when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains.\n  Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of \nthe flat tax legislation I am introducing today.\n  The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According \nto the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours \neach year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing \nthrough IRS laws and regulations which fill 17,000 pages and have grown \nfrom 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1995.\n  Whenever the government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it \ncan convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of \ncomplexity, frustration and inefficiency. By way of example, most \nAmericans have become familiar with the absurdities of the government's \nmilitary procurement programs. If these programs have taught us \nanything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet \nseat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and \nrestrictions when the government gets involved. The Internal Revenue \nService is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a \ndistressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized \nprint-outs claiming that additional taxes are due, which require \nrepeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is \ndetermined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first \nplace.\n  The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations \nfor millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the \ngreat majority of the IRS rules, regulations and instructions and \ndelete most of the five million words in the Internal Revenue Code. \nInstead of tens of millions of hours of non-productive time spent in \ncompliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would spend \nonly the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized \nform. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable \nhours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more \ntime with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules \nand regulations.\n  The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a \nsmall postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy \nquestions. Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a \nseemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers.\n\n  Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax \nbill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary \ngovernment regulation, bureaucracy and red tape from our everyday \nlives. The heavy hand of government bureaucracy is particularly onerous \nin the case of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to \nextend its influence into so many aspects of our lives.\n  In 1995, the IRS employed 117,000 people, spread out over countless \noffices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $7 \nbillion, with over $4 billion spent merely on enforcement. By \nsimplifying the tax code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of \nrules and regulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a \nsignificant portion of the IRS budget, including the bulk of the \nfunding now needed for enforcement and administration.\n  In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, \nenergies and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, in 1996, the private sector spent over \n$150 billion complying with federal tax laws. According to a Tax \nFoundation study, adoption of flat tax reform would cut pre-filing \ncompliance costs by over 90 percent.\n  Monies spent by businesses and investors in creating tax shelters and \nfinding loopholes could be instead directed to productive and job-\ncreating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, the \nopportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, \nallowing the government to collect, according to some estimates, over \n$120 billion annually.\n  The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a \ntremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson \nestimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would \nincrease future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value \nterms, over a seven year period. This translates into over $7,500 in \nincreased wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth \nalso means that there will be more jobs--it is estimated that the $2 \ntrillion increase in wealth would lead to the creation of 6 million new \njobs.\n  The economic principles are fairly straightforward. Our current tax \nsystem is inefficient; it is biased toward too little savings and too \nmuch consumption. The flat tax creates substantial incentives for \nsavings and investment by eliminating taxation on interest, dividends \nand capital gains--and tax policies which promote capital formation and \ninvestment are the best vehicle for creation of new and high paying \njobs, and for a greater prosperity for all Americans.\n  It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need \nnot only to eliminate the federal government's reliance on deficits and \nborrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings \nand investment that has been the real engine driving American \nprosperity throughout our history. These concepts are related--the \nfederal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving \nless for businesses to borrow for investments.\n  It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy \nthat represents the pool of all capital available for investment--in \ntraining, education, research, machinery, physical plant, etc.--and \nthat constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics \nhere are daunting. In the 1960s, the net U.S. national savings rate was \n8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. Americans save \nat only one-tenth the rate of the Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate \nof the Germans. This is unacceptable and we must do something to \nreverse the trend.\n  An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that \nalthough the federal budget deficit is the largest cause of \n``dissavings,'' both personal and business savings rates have declined \nsignificantly over the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool \nof capital stock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, \nwe have to do more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very \nmaterially raise our levels of private savings and investment. And we \nhave to do so in a way that will not cause additional deficits.\n  The less money people save, the less money is available for business \ninvestment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and \ninvestment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings \naccounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and \nthe capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and \nthe financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for \nsaving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since \ngains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in \nvalue, are taxed as if they were profits to the taxpayer.\n  With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax free \nmunicipal bonds, our current tax code does virtually nothing to \nencourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over \nconsumption. This bill will change this system, and address this \nproblem. The proposed legislation reverses the current skewed \nincentives by promoting savings and investment by individuals and by \nbusinesses. Individuals would be able to invest and save their money \ntax-free and reap the benefits of the accumulated value of those \ninvestments without paying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these \ninvestments. Businesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed \nthem to expense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology \nin the year the\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\nexpense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax benefits for \nthese investments through complicated depreciation schedules. With \ngreater investment and a larger pool of savings available, interest \nrates and the costs of investment would also drop, spurring even \ngreater economic growth.\n\n  Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue \nlosses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives \nthe bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are \nwrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, \nbut historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues \nactually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of \ntheir take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in \npursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes.\n  As one example, under President Kennedy when individual tax rates \nwere lowered, investment incentives including the investment tax credit \nwere created and then expanded and depreciation rates were accelerated. \nYet, between 1962 and 1967, gross annual federal tax receipts grew from \n$99.7 billion to $148 billion--an increase of nearly 50%. More recently \nafter President Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980's, government tax \nrevenues rose from just under $600 billion in 1981 to nearly $1 \ntrillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut program helped to bring \nabout one of the longest peacetime expansion of the U.S. economy in \nhistory. There is every reason to believe that the flat tax proposed \nhere can do the same--and by maintaining revenue neutrality in this \nflat tax proposal, as we have, we can avoid any increases in annual \ndeficits and the national debt.\n  In addition to increasing federal revenues by fostering economic \ngrowth, the flat tax can also add to federal revenues without \nincreasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research \nService estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals sheltered more \nthan $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and corporations \nsheltered an additional $60 billion. There may well be additional \nmonies hidden in quasi-legal or even illegal ``tax shelters.'' Under a \nflat tax system, all tax shelters will disappear and all income will be \nsubject to taxation.\n  The growth case for a flat tax is compelling. It is even more \ncompelling in the case of a tax revision that is simple and \ndemonstrably fair.\n  By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and \ntheir dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers \nwill pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and \nmiddle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of \ntax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to \nshelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also \nensure that all Americans pay their fair share.\n  The flat tax legislation that I am offering will retain the element \nof progressivity that Americans view as essential to fairness in an \nincome tax system. Because of the lower end income exclusions, and the \ncapped deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable \ncontributions, the effective tax rates under my bill will range from 0% \nfor families with incomes under about $30,000 to roughly 20% for the \nhighest income groups.\n  My proposed legislation demonstrably retains the fairness that must \nbe an essential component of the American tax system.\n  The proposal that I make today is dramatic, but so are its \nadvantages: a taxation system that is simple, fair and designed to \nmaximize prosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages \nare:\n  Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms \nand attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.3 \nbillion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Cuts Government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS \nrules, regulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 \nwords in 1955 to 5.6 million words and 12,000 pages currently. It would \nalso allow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 117,000 \nemployees.\n  Promotes Economic Growth: Economists estimate a growth of over $2 \ntrillion in national wealth over seven years, representing an increase \nof approximately $7,500 in personal wealth for every man, woman and \nchild in America. This growth would also lead to the creation of 6 \nmillion new jobs.\n  Increases Efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis \nof productivity rather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to \neven greater economic expansion.\n  Reduces Interest Rates: Economic forecasts indicate that interest \nrates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, as the flat \ntax removes many of the current disincentives to savings.\n  Lowers Compliance Costs: Americans would be able to save up to $224 \nbillion they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Decreases Fraud: As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \nsimplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and \nfraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue \nannually.\n  Reduces IRS Costs: Simplification of the tax code will allow us to \nsave significantly on the $7 billion annual budget currently allocated \nto the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years \nof enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent \nincrease in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and \nincreased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 \nincrease in the personal income of all Americans.\n  No one likes to pay taxes. But Americans will be much more willing to \npay their taxes under a system that they believe is fair, a system that \nthey can understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather \nthan prevents growth and prosperity. The legislation I introduce today \nwill afford Americans such a tax system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 823. A bill to establish a program to assure the safety of \nprocessed produce intended for human consumption, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   the fruit and vegetable safety act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nbridge obvious gaps in the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables. This \nlegislation will establish basic standards of sanitation for processed \nfruits and vegetables, simple standards that will help assure that \nAmericans can enjoy these foods safely.\n  American families are on the front lines of this food safety battle \nthree times a day--breakfast, lunch and dinner. Health experts advise \nus to eat at least five servings a day of fresh fruits and vegetables \nas part of a healthy lifestyle. Studies show these foods can cut our \nrisks of cancer and heart disease. Americans have listened, and our \nconsumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has grown every year. We can \nnow find a variety of out-of-season produce, imported and exotic foods. \nWe also enjoy convenience foods, ready-to-eat mixed salads, sprouts, \nmixed juices, a variety of frozen berries, dried spices, and other \ntreats unavailable a few decades ago.\n  Americans can buy produce that is the safest in the world, and food \nsafety problems from produce are rare. But these problems can be \ndevastating for victims, and consumers are demanding stronger laws to \nprotect themselves from food borne illness. Since 1990, more than 40 \noutbreaks of foodborne illness have been linked to fresh fruit, \nvegetable and juice products consumed in the United States. More than \n6300 illnesses were reported, with victims in almost all 50 states. \nDomestic melons, imported strawberries, lettuce, sprouts and orange \njuice each took their toll.\n  Processed or ready-to-eat produce may be more easily contaminated \nbecause it is handled extensively, cut up and rinsed, and then is eaten \nby the consumer without further preparation. It is essential that the \nprocessor handle these foods safely, because there is nothing the \nconsumer can do once these products are contaminated.\n  This bill will improve the safety of these products by requiring that \nthey are always processed under sanitary conditions. These are the same \nconditions you would use in your own kitchen, and should expect from a \nprocessor. The guidelines are simple; that rinse water be clean and \nsewage be kept\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\naway from the food, that workers can and do wash their hands, that \nflies, birds and rodents be kept out of the processing plant.\n  Under the bill provisions, FDA will inspect processors, domestic and \nimporting, annually, to be sure they are following sanitary guidelines. \nFDA will also coordinate with other food safety agencies to develop \nresearch programs aimed at setting standards for safe agricultural \npractices for produce, and for testing methods that can verify that \nfruit or vegetable products has been processed safely.\n  Last August, the National Academy of Sciences, in evaluating the \nfederal food safety system, advised that food safety agencies be able \nto ``mandate minimum sanitation standards for food.'' Food safety \nshould be a requirement--not a suggestion. We have had basic sanitation \nstandards in place for meat and poultry for 93 years. FDA needs strong \nmandatory sanitation guidelines for produce. My bill would establish \nbasic sanitation standards for processed fruits and vegetables. Most \nprocessors in the US are already following these reasonable standards, \nand are keeping their products safe. This bill will bring everyone up \nto par domestically, and allow FDA to address produce sanitation \nproblems in importing countries.\n  Agriculture is clearly our nation's largest employer, providing jobs \nfor millions from the farm to the corner markets. Agricultural \ncommunities cannot afford to have the American public question the \nsafety of the food in their grocery stores. This is not just a public \nhealth issue, it is also an economic issue.\n  I believe these simple standards of cleanliness are reasonable, are \nlong overdue, and will help assure that Americans can safely make these \nfoods a part of every meal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Cleland, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 284. A bill to improve educational systems and facilities to \nbetter educate students throughout the United States; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    comprehensive school improvement and accountability act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think every American knows what today \nis--Tax Day, 1999. It's a day that I think no doubt leaves most \nAmericans, certainly, tired from the all too hurried rush to file those \nforms--but I hope also reminded that as we pay our taxes we're really \nmaking choices about our priorities--investing in a strong national \ndefense, making a difference in research and development, protecting \nSocial Security and Medicare--and the truth is that while no one likes \nto pay taxes, this is why we do it--so we can invest in certain \npriorities that make our nation strong.\n  Well, Mr. President, today I want to join with my colleague Gordon \nSmith to talk about one of those investments, about the commitment \nAmericans want us to make to our public schools, and about the biggest \ntax cut we can ever deliver for our children and grandchildren--the tax \ncut you give to future generations when you insist--today--that you're \ngoing to have a committed and qualified teacher in every classroom, \nthat you're going to make every public school work, and that you're \ngoing to put every child on the road to a life in which they can make \nthe most of their own talents and capacities for success.\n  Let's be honest--as a society, there is no decision of greater \nimportance to the long term health, stability, and competitiveness of \nthis nation, than the way we decide to educate our children.\n  We look to public schools today to educate our children to lead in an \ninformation age where the term ``wired worker'' will soon be redundant \nbecause of an information revolution that has literally put more power \nin the computer chip of a digital watch than in every computer combined \nin the United States just fifty years ago; massive technological change \nand demands to improve our productivity, putting more Americans to work \nfor longer hours and putting them in front of computer screens for \nhours more when they're not at work; a global economy where borders \nhave vanished--and the wealth of nations will be determined by the \nwisdom of their workers--by their level of training, the depth of their \nknowledge, and their ability to compete with workers around the world.\n  Mr. President, two hundred years ago Thomas Jefferson told us that \nour public schools would be ``the pillars of the republic''--he was \nright then, he is right now--but today there is a caveat: those public \nschools must also be--more than ever--the pillars of our economy and \nthe pillars of our communities.\n  And I would respectfully suggest to you that there has not been a \nmore urgent time than the present to reevaluate--honestly--the way \nAmerica's greatest democratic experiment is working--the experiment of \nour nation's public schools.\n  Those pillars of the republic have never before had to support so \nheavy a burden as they do today. In our world of telecommuting, the \nInternet, hundreds and soon thousands of television channels, sixty, \nseventy and eighty hour work weeks--there are fewer and fewer places \nwhere Americans come together in person to share in that common civic \nculture, fewer ways in which we unite as citizens--and caught up in \nthat whirlwind are more students living in poverty, more students \ndealing with disabilities, more students with limited command of the \nEnglish language.\n  More reasons, I believe, why this nation must have a great public \nschool system.\n  And what can we say of the system before us today? I think we must \nsay that--although there are thousands of public schools in this \ncountry doing a magnificent job of educating our children to a world \nclass level--too many of our schools are struggling and too many kids \nare being left behind.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have a responsibility to be the true \nfriends of public education--and the best friends are critical friends, \nand it is time that we seek the truth and offer our help to a system \nthat is not doing enough for a large proportion of the 50 million \nchildren in our public schools today--children whose reading scores \nshow that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are \nbelow basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are \nproficient and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level; \nchildren who edge out only South Africa and Cyprus on international \ntests in science and math, with 29 percent of all college freshmen \nrequiring remedial classes in basic skills.\n  Mr. President, this year we have already passed the Ed-Flex Bill, a \nstep forward in giving our schools the flexibility and the \naccountability they need to enact reform, making it a matter of law \nthat we won't tie their hands with red tape when Governors and Mayors \nand local school districts are doing all they can to educate our kids, \nbut also emphasizing that with added flexibility comes a responsibility \nto raise student achievement.\n  But Mr. President, EdFlex was just one step in a forward moving \ndirection--balancing accountability and flexibility--to continue the \nprocess of real education reform--and that is why I am joining with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Gordon Smith, to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation today--the Kerry-Smith Bill--with our colleagues the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, my colleague Ted Kennedy and \nwith Max Cleland, Evan Bayh, John Edwards, Carl Levin, Patty Murray, \nRichard Bryan, as well as John Chafee, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe \nfrom Maine--legislation which together we believe will make a \ndifference in our schools, legislation which can bring together leaders \nfrom across the political spectrum around good ideas which unite us \nrather than dividing us.\n  Mr. President, for too long in this country the education debate has \nbeen stuck both nationally and locally--leaders unable or unwilling to \nanswer the challenge, trapped in a debate that is little more than an \necho of old and irrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied \nby ideology and interest groups--both on the right and on the left.\n  Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we \npride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, \nhave we--\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nin so many debates--been stuck in a place where Democrats and \nRepublicans seem to talk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be \nalways ready to throw money at the problem but never for sufficient \naccountability or creativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready \nto give a voucher to go somewhere else but rarely supportive of \ninvesting sufficient resources to make the public schools work.\n  Well, I think it is in this Congress, this year, that we can finally \ndisengage ourselves from the political combat, and acknowledge that \nwith so much on the line, such high stakes in our schools, you can't \njust talk past each other and call it reform.\n  We all need to do our part to find a new answer, and Mr. President I \nwould respectfully suggest that in the bipartisan support you see for \nthis legislation, there is a different road we can meet on to make it \nhappen.\n  Together we are introducing the kind of comprehensive education \nreform legislation that I believe will provide us a chance to come \ntogether not as Democrats and Republicans, but as the true friends of \nparents, children, teachers, and principals--to come together as \ncitizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of public education \nin this country. We need to ask one question: ``What provides our \nchildren with the best education?'' And whether the answer is \nconservative, liberal or simply practical, we need to commit ourselves \nto that course.\n  Our bill is built on the notion of giving grants for schools--with \nreal accountability--to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the \nproven best practices of any other school--Voluntary State Reform \nIncentive Grants so school districts that choose to finance and \nimplement comprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models \ncan bring forth change. We will target investments at school districts \nwith high numbers of at-risk students and leverage local dollars \nthrough matching grants. This component of the legislation will give \nschools the chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what \nworks in any other school--private, parochial or public--with \ndecentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, and \nhigh levels of volunteerism--while at the same time meeting high \nstandards of student achievement and public accountability. I believe \npublic schools need to have the chance to make changes not tomorrow, \nnot five years from now, not after another study--but now--today.\n  So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school adopting \nthe best practices of high achieving schools, building accountability \ninto the system--what then are the key ingredients of excellence that \nevery school needs to succeed?\n  Well, Mr. President, I think we can start by guaranteeing that every \none of our nation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the \ntalents and the know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; \nthe vision to create an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer \nteachers and engage parents. Without those abilities, the title of \nprincipal and the freedom to lead means little. We are proposing an \n``Excellent Principals Challenge Grant'' which would provide funds to \nlocal school districts to train principals in sound management skills \nand effective classroom practices. This bill helps our schools make \nbeing a principal the great calling of our time.\n\n  But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective \nprincipals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: \nprincipals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom \nthey must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And \nwe must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United \nStates hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them \nin the next five years. In the Kerry-Smith Bill we will empower our \nstates and school districts to find new ways to hire and train \noutstanding teachers: through a focus on teacher quality and training--\nin Title V of this bill--we can use financial incentives to attract a \nlarger group of qualified people into the teaching profession and we \ncan provide real ongoing education and continued training for our \nnation's teachers.\n  This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification \npolicies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our \nstandards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they \nare too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make \nteaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We \nknow we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country \nto recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. \nToday we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal \narts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. \nOur legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so principals \nhave a far greater flexibility to hire liberal arts graduates as \nteachers, graduates who can meet high standards; while at the same time \nallowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to achieve a more broad \nbased meaningful certification--the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards certification with its rigorous test of subject \nmatter knowledge and teaching ability.\n  This legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our \npublic schools--providing college scholarships for our highest \nachieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in \nour public schools.\n  We will demand a great deal from our principals and our teachers--\nholding them accountable for student achievement--but Mr. President we \nalso hope to build a new consensus in America that recognizes that you \ncan't hold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed.\n  Our bill helps to close the resource gap in public education: helping \nto eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into \narenas of violence by giving school districts incentives to write \ndiscipline codes and create ``Second Chance'' schools with a range of \nalternatives for chronically disruptive and violent students--\neverything from short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration \nin-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-campus alternatives; \nhelping every child come to school ready to learn by funding \nsuccessful, local early childhood development efforts; and making \nschools the hubs of our communities once more by providing support for \nafter school programs where students receive tutoring, mentoring, and \nvalues-based education--the kind of programs that are open to entire \ncommunities, making public schools truly public.\n  And our legislation will help us bring a new kind accountability to \npublic education by injecting choice and competition into a public \nschool system badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes \nin monopolies. We are a country that believes competition raises \nquality. And we ought to merge the best of those ideas by ending a \nsystem that restricts each child to an administrator's choice and not a \nparent's choice where possible. It is time we adopt a competitive \nsystem of public school choice with grants awarded to schools that meet \nparents' test of quality and assistance to schools that must catch up \nrapidly. That is why our bill creates an incentive for schools all \nacross the nation to adopt public school choice to the extent \nlogistically feasible.\n  Mr. President, we are not just asking Democrats and Republicans to \nmeet in a compromise, a grand bargain to reform public education. We \nare offering legislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a \ndebate, but a vote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. \nTogether we can embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides \nof the ideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of \npublic education is not found in one concept alone--in private school \nvouchers or bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our \nchildren by breaking with the instinct for the symbolic, and especially \nthe notion that a speech here and there will make education better in \nthis country. It can't and it won't. But our hard work together in the \ncoming year--Democrats and Republicans together--can make a difference. \nEducation reform can work in a bi-partisan way. There is no shortage of \ngood ideas or leadership here in the Senate--the experience of Gordon \nSmith who spent years in the Oregon legislature working to balance \nresources and accountability to raise the quality of public education; \nwith\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\ntireless leadership from former Governors like Evan Bayh and John \nChafee; bi-partisan creativity from Patty Murray and Olympia Snowe; and \nthe leadership and passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my \nstate, Senator Kennedy, who has led the fight on education in this \nSenate, and who has provided this body with over 30 years of unrivaled \nleadership and support for education.\n  We look forward to working with all of our colleagues this year to \npass this legislation, in this important year as we undergo the process \nof reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to find \ncommon ground in ideas that we can all support--bold legislation that \nsends the message--finally--to parents and children struggling to find \nschools that work, and to teachers and principals struggling in schools \nsimultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and starved for resources--to \nprove to them not just that we hear their cries for help, but that we \nwill respond not with sound bites and salvos, but with real answers.\n  I thank my colleagues and I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 824\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in an effort of \nbipartisanship with Senator Kerry, to present our plan to improve the \nquality of education for the children of this country. The legislation \nthat we are introducing with Senators Chafee, Collins, Snowe, Bayh, \nCleland, Kennedy, Levin, Edwards, Bryan, and Murray, combines the best \nideas from the Republicans with the best ideas from the Democrats--it \nis a way of reaching across the aisle to accomplish education reform.\n  Our shared goal is legislation that empowers educators, parents, and \nprincipals to initiate positive change in the local school districts \nwithout burdensome Federal mandates. The Kerry-Smith Plan to Educate \nAmerica's Children acts upon that goal and incorporates what the \nPresident proposed in his State of the Union Address--that our Federal \ndollars must be invested in programs that work. I couldn't agree more. \nWe need to ensure that we're getting the biggest bang out of our \neducation buck--not only for the Federal Government--but for the \ntaxpayers who deserve it, and who expect it. The taxpayers are not only \nthe watchdogs of how we spend our money, they are the stockholders and \nhave the right to determine the direction and quality of our \ninvestment. This legislation turns the taxpayers into stockholders by \ndirecting the Federal dollars to State and local education agencies and \nallows them to manage the money locally--in local school districts and \nfor local students--to enhance and improve the quality of public \neducation in our nation.\n  Our proposal provides local education agencies, parents, principals, \nand teachers the resources to build upon reform models that have been \nproven to work, such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse and Success For All \nprograms. For example, the Success For All program focuses on raising \nthe achievement levels of K-12 students in low-performing schools by \nproviding a wide range of assistance, including one-on-one tutoring and \nfamily support programs. To ensure that progress is being made, \nstudents in the Success For All program are assessed every eight weeks. \nIf a student needs assistance in a specific area such as reading, a \ntutor is provided to help that student improve his or her reading \nskills.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what every school in America should be \ndoing. In addition, the Modern Red Schoolhouse program goes back to the \nbasics and focuses on the core subject areas of math, science, and \nreading. Students learn to master these subject areas at their own pace \nin order to fulfill individual learning contracts. Importantly, this \nprogram combines parental and community involvement with flexible daily \nand yearly schedules for students in order to meet their individual \ngoals.\n  It is clear that any education reform proposal must be comprehensive \nin order to be successful. That is why the Kerry-Smith bill focuses on \nthe needs of children and parents before the school day begins, and \nafter the school day ends.\n  First, our legislation strives to ensure that every child begins \nschool ready to learn by providing the resources to expand existing \nprograms such as EvenStart or HeadStart.\n  Second, our legislation provides the resources for the development \nand training of excellent principals--and the retraining of current \nprincipals to improve the way they manage our schools. This program can \nbe an opportunity to encourage and recruit second-career principals \nfrom the business community.\n  Third, we provide the needed support for communities to develop \nalternative schools for students who need further academic or \npsychological counseling. One of the concerns I hear in my state is \nthat there aren't enough counselors in each school district. In fact, \none particular school district in my state, has one counselor for every \n800 students. It is my hope we can greatly increase the number of \ncounselors. Too many children need extra support, and it benefits us \nall to help ensure they get that support.\n  In this world-wide web generation where everything is changing and \ngrowing at such a rapid rate, we're not always able to keep up with the \npace and progress of our children. Thomas Jefferson once said something \nto the effect that each generation is its own nation--and I think that \nis true to some extent--and it is our responsibility to prepare the \nnext generation as they face the challenges of the next century.\n  So as we begin debating education reform, I will support those \npolicies that fulfill our commitment. We can achieve our commitment by \nproviding comprehensive programs to meet the needs of all of our \nchildren throughout the entire school day and after school.\n  We can achieve our commitment by investing in education programs that \nhave proven to work--based on research and real results. And we can \nachieve our commitment by directing the resources for mentoring and \ntraining of our teachers and principals and rewarding local districts \nthat display excellence in education.\n  The Kerry-Smith bill is an aggressive approach and puts these \nprinciples to work--not in Washington, D.C., but in our states and \nlocal school districts. We realize that there are many education reform \nproposals that will be introduced in the Senate this year. And despite \nthe differing views of our respective parties on education in previous \nyears, Senator Kerry and I intended to work with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to find a workable solution based on the combined \nstrength of various bills.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Kerry, for \nhis foresight and leadership on this issue and encourage my colleagues' \ncosponsorship and support. The education of our children is, and must \ncontinue to be, a bipartisan commitment to excellence.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Education Improvement Act \nof 1999, introduced today by Senator Smith and Senator Kerry, and I am \nproud to be a sponsor. It is a major initiative to improve the nation's \npublic schools and address the serious problems they face, such as the \nshortage of teachers and the lack of after-school programs. These are \nreal problems that deserve real solutions.\n  Education must continue to be a top priority for this Congress. Few \nother issues are as important to the nation as ensuring that every \nchild has the opportunity for a good education.\n  Last year, with broad bipartisan support, Congress made substantial \ninvestments in the nation's public schools to reduce class size, expand \nafter-school programs and improve the initial training of teachers. But \nmore needs to be done. States and local communities are making \nsignificant progress toward improving their public schools, but they \ncan't do it alone. The federal government must lend a helping hand.\n  We must do more to meet the needs of public schools, families, and \nchildren. We need to expand early childhood education programs, and \nmeet our commitment to reducing class size, modernizing school \nbuildings, improving the quality of the nation's teachers, and provide \nmore opportunities for after-school programs.\n  The bill addresses these important issues in innovative and very \npromising ways. The proposed ``Excellent Principals Challenge Grants'' \nwill give school principal the support they need to be effective school \nleaders. Principals are the bridge between the school and the school \nboards, and the children and families in the community. More needs to \nbe done to make sure that principals receive the training they need to \nbecome effective school administrators. Every child should have the \nopportunity to attend a school with a well-trained teacher and a well-\ntrained principal.\n  When it comes to education, the nation's children deserve the best \nhelp we\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\ncan give them. I commend Senator Kerry and Senator Smith for making \nthis strong commitment to improving the nation's public schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 825. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall business employers a credit against income tax for employee \nhealth insurance expenses paid or incurred by the employer; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n small business tax credit for health insurance for low-income workers\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on tax day to introduce a new \nlegislative proposal to help small businesses afford quality health \ninsurance for their low-income workers. The number of uninsured is at \nan all-time high. More than 43 million people, including 11 million \nchildren, lack health insurance coverage. Workers in small firms are \nsignificantly more likely to be uninsured than workers in larger firms. \nNationally, 34 percent of workers in small businesses with less than 10 \nemployees are uninsured. This compares to the national average for all \nworkers which is 18.2 percent. In Illinois, 183,781 workers in a small \nbusiness in 1997 went without health insurance. For low-income workers \nthe situation was even worse. Nationally, 41.3 percent of workers \nearning less than $16,000 were uninsured. Again in Illinois, 112,770 \nworking for less than $16,000 in small businesses were uninsured.\n  This situation is deteriorating. Recent studies show that the number \nof small businesses offering health insurance has been declining. In \n1996, 52 percent of small businesses offered their employees health \ninsurance benefits. This level had fallen to 47 percent by 1998. For \nthe smallest firms, those with 3-9 workers, the percentage of employees \ncovered by employer-sponsored health insurance fell from 36 percent in \n1996 to 31 percent in 1998.\n  Only 39 percent of small businesses with a significant percentage of \nlow-income employees offer employer-sponsored health insurance--such \ncompanies are half as likely to offer health benefits as are companies \nthat have only a small proportion of low-income employees.\n  One of the main reasons for this decline in employer-sponsored health \ninsurance is cost. Small businesses pay on average 30 percent more for \nhealth insurance than larger firms and costs are increasing more \nrapidly for small businesses causing them to drop health insurance \nbenefits.\n  Health insurance coverage is also related to income. High income \nworkers have the highest rates of insurance. The very poor are \ngenerally covered by public sources of health care. It is most often \nthe working poor who have the lowest incidence of insurance. Thirty-\nseven percent of those with family incomes between 100 percent and 125 \npercent of poverty are uninsured. In contrast, 92.2 percent of \nindividuals in families with incomes over $50,000 have insurance.\n  Bearing all this in mind, I am introducing a bill that recognizes \nthat the most concentrated pool of Americans without health insurance \nare low-income workers in small businesses (0-9 employees). The bill \nprovides tax credits to small businesses when they provide health \ninsurance to those low-income workers. The bill provides a tax credit \nof up to $600 for an individual policy for a worker making up to \n$16,000/yr. and a tax credit of up to $1,200 for a family policy for a \nworker making up to $16,000/yr. The tax credit is valued at 60 percent \nof what the employer contributes for the individual's health insurance, \nor 70 percent of what the employer contributes for a family policy, to \nthe maximum of $600 and $1,200 for self-only and family policies \nrespectively.\n  The proposal does not undermine the employer-based health insurance \nmarket, and does not undermine the protections and advantages that are \navailable to group purchasers. Instead it is designed to help small \nbusinesses to provide quality health insurance benefits for their \nemployees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Helms, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Abraham, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n        Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S.J. Res. 19. A joint resolution requesting the President to advance \nthe late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel on the retired list of the Navy \nto the highest grade held as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, \nduring World War II, and to advance the late Major General Walter C. \nShort on the retired list of the Army to the highest grade held as \nCommanding General, Hawaiian Department, during World War II, as was \ndone under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for all other senior \nofficers who served in positions of command during World War II, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  advancement of rear adm. kimmel and maj. gen. short on retired lists\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and on behalf of Senator Thurmond, Senator \nHelms, Senator Domenici, Senator Specter, Senator Stevens, and 15 other \nof our colleagues, to reintroduce a resolution whose intent to redress \na grave injustice, one that haunts us from the tribulations of World \nWar II.\n  The matter of which I speak concerns the reputations of two of the \nmost accomplished officers who served in Pacific theater during that \nwar: Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short.\n  They were the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces deployed \nin the Pacific at the time of the disastrous surprise December 7, 1941 \nattack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate aftermath of the attack they \nwere unfairly and publicly charged with dereliction of duty and blamed \nas singularly responsible for the success of that attack. In short, as \nwe all know today, they were scapegoated.\n  What is most unforgivable is that after the end of World War II, this \nscapegoating was given a near permanent veneer when the President of \nthe United States declined to advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short \non the retired list to their highest ranks of wartime command--an honor \nthat was given to every other senior commander who served in wartime \npositions above his regular grade.\n  That decision to exclude only these two officers was made despite the \nfact that wartime investigations had already exonerated those \ncommanders of the dereliction of duty charge and criticized the War and \nNavy Departments for failings that contributed to the success of the \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat this fact: Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort were the only two flag and general rank officers from World War \nII excluded from advancement on the military's retired list. That fact \nalone perpetuates the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nderelict in their duty and singularly responsible for the success of \nthe attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  The scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was one of the \ngreat injustices that occurred within our own ranks during World War \nII. The motivation behind our resolution today is to recognize and \ncorrect this injustice.\n  Our resolution calls upon the President of the United States \nposthumously to advance on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short to the grades of this highest wartime commands. In \nadopting this resolution, the Senate would communicate its recognition \nof the injustice done to them and call upon the President to take \ncorrective action. Such a statement by the Senate would do much to \nremove the stigma of blame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of \nthese two officers. It is a correction consistent with our military's \ntradition of honor, and it is one long overdue.\n  Mr. President, the facts that constitute the case of Admiral Kimmel \nand General Short have been remarkably documented. Since the 1941 \nattack on Pearl Harbor, there have been no less than nine official \ngovernmental investigations and reports, and one inquiry conducted by a \nspecial Joint Congressional Committee.\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\n  Perhaps the most flawed, and unfortunately most influential \ninvestigation, was that of the Roberts Commission. Less than 6 weeks \nafter the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily prepared report to the \nPresident, the commission accused Kimmel and Short of dereliction of \nduty--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized.\n  Adm. William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this \nCommission, later disavowed its report, stating that Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short were ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to \ntrial, they would have been cleared of the charge.''\n  Later, Adm. J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor as \nCommander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote:\n\n       In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in \n     the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn \n     up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of \n     the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and \n     deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government \n     Printing Office.\n\n  Subsequent investigations provided clear evidence that Admiral Kimmel \nand General Short were unfairly singled out for blame. These reports \ninclude those presented by a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army \nPearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional \nCommittee, and more recently a 1991 Army Board for the Correction of \nMilitary Records and report prepared by the Department of Defense in \n1995. The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four \nprincipal points.\n  First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not \nprovided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in \nWashington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their senior commanders \nhad critical information about Japanese intentions, plans, and actions, \nbut neighter passed this on nor took issue nor attempted to correct the \ndisposition of forces under Kimmel's and Short's commands in response \nto the information they attained.\n  Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and \nconsistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short.\n  In my review of this case, I was most struck by the honor and \nintegrity demonstrated by Gen. George Marshall who was Army Chief of \nStaff at the time of the attack. On November 27, 1941, General Short \ninterpreted a vaguely written war warning message sent from the high \ncommand in Washington as suggesting the need to defend against \nsabotage. Consequently, he concentrated his aircraft away from \nperimeter roads to protect them, thus inadvertently increasing their \nvulnerability to air attack. When he reported his preparations to the \nGeneral Staff in Washington, the General Staff took no steps to clarify \nthe reality of the situation.\n  In 1946 before a Joint Congressional Committee investigating the \nPearl Harbor disaster General Marshall testified that he was \nresponsible for ensuring the proper disposition of General Short's \nforces. He acknowledged that he must have received General Short's \nreport, which would have been his opportunity to issue a corrective \nmessage, and that he failed to do so.\n  Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of \nresponsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able \nto have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort.\n  A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the \nDepartment of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the \nflow of intelligence. The Dorn Report completed in 1995 for the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense at the request of Senator Thurmond, stated that \nthe handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up \nto the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, \nineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \nclarification and followup.\n  The bottom line is that poor command decisions and inefficient \nmanagement structures and procedures blocked the flow of essential \nintelligence from Washington to the Hawaiian commanders.\n  The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned \nreports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed \nonly upon the Hawaiian commanders. Some of these reports completely \nabsolved these two officers. While others found them to have made \nerrors in judgment, all the reports subsequent to the Roberts \nCommission cleared Admiral Kimmel and General Short of the charge of \ndereliction of duty and underscored the rollout of a broad failure by \nthe entire chain of command.\n  And, Mr. President, all those reports identified significant failures \nand shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that \ncontributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  The Dorn Report put it best, stating that ``responsibility for the \nPearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.''\n  Mr. President, let me add one poignant fact about two of these \ninvestigations. The conclusions of the 1944 Naval Court of Inquiry and \nthe Army Pearl Harbor Board--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been \nproperly disposed according to the information available to them and \nthat their superiors had failed to share important intelligence--were \nkept secret on the grounds that citing the existence of this \nintelligence would have been detrimental to the war effort.\n  Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the \ncruel myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the \ndisaster at Pearl Harbor. To do so is not only unfair, it tarnishes our \nNation's military honor. For reasons unexplainable to me, this \nscapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short has survived the \ncleansing tides of history.\n  This issue of fairness and justice has been raised not only by \nGeneral Short and Admiral Kimmel and their surviving families today, \nbut also by numerous senior officers and public organizations around \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, allow me to submit for the Record a letter endorsing \nour resolution from five living former naval officers who served at the \nvery pinnacle of military responsibility. They are former Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Thomas H. Moorer and Adm. William J. \nCrowe; and former Chiefs of Naval Operations Adm. J.L. Holloway III, \nAdm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, and Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost.\n  I also submit a similar letter from Senator Robert Dole, one of our \nmost distinguished colleagues, who as we all know served heroically in \nWorld War II.\n  The efforts of these and other officers have been complemented by the \ninitiatives of many public organizations who have called for posthumous \nadvancement of Kimmel and Short.\n  I submit for the Record a copy of the VFW's Resolution Number 441 \npassed last August calling for the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short.\n  Mr. President, Admiral Kimmel and General Short remain unjustly \nstigmatized by our Nation's failure to treat them in the same manner \nwith which we treated their peers. To redress this wrong would be fully \nconsistent with this Nation's sense of justice. As I said earlier, \nafter 58 years, this correction is long overdue.\n  The message of our joint resolution is about justice, equity, and \nhonor. Its purpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that \nthese two officers are treated fairly and with the dignity and honor \nthey deserve, and to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate \nthe memory and lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor. In \nthe largest sense, passage of this resolution will restore the honor of \nthe United States in this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe joint resolution and the documents to which I have referred.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Whereas Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, formerly the \n     Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet and the \n     Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, had an \n     excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941 attack \n     on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas Major General Walter C. Short, formerly the \n     Commander of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had \n     an excellent and unassailable record throughout\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\n     his career in the United States Army prior to the December 7, \n     1941 attack on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas numerous investigations following the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short were not provided necessary and \n     critical intelligence that was available, that foretold of \n     war with Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that \n     would have alerted them to prepare for the attack, including \n     such essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb \n     Plot message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from \n     the Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese \n     Ambassador in the United States from December 6-7, 1941, \n     known as the Fourteen-Part Message;\n       Whereas on December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general;\n       Whereas Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge'';\n       Whereas on October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his military \n     decisions and the disposition of his forces at the time of \n     the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor were proper ``by \n     virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had at hand \n     which indicated neither the probability nor the imminence of \n     an air attack on Pearl Harbor''; criticized the higher \n     command for not sharing with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very \n     critical period of 26 November to 7 December 1941, important \n     information . . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and, \n     concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service;\n       Whereas on June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by \n     Admiral T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the \n     Navy produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that \n     essential intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war \n     plans was available in Washington but was not shared with \n     Admiral Kimmel;\n       Whereas on October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that Lieutenant General Short had \n     not been kept ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation for war''; detailed information and \n     intelligence about Japanese intentions and war plans were \n     available in ``abundance'' but were not shared with the \n     General Short's Hawaii command; and General Short was not \n     provided ``on the evening of December 6th and the early \n     morning of December 7th, the critical information indicating \n     an almost immediate break with Japan, though there was ample \n     time to have accomplished this'';\n       Whereas the reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and \n     the Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept \n     secret, and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were \n     denied their requests to defend themselves through trial by \n     court-martial;\n       Whereas the joint committee of Congress that was \n     established to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-\n     page report which included the conclusions of the committee \n     that the two officers had not been guilty of dereliction of \n     duty;\n       Whereas the then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral J. L. \n     Holloway, Jr., on April 27, 1954, recommended that Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947;\n       Whereas on November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of \n     the Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that Lieutenant General Short \n     ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl Harbor \n     disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' to \n     advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the retired \n     list'';\n       Whereas in October 1994, the then Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 \n     recommendation against the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \n     recommended that the case of Admiral Kimmel be reopened;\n       Whereas the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear \n     Admiral Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set \n     forth as a conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for \n     the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the \n     shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it \n     should be broadly shared'';\n       Whereas the Dorn Report found that ``Army and Navy \n     officials in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese \n     diplomatic communications . . . which provided crucial \n     confirmation of the imminence of war''; that ``the evidence \n     of the handling of these messages in Washington reveals some \n     ineptitude, some unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, \n     limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \n     clarification and follow-up at higher levels''; and, that \n     ``together, these characteristics resulted in failure . . . \n     to appreciate fully and to convey to the commanders in Hawaii \n     the sense of focus and urgency that these intercepts should \n     have engendered'';\n       Whereas, on July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from Admiral \n     Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short;\n       Whereas the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing \n     a promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a \n     legal basis for the President to honor any officer of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list;\n       Whereas Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the \n     only two eligible officers from World War II who were \n     excluded from the list of retired officers presented for \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947;\n       Whereas this singular exclusion from advancement on the \n     retired list serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a \n     distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two \n     of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Major General Walter Short died on September 23, \n     1949, and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, \n     without the honor of having been returned to their wartime \n     ranks as were their fellow veterans of World War II; and\n       Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, \n     and other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through \n     their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their \n     highest wartime grades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADVANCEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL KIMMEL AND MAJOR \n                   GENERAL SHORT ON RETIRED LISTS.\n\n       (a) Request.--The President is requested--\n       (1) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E.

Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chairman, \n       Joint Chiefs of Staff, Former Chief of Naval Operations.\n     J.L. Holloway III, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chief of \n       Naval Operations.\n     William J. Crowe, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chairman, \n       Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Elmo R. Zumwalt, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chief of \n       Naval Operations.\n     Carlisle A.H. Trost, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chief \n       of Naval Operations.\n     Re the honor and reputations of Admiral Husband Kimmel and \n         General Walter Short.\n\n       Dear Senator: We ask that the honor and reputations of two \n     fine officers who dedicated themselves to the service of \n     their country be restored. Admiral Husband Kimmel and General \n     Walter Short were singularly scapegoated as responsible for \n     the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December \n     7, 1941. The time is long overdue to reverse this inequity \n     and treat Admiral Kimmel and General Short fairly and justly. \n     The appropriate vehicle for that is the current Roth-Biden \n     Resolution.\n       The Resoltuion calls for the posthumous advancement on the \n     retirement list of Admiral Kimmel and General Short to their \n     highest WWII wartime ranks of four-star admiral and three-\n     star general as provided by the Officer Personnel Act of \n     1947. They are the only two eligible officers who have been \n     singled out for exclusion from that privilege; all other \n     eligible officers have been so privileged.\n       We urge you to support this Resolution.\n       We are career military officers who have served over a \n     period of several decades and through several wartime eras in \n     the capacities of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and/or \n     Chief of Naval Operations. Each of us is familiar with the \n     circumstances leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       We are unanimous in our conviction that Admiral Husband \n     Kimmel and General Walter Short were not responsible for the \n     success of that attack, and that the fault lay with the \n     command structure at the seat of government in Washington. \n     The Roth-Biden Resolution details specifics of this case and \n     requests the President of the United States to nominate \n     Kimmel and Short for the appropriate advancement in rank.\n       As many of you know, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \n     the Hawaiian Commanders in charge of naval and ground forces \n     on Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack. After a hurried \n     investigation in January, 1942 they were charged with having \n     been ``derelict in their duty'' and given no opportunity to \n     refute that charge which was publicized throughout the \n     country.\n       As a result, many today believe the ``dereliction'' charge \n     to be true despite the fact that a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel of blame; a Joint Congressional \n     Committee specifically found that neither had been derelict \n     in his duty; a four-to-one majority of the members of a Board \n     for the Correction of Military Records in the Department of \n     the Army found that General Short had been ``unjustly held \n     responsible'' and recommended his advancement to the rank of \n     lieutenant general on the retired list.\n       This injustice has been perpetuated for more than half a \n     century by their sole exclusion from the privilege of the Act \n     mentioned above.\n       As professional military officers we support in the \n     strongest terms the concept of holding commanders accountable \n     for the performance of their forces. We are equally strong in \n     our belief in the fundamental American principle of justice \n     for all Americans, regardless of creed, color, status or \n     rank. In other words, we believe strongly in fairness.\n       These two principles must be applied to the specific facts \n     of a given situation. History as well as innumerable \n     investigations have proven beyond any question that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster. And we submit that where there is no \n     responsibility there can be no accountability.\n       But as a military principle--both practical and moral--the \n     dynamic of accountability works in both directions along the \n     vertical line known as the chain of command. In view of the \n     facts presented in the Roth-Biden Resolution and below--with \n     special reference to the fact that essential and critical \n     intelligence information was withheld from the Hawaiian \n     Commanders despite the commitment of the command structure to \n     provide that information to them--we submit that while the \n     Hawaiian Commanders were responsible and accountable as \n     anyone could have been given the circumstances, their \n     superiors in Washington were sadly and tragically lacking in \n     both of these leadership commitments.\n       A review of the historical facts available on the subject \n     of the attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrates that these \n     officers were not treated fairly.\n       1. They accomplished all that anyone could have with the \n     support provided by their superiors in terms of operating \n     forces (ships and aircraft) and information (instructions and \n     intelligence). Their disposition of forces, in view of the \n     information made available to them by the command structure \n     in Washington, was reasonable and appropriate.\n       2. Admiral Kimmel was told of the capabilities of U.S. \n     intelligence (MAGIC, the code-breaking capability of PURPLE \n     and other Japanese codes) and he was promised he could rely \n     on adequate warning of any attack based on this special \n     intelligence capability. Both Commanders rightfully operated \n     under the impression, and with the assurance, that they were \n     receiving the necessary intelligence information to fulfill \n     their responsibilities.\n       3. Historical information now available in the public \n     domain through declassified files, and post-war statements of \n     many officers involved, clearly demonstrate that vital \n     information was routinely withheld from both commanders. For \n     example, the ``Bomb Plot'' message and subsequent reporting \n     orders from Tokyo to Japanese agents in Hawaii as to \n     location, types and number of warships, and their replies to \n     Tokyo.\n       4. The code-breaking intelligence of PURPLE did provide \n     warning of an attack on Pearl Harbor, but the Hawaiian \n     Commanders were not informed. Whether deliberate or for some \n     other reason should make no difference, have no bearing. \n     These officers did not get the support and warnings they were \n     promised.\n       5. The fault was not theirs. It lay in Washington.\n       We urge you, as Members of the United States Senate, to \n     take a leadership role in assuring justice for two military \n     careerists who were willing to fight and die for their \n     country, but not to be humiliated by its government. We \n     believe that the American people--with their national \n     characteristic of fair play--would want the record set \n     straight. Thank you.\n           Respectfully,\n     Admiral Thomas H. Moorer (USN, Ret.).\n     Admiral William J. Crowe (USN, Ret.).\n     Admiral J.L. Holloway III (USN, Ret.).\n     Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt (USN, Ret.).\n     Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost (USN, Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1999.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: I will join my voice with yours in support of \n     the Kimmel-Short Resolution of 1999.\n       The responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should be \n     shared by many. In light of the more recent disclosures of \n     withheld information Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short should have had, I agree these two commanders have been \n     unjustly stigmatized.\n       Please keep me informed of the progress of this resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Resolution No. 441\n\n\n   restore pre-attack ranks to admiral husband e. kimmel and general \n                            walter c. short\n\n       Whereas, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General C. Short \n     were the Commanders of Record for the Navy and Army Forces at \n     Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese \n     Imperial Navy launched its attack; and\n       Whereas, following the attack, President D. Roosevelt \n     appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts to a \n     commission to investigate such incident to determine if there \n     had been any dereliction to duty; and\n       Whereas, the Roberts Commission conducted a rushed \n     investigation in only five weeks. It charged Admiral Kimmel \n     and General Short with dereliction of their duty. The \n     findings were made public to the world; and\n       Whereas, the dereliction of duty charge destroyed the honor \n     and reputations of both Admiral Kimmel and General Short, and \n     due to the urgency neither man was given the opportunity to \n     defend himself against the accusation of dereliction of duty; \n     and\n       Whereas, other investigations showed that there was no \n     basis for the dereliction of duty charges, and a \n     Congressional investigation in 1946 made specific findings \n     that neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short had been \n     ``derelict in his duty'' at the time of the bombing of Pearl \n     Harbor; and\n       Whereas, it has been documented that the United States \n     military had broken the Japanese codes in 1941. With the use \n     of a cryptic machine known as ``Magic,'' the military was \n     able to decipher the Japanese diplomatic code known as \n     ``Purple'' and the military code known as JN-25.

Kimmel and General \n     Walter C. Short. The Naval and Army Commanders at Hawaii at \n     the time of the Japanese attack December 7, 1941 and urging \n     the President to take such steps as are necessary to advance \n     these two officers posthumously on the list of retired Navy \n     and Army officers to their pre-attack ranks of Four-Star \n     Admiral and Three-Star General.\n       Whereas, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. \n     Short were the Commanders of record for the Navy and Army \n     forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941 when the \n     Japanese Imperial Navy launched its attack; and\n       Whereas, Following the attack, President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts to \n     a Commission to investigate such incident to determine if \n     there has been any dereliction of duty; and\n       Whereas, The Roberts Commission conducted a rush \n     investigation in only five weeks. It charged Admiral Kimmel \n     and General Short with dereliction of their duty. These \n     findings were made public to the world; and\n       Whereas, The dereliction of duty charge destroyed the honor \n     and reputations of both Admiral Kimmel and General Short, and \n     due to the urgency of the war neither man was given the \n     opportunity to defend himself against the accusation of \n     dereliction of duty; and\n       Whereas, Other investigations showed that there was no \n     basis for the dereliction of duty charges, and a \n     Congressional Investigation in 1946 made specific findings \n     that neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short had been \n     ``derelict in his duty'' a the time of the bombing of Pearl \n     Harbor; and\n       Whereas, It has been documented that the United States \n     Military had broken the Japanese codes in 1941. With the use \n     of a cryptic machine known as ``Magic,'' the Military was \n     able to decipher the Japanese diplomatic code known as \n     ``Purple'' and the military code known as JN-25. The final \n     part of the diplomatic message that told of the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor was received on December 6, 1941. With this \n     vital information in hand, no warning was dispatched to \n     Admiral Kimmel or General Short to provide sufficient time to \n     defend Pearl Harbor in the proper manner; and\n       Whereas, It was not until after the tenth investigation of \n     the attack on pearl Harbor was completed in December of 1995, \n     that the United States Government acknowledged in the report \n     of Under Secretary of Defense Edwin S.

Kimmel and General Walter \n     C. Short by making a public apology to them and their \n     families for the wrongful actions of past administrations for \n     allowing these unfounded charges of dereliction of duty to \n     stand.\n       Be It Resolved, That the Veterans of Foreign Wars urges the \n     President of the United States to take the necessary steps to \n     posthumously advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short to \n     their highest wartime ranks of Four-Star Admiral and Three-\n     Star General. Such action would correct the injustice \n     suffered by them and their families for the past fifty-six \n     years.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I and my colleagues--Senators Roth, \nKennedy, Durbin, Kerry, Hollings, Landrieu, Helms, Stevens, Specter, \nThurmond, Domenici, Kyl, Murkowski, Cochran, Craig, Enzi, Abraham, \nSmith, Collins, Voinovich, and DeWine--are introducing a resolution \nthat seeks long overdue justice for the two commanders at Pearl Harbor \nfifty-eight years ago, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short.\n  Some will ask, ``why now?'' After all, fifty-eight years have passed. \nI believe it is more important than ever to take this action now. It is \nnot just the simple truth--that there can be no statute of limitations \nfor restoring honor and dignity to men who spent their lives dedicated \nto serving America and yet, were unfairly treated. It is also because \nwe have brave men and women in the military today who are fighting one \nof the most professional and precise battles ever seen against a \nbrutal, genocidal dictator in Kosovo. They know that their cause is \njust. What too many people do not know is the sacrifice and dedication \nit takes to be able to do their jobs.\n  The tremendous ability of our pilots, our maintainers, and our \nsupport crews is a direct result of their commitment to professional \nexcellence and service and their willingness to defend the values \nAmericans cherish. We owe it to them to defend those same values here \nat home. When it comes to serving truth and justice, the time must \nalways be ``now.'' When it comes to treating people with fairness and \nhonoring their service, the time must always be ``now.''\n  This is the second year we are bringing a resolution before our \ncolleagues. We cannot give up because it is important that the Senate \nunderstand and act to end the injustice done to these fine officers. \nUltimately, it is the President who must take action, but it is \nimportant that we send the message that the historical truth matters. \nAt Pearl Harbor, these two officers should not bear all of the blame. \nIf they continue to do so, both our nation and our military lose.\n  Today's military is a testament to our ability to confront and learn \nfrom our mistakes, but that can only happen if the record is accurate. \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short served with selfless dedication and \nhonor. They were in command during a devastating surprise attack. They \ndeserved to be treated as officers who used their best judgement to \nfollow the orders they were given and to meet their command \nresponsibilities. Instead, they were made singular scapegoats for that \ntragedy for fifty-eight years, without full consideration of the \ncircumstances and options available to them.\n  I hope that most of my colleagues will read this resolution. The \nmajority of the text details the historic case on behalf of Admiral \nKimmel and General Short and expresses Congress's opinion that both \nofficers performed their duty competently. Most importantly, it \nrequests that the President submit the names of Kimmel and Short to the \nSenate for posthumous advancement on the retirement lists to their \nhighest held wartime rank.\n  This action would not require any form of compensation. Instead, it \nwould acknowledge, once and for all, that these two officers were not \ntreated fairly by the U.S. government and it would uphold the military \ntradition that responsible officers take the blame for their failures, \nnot for the failures of others.\n  Before I go into a more detailed review of the historical case, I \nalso want my colleagues to know that this resolution has the support of \nvarious veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) \nand the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. The Delaware VFW passed a \nresolution in support last June and the national VFW passed a \nresolution in support in last September.\n  Now, let me review what happened. First, I want to discuss the \ntreatment of Kimmel and Short. Like most Americans, Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short requested a fair and open hearing of their case, a court \nmartial. They were denied their request. After lifetimes of honorable \nservice to this nation and the defense of its values, they were denied \nthe most basic form of justice--a hearing by their peers.\n  Here are some of the historic facts. On December 18, 1941, a mere 11 \ndays after Pearl Harbor, the Roberts Commission was formed to determine \nwhether derelictions of duty or errors of judgement by Kimmel and Short \ncontributed to the success of the Japanese attack. This commission \nconcluded that both commanders had been derelict in their duty and the \nPresident ordered the immediate public release of these findings. The \nRoberts Commission was the only investigative body that found these two \nofficers derelict in their duty.\n  Several facts about the Roberts Commission force us to question its \nconclusions.\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n  First, Kimmel and Short were denied the right to counsel and were not \nallowed to be present when witnesses were questioned. They were then \nexplicitly told that the Commission was a fact-finding body and would \nnot be passing judgement on their performance. When the findings \naccusing them of a serious offense were released, they immediately \nrequested a court-martial. That request was refused. It is difficult to \nimagine a fair review of the evidence given the rules of procedure \nfollowed by the Commission.\n\n  It is also important to note the timing here. It would be difficult \nto provide a fair hearing in the charged atmosphere immediately \nfollowing America's entry into the war in the Pacific. In fact, Kimmel \nand Short were the objects of public vilification. The Commission was \nnot immune to this pressure. One Commission member, for example, \nAdmiral Standley, expressed strong reservations about the Commission's \nfindings, later characterizing them as a ``travesty of justice''. He \ndid sign the Report, however, because of concerns that doing otherwise \nmight adversely affect the war effort. As you will see, the war effort \nplayed an important role in how Kimmel and Short were treated.\n  In 1944, an Army Board investigated General Short's actions at Pearl \nHarbor. The conclusions of that investigation placed blame of General \nMarshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor \nand in 1944. This report was sequestered and kept secret from the \npublic on the groups that it would be detrimental to the war effort.\n  That same year, a Naval Court of Inquiry investigated Admiral \nKimmel's actions at Pearl Harbor. The Naval Court's conclusions were \ndivided into two sections in order to protect information indicating \nthat America had the ability to decode and intercept Japanese messages. \nThe first and longer, section therefore, was classified ``top secret''.\n  The second section, was written to be unclassified and completely \nexonerated Admiral Kimmel and recognized the Admiral Stark bore some of \nthe blame for Pearl Harbor because of his failure to provide Kimmel \nwith critical information available in Washington. Then Secretary of \nthe Navy James Forrestal instructed the Court that it had to classify \nboth sections ``secret'' and not release any findings to the public.\n  The historic record is not flattering to our government. A hastily \nconvened and procedurally flawed Commission released condemning \nfindings to the public, while two thorough military reviews which had \nopposite conclusions were kept secret.\n  I hope that I have made my point that these officers were not treated \nfairly and that there is good reason to question where the blame for \nPearl Harbor should lie.\n  The whole story was re-evaluated in 1995 at the request of Senator \nThurmond by Under Secretary for Defense Edwin Dorn. In his report, Dorn \nconcluded that responsibility for the disaster at Pearl Harbor should \nbe broadly shared. I agree.\n  Where Dorn's conclusions differ from mine and my co-sponsors, is that \nhe also found that he also found that ``the official treatment of \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and \nprocedurally proper.'' I disagree.\n  These officers were publicly vilified and never given a chance to \nclear their names. If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the \ntruth, then there would be no need for the President to take any action \ntoday. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are \nable to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a \ngood portion of the whole story. I believe sincerely that one of our \ngreatest strengths as a nation comes from our ability to honor truth \nand the lessons of our past.\n  Like many, I accept that there was a real need to protect our \nintelligence capabilities during the war. What I can not accept, \nhowever, is that there is a reason for continuing to deny the \nculpability of others in Washington at the expense of these two \noffice's reputations fifty-seven years later. Continuing to falsely \nscapegoat two dedicated and competent officers dishonors the military \ntradition of taking responsibility for failure. The message that is \nsent is a travesty to American tradition and honor--that the truth will \nbe suppressed to protect some responsible parties and distorted to \nsacrifice others.\n  This is not to say that the sponsors of this resolution want to place \nblame. We are not seeking to place blame in a new quarter. This is not \na witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who were advanced in rank \nand continued to serve, despite being implicated in the losses at Pearl \nHarbor. I think the historic record has become quite clear that blame \nshould be shared.\n  The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nblamed entirely and forced into early retirement.\n  After the war, in 1947, they were singled out as the only eligible \nofficers from World War II not advanced to their highest held wartime \nranks on the retirement lists, under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. \nBy failing to advance them, the government and the Departments of the \nNavy and Army perpetuate the myth that these two officers bear a unique \nand disproportionate part of the blame.\n  The government that denied these officers a fair hearing and \nsuppressed findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile \ninformation owes them an official apology. That's what this resolution \ncalls for.\n  The last point that I want to make deals with the military situation \nat Pearl Harbor. It is legitimate to ask whether Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short, as commanding officers, properly deployed their forces. \nI think reasonable people may disagree on this point.\n  I have been struck by the number of qualified individuals who believe \nthe commanders properly deployed their assets based on the intelligence \navailable to them. I am including this partial list of flag officers \ninto the Record following my statement for my colleagues to review. \nAmong those listed is Vice Admiral Richardson, a distinguished naval \ncommander, who wrote an entire report refuting the conclusions of the \nDorn Report. My colleagues will also see the names of four Chiefs of \nNaval Operations and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nAdmiral Thomas Moorer. It was Admiral Moorer who observed that, ``If \nNelson and Napoleon had been in command at Pearl Harbor, the results \nwould have been the same.''\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe this case is unique and \ndemands our attention. As we honor those who served in World War II and \nwho serve today in Kosovo, we must also honor the ideals for which they \nfought. High among those American ideals is upholding truth and \njustice. Those ideals give us the strength to admit and, where \npossible, correct our errors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move one step \ncloser to justice for Admiral Kimmel and General Short.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this resolution, which \nwill at long last restore the reputations of two distinguished military \nofficers in World War II--Admiral Husband E. Kimmel of the United \nStates Navy and General Walter C. Short of the United States Army.\n  This resolution gives us an opportunity to correct a grave injustice \nin the history of that war. Despite their loyal and distinguished \nservice to the nation, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly \nsingled out for blame as scapegoats after the Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor on December 7, 1941, which caught America unprepared.\n  In fact, wartime investigations of the attack on Pearl Harbor \nconcluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the command of Admiral Kimmel \nand our forces under the command of General Short had been properly \npositioned, given the information they had received. However, as the \ninvestigations found, their superior officers had not given them vital \nintelligence that could have made a difference, perhaps all the \ndifference, in their preparedness for the attack. These conclusions of \nthe wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to protect the \nwar effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification to ignore \nthese facts.\n  I learned more about this injustice from Edward B. Hanify, a close \nfriend who is a distinguished attorney in Boston and who was assigned \nin 1944 as a young Navy lieutenant to be one of the lawyers for Admiral \nKimmel. I believe\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nthat members of the Senate will be very interested in Mr. Hanify's \nperspective, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter he wrote to me \nlast September may be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No action by the Senate can ever fully atone for the \ninjustice suffered by these two officers. But we can correct the \nhistorical record, and restore the distinguished reputations of Admiral \nKimmel and General Short.\n  I commend Senator Biden and Senator Roth for their leadership in \nsponsoring this measure, and I urge the Senate to act expeditiously on \nthis long-overdue resolution.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                September 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am advised that a Resolution known \n     as the Roth/Biden Resolution has been introduced in the \n     Senate and that it has presently the support of the following \n     Senators: Roth; Biden; Helms; Thurmond; Inouye; Stevens; \n     Specter; Hollings; Faircloth; Cochran and McCain. The \n     substance of the Resolution is to request the President to \n     advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to the grade \n     of Admiral on the retired list of the Navy and to advance the \n     late Major General Walter C. Short to the grade of Lieutenant \n     General on the retired list of the Army.\n       Admiral Kimmel at the time of Pearl Harbor was Commander in \n     Chief of the Pacific Fleet then based in Pearl Harbor and \n     General Short was the Commanding General of the Hawaiian \n     Department of the Army.\n       The reason for my interest in this Resolution is as \n     follows: IN early 1944 when I was a Lieutenant j.g. \n     (U.S.N.R.) the Navy Department gave me orders which assigned \n     me as one of counsel to the defense of Admiral Kimmel in the \n     event of his promised court martial. As a consequence, I am \n     probably one of the few living persons who heard the \n     testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry, accompanied \n     Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board of \n     Investigation and later heard substantially all the testimony \n     before the members of Congress who carried on the lengthy \n     Congressional investigation of Pearl Harbor. In the \n     intervening fifty years I have followed very carefully all \n     subsequent developments dealing the the Pearl Harbor \n     catastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that \n     disaster.\n       On the basis of this experience and further studies over a \n     fifty year period I feel strongly:\n       (1) That the odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made \n     by the Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable \n     damage to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel despite the fact \n     that the finding was later repudiated and found groundless;\n        (2) I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to \n     callous and cruel treatment by his superiors who were \n     attempting to deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, \n     particularly on account of their strange behavior on the \n     evening of December 6th and morning of December 7th in \n     failing to warn the Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army \n     Department that a Japanese attack on the United States was \n     scheduled for December 7th at 1:00 p.m. Washington time (dawn \n     at Pearl Harbor) and that intercepted intelligence indicated \n     that Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack; \n     (Washington had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and \n     Army in Hawaii did not have it or any means of obtaining it)\n       (3) Subsequent investigations by both services repudiated \n     the ``dereliction of duty'' charge and in the case of Admiral \n     Kimmel the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and \n     dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the \n     information which he had from Washington.\n       The proposed legislaiton provides some measure of remedial \n     Justice to a conscientious officer who for years unjustly \n     bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor \n     catastrophe. You may be interested to know that a Senator \n     from Massachusetts, Honorable David I. Walsh then Chairman of \n     the Naval Affairs Committee, was most effective in securing \n     legislaiton by Congress which ordered the Army and Navy \n     Departments to investigate the Pearl Harbor disaster--an \n     investigation conducted with all the ``due process'' \n     safeguards for all interested parties not observed in other \n     investigations or inquiries.\n       I sincerely hope that you will support the Roth/Biden \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Edward B. Hanify,\n     Ropes & Gray.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url":

Res. 26\n\n       Whereas homeownership is a fundamental American ideal, \n     which promotes social and economic benefits beyond the \n     benefits that accrue to the occupant of the home;\n       Whereas homeownership is an important factor in promoting \n     economic security and stability for American families;\n       Whereas it is proper that the policy of the Federal \n     Government is, and should continue to be, to encourage \n     homeownership;\n       Whereas the rate of homeownership grew from 64.7 percent of \n     households in 1995 to 67 percent in 1998;\n       Whereas the housing needs of the population will change as \n     the population ages;\n       Whereas the greatest growth sectors in homeownership are \n     minorities and first-time homebuyers;\n       Whereas the level of homeownership among foreign-born \n     naturalized citizens who have been in the United States for \n     at least 6 years is the same as the level of homeownership of \n     the Nation as a whole (67 percent in 1998);\n       Whereas the value of a home represents a valuable source of \n     savings for a family;\n       Whereas the provisions related to homeownership are among \n     the simplest and most easily administered provisions of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       Whereas the current Federal income tax deduction for \n     interest paid on debt secured by a first home has been a \n     valuable cornerstone of this Nation's housing policy for most \n     of this century and may well be the most important component \n     of housing-related tax policy in America today;\n       Whereas the current Federal income tax deduction for \n     interest paid on debt secured by second homes is of crucial \n     importance to the economies of communities in each of the 50 \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Federal income tax deduction for interest paid on debt \n     secured by a first or second home should not be further \n     restricted.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on this April 15, Tax Day 1999, I rise \nin support of one aspect of our deservedly maligned tax code--the \nmortgage interest deduction. The mortgage interest deduction provides \ninvaluable assistance to American families seeking the stability and \ncomfort of a home they can call their own.\n  I purchased my first home, a small fieldstone farmhouse in the \nOzarks, in the Spring of 1967, just before proposing to my wife, Janet. \nLike most families, paying for it was the single largest task in our \nyoung lives. It was, with the wisdom of 30 plus years, a \ntransformational event. For it represented our first real taste of what \nJames Truslow Adams called the ``American Dream.''\n  The experience Janet and I had paying for that farm is not uncommon. \nIn fact, the largest debt most families take on in their lifetimes is a \nhome. Two-thirds of Americans own a home, as do approximately 80 \npercent of Americans over the age of 50 (unfortunately, Janet and I now \nfall into both categories). This represents real progress. In 1940, \nfully 56 percent of Americans were renters. Clearly, America has come a \nlong way.\n  People buy homes for different reasons. For us, our Ozark farmhouse \noffered many things: a place of safety to raise a family, the potential \nof financial security, a sense of community. As I travel across this \ngreat country, couples of all ages suggest that they are looking for \nthe same things Janet and I sought over a quarter century ago. They \nseem to know, as we did, that buying a home is among the essential \nsteps a family takes to ensure stability and prosperity in their lives.\n  Unfortunately, while homes are a worthwhile investment, they also are \nexpensive. Real estate experts recommend that families buy homes valued \nat over three times their annual income--a sum far greater than what \nfamilies could pay back in a year, or two, or even five. So, most \nAmericans take out a mortgage. It is, frequently, a commitment to repay \nthe loan (with interest) over a 30-year period.\n  Historically, the Federal Government has encouraged such behavior. It \nhas done so to promote stable families in stable homes. Through the \nhome mortgage tax deduction, one of the best and most praise-worthy \nparts of our highly-flawed tax code, the government allows taxpayers to \ndeduct the cost of interest on their mortgages from their income taxes. \nIn the early years of a mortgage, nearly 90 percent of payments go to \ninterest charges and are therefore tax deductible.\n  The home mortgage deduction not only encourages home buying, it also \nhelps to promote community and family. In my home state of Missouri, \n526,744 tax filers claim the interest deduction out of 2,416,434 \nreturns. These are families trying to build their homes, getting what \nadvantages they can out of the overly-burdensome tax code.\n  Across the rest of the country, homeownership is an important factor \nin promoting economic security and stability for American families. In \nfact, homeownership is one of the most valuable sources of saving for \nAmerican families and, unlike other forms of saving, it is encouraged \nand facilitated by our tax code.\n  The home mortgage deduction is also of great assistance to many of \nour citizens who are trying hardest to establish the stability and \nsecurity of homeownership. The greatest growth sectors in homeownership \ntoday are among minorities and first-time homebuyers, who are \nfrequently just on the cusp of attaining the American dream.\n  Similarly, immigrants, who come to this country seeking a new way of \nlife, are beneficiaries of the mortgage deduction. In fact, the level \nof homeownership among foreign-born naturalized citizens who have been \nin the United States for at least six years is the same as the level of \nhomeownership of the Nation as a whole. When families such as these, \nwho are new to our shores, prosper, we as a nation prosper.\n  In short, the home mortgage deduction is an important benefit to \ncitizens across this great land. It is in our national interest to \nmaintain this portion of the tax code so that new generations can also \nexperience the safety and security of homeownership. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3816-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3816-S3817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 77--COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF \n    CONNECTICUT HUSKIES FOR WINNING THE 1999 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Liberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

On Friday, March 12 the team won the NCAA \nnational title in team rifle competition during the annual \nchampionships held at Norwich University in Northfield, VT.\n  While the Nanooks won the team Rifle Championships, the students had \nseveral other firsts. Ms. Kelly Mansfield, a junior at the University, \nbecame the first person ever to win both the small-bore and individual \ntitles in the same year. And the Nanooks set a record with eight team \nmembers earning All-American status, record number of All-Americans in \nrifle competition from a single University. Of the team's eight All-\nAmericans six earned honors in both the small-bore and air rifle \ndisciplines, another record.\n  Besides Ms. Mansfield, I would like to congratulate the other seven \nAll-Americans who competed with such distinction during the national \ncollegiate championships. Earning praise are sophomore Dan Jordan, \nfreshman Johan Lindberg and sophomore Melissa Mulloy, all double All-\nAmericans first team in both events. Also earning praise are junior \nJoacim Trybom, who earned first-team, small-bore and second team air \nrifle honors; Grant Mecozzi, who earned second-team honors in both \ncategories; and Amber Darland, who made the second team in small-bore.\n  I also would like to mention senior Kelly Bushong, who won honorable \nmention on the small-bore squad.\n  All of the students from the University's Fairbanks campus performed \nwonderfully, an obvious reflection on their coach, Randy Pitney, who \nhas done a sensational job of teaching and preparing his team this \nyear. All Alaskans wish to offer our praise and our thanks for the \nteam's hard work and dedication. Excellence in marksmanship takes skill \nand discipline. It also takes desire--the desire to practice, the \ndesire to be the best. That was particularly hard this past January in \nFairbanks when the temperature was often -50 degrees F.\n  I can't say enough for the accomplishments of these young women and \nmen. Everyone in Alaska is very proud of the Nanooks' achievements \nduring the 1998-99 season. Again, congratulations on a great \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3818-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3818-S3819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF HENRY S. LANDAU\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Henry S. \nLandau on receiving the Humanitarian Award of the Jewish Federation of \nWashtenaw County, Michigan. Mr. Landau is being honored by the Jewish \nFederation as a ``builder of our future,'' because of the outstanding \nwork he has done to establish programs and institutions to provide \neducation and job training in the community.\n  Henry Landau has served his community, state, and country in \ncountless ways. He served as a trustee of Washtenaw Community College \nfrom 1976 to 1982. He also served as chair of the Washtenaw Community \nCollege Foundation and was later honored by the college with a lifetime \nachievement award and an endowed scholarship. Mr. Landau was a Senior \nLife Director of the National Association of Home Builders and a \ntrustee of the Home Builders Institute. Mr. Landau also served as \nPresident of the Michigan Association of Home Builders and was a board \nmember for eighteen years.\n  Henry Landau was instrumental in establishing a unique and innovative \nprogram in the Ann Arbor Public School System to teach high school \nstudents about the building trades by allowing them to build an actual \nhome. This successful program continues and is now financed through the \nsale of the homes built by students. The construction industry later \nhonored Mr. Landau's efforts with the H.S. Landau Scholarship, which is \nawarded annually and benefits a graduate of the Ann Arbor student \nbuilding program.\n  Mr. President, I have mentioned only a small sampling of the many \nways in which Henry Landau has used his vitality, creativity and hard \nwork to make his community and our nation a better place to live. I \nknow my colleagues will join me in honoring Henry Landau for\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nhis many extraordinary efforts on behalf of his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3819-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION OF MEMBERS AND OFFICERS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Res. 80\n\n       Whereas on April 12, 1999, a treacherous fire erupted in a \n     historic cotton mill in Atlanta, Georgia, and Mr. Ivers Sims, \n     a construction worker, found himself suspended 180 feet in \n     the air trapped by raging flames surrounding him;\n       Whereas Boyd Clines, a Georgia Department of Natural \n     Resources pilot, and his navigator, Larry Rogers, arrived on \n     the scene and negotiated a helicopter through the menacing \n     wind, smoke, and fire which emanated from the cotton mill, \n     while an Atlanta firefighter, Matt Moseley, dangled from a \n     rope near the flames, all in an attempt to save Mr. Sims;\n       Whereas Boyd Clines, Larry Rogers, and Matt Moseley, in the \n     true spirit of heroism, demonstrated amazing courage and \n     valor in risking their lives in order to save the life of Mr. \n     Sims;\n       Whereas the teamwork, dedication, and bravery that Boyd \n     Clines, Larry Rogers, and Matt Moseley displayed during the \n     rescue mission enabled the mission to be successful;\n       Whereas Atlanta firefighters, police officers, Sheriffs \n     deputies, and residents diligently worked together in order \n     to fight the massive fire that engulfed the historic cotton \n     mill;\n       Whereas Atlanta residents at home during the fire helped \n     during the crisis by rescuing pets and using garden hoses to \n     extinguish the flames emanating from burning debris;\n       Whereas the Atlanta firefighters, facing shortages of \n     equipment and personnel, heroically contained a fire that \n     could have spread beyond the cotton mill and enveloped a \n     historic neighborhood now being revitalized;\n       Whereas the fire crisis of April 12, 1999, shall be \n     remembered not for the tragic loss of the historic cotton \n     mill, but instead for the heroism and bravery displayed by \n     Boyd Clines, Larry Rogers, and Matt Moseley; and\n       Whereas it should be recognized that Boyd Clines, Larry \n     Rogers, and Matt Moseley have brought pride and honor to the \n     State of Georgia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Boyd Clines, Larry Rogers, and Matt \n     Moseley for the bravery and heroism that they displayed \n     during the April 12, 1999, rescue mission of Mr. Ivers Sims; \n     and\n       (2) commends Atlanta firefighters, police officers, \n     Sheriffs deputies, and residents for the outstanding teamwork \n     that they displayed in fighting the fire of the cotton mill.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, to digress for just a moment, this is a \nresolution acknowledging the heroism of Boyd Clines, Larry Rogers, and \nMatt Moseley. I doubt that there is hardly an American alive who did \nnot watch that stunning and chilling event when these three men \nexemplified all the virtues of American heroism. It is a stark reminder \nof what Americans, who work for our fire departments, our rescue units, \nour law enforcement agencies all across the country, are capable of \ndoing, and their total dedication where they will often set all their \nown personal safety aside in the name of helping another citizen.\n  It was all embodied in this enormous event that occurred in Atlanta, \nGA several days ago. It was an incredible sight and witness of American \nheroism. I am particularly pleased to be able to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Cleland, in the authorship of that resolution which \nhas just been approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/15/senate-section/article/S3819-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3819-S3820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REFERRAL OF MEASURE--S. 754\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
