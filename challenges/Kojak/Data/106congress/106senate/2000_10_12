You never \ngive up on us.

It is a combination of \ngratitude, honesty, and courage. We admit that all that we have and are \nis Your gift; we honestly face the distance between what we are and \nwhat we could be in our relationships and responsibilities; we need \ncourage to blow the cap off of our reservations and live the full \npotential according to Your expectations.\n  Here we are at the beginning of a crucial day in the life of this \nSenate. As we rush into the schedule, we meet You at the pass. We don't \nneed to spin to win with You. You know all about us. And so we simply \nask You to take our minds and focus our intelligence on what is best \nfor America, to take our wills and guide us to choose what is righteous \nand just, and to take our voices and speak Your truth through them. You \nare our Lord and Saviour.

Findings and Purpose.--\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation has not made adequate progress in \n     maintaining and expanding the inventory of affordable housing \n     for low and very low-income families, including persons with \n     disabilities and seniors;\n       (2) despite continued economic expansion, worst case \n     housing needs have reached an all-time high of 5.4 million \n     families, increasing by 4 percent between 1995 and 1997;\n       (3) the number of rental units which are affordable to \n     extremely low-income families has decreased by 5 percent \n     since 1991, a loss of over 37,000 units;\n       (4) the Administration and the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development has proposed increased funding for \n     incremental rental vouchers as the primary solution to making \n     additional housing available for low-income and very low-\n     income families;\n       (5) while section 8 vouchers represent housing choice as a \n     matter of philosophy, in many cases\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\n     families using vouchers have difficult time finding housing, \n     especially in low vacancy market areas;\n       (6) in many cases, where section 8 vouchers are used, the \n     result is de facto redlining where low-income families are \n     relegated to the poorest and most distressed neighborhoods \n     with limited opportunities for transportation, employment and \n     quality schools;\n       (7) section 8 vouchers do not produce additional new units \n     of affordable low-income housing since banks will not finance \n     new construction with one year termed portable assistance;\n       (8) the Department of Housing and Urban Development has not \n     provided the necessary leadership to assist in the \n     development of needed affordable housing;\n       (9) a large number of States and local government have been \n     successful in developing new tools and opportunities for the \n     development of additional affordable housing for low-income \n     families, including the development of affordable mixed \n     income housing as part of State and local redevelopment \n     strategies for distressed communities; and\n       (10) State housing finance agencies have the local \n     experience and knowledge to maximize the development of \n     additional units of affordable low-income housing and to \n     preserve the existing stock of low-income affordable housing.\n       (b) The purpose of this Act is to redirect the primary \n     responsibility for the preservation of existing affordable \n     low-income housing and the expansion of the inventory of \n     affordable rental housing for very low-income and low-income \n     families from the Federal Government to State and local \n     governments through State housing finance agencies.\n       Sec. 4. Definitions.--For purposes of this Act, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) The term ``low-income families'' shall have the same \n     meaning as provided under section 3(b)(2) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) The term ``project-based assistance'' shall have the \n     meaning given such term in section 16(c)(6) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937, except that such term includes \n     assistance under any successor programs to the programs \n     referred to in such section.\n       (3) The term ``public housing agency'' shall have the \n     meaning given such term in section 3(b) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937.\n       (4) The term ``Secretary'' shall mean the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development.\n       (5) The term ``section 8 assistance'' or ``voucher'' shall \n     have the meaning given such term in section 8(f) of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (6) The term ``State'' shall mean the United States of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, Guam, the Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and any \n     other territory of possession of the United States.\n       (7) The term ``State housing finance agency'' shall mean \n     any State or local housing finance agency that has been \n     designated by a State to administer this program.\n       (8) The term ``very low-income families'' shall have the \n     same meaning as provided under section 3(b) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n\nTITLE I--PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING FOR LOW AND VERY LOW-INCOME FAMILIES\n\n       Sec. 101. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall make funds available to State housing finance agencies \n     as provided under section 102 for the rehabilitation of \n     existing low-income housing, for the development of new \n     affordable low-income housing units, and for the preservation \n     of existing low-income housing units that are at risk of \n     becoming unavailable for low-income families.\n       Sec. 102. Allocation of Resources.--\n       (a) In general.--The Secretary shall allocate funds \n     approved in appropriations Acts to State housing finance \n     agencies to carry out this Title.

For each fiscal year, \n     the Secretary shall reserve for grants to Indian tribes 1 \n     percent of the amount appropriated under the applicable \n     appropriations Act. The Secretary shall provide for \n     distribution of amounts under this subsection to Indian \n     tribes on the basis of a competition conducted pursuant to \n     specific criteria developed after notice and public comment.\n       (b) Minimum state allocation.--If the allocation under \n     subsection (a), when applied to the funds approved under this \n     section in appropriations Acts for a fiscal year, would \n     result in funding of less than $10,000,000 to any State \n     housing finance agency, the allocation for such State housing \n     finance agency shall be $10,000,000 and the increase shall be \n     deducted pro rata from the allocation of all other State \n     housing finance agencies.\n       (c) Criteria for reallocation.--The Secretary shall \n     reallocate any funds previously allocated to a State housing \n     finance agency for any fiscal year in which the State housing \n     finance agency fails to provide its match requirements or \n     fails to submit an affordable housing expansion plan that is \n     approved by the Secretary. All such funds shall be \n     reallocated pursuant to the formula provided under subsection \n     (a).\n       Sec. 103. Affordable Housing Expansion Plan.--\n       (a) Submission of affordable housing expansion plan.--The \n     Secretary shall allocate funds under section 102 to a State \n     housing finance agency only if the State housing finance \n     agency has submitted an affordable housing expansion plan, \n     with annual updates, approved by the Secretary and designed \n     to meet the overall very low- and low-income housing needs of \n     both the rural and urban areas of the State in which the \n     State housing finance agency is located. This plan shall be \n     developed in conjunction with the housing strategies \n     developed for the applicable States and localities under \n     section 105 of Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing \n     Act.\n       (b) Citizen participation.--Before submitting an affordable \n     housing expansion plan to the Secretary, a State housing \n     finance agency shall--\n       (1) make available to citizens of the State, public \n     agencies and other interested parties information regarding \n     the amount of assistance expected to be made available under \n     this Title and the range of investment or other uses of such \n     assistance that the State housing finance agency may \n     undertake;\n       (2) publish the proposed plan in a manner that, in the \n     determination of the Secretary, affords affected citizens, \n     public agencies, and other interested parties a reasonable \n     opportunity to review its contents and to submit comments on \n     the proposed plan;\n       (3) hold one or more public hearings to obtain the views of \n     citizens, public agencies, and other interested parties on \n     the housing needs of the State; and\n       (4) provide citizens, public agencies, and other interested \n     parties with reasonable access to records regarding the uses \n     of any assistance that the State housing finance agency may \n     have received under this Title during the preceding 5 years.\n       Sec. 104.

Matching Requirements.--\n       (a) In general.--Each State housing finance agency shall \n     make contributions for activities under this title that \n     total, throughout a fiscal year, not less than 75 percent of \n     the funds made available under this title.\n       (b) Allowable amounts.--\n       (1) Application to housing.--A contribution shall be \n     recognized for purposes of a match under subsection (a) only \n     if--\n       (A) is made with respect to housing that qualifies as \n     affordable housing under section 107; or\n       (B) is made with respect to any portion of a project for \n     which not less than 50 percent of the units qualify as \n     affordable housing under section 107.\n       (2) Form.--A contribution may be in the form of--\n       (A) cash contributions from non-Federal sources, which may \n     not include funds from a grant under section 106(b) or \n     section 106(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act \n     of 1974 or from the value of low income tax credits allocated \n     pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code;\n       (B) the value of taxes, fees or other charges that are \n     normally and customarily imposed but are waived, forgone, or \n     deferred in a manner that achieves affordability of housing \n     assisted under this title;\n       (C) the value of land or other real property as appraised \n     according to procedures acceptable to the Secretary;\n       (D) the value of investment in on-site and off-site \n     infrastructure directly required for affordable housing \n     assisted under this title;\n       (E) the reasonable value of any site-preparation and \n     construction materials and any donated or voluntary labor in \n     connection with the site-preparation for, construction or \n     rehabilitation of affordable housing; and\n       (F) such other contributions to affordable housing as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (3) Administrative expenses.--Contributions for \n     administrative expenses may not be recognized for purposes of \n     this section.\n       Sec. 106.

Eligible Affordable Housing.--\n       (a) Production of affordable housing.--In the case of new \n     construction, housing shall\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n     qualify for assistance under this title only if the housing--\n       (1) has not less than 30 percent of the units assisted \n     under this title occupied by very low-income families who pay \n     as a contribution towards rent (not including any Federal or \n     State rental subsidy provided on behalf of the family) not \n     more than 20 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose \n     income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, \n     as determined by the Secretary, with adjustments for the \n     number of bedrooms in the unit, except that the Secretary may \n     establish income ceilings higher or lower than 50 percent of \n     the median income for the area on the basis of the \n     Secretary's findings that variations are necessary because of \n     the prevailing levels of construction costs or fair market \n     rents, or unusually high or low family incomes;\n       (2) except as provided under paragraph (1), requires all \n     units assisted under this title to be occupied by households \n     that are low-income families and who pay no more than 30 \n     percent of 100 percent of the median income for an area; and\n       (3) will remain affordable under the requirements provided \n     in paragraphs (1) and (2), according to legally binding \n     commitments satisfactory to the Secretary, for not less than \n     40 years, without regard to the term of the mortgage or to \n     the transfer of ownership, or for such period that the \n     Secretary determines is the longest feasible period of time \n     consistent with sound economics and the purposes of this Act, \n     including foreclosure where the responsibility for \n     maintaining the low-income character of the property will be \n     the responsibility of the State housing finance agency.\n       Sec. 108.

Subsidy Layering Requirements.--The requirements \n     of section 102(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development Reform Act of 1989 may be satisfied in connection \n     with assistance, including a commitment to insure a mortgage, \n     provided under this Title by a certification of a State \n     housing finance agency to the Secretary that the combination \n     of assistance within the jurisdiction of the Secretary and \n     other government assistance provided in connection with a \n     property assisted under this Title shall not be any greater \n     than is necessary to provide affordable housing.\n       Sec. 112. Multifamily Risk-sharing Mortgage Insurance \n     Program.--The Secretary shall carry out a mortgage insurance \n     program through the Federal Housing Administration in \n     conjunction with State housing finance agencies to insure \n     multifamily mortgages for housing that qualifies under this \n     Title. This program shall be consistent with the requirements \n     established under section 542 of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act of 1992, except that housing that meet the \n     requirements of this Title shall be eligible for mortgage \n     insurance.\n       Sec. 113. Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue notice \n     and comment rulemaking with final regulations issued no later \n     than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Sec. 114. Sunset.--Title I shall expire on October 1, 2001, \n     except that all funds shall remain available until expended.\n\n           TITLE II--SECTION 8 VOUCHER SUCCESS DEMONSTRATION\n\n       Sec. 201. Authority.--The Secretary shall establish a \n     voucher success demonstration to permit public housing \n     agencies to increase the payment standard for section 8 \n     vouchers for an area in excess of the payment standard \n     established under section 8(o)(B) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 to assist in helping low-income and very \n     low-income families obtain housing in tight rental markets. \n     Except as otherwise provided herein, all assistance provided \n     under this Title shall be subject to the requirements of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937.\n       Sec. 202. Eligibility.--\n       (a) Voucher success plan.--Not less than annually, each \n     public housing agency that seeks to participate in the \n     voucher success demonstration under section 201 shall submit \n     to the Secretary a voucher success plan that--\n       (1) demonstrates that the market area for which the public \n     housing agency is responsible is an area, based on housing \n     market indicators, such as low vacancy rates or high \n     absorption rates, where there is not adequate available and \n     affordable housing or where families with vouchers will not \n     be able to locate suitable units or use tenant-based \n     assistance successfully;\n       (2) identifies a payment standard in excess of the payment \n     standard established under section 8(o)(B) that will ensure \n     that not less than 97 percent of families with vouchers will \n     be able to obtain suitable housing in that market area within \n     120 days;\n       (3) describes actions that the public housing agency will \n     take that will assist families with vouchers, including \n     seniors and persons with disabilities, to identify and obtain \n     suitable and available affordable housing that is close to \n     transportation, employment opportunities, quality schools and \n     appropriate services; and\n       (4) shall include such other information and commitments as \n     deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (b) Increased payment standard.--The Secretary shall \n     approve a payment standard for a market area under this \n     demonstration to no more than 150 percent of the payment \n     standard established under section 8(o)(B) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937. This payment standard shall be \n     published annually in the Federal Register and adjusted \n     annually to reflect changes in each market area.\n       (c) Procedures.--The Secretary shall establish requirements \n     and procedures for the submission and review of voucher \n     success plans, including requirements for timing and form of \n     submission, and for the contents and approval of such plans.\n       (d) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue interim \n     regulations no later than 3 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act with final notice and public comment \n     regulations issued no later than 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Savings clause.--A family using a voucher approved as \n     part of a demonstration under this Title shall be eligible \n     for an approved payment standard in excess of the payment \n     standard established under section 8(o)(d) of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 to the extent the assisted family \n     continues to reside in the same housing in which the family \n     was residing on the date in which the housing was determined \n     eligible for the increased payment standard under this Title.\n       Sec. 203. Limitation on Funding.--Except to the extent \n     additional incremental vouchers are provided in \n     appropriations Acts, for purposes of this section, each \n     public housing agency shall be limited to the section 8 funds \n     allocated to that public housing agency as of October 1, \n     2000, including appropriate amounts for reserves, for \n     purposes of implementing the voucher success plan.\n\n    TITLE III--PRESERVATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING AND MISCELLANEOUS \n                               PROVISIONS\n\n       Sec. 301. Section 8 Project-based Flexibility.--Section \n     8(o)(13) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended \n     by--\n       (1) in paragraph (A)(ii), striking ``15 percent'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``25 percent''; and\n       (2) adding the following new paragraph (E) to the end:\n       ``(E) The Secretary shall establish expedited procedures to \n     allow public housing agencies to enter into housing \n     assistance payment contracts with respect to existing \n     structures.''.\n       Sec. 302. Disposition of HUD-held and HUD-owned Multifamily \n     Projects.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall maintain any \n     rental assistance payments attached to any dwelling units \n     under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for \n     all multifamily properties owned by the Secretary and \n     multifamily properties held by the Secretary for purposes of \n     management and disposition of such properties. To the extent, \n     the Secretary determines that a multifamily property owned by \n     the Secretary or held by the Secretary is not feasible for \n     continued rental assistance payments under section 8, the \n     Secretary may, in consultation with the tenants of that \n     property, contract for project-based rental assistance \n     payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing \n     properties.\n       Sec. 303. Family Unification Program.--Section 8(x)(2) of \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended by--\n       (a) striking ``any family (A) who is otherwise eligible for \n     such assistance, and (B)'' and inserting in lieu thereof: \n     ``(A) any family (i) who is otherwise eligible for such \n     assistance, and (ii)''; and\n       (b) inserting before the period at the end: ``(B) for a \n     period not to exceed 18 months, youths who have attained at \n     least 18 years of age and not more than 21 years of age and \n     who have left foster care at age 16 or older''.\n       Sec. 304. Permanent Extension of FHA Multifamily Mortgage \n     Credit Demonstrations.--Section 542 of the Housing and \n     Community Development Act of 1992 is amended--\n       (1) by revising subsection (b)(5) to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Insurance authority.--Using any authority provided in \n     appropriation Acts to insure mortgages under the National \n     Housing Act, the Secretary may enter into commitments under \n     this subsection for risk-sharing units.'';\n       (2) by revising subsection (c)(4) to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Insurance authority.--Using any authority provided in \n     appropriation Acts to insure mortgages under the National \n     Housing Act, the Secretary may enter into commitments under \n     this subsection for risk-sharing units.'';\n       (3) in the heading, by striking ``Demonstrations'' and \n     inserting ``Programs'';\n       (4) in the first sentence of subsection (a), by striking \n     ``demonstrate the effectiveness of providing'' and inserting \n     ``provide'';\n       (5) in the second sentence of subsection (a), by striking \n     ``demonstration'';\n       (6) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``determine the \n     effectiveness of'' and inserting ``provide'';\n       (7) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``test the \n     effectiveness of'' and inserting ``provide'';\n       (8) by striking subsection (d); and\n       (9) by striking ``pilot'' and ``PILOT'' each place it \n     appears.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001''.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee substitute is agreed to. The \nBond-Mikulski amendment is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4306) was agreed to, as follows: (The text of the \namendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as comanager, I am pleased to present to the \nSenate, H.R. 4635, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, \nas reported from the Committee on Appropriations.\n  This is an unusual year. We have offered, and it has been accepted, a \nmanagers' amendment that I have offered with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, which will replace the Senate committee-\nreported text of H.R. 4635.\n  This compromise amendment was worked out in agreement with Senator \nMikulski, Congressman Walsh, Congressman Mollohan, and me in \nconsultation with the administration. This is an unusual and far from \nperfect situation. It is not the way I would normally prefer to proceed \nwith the passage of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. Nevertheless, we \nhave worked hard to develop a comprehensive package that considers the \nconcerns of all colleagues in both the House and Senate. It also met \nthe test for approval by the administration. I strongly believe that \nthe proposed compromise language strikes the right balance in funding \nthe programs under the jurisdiction of the VA/HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n\n  The managers amendment/compromise agreement totals some $105.8 \nbillion, including some $24.6 billion in mandatory veterans benefits. \nThis represents some $1.1 billion over the Senate committee-reported \nbill and almost $1 billion less than the budget request. Outlays are \nfunded at some $110.7 billion for fiscal year 2001, $540 million over \nthe Senate committee-reported bill of $110.2 billion. The bill meets \nour current funding allocation, per the Budget Committee.\n  We also did our best to satisfy priorities of Senators who made \nspecial requests for such items as economic development grants, water \ninfrastructure improvements and the like. Such requests numbered \nseveral thousand, illustrating the level of interest and demand for \nassistance provided in this bill.\n  We also attempted to address the administration's top concerns, \nincluding funding for 79,000 new housing vouchers, as well as record \nfunding for EPA at $7.8 billion.\n  Before going into the details of the compromise agreement, I would \nlike to commend my ranking members, Senator Mikulski, and her staff for \ntheir cooperation and support throughout this process. We would not \nhave reached agreement as quickly, nor attained as good a result, \nwithout her active help. She is a vitally important part of this \noperation. I am deeply grateful for her help, guidance, and counsel.\n  To turn to the elements of the bill: For Veterans Affairs, the \nproposed compromise language to VA/HUD FY 2001 appropriations bill \nincludes funding for VA that totals $47 billion, including $22.4 \nbillion in discretionary spending. Veterans needs remain the highest \npriority for this bill, and compared to the President's request, this \nbill has an additional $54.7 million.\n  The compromise includes $20.28 billion for VA medical care, $1.4 \nbillion more than the current level, and $351 million for research, an \nincrease of $30 million above the budget request level for this key \nprogram which helps ensure the best quality of care to our veterans and \nkeeps the best doctors in the VA system.\n  The VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise also includes \nabout $180 million more than the President's request for VA medical \ncare by including a provision that will ensure VA will not be penalized \nfrom collecting less in new receipts authorized under the 1999 \nMillennium Act.\n  In addition, the compromise includes a new Title V, Filipino Veterans \nBenefits Improvements, which provides benefits to Filipino veterans who \nfought alongside American soldiers in World War II and who live in the \nUnited States, equal to those benefits provided to U.S. veterans of \nWorld War II. This is a long overdue remedy of inequitable treatment of \nFilipino veterans. We thank our colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee for their agreement and assistance in including this \nprovision.\n  For HUD, the VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise \nappropriates some $30.6 billion, approximately the same as the budget \nrequest. This includes a section 8 rescission of some $1.8 billion in \nexcess section 8 funds. This funding includes all the funding needed to \nrenew all expiring section 8 contracts and also provides funds for \n79,000 incremental vouchers, an administration priority.\n  The public housing capital funding is increased by $45 million above \nthe budget request in fiscal year 2001 to $3 billion. Similarly, the \npublic housing operating funding has been increased by $50 million \nabove the budget request in fiscal year 2001 to $3.242 billion.\n  In addition, CDBG and HOME funds have been increased by $150 million \neach in fiscal year 2001 with CDBG at $5.057 billion and HOME at $1.8 \nbillion, respectively. These are important block grant programs which \nrely on decisionmaking guided by local choice and need. I also hope \nthese funds are used as an investment in housing production to meet the \nincreasing affordable housing needs of low-income families. Staff work \nin this subcommittee has shown one of the serious problems facing us is \nlack of affordable housing.\n\n  In addition, the VA/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 \nfunds section 202 elderly housing at $779 million, the budget request, \nand section 811 housing for disabled persons at $217 million, $7 \nmillion over the budget request. A separate account has been created at \n$100 million for the renewal of expiring shelter plus care contracts.\n  This bill includes a number of noncontroversial HUD administrative \nprovisions, whereas we have dropped, at the request of the Senate \nBanking Committee, a new housing production program for extremely low-\nincome families and a provision that would have provided favorable \ntreatment under FHA for municipal workers such as teachers, firemen, \nand police.\n  We also have maintained a provision that would increase the amount of \nsection 8 assistance available to PHAs for project-based assistance \nfrom 15 percent to 20 percent with a limitation that no more than 25 \npercent of the units in a building can be project-based, except in the \ncase of seniors, disabled persons and scattered site housing as well as \na provision that would require HUD to maintain section 8 projected-\nbased assistance on a HUD-held or HUD-owned multifamily housing \nprojects where the project is elderly or disabled housing unless that \nhousing is not viable. These are important provisions that focus on \nlocal decisionmaking and local housing needs.\n  For EPA, the VA/HUD fiscal year 2001 appropriations compromise \nincludes a record $7.8 billion for EPA, plus an additional $138 million \nfor the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences which traditionally \nhave been funded under EPA's appropriation and are funded separately in \nthis bill. Thus, compared to the budget request, the compromise will \nprovide an additional $686 million more than the President and about \n$400 million more than fiscal year 2000.\n  Additional funds of $550 million above the budget request have been \nprovided for clean water state revolving funds as well as additional \nfunds of $12 million for section 106 water quality grants--$57 million \nabove the fiscal year 2000 level to help states meet future total \nmaximum daily load requirements.\n  Compared to last year, the compromise increases operating programs by \n$246 million including an additional $20 million for the climate change \ntechnology initiative voluntary programs and protection of all core \nprograms.\n  The compromise does not fund new, unauthorized programs such as clean \nair partnerships or Great Lakes grants which would detract from EPA \ncore responsibilities.\n  With respect to legislative issues, the compromise bill includes the \nfiscal year 1999 bill with report language relative to the Kyoto \nProtocol. The proposed report would provide up to an additional 6 \nmonths for finalizing the arsenic-in-drinking water rule, and the bill \nmodifies the so-called Collins-Linder provision on ozone nonattainment\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\ndesignations which would allow EPA to make designations once the \nSupreme Court decides this case but not later than June 2001.\n  These so-called EPA riders are primarily report language which we \nbelieve are fair and reasonable compromises on issues where there are \nbroad questions and we need to bring some resolution. While everyone \nmay not agree with these decisions, we have worked hard to balance the \ndecisions associated with this account to the overall benefit of EPA \npolicy and funding needs in consultation with and agreement with the \nadministration.\n  For FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill for 2001 appropriates a total of $936.8 million for \nFEMA and includes an additional $1.3 billion in disaster relief \ncontingency funds. With the disaster relief funds provided here, \ncoupled with contingency funds already on hand, funding will be \nsufficient to meet fiscal year 2001 disaster relief operations.\n  Most notable in FEMA funding is the addition of $30 million above the \nSenate- or House-appropriated levels for emergency food and shelter, \nfor a total of $140 million. This popular program results in temporary \nhousing and food assistance to thousands of needy individuals with very \nlittle overhead costs.\n  For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the VA-HUD \nappropriations compromise funds NASA at $14.285 billion instead of \n$14.035 billion, for an increase of $250 million. This account includes \n$5.46 billion for human space flight, which is $37 million below the \nadministration request for fiscal year 2001. This reduction reflects a \nNASA request for a reduction in this account in order to provide full \nfunding for the Mars 2003 lander program.\n  The funding includes $6.19 billion in fiscal year 2001 for science, \naeronautics, and technology, instead of $5.93 billion as requested by \nthe administration, an increase of $261 million above the budget \nrequest. Included in this is $20 million for Living with a Star and \n$290 million for the space launch initiative, including $40 million for \nalternative access to the space station initiative. In addition, \nmission support is funded for fiscal year 2001 at $2.6 billion, instead \nof $2.58 billion, an increase of $24.7 million over the budget request.\n  For the National Science Foundation--and this is a very important \narea for the ranking member and me--the VA-HUD compromise funds NSF at \n$4.43 billion, a $529 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 \nenacted level and $146 million below the President's request. Funding \nhighlights include $215 million for information technology research, \n$150 million for nanotechnology, and $65 million for plant genome \nresearch. Lastly, to assist smaller research institutions, $75 million \nwas included for EPSCoR, a $20 million increase over last year's level, \nand $10 million for the Office of Innovation Partnerships.\n  We believe very strongly the scientific exploration in space needs to \nbe spread broadly throughout the land to ensure we achieve inclusion of \nknowledgeable and dedicated scientists at institutions which may not \ntraditionally have received funding in the past.\n  I consider NSF a priority account that needs additional funding in \norder to pace U.S. leadership in science and technology. Senator \nMikulski and I have heard from leading scientists in this country who \nsay that we are falling behind because we are not providing enough \nfunding for the National Science Foundation. Medical doctors who depend \ndirectly upon the research work done at the National Institutes of \nHealth have come to us and said that we must bring NSF funding up to \nNIH funding because so many of the health breakthroughs on which NIH is \nworking depend upon the support the National Science Foundation \nprovides.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have launched an effort to double the NSF \nbudget. We have circulated a letter and have a significant number of \ncolleagues who have joined with us. We will be back. We will be asking \nthe full Senate to recognize a priority in the National Science \nFoundation and help get us on that path for the next year.\n  Finally, for the National Service Corporation, the VA-HUD fiscal year \n2001 appropriations compromise appropriates $458 million, a $25 million \nincrease over last year's level and $75 million below the budget \nrequest. Further, $30 million will be rescinded from excess funds in \nthe National Service Trust.\n  The compromise also funds the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions Fund at $118 million, a $23 million increase over last \nyear's level and $7 million below the request.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague, \nSenator Bond, as well as our colleagues Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens, for enabling us to move our bill forward. I particularly \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Bond for his collegial and civil way \nof including me in all discussions related to both the funding and \npolicy that we developed in this bill. His courtesy and collegiality \nare very much appreciated.\n  I believe today the bill we present takes care of national needs and \nnational interests. I am also confident that it will be signed by \nPresident Bill Clinton because it takes care of the day-to-day needs of \nthe American people and at the same time looks forward to helping with \nthe long-range needs of our country to remain competitive and on the \ncutting edge of science.\n  This bill has always been to me about five things: meeting our \nobligations to our veterans--promises made, promises kept; investing in \nour neighborhoods and our communities promoting self-help; creating \nreal opportunities for people to move from welfare to work, to make \nsure that public housing is not a way of life but a way to a better \nlife; and, of course, advancing science and technology, the new ideas \nthat lead to the new jobs and the new products. It is also about \nprotecting consumers from fraud and scams and communities from floods \nand disasters.\n  I believe we meet the goals in this bill, and we have done it in a \nfiscally prudent way. While I support the bill, the process has left \nmuch to be desired; again no fault of Chairman Bond but really the \nSenate has placed us in a very awkward situation.\n  The bill before the Senate today is a managers' substitute for the \nSenate bill. This is effectively our conference report. We did not have \na conference report, though we met. We had kind of a chatroom where we \nwould meet and try to iron out our differences. We did. It also \ninvolved OMB and the White House for consultation. We wanted to be sure \nboth sides of the aisle would support the bill. We also wanted to be \nsure that the President would sign the bill. I believe we achieved \nthis.\n  I say to my colleagues, it will be absolutely crucial, in order to \nmove this bill with this unique parliamentary situation, to have no \namendments to this legislation. My colleague from California, Senator \nBoxer, will offer two amendments. I am going to oppose them. I am going \nto oppose them both on procedural and substantive grounds. On \nprocedure, if the Boxer amendments prevail, we will have enormous \ndifficulty reconvening and working with the House to pass this bill. I \njust put that out.\n  Though we had an unofficial conference, I do believe we were able to \nmove forward. Senator Bond has outlined in detail what we were able to \ndo financially. I am so glad we worked together on a bipartisan basis, \nparticularly in the area of veterans health care, joining hands, \nscrutinizing the budget and then the appropriations to make sure that \nveterans health care will be funded $1.4 billion over last year's \nlevel.\n  We also want to look ahead to be sure, while we are taking care of \nthe men and women who bear the permanent wounds of war, we do the \nmedical research, to find the cures for those things affecting our \nveterans population. This legislation provides $350 million for medical \nand prosthetic research, $30 million over last year. I have seen the \nwork at my own University of Maryland and know that people will live \nlonger, live better, and recover more quickly because of the funding \nfor veterans health care research which also goes into the civilian \npopulation.\n  Also, we have added more money, $100 million, for State veterans \nhomes. This is to provide long-term care and rehabilitation, which is \nvery crucial. It\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nmeans the Federal Government does not bear the sole burden, the State \ngovernments do not bear the sole burden, and, most of all, our veterans \ndo not bear the sole burden. This unique Federal-State partnership will \nmeet the long term and rehab needs of our veterans.\n  In addition, we have paid attention to the day-to-day needs of our \nconstituents in Housing and Urban Development.\n  We want to make sure the people of the United States of America, who \nare out there working every day but who are also part of the working \npoor, have help with housing. We have been able to create 79,000 new \nvouchers to help working families find affordable housing. \nUnfortunately, we do not have enough housing to meet their needs.\n  Senator Bond led a very vigorous effort, which I supported, as did \nthe authorizers on my side, to start a production program. We were \nderailed from that, but we did not want to be detoured from the bill, \nso we put that aside for another year. But we really call out to our \nauthorizers, please, pass a production bill that will generate jobs in \nconstruction and meet the needs of our citizens.\n  Where I think we also worked very closely together is in helping the \nelderly and disabled. We have provided $780 million for housing for the \nelderly. It is more than last year. It also helps with assisted living \nand service coordinators to be able to help people keep as independent \nas long as they can, and to even develop new models of care.\n  At the same time, we looked out for those who are disabled and the \nspecial AIDS population. But we wanted to also remember not only the \n``H,'' which is housing, we wanted the part called urban development. \nBut we also know so many of our constituents live in rural areas. So we \nlooked to see how we could increase the ability for local \ndecisionmaking. That is why we funded community development block grant \nmoney and a program called HOME at much more than last year, because it \ngoes right to cities, communities, and neighborhoods. Whether you are \nin a small rural town in Missouri or a big city such as Baltimore, \ncommunity development block grant money and HOME will be of great help \nto you.\n  But we are about promoting self-help. That is why we continued to \nstay the course in providing funds for empowerment zones, again \nrecognizing rural needs and also promoting home ownership. That is why \nwe help the homeowners by extending the FHA downpayment simplification \nprogram for another 25 months. So we looked at how we could create \nopportunities at the local level.\n  Another area where we have strong bipartisan support within the \ncommittee and by its chairman and ranking member is to make sure that \nAmerica continues to lead the way in science and technology. Therefore, \nI am so pleased that we are funding the National Space Agency at $14.3 \nbillion, $250 million above the President's request. Quite frankly, I \nthink NASA needs a lot more because they have been severely cut over \nthe years, but fiscal prudence won. At the same time, we wanted to make \nsure that we were fiscally prudent, that our shuttle will be safe, our \nspace station will be ready, and that we will move ahead on a vigorous \nspace science program, such as the Living With A Star Program that will \nbe done at Goddard Space Flight Center in my own community.\n  The National Science Foundation is also a very important, crucial \nprogram. The national science program, as Senator Bond has said, really \ndoes promote the basic research that goes into our country. It has been \na star. It has been almost flat-lined for several years while we tried \nto balance the budget. This is why this year they will receive a $520 \nmillion increase over last year's enacted level.\n  One of the areas which we will be also advocating is a field called \nnanotechnology. You have heard of a nanosecond. It is because it is \nsmall. But let me tell you, the nanotechnology is the next generation \npast this infotechnology. You have seen the biotech revolution and the \ninfotech revolution, but wait until the nanotech research gets \nunderway. We are going to have new products, new materials. We are \ngoing to be able to have a supercomputer the size of my ring.\n\n  We will be able to take little pills, that will literally have \ndiagnostic equipment, that will be able to go through our bodies, \ngiving immediate responses to our physicians. This is going to be \nextraordinary. I am so pleased to be part of what we are doing.\n  At the same time, we want to call forth young people to continue the \ncall for service. That is why I am so pleased we continued to stay the \ncourse on national service, with a modest increase.\n  One of the things we have done in national service is add something \ncalled E-Corps. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong \nproponent to make sure we do not have a digital divide in this country, \nmeaning that young people have access to technology and access to know \nhow to use technology. What we are creating in this legislation is \nhaving E-Corps volunteers to train and mentor not only the children but \ncommunity leaders and librarians and others who will be teaching our \nchildren.\n  Last, but not at all least, we joined hands to protect the \nenvironment. We have increased funds for the environment, whether it is \nthe clean water revolving fund, small watershed programs to restore \nrivers and streams, or having full funding of the Chesapeake Bay \nprogram. I believe the environment will be stronger and better \nprotected by the resources that we have put in this bill.\n  Now, yes, there are riders. I don't go for riders. None of us go for \nriders. But we were in a very difficult situation with the bill. We \ntook the language that was being proposed by the House, working with \nthe office of OMB--the President's own--and the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality that advises the President on the environment. \nThey were in the room to help us really identify the appropriate \nlanguage that could meet the policy objectives of those who advocated \nit without shackling EPA or hurting communities.\n  I will say more about that during the debate. But I will tell you, \nregardless of how you feel about the riders, they were acceptable to \nthe President's Council on Environmental Quality.\n  To be more specific, Mr. President, I am especially pleased that we \nwere able to provide a significant increase in funding for veterans \nhealth care. We met the President's request of $20.2 billion and are \n$1.4 billion above last year's level. This will help us ensure that \npromises made to our veterans are promises kept, and that our veterans \nget the health care to which they are entitled.\n  We were also able to provide $351 million for medical and prosthetic \nresearch. This is $30 million above the budget request and last year's \nlevel.\n  The VA plays a major role in medical research for the special needs \nof our veterans, such as: geriatrics, Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and \northopedic research. Our veterans are not the only ones who benefit \nfrom this research--our entire nation does, especially as America's \npopulation continues to age.\n  We are also providing $100 million in funding for state veterans \nhomes. This is $40 million above the budget request and $10 million \nabove last year's level. The state homes serve as long-term care and \nrehabilitation facilities for our veterans.\n  We were also able to provide over $1.6 billion for the Veterans \nBenefits Administration, which will help them administer benefits to \nour veterans more quickly.\n  I am also very pleased that we were able to include a new title in \nour bill that will provide benefits to Filipino veterans who fought \nalongside Americans in World War II and who live in the United States.\n  Finally, our Filipino-American veterans will receive equal benefits \nfor equal valor.\n  We were able to take care of America's working families in this bill \nas well, by funding housing programs that millions of Americans depend \nupon.\n  Our bill provides almost $13 billion to review all expiring section 8 \nhousing vouchers. And we have included $453 million in funding to issue \n79,000 new vouchers, to help working families find affordable housing. \nThis is 19,000 more than we were able to fund last year.\n  We included provisions to make it easier for public housing \nauthorities to provide more project-based assistance to increase the \nstock of affordable housing, instead of just vouchers.\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues were aware, a production bill was under \nserious consideration during the conference. It was a modified version \nof Senator Bond's housing production bill that was included in the \noriginal Senate bill. Unfortunately, we were forced to drop this \nprovision due to objections from the authorizing committee, but I hope \nwe will re-visit the issue next year. We were also able to maintain \nlevel funding for other critical core HUD programs.\n  We provided $779 million for housing for the elderly, which meets the \nPresident's request and is $69 million more than last year. This \nincludes funds for assisted living and service coordinators. We also \nprovided $217 million in funding for housing for disabled \nAmericans, which is $7 million above the President's request and $23 \nmillion over last year's level.\n\n  Homeless assistance grants received a $5 million increase and are \nfunded at $1.025 billion.\n  We were able to provide both the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram and the HOME Program with $150 million increases. CDBG is \nfunded at more than $5 billion, and HOME is funded at $1.8 billion. The \nCDBG Program is one of the most important programs for rebuilding our \ncities and neighborhoods.\n  We also provided increased funding to help our neighborhoods and \ncommunities through the HOPE VI Program, which helps demolish and then \nrevitalize distressed public housing sites. This year, we provided $575 \nmillion for HOPE VI, the same as last year's level.\n  I am pleased that we were able to provide funding for other programs \nthat help America's communities. We increased funding for empowerment \nzones by providing $90 million in this bill and increased funding for \nCDFI--Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.\n  Funding for empowerment zones will help designated areas with \neconomic development and social services. Community involvement in the \nempowerment zone initiative will prove especially beneficial.\n  We also help homeowners by extending the FHA downpayment \nsimplification program for 25 months.\n  As I said, I am extremely pleased that our bill fully funds NASA at \n$14.3 billion, an increase of $250 million. This funding exceeds the \nPresident's request for NASA. All of NASA's core programs are fully \nfunded and all of our centers are fully funded, including the Goddard \nSpace Flight Center in my home State of Maryland.\n  The VA-HUD bill includes $1.5 billion for Earth science, more than \n$2.5 billion for space science, including funding for the Mars polar \nlander, and $20 million to start an exciting new program called \n``Living With A Star,'' which will study the relationship between the \nsun and the Earth and its impact on our environment and our climate. It \nwill help us predict and protect against solar storms that can disrupt \nour energy and communications systems.\n  I am especially proud that this program will be headquartered at the \nGoddard Space Flight Center.\n  NASA science programs are critical not just for science, but for \ntechnology. With NASA technology, we can create new jobs and literally \nsave lives, while developing a greater understanding of how our \nuniverse works.\n  I fought hard to make sure that this funding was included in this \nmanager's amendment.\n  And, of course, in the area of human space flight, we fully fund the \nspace shuttle upgrades, space station construction, and fully fund the \nnew ``Space Launch Initiative'' to find new, low-cost launch vehicles \nthat will reduce the cost of getting to space.\n  The VA-HUD manager's amendment also increases funding for the \nCorporation for National Service.\n  The House bill cut funding for the Corporation for National Service, \nbut I made it a priority to restore it in the Senate bill and in \nconference.\n  The corporation is funded at $458 million, a $25 million increase \nover last year's level.\n  The Corporation for National Service has enrolled over 100,000 \nmembers and participants across the country, in a wide array of \ncommunity service programs, including: AmeriCorps, a national service \nprogram that helps communities, learn and serve America, which supports \nservice-learning programs across the country by providing funding and \ntraining, and the National Senior Service Corps, which helps seniors \nget involved in their communities.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been very concerned about the \ndigital divide in this country.\n  I introduced legislation called the Digital Empowerment Act to \nprovide a one-stop shop and increased funds to local communities trying \nto cross the digital divide.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains $25 million within the national \nservice budget to create an ``E-Corps'' of volunteers who will bring \ntechnology skills to people who have been left out or left behind in \nthe digital economy, by training and mentoring children, teachers, and \nnon-profit and community center staff on how to use computers and \ninformation technology.\n  With regard to the EPA, our bill provides $7.8 billion in funding, \nplus an additional $138 million for the Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry, ATSDR, and the National Institute of Environmental \nHealth Sciences, NIEHS.\n  All together, this is an increase of $400 million over last year's \nlevel, and $686 million more than the President's request.\n  We increased funding by $246 million for EPA's core environmental \nprograms, including a $38 million increase for nonpoint source \npollution control grants, and a $20 million increase for the climate \nchange technology initiative.\n  We also provided an additional $550 million for the clean water state \nrevolving fund. Taking care of the infrastructure needs of local \ncommunities has always been a priority for the VA-HUD Subcommittee.\n  We have fully funded the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and Long Island \nSound Programs, and provided $1.25 million for the Chesapeake by small \nwatershed grants program, a $500,000 increase over last year's level, \nthat will help our small communities around the Bay watershed prevent \nrunoff and pollution.\n  Legislatively, the bill includes the FY 1999 bill and report language \nregarding the Kyoto Protocol, provides up to an additional 6 months for \nfinalizing the arsenic-in-drinking-water rule, and includes a weaker \nversion of the Collins-Linder provision on ozone.\n  There is no language on the diesel sulfur rule. However modified \nreport language has been included regarding dredging and invasive \nremediation.\n  I am a strong supporter of FEMA, and am proud that we have provided \n$937 million in funding for FEMA, plus an additional $1.3 billion in \nemergency disaster relief funding.\n  The National Science Foundation is funded at $4.43 billion, a $529 \nmillion increase over last year's enacted level, and one of the largest \nincreases in NSF's history.\n  This funding level will keep America at the forefront of science and \ntechnology into the next century in info-tech and bio-tech, and is an \nimportant step towards holding onto America's science and technology \nbase.\n  This is a downpayment toward our goal of doubling the NSF budget over \nthe next five years.\n  I am especially pleased that we were able to provide $150 million for \nthe new nanotechnology initiative. We were also able to provide $215 \nmillion for information technology, and well-deserved increases for \nseveral of NSF's education and human resources accounts. These include \na $10 million increase over the budget request for informal science \neducation, nearly $20 million for graduate fellowships in K-12 \neducation, and over $55 million for graduate research fellowships.\n  Mr. President, I once again appreciate the cooperation of my \ncolleagues throughout this process. While I regret that this year's \nprocess was highly irregular, I am pleased that we worked together to \nbring a conference agreement to the Senate floor. I believe this year's \nVA/HUD bill is good for our country, our veterans, and our communities.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my statement, I really want to thank \nSenator Bond and his staff, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, and Carolyn \nApostolou, for all the work they did, and also my own staff, Paul \nCarliner, Sean Smith, and Alexa Mitrakos, for helping us really move \nthis bill, and, most of all, to move America forward.\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4307\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I \ncall up amendment No. 4307 and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4307.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield back all time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I heard the number, but what is the bill? \nWhat does it do?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the language of S. 2900 as reported.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is this the language of the Senate, of the bill that was \nreported from the committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. So it is the Senate-reported bill and carries the Senate \ntitle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the language, but it doesn't carry the \ntitle.\n  Mr. BYRD. It carries the Senate number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I just \nasked unanimous consent that this amendment be called up and yielded \nback time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nArizona does have the time. He also has time on the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know the Senator has time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Maryland until she \ncompletes this business.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Does Senator Byrd intend to speak?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not intend to take the time of the \nSenate at this point.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I urge that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona wish to speak \nbefore the amendment is adopted?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since the Senator from Maryland had already embarked on \nthis parliamentary movement, I will yield until that is completed and \nthen speak after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4307.\n  The amendment (No. 4307) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to reconsider.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for a division.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia asks for a \ndivision. As many as are in favor of the amendment will rise and remain \nstanding until they are counted. (After a pause.) Those opposed will \nrise and stand until counted.\n  On a division, the amendment was rejected.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their hard work on this important legislation which \nprovides federal funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nand Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Independent Agencies. Once \nagain, though, I find myself in the unpleasant position of commenting \non the process of bringing these spending bills to the Senate floor and \non the spending items that have not been appropriately reviewed.\n  This task is even more necessary for this bill because of the truly \nunique process by which it arrived on the Senate floor--a process that \nincreasingly empowers appropriators while disenfranchising many of my \ncolleagues.\n  Let me comment on the process that has brought us to the point in \ntime where we are about to vote on final passage of this bill. First, \nlet me explain how the appropriations process is supposed to work. In \nthe normal process of passing appropriations bills, an appropriations \nbill is first passed in the House of Representatives, then the Senate \npasses its own version. A conference committee is formed to iron out \nthe differences between the two different bills, resulting in a \nconference report. Then the conference report is passed by both the \nHouse and the Senate, and sent to the President for his signature in \norder to become law. That sounds fairly straightforward.\n  In the case of this bill, we have decided to substitute the normal \nprocess of considering appropriations bills for a highly questionable \napproach to passing legislation.\n  The process we have decided to undertake avoids substantive debate on \nthe merits of this bill and to the larger question of whether we are \nspending taxpayers' hard-earned money wisely and responsibly. Just \nbecause it is late in the game does not give us the right to avoid the \nnormal process of appropriations. The Senate is being asked to pass the \nbill despite the fact that there was only one copy made available to \neach side and many Senators did not have adequate time to review its \ncontents. How can we make sound policy and budget decisions with this \ntype of budget steam-rolling?\n  Let me be clear about what is occurring today. This VA-HUD bill that \nwe are voting on is a so-called ``composite compromise,'' cloaking the \nreality that we would normally be calling a VA-HUD conference report. \nThe Appropriations leadership intends to take up the House-passed \nversion of this year's VA-HUD Appropriations bill, substitute a Senate \nmanagers' amendment written by the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittees which for all practical purposes is a conference agreement--\na conference agreement, not open to public inspection, not done through \nthe normal legislative process, such as appointing conferees or \nallowing full disclosure of the issues being discussed. This process \nwill allow the Appropriators to simply insert a ``Committee Statement'' \ninto the record outlining certain questionable spending priorities that \nwill ultimately be paid for by the American taxpayer. This ``composite \ncompromise'' will then go to the House so that they can quickly pass \nthe amended bill and then send it to the President for his signature.\n  Is that the way to pass legislation? As legislators, we have been \nentrusted by the American taxpayers to represent the fiscal interests \nof them and their nation. The American taxpayer is counting on us to \nuse their hard-earned money wisely and here we are, manipulating the \nbudget process so that we can say we did something and go back home to \ncampaign.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the budget process games began long \nbefore this bill.\n  When the conference report on Legislative Branch Appropriations bill \nfirst came to the floor for debate and a vote last month, the \nappropriators decided to insert the Treasury and General Government \nappropriations bill into it. Rather than having the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations bill considered separately as it is \nusually done, to be debated on its own merits, the appropriators' \nactions decided to circumvent the normal budget\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nprocess. This so-called ``minibus'' was soundly defeated and rightly \nso.\n  When the conference report on the Transportation Appropriations bill \nwas brought to the Senate floor for a vote, the appropriators did not \neven provide a copy of the report for others to read and examine before \nvoting on the nearly $60 billion bill. The transportation bill itself \nwas only two pages long with the barest of detail--with actual text of \nthe report to come later.\n  And yet, the appropriators were expecting Senators to vote yes on \nlegislation that could not even be read, deciphered, and debated \nintelligently? How is this type of action accountable to all the hard-\nworking Americans who demand that all their tax dollars are wisely \nspent? I worry that these budget games we play serve to reinforce their \ncynicism about politics.\n  Mr. President, the budget process can be summed up simply: no debate, \nno deliberation, and very few votes. Mr. President, this is no way to \nrun the United States Senate.\n  To date, only two of the thirteen appropriations bills have become \nlaw. Of those remaining, three bills--Labor, HHS, Education, VA-HUD, \nand Treasury-Postal--were never brought to the Senate floor for debate \nas part of a deliberate strategy to prevent votes on any controversial \namendments that my colleagues may have offered. Extraordinary measures \nare being employed to drive these spending bills through Congress. The \nonly winners in such an arrangement are the appropriators. The rest of \nus, including our constituents, are, for all intents and purposes, \nshut-out of the process.\n  Mr. President, by adopting this budget strategy, we do a disservice \nto our constituents by not squarely facing tough issues, whether it's \nschool choice, gun control, campaign finance, minimum wage, gambling, \nor HMO reform, and engaging in debate--even in the heat of an election \nseason where both sides of the aisle are maneuvering for maximum \npolitical advantage. These are important issues. They deserve to be \ndebated and each deserves an up or down vote.\n  Moreover, we have an obligation to ensure that Congress spends the \ntaxpayer's hard-earned dollars prudently to protect the projected \nbudget surpluses. The American public cannot understand why we engage \nin a process that continues to spend huge amounts of money without \nadequately balancing this spending against our nation's most urgent \npresent and future needs. Spending from this budget process has been on \nautomatic pilot. We have already exceeded the budget caps by over $30 \nbillion, consuming, so far, about one-third of the on-budget surplus \nfor FY2001--and we have yet to pass all of the appropriations bills. \nThis byzantine budget process precludes serious discussion about how \nour projected budget surpluses should be devoted to national priorities \nsuch as saving Social Security, providing much needed tax relief, \npaying down the national debt, or addressing other major priorities.\n  But more is lost beyond the throttling of debate, the profligate \nspending of taxpayers' dollars, and the broken budget process.\n  Since 1960, the percentage of voters participating in the general \npresidential election has dropped nearly 15 percent, reaching below the \n50 percent mark four years ago. Today, voter apathy, especially among \nthe youth of America, is widespread. Even more disheartening is the \nfact that too many Americans, when asked to rank the people in the \ndifferent fields from highest regard to lowest, consistently rank our \nprofession near the bottom. Poll after poll continues to show an \nundercurrent of cynicism toward our governmental institution. As I \npreviously mentioned, budget games like the one we have witnessed in \nthe last few weeks contribute to this cynicism.\n\n  We can still seize the reform mantle and learn from this budget \nmorass when the doors of the new Congress open in January. We need new \nreforms in the way we address the budget process. Perhaps we should \neven consider the radical step of abolishing the Appropriations \nCommittees. Too many programs are without authorization. We also should \nstudy whether the authorizers should also be the appropriators, to \nbuild more accountability into the process.\n  There are many other reforms we should consider next Congress if we \nare to spare Congress' reputation from further damage and begin to \nrepair the people's respect for this Government.\n  The Washington Post yesterday had an article by Dan Morgan, ``As Last \nBills Leave Station, Lobbyists Grab Tickets.''\n\n       With only a handful of bills remaining to be signed into \n     law before Congress adjourns, well tailored business \n     lobbyists for elite corporations have descended on Capitol \n     Hill to plead for dozens of special provisions in a \n     Washington ritual with billions of dollars at stake.\n\n  Mr. President, on October 6, the Senate passed the conference report \non the bill H.R. 4475, which funds the Department of Transportation and \nrelated agencies. At the time, I included for the Record a list of \nexamples of pork barrel spending contained in the Transportation \nconference report. But because the list of pork barrel was so long and \nso extensive I was unable to publish the full list in the Congressional \nRecord. For those who wish to view the list in its entirety, please \nvisit my website: http://mccain.senate.gov and click the ``pork \nbarreling'' logo at the bottom.\n  We are also legislating on these appropriations bills. Huge and vital \ninterests are being legislated in smoke-filled rooms in the darkest \ncorners of this Capitol. These lobbyists are out there and they are \ndoing damage to the national interest by getting their special \ninterests represented in appropriations bills which have never been \ndebated or discussed on the floor of either House.\n  That is wrong, Mr. President. Nobody knows how much overspending \nthere will be. Some say as much as $45 or $60 billion.\n  There is an article today, I believe in the USA Today, that shows we \nare spending the surplus. We are all talking about how we will use the \nsurplus. Yet we are spending it now. We are spending the surplus. We \nare putting into law entitlement programs that will spend even more.\n  There are some very interesting CBO studies and others by outside \nwatchdog organizations that indicate this much ballyhooed and very \noptimistic view of our budget surplus is being eroded as we speak by \nthis appropriations process.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at these bills, to look at the spending \nin it, to look at the legislation that is going on. We are abrogating \nour responsibilities to the taxpayers by voting on bills that we have \nneither seen nor read.\n  I hope we can make some sense out of this. The train wreck that is \nabout to occur is the worst that I have seen in all the years I have \nbeen in the Congress. I don't think it helps us in the eyes of the \nAmerican citizens, to say the least.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with respect to this bill, it is a very \nfrustrating exercise, as Senator McCain said. One of the problems is we \nhave a practice around here of combining bills in such a way that while \nyou want to vote for part of it, you want to oppose the other part. It \nmakes it very difficult to make your decision about whether you will \nvote yes or no.\n  I wrote to the Appropriations Committee chairman when I first came to \nthe Senate and asked to ``de-attach'' some of the bills. The bill \nbefore the Senate is the VA-HUD bill. Everybody wants to vote for the \nveterans programs, and because of the way those programs are structured \nthis year, I support those programs. I want to be able to vote for \nthose programs.\n  As usual, when it is combined with the runaway spending in the HUD \npart of the bill, it makes it impossible to do so. It is exacerbated \nthis year as a result of the tactics of the minority. We have not been \nable to bring bills to the floor, and we have not been able to send \nthem to the President. The result is we have had to combine a bunch of \nbills at the end of the session, and we find we have to combine the \nenergy and water appropriations bill with the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill.\n  The problem, as bad as it is in the first instance, is exacerbated. I \nvoted for the energy and water appropriations bill. While there are \nprograms in that bill that I don't support overall, it was an important \nand good bill. I supported what Senator Domenici was trying to do in \nthat legislation, by and large, so I voted for it.\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\n  The question is what to do now in a bill, the VA-HUD bill, which is \nincreasing at a huge rate, and which now has the energy and water bill \nattached to it. I can't pick and choose. I can't take the veterans part \nout and say I support that, but I don't support the rest of it. I can't \ntake the energy and water part out and say, I support it but I don't \nsupport the rest of it. It is not a good way to legislate, as Senator \nMcCain said.\n\n  I point out, there are good things in the bill. Veterans health care \nis increased by 6.5 percent, from $19 billion to $20.3 billion. The \naccount for prosthetic and medical research, a relatively small account \nbut very important, will receive a modest increase. There are some \nimportant projects in the NASA account that will receive necessary \nfunding. I support that part of the bill.\n  How can I support a bill which has exploded funding in the HUD part \nof it? The VA part of this bill increases spending by 7 percent. Now, \nthat is an important and significant increase. But the social programs \nunder the HUD part of this bill have increased by 18 percent.\n  I have heard it said when we add up all the spending bills this year, \nit will be more than any other year in modern history, including the \nGreat Society. We are increasing these social programs in the HUD part \nof the bill by 18 percent. The earmarking has exploded. We have not \nseen the final list, but we know it is up to at least $292 million, up \nfrom $123 million in the committee-passed bill, and $240 million from \nlast year. That is too much. We have funding in here for everything \nfrom renovating theaters to restoring carousels. This is not something \nthe Federal Government needs to be doing.\n  Finally, there is language in the Senate report that suggests that \nsome of my colleagues are wavering from a commitment that has been made \nby the Senate and the House to ensure that the allocation of veterans \nhealth care funds reflects the reality of where veterans live.\n  Four years ago, under the leadership of Senator McCain, Congress \nimplemented the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation System. This was \ndone at the request of the Veterans' Administration. Up until then, the \nformula that VA used did not take into account shifts in population \nthat are relevant in assessing where resources are needed. In \nparticular, we found in Arizona a lot of so-called snow birds, those \ngreat folks who live in the cold States and come down to visit Arizona \nin the wintertime because it is warmer in Arizona. We didn't have the \nfacilities to take care of all of those people because the dollars \nassociated with their care were allocated to the Northeast primarily, \nor to the North.\n  The Senate, therefore, voted overwhelmingly to implement this new \nsystem that let the dollars follow the patients, so to speak. That vote \nwas 79-18. Yet some who benefited from the earlier faulty formula \ncomplained, and as a result we find language in here that will require \na study. The money for this study is going to have to come from the \nhealth care that otherwise would be provided to veterans.\n  I don't believe the way the language in the report is written the \ninvestigators are going to have a fair approach to this because of the \none-sided list of items they are to explore.\n  I want to be able to support the veterans part of this bill. I want \nto support the energy and water component of this legislation, but it \nwill be very difficult considering the explosive growth in the HUD part \nof the bill.\n  I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Bond, and Senator \nMikulski. They have an impossible task. Everybody comes to them with \nrequests. The bottom line is we have to draw the line at some point. It \nseems to me this is the point at which the American taxpayers deserve \nto be represented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed 2 \nminutes of additional time to talk about the situation in the Middle \nEast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senators Mikulski and Bond for their \ngraciousness. I know they are anxious to move their bill forward. I \nalso thank them and Senator Daschle and Senator Lott for receiving an \nagreement with me, whereby I could offer these very important \namendments to this appropriations bill.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4308\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), for herself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 4308.\n\n(Purpose: To strike the riders that delay the Environmental Protection \n Agency's new standard on arsenic in drinking water and that prohibit \n    the designation of nonattainment areas under the Clear Air Act)\n\n       On page 103, strike the first three lines.\n       On page 138, strike section 427.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask if we can have a copy of the \namendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly. I say to my friend that it is a very simple \namendment. It strikes two riders. We will send it over to the Senator \nat this time. It doesn't have any language. It simply strikes two of \nthe riders.\n  Mr. President, will you please tell me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment strikes two egregious anti-environment \nriders that have been attached to this appropriations bill. These \nriders are opposed by 21 environmental groups.\n  There is a letter on everyone's desk from the League of Conservation \nVoters. They consider this to be extremely important.\n  We also have another letter that came in this morning signed by the \nmost respected environmental groups in the country supporting both of \nmy amendments.\n  We will try to put these on the desks. I will go through the groups \nin a moment.\n  Twenty-one environmental groups oppose these riders. They say they \nbelieve these riders would ``jeopardize public health or the \nenvironment.''\n  The first rider deals with arsenic in drinking water. Let me take a \nmoment to explain why I think this rider should be stricken. In the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendment of 1996, which the Senate approved \nunanimously, we told the EPA to update its drinking water standard for \narsenic by January 1, 2001. We included this provision in the law \nbecause we learned from public health experts that the current standard \nfor arsenic is severely dangerous and outdated. The standard was set in \n1975, but it was based on public health data from 1942.\n  What do scientists and health experts say about the dangers of \narsenic? According to a National Academy of Sciences report, arsenic in \nwater is known to cause cancer of the lungs, skin, and bladder. The \nNational Academy of Sciences study and other studies also found that \narsenic in drinking water may cause kidney and liver cancer. Arsenic is \nalso known to cause other severe problems, including toxicity to the \ncentral and peripheral nervous system, hypertension, cardiovascular \ndisease, skin lesions, and could cause birth defects and reproductive \nproblems.\n  Here is the national shocker. The National Academy of Sciences \nestimates that 1 in every 100 people who drink water containing arsenic \nat the current standard may well develop cancer caused by arsenic. This \nis a cancer risk that is 10,000 times higher than the cancer risk EPA \nallows in food.\n  The National Resources Defense Council analyzed EPA's base data, and \nthey looked at 25 States serving approximately 100 million Americans. \nThey found that approximately half of those Americans are drinking \nwater with arsenic levels that could cause 1 in 100 of them to develop \ncancer.\n  The arsenic levels in those systems meet the EPA's outdated 50 parts \nper billion standard. As the NAS has said, the outdated standard ``does \nnot achieve EPA's goal for public health protection and requires \nrevision as promptly as possible.''\n  Let me repeat that. This is science. They base these rules on \nscience. The\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nsciences say set the standard at a lower level as soon as possible.\n  In this rider we push the date back. It is a delay. I think it is a \ndangerous delay.\n  The EPA has been working on this new standard for a long time. They \nhave held numerous public hearings. Actually, they have been working on \nupdating the standard since the early 1980s.\n  It is time to do this. The EPA was told by Congress to move forward \nby January 1, and now this rider was slipped into this bill.\n  I know my friends believed at the time that these riders were not \nthat much of a problem. Whoever told them that--and I was not in the \nroom--I believe was wrong. They are proven wrong by science. They have \nbeen proven wrong.\n  Call me old fashioned, but I think when you play around with the \narsenic levels in drinking water, it deserves to have the light of day. \nIt should not be attached to some rider. I am the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee on the Environment. My chairman of the full committee is \nhere, Senator Baucus. We are working hard to make sure that drinking \nwater is safe. Yet we push back the date. That is not the right thing \nto do.\n  I appreciate my friends giving me 15 minutes of time, and I am going \nto give Senator Baucus about 5 minutes of that time when he is ready. I \nhave saved 5 minutes.\n  This is no way to legislate on an issue such as arsenic.\n  In closing, before I yield my time to my friend, I want to talk about \nthe other part of this amendment which deals with another egregious \nrider that has to do with clean air. The clean air rider is very \nimportant. It essentially would prohibit EPA from designating new \nregions of the country as being in violation of smog standards. In \nother words, it is a gag order on EPA, telling them they cannot, in \nfact, tell communities their air is dirty. This is a fact.\n  I do not understand, again, why we would be doing this. There is a \ncourt case pending on the power of the EPA. It specifically says in \nthat court case that EPA has the right to designate these areas and to \ntell people in these areas they are not meeting the smog standard. \nAdministrator Browner made a very strong comment about this rider in \nthe past.\n  I ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I would like to do at this time is yield 3 minutes \nto my friend, Senator Baucus, and 2 minutes following to my friend, \nSenator Lautenberg. Then I would have 3 minutes remaining, which I \nwould retain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have 3 minutes.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski--I worked with her on this bill--and also Senator \nBoxer for offering these amendments.\n  I strongly support Senator Boxer in her efforts to delete these \nprovisions. Not only do they intrude upon the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, they are clearly legislation. \nOur committee was not consulted. The Appropriations Committee is now \nwriting legislative language in an appropriations bill. It also is very \nunsound public policy.\n  One of these riders, the so-called Linder-Collins provision, is \nreally an attack on the public's right to know. The provision prohibits \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from identifying those areas which \ndo not the meet the 8-hour standard ozone pollution provision until \nnext June. In other words, even if the EPA knew an area had unhealthy \nair, it could not tell citizens or their government.\n  Since my time is so limited, I will not speak more on that issue. \nSenator Boxer will, and I believe other Senators will, too.\n  I also want to speak a bit on the other one, and that is the arsenic \nprovision. The other rider postpones EPA's final rules on arsenic \nstandards for drinking water for 6 months. This is very important. This \nis yet another unhealthy delay that could expose Americans to \nunnecessary danger. Why do I say that? First, arsenic is a poison. We \nnow know it is also a carcinogen. So it is an especially serious \ncontaminant in drinking water.\n  Get this. The current standard for arsenic was written in 1942, \nbefore we knew that arsenic causes cancer. Then, in 1996, Congress \ncompleted a comprehensive rewrite of the Safe Drinking Water Act. We \nput some common sense into the act, some risk assessment, some \nadditional funding for the States. We also put in place a plan to \nresolve the remaining scientific issues.\n  As a result of the scientific study done by the National Academy of \nSciences, we learned that arsenic is even more deadly than previously \nthought. NAS found:\n\n       There is sufficient evidence from human epidemiological \n     studies . . . that chronic ingestion of inorganic arsenic \n     causes bladder and lung cancer as well as skin cancer.\n\n  The study also said the current standard should be revised downward \n``as promptly as possible.''\n  Furthermore, when the Environment and Public Works Committee had a \nhearing on the matter, in response to a question, Dr. Michael Cossett, \na member of the NAS group who studied the arsenic issue, said:\n\n       Our committee specifically in its conclusions felt that the \n     standards should be lowered as promptly as possible.\n\n  He went on to say that the current standard certainly was not \nprotective of public health.\n  Yet we have this anti-environmental rider. It is further delay in \nprotecting the American public from better arsenic standards. I cannot \nunderstand it. I think it is very bad public policy, and I strongly \nurge Congress to delete these provisions which, if not deleted, are \ngoing to cause serious harm to the American public.\n  Mr. President, earlier today we had a discussion about the arsenic \nrider. I want to assure Mr. Bond and Ms. Mikulski that although the \nminority committee staff was notified about the intention to pursue \nthis rider, they objected to its inclusion. I just want to be sure the \nRecord accurately reflects what occurred.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, time is short. I will try to get to \nthe point very quickly.\n  I support Senator Boxer's amendments to this VA-HUD appropriations \nbill. I want to point out one thing. Under the leadership of Senators \nBond and Mikulski, the bill our subcommittee reported last month was \nfar better than the one before us today.\n  What we see today with these riders that have come over from the \nHouse side of the Capitol is delayed corporate responsibility. That is \nwhat these amendments ought to be called: Just take care of the \ncorporations and forget about our obligation to our people to protect \nus from contaminated, polluted environments.\n  One of these amendments is there because it is strongly supported by \nGeneral Electric, an extremely powerful corporation. I like General \nElectric. I know a lot of the people who run that company. But they \nhave, according to the League of Conservation Voters, polluted 200 \nmiles of New York and Connecticut coastline with a million pounds of \nPCBs. Their slogan is: ``Bring Good Things To Life.'' We have heard it. \nI would rather have them say: ``Bring Good Life To Things,'' like fish \nand birds and people. That is where they ought to be.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for bringing up this amendment. I hope our \ncolleagues are going to support it.\n  This is a good bill, other than this part. Again, I commend Senators \nBond and Mikulski for a very tough job well done. But we ought not let \nthe corporations escape getting on with their responsibilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to retain my 3 minutes if I might, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri now has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Very briefly, this bill includes the provision that provides up to an \nadditional 6 months for EPA to finalize the arsenic in drinking water \nrule. They can finalize it before June 2001 but will not be held to the \nstatutory deadline. And EPA does not anticipate finalizing the rule \nuntil April or May, despite the\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\nact's requirements. The practical effect of knocking this out would be \nto force EPA to spend its resources fighting in court to do what it \ncannot otherwise do, and that is take the time necessary to do the job \nright.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act called for a full year of comment. The \nfull year would be up June 2001. The most conservative estimates of \ncompliance, including EPA's, for the smallest communities show water \nrates increasing by hundreds of dollars per family.\n  The State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality says the rate \nincrease to remove arsenic from the Heartland Mobile Home Park would be \n$230 per month per customer. Even the EPA said it would be $70 per \nmonth per customer.\n  Do you know what is going to happen? No system. They are going to be \noff the system. There will be no water. They will get it from sources \nthat are not protected at all.\n  This is a very important rule that needs to be worked out \nscientifically. EPA has not identified the specific level in drinking \nwater below which there is not a significant risk to public health.\n  On the ozone nonattainment designation, it seems to me completely \nunreasonable that EPA should be making designations when that standard \nis before the U.S. Supreme Court. Why do the EPA and the State expend \nresources giving communities a black eye by designating them \nnonattainment areas when the entire ability to designate may be \nrepealed by the Supreme Court? The EPA would be allowed, under this \nlegislation, to move forward when the Supreme Court acts but no later \nthan June 2001.\n  Do not blacklist communities before there is a statutory \nauthorization. The National Association of Counties has said this \nprocess will brand hundreds of new counties across the country clean \nair violators resulting in lost jobs and lost economic opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the Boxer amendment on arsenic \nin drinking water, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  This amendment is not needed, and its adoption will effectively kill \nthis bill.\n  Let me be clear about what we did.\n  In our negotiations with the House, bill language was added that \nallows EPA to take until June 22, 2001 to issue a final rule setting \nthe allowable level of arsenic in drinking water.\n  EPA remains free to issue the final rule anytime up to June 22, 2001.\n  This provision was carefully negotiated with the administration.\n  It does not prevent, prohibit or restrict EPA's ability to issue a \nfinal rule for arsenic in drinking water.\n  Since EPA missed the deadline for proposal of this rule, this \nextension from the current January 1, 2001 statutory deadline would \nallow EPA the same length of time--12 months--to consider public \ncomments as contemplated in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n1996.\n  This provision is fully consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Our provision maintains all of the protections for public health and \nsafety.\n  If it didn't, I would not support it.\n  This is not a debate about arsenic in drinking water.\n  We all agree that arsenic in drinking water should be reduced or \neliminated consistent with science based public health standards.\n  This is a disagreement over process, not substance.\n  Let me be very clear, the language contained in the VA/HUD bill is \npermissive and does not prevent EPA from issuing the regulation earlier \nthan June 2001 if EPA is prepared to promulgate the final rule.\n  Also, public interest groups would still be allowed to file suit next \nJune if EPA misses the revised deadline--just as they can now.\n  No one's rights or privileges have been taken away.\n  Our provision on arsenic simply moves a date. It poses no threat to \npublic health or the environment.\n  It is fully consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act, and it \nmaintains EPA's full authority.\n  I point out to my colleagues that this bill contains $825 million for \nthe safe drinking water revolving loan program.\n  This is EPA's main program to upgrade and improve our Nation's public \ndrinking water systems.\n  Overall, our bill provides $3.6 billion for all clean water \nprograms--a $200 million increase over last year and, over $700 million \nmore than the President's request.\n  If the Boxer amendment is adopted, it will kill this bill and \njeopardize the funding increases for our clean water programs.\n  If this bill dies, there is no guarantee that we will be able to \nmaintain our current level of funding.\n  The administration supports our provision, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the Boxer amendment on ozone nonattainment \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  This amendment is not needed and should it pass, it will effectively \nkill this bill.\n  The administration supports the provision in our bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it and vote against this amendment.\n  Let me be clear about what the ozone nonattainment provision in the \nVA/HUD bill does.\n  The provision prohibits EPA from issuing new ozone nonattainment \ndesignations until June 15, 2001, or until the Supreme Court issues its \nruling in this matter, whichever comes first.\n  The administration was involved in the negotiations over this \nprovision and they support it.\n  I believe this provision is a matter of common sense. It makes no \nsense to issue new nonattainment designations, just to have the Supreme \nCourt invalidate them.\n  That will do nothing more than confuse State and local governments \nand undercut EPA's authority and credibility.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues, that during our negotiations \nwith the House, the language was modified to allow final designations \nto occur as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the ozone standard \ncase, rather than waiting until June 15, 2001.\n  Depending on the Supreme Court's decision, this would potentially \nallow EPA to proceed with final designations several months earlier \nthan under the original language.\n  This provision does not weaken the Clean Air Act, it does not \nthreaten the Clean Air Act and, it does not undercut EPA's authority.\n  Our bill language does not preclude EPA from taking preparatory steps \nleading up to the final designations.\n  After the final designations are made, States have 3 years before \nthey have to begin implementing their plans for achieving the new \nstandard.\n  The additional time provided by this bill language, being tied to the \nSupreme Court process, minimizes any delay in moving forward with any \nclean air plans and acknowledges the uncertainty created by the ongoing \nlitigation.\n  Our bill provides $209 million for State air assistance grants to \nhelp states meet Clean Air Act requirements.\n  If the Boxer amendment passes, the VA/HUD bill will be killed and \nfunding levels that it contains will be in jeopardy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment and support \nthe administration.\n  Mr. President, in summary, I oppose the Boxer amendments both on the \nissue of substance and procedure. No. 1, everybody complains about the \nprocess. Nobody complained about it more than Bond and Mikulski. We \nwanted to bring our bill to the floor, have a vote by the Senate, and \ngo into a conference that was open and public. We were denied that.\n  Because we were worried about the homeless, because we were worried \nabout veterans, because we were worried about the environment, we \npressed on in a quasi-conference. Bond and Mikulski were united to \ndelete the riders, but we lost. The House would not yield.\n  We then went to a fallback position because, again, we are worried \nabout the homeless; we are worried about the veterans; we are worried \nabout the environment and the National Service Corps, and all that is \nin this bill. When we negotiated, I invited into the room OMB--with the \nconcurrence of my Republican colleagues--who brought in\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\nthe Council on Environmental Quality. The President's chief adviser on \nthe environment was on the phone with the legal counsel at EPA. We did \nnot make this up.\n  I thought I was proceeding on safe grounds because of the advice I \nreceived from the Council on Environmental Quality. I say to my \nDemocratic colleagues: Do you believe in a letter from 21 groups or do \nyou believe in President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality? \nThe choice is there. Do you believe the advocacy analysis or President \nClinton's analysis? I go with President Clinton because I believe there \nis a track record on protecting the environment.\n  What about arsenic? It does not shackle anybody. It delays it by 6 \nmonths. Under the current law, EPA must give the regs by January 2001. \nThey can issue them at any time up to 2001. EPA retains its authority \nand its flexibility to issue the regs any time, but it removes the old \ndeadline. Why do we do this? So small rural communities can have time \nto get EPA information, cost, and other things they are going to need \nto comply.\n  Let's go to the ozone. That court case is before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. It is not going through some small court. It is in \nthe Supreme Court. They are going to decide it in June. The Court term \nends in June. This language will no longer apply once the Court issues \nits ruling. Also, the language becomes moot in 2001.\n  Why was this language added? To prevent EPA from making new \nattainment designations and then have the Supreme Court invalidate \nthem. We are saying, let the Court act and move on. At the same time, \nEPA is allowed to go on with its own planning process. Once the Supreme \nCourt acts, EPA is good to go.\n  We are not shackling anybody. We are not stymying anybody. I believe \nin each of these instances there is flexibility to meet the compelling \nneeds of public health. If they did not have that, I would not have \nsupported it. If President Clinton's own team did not tell me it was OK \nto do this, I would not have done it.\n  I stand on the advice we were given, and I believe the advice is \naccurate, responsible, and reliable. I urge my colleagues to defeat the \nBoxer amendments.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland. I yield \n3 minutes to the junior Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski. \nAs chairman of the Fisheries, Wildlife and Drinking Water Subcommittee, \nI rise today in strong opposition to the amendment to prevent the EPA \nfrom having the time necessary to produce a proper arsenic drinking \nwater rule based on the available science. It is important to note that \nin 1996 this Congress directed the EPA to adopt a specific schedule to \npropose an arsenic standard to allow for a full year of public review \nand comments by scientific experts and then to implement a rule after \ntaking into consideration those comments.\n  That is what is at stake. It is important to follow up on what \nSenators Bond and Mikulski have said about what this amendment really \ndoes. It has been characterized as stopping the EPA from protecting us \nfrom arsenic problems.\n  The reality is that all this amendment does is give the EPA up to an \nadditional 6 months to complete its work. In fact, I am quite surprised \nto see this amendment today because the administration itself has said \nthey do not have the ability to meet the statutory deadline, and they \nneed this extra time to make sure the rule they adopt is scientifically \njustified and does not cause the immense damage to local small \ncommunities in rural areas that is of concern.\n  We have held hearings on this issue in our subcommittee, and witness \nafter witness has raised questions about whether the science is there \nto justify the direction in which the EPA is going. The EPA has \nacknowledged these questions. The EPA has said it needs time to further \nreview the science, and the EPA has said it will take that time if we \ngive it to them to do a good rule that will protect the country and yet \nnot do damage to small communities in rural areas.\n  It is also important to note that this amendment does not stop the \nEPA from acting at any time the EPA deems it is ready to act. If the \nEPA says it has the process finalized, it has the science understood \nand is ready to proceed, they can proceed tomorrow, they can proceed in \nNovember or December or January when the statutory deadline exists. \nAgain, the EPA has told us they are not ready to do so and that they \nneed this extra time. We believe they need the extra time because of \nthe impending damage that could be caused to local communities across \nthis country.\n  As Senator Bond has said, there are communities and individual \nfamilies who will see their water bills go up by hundreds of dollars. \nThere are communities that probably will have to go off their systems \nbecause of this. The potential damage if we do not give the EPA the \ntime to act properly and to review the comments is immense, and that is \nwhy I must oppose this amendment. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I reserve the time that has been allocated \nto various Members. I now allocate 3 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman of my subcommittee for \nyielding.\n  I say to the Senator from California, her amendment is a perfect \nexample of no good deed goes unpunished. I say that to the Senator from \nCalifornia for this very simple reason. This language has been worked \nout with all of the parties, and all of the staffs, with the \nadministration, and with the EPA. While they do not like it, they \nunderstand their science, and where they are does not justify, at this \ntime, the kind of regulation they are attempting to bring down.\n\n  From the State of the Senator from California, let me read from the \nIndian Wells Valley Water District. This is a water district of 10 to \n12 wells, wells that, meeting the current standard proposed by EPA, \nwould cost this water district $1 million per year--a 60- to 70-percent \ncost increase in their operations.\n  What happens when Government goes silly or crazy based on science \nthey\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nhave not substantiated, in highly mineralized areas, where arsenic is \npresent in water supplies, is that they drive up costs, and ultimately \nthey collapse these little water districts and everybody goes out and \ndrills their own wells to supply their own household water and then an \neven greater problem exists.\n  We are talking about cost per speculative cancer case--cost per \nspeculative cancer case.\n  If the amendment of the Senator from California prevails, that cost \nper speculative cancer case goes to $5 million per speculative case.\n  I do not think that is good policy. I know the science isn't there \nyet to justify it because the word ``speculative'' is the word EPA uses \nin suggesting these dramatic reductions in arsenic levels.\n  I do not want to destroy rural water systems. Neither does this \nsubcommittee. My colleague from Idaho spoke very clearly about the real \nlive impact if this amendment were to prevail. Across this country, \nsmall independent water districts cannot nor could not comply without a \ncost of several hundred dollars more per month added to the cost of a \nwater bill.\n  This is not good policy. I do not even think it is good politics.\n  Let me repeat: No good deed will go unpunished according to this \namendment because we have been working collectively together to solve \nthis problem, recognizing the phenomenal importance of the water \nquality to all citizens in this country.\n  Energy and Water, as an authorizing committee, has acted responsibly. \nWhile the ranking member might suggest that staff or they were not \nconsulted, that is simply not true. They were thoroughly involved and \nconsulted on this issue. This is a compromise. It does not shut down \nthe process, as has clearly been spoken to by my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Crapo. So I hope the Senate will recognize that.\n  Let us not rush to judgment, nor let us not get into the speculative \nbusiness of driving up costs of water and, therefore, allowing people \nto go out and drill their own wells and even create a more dangerous \nwater structure for small rural communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of debate on the two amendments under the previous order, I \nbe permitted to speak on the VA-HUD bill for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we reserve the remainder of our time on \nthese amendments. I believe the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee is on his way over.\n  What time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 2 minutes, and \nthe Senator from California has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. We reserve our time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleagues \ndirectly on a number of points that they made. These two riders should \nbe deleted. It is bad process. I think that has been spoken to a number \nof times. And it is really bad policy. I think that has been spoken to \nas well.\n  I say to my dearest friend, Senator Mikulski, who has worked so hard \non this bill--and it means everything to her--how much I support her \nbill but for these riders. I want to tell her how I feel.\n  I do not think that all wisdom resides in Washington. I think I am \nquoting the Republican candidate for President. I do think these 21 \ngroups are phenomenal. I do trust them. The National Resources Defense \nCouncil, the Sierra Club--maybe they do not always agree with every one \nof us, but they spend their lives on these issues. I do respect them. \nAnd I do think that they can. I am really glad it looks as if they are \ngoing to count these votes as an important vote on their scorecard.\n  But I do want to say if CEQ were in the room and some others from the \nadministration--I know it to be fact, and it is true --I just do not \nhappen to agree with them. I will tell you who was not in the room, who \nwas not even given the courtesy of a phone call, Senator Max Baucus, \nwho is the ranking member on Environment and Public Works. I will tell \nyou who else was not in the room, Senator Moynihan, who supports my \ndredging amendment. I think a phone call from the administration, if \nyou will, to those folks would have been in order to find out how we \nfeel about these anti-environmented riders. So we are very \ndisappointed.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Craig, who has left the floor, he calls \nit ``silly science'' to talk about a lower standard for arsenic. Here \nis the silly science. I have to tell you, taxpayers pay the National \nAcademy of Sciences to produce this study on arsenic in drinking water. \nThis isn't silly science. This is what they said:\n\n       This outdated standard does not achieve EPA's goal for \n     public health protection and, therefore, requires revision as \n     promptly as possible.\n\n  So what did we do? We did the opposite. We delayed the date.\n  The Senator mentioned a water district in California. That is why we \nhave a waiver in the Safe Drinking Water Act, for those small \ncommunities, a waiver so they will not have hardship. That is why we \nhave a State revolving fund which, by the way, is funded in this bill. \nIt needs more attention. It needs more help.\n  But I have to say, again--and call me as old-fashioned as you want; \nmaybe it is because when I was a kid I saw ``Arsenic and Old Lace''--\nbut I can tell you right now, the science is clear. It is not silly; it \nis not foolish. This is very dangerous. We have to do something about \nit.\n  To say this is a rush to judgment when we have been having hearings \non the standard since the 1980s, we all know what it is about. It is \nabout a delay. It is the hope that the new administration may not be as \ntough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I would sum up this way. We have a gag order in front \nof us in the rider that deals with EPA not being allowed to tell people \nthey live in a dirty air district. It is for people to know that \nexposure to smog decreases lung function. It hurts our children with \nasthma, and it leads to emergency room visits. The courts have said \nclearly--and I have a direct quotation from the court--the court said: \nEPA has the right to tell people the truth about the quality of their \nair. This rider overturns that court decision.\n  I hope we will have strong support for this amendment.\n  I thank my friends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from New Hampshire \nif he is ready to speak?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, just to correct the record, the staff of the \nranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee was \nconsulted, was informed of this. This was not done without advice to \nthem. That was just incorrect.\n  I now yield the remaining time on this side to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 1 minute 39 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is not much time to try to make my \npoints here. But, look, this is one of those situations where you have \nan amendment, part of which I support and part of which I do not, which \nmeans I have to oppose it.\n  The clean air provisions that the Senator from California has \noutlined I can support. But it is unfortunate that I have to be here \ntoday, as the chairman of the committee, to choose to do something that \nthis body chose to do 4 years ago in the Safe Drinking Water Act \namendment.\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\n  It is worse that the only groups objecting to this language in VA-HUD \nare doing so because they stand to gain attorney's fees. I support the \nunderlying managers' amendment by the Senator from Missouri. We are \ngoing to see wasteful litigation here, and it is wrong.\n\n  To put this in context would take more time than I have, but we all \nagree the standard on this should be reviewed. This is not a discussion \nabout the standard. The arsenic standard needs to be reviewed. But due \nto the complexity and science that was needed to develop the standard, \nthe Congress very clearly dictated a timeframe.\n  Congress directed EPA to propose a rule on January 1, 2000, and to \nfinalize the rule on January 1, 2001. They made it clear we wanted to \nprovide one year from the date of publication of a draft rule to \npublication of a final rule. EPA cannot meet this requirement right \nnow, and we need to get this science. We need to draw all this in. That \nis what the managers' amendment allows for.\n  To go to litigation now means we will waste millions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money on litigation for no reason, and they are still not \ngoing to be able to meet the standard in spite of the litigation. It is \nabsolutely ridiculous.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support Senator Bond and the managers' \namendment on this issue.\n  To reiterate, I come today to talk about Senator Boxer's amendment to \nthe VA HUD appropriations bill. Unfortunately, Senator Boxer has put \ntwo issues into her amendment. I support one and strongly object to the \nother. Due to that strong objection I will vote against this amendment.\n  On the arsenic provision, it is very unfortunate that I need to come \ndown here today to defend what this body chose to do four years ago in \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. It is even worse that the only \ngroups objecting to this language in the VA HUD appropriation bill are \ndoing so because they stand to gain attorneys fees.\n  The provision on arsenic in the VA-HUD Appropriations bill does one \nthing: preserves the original intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of 1996. While Senator Boxer's amendment does one thing--\npromotes wasteful litigation.\n  To put this into context let me explain the history and reality of \nthe situation. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 clearly \noutlined a need to review the standard for arsenic. We all agree the \nstandard needs to be reviewed. This is NOT a discussion about the \nstandard. I repeat, the arsenic standard needs to be reviewed.\n  However, due to the complexity and science that was needed to develop \nthe standard, we the Congress, very clearly dictated the time frame for \ndeveloping this rule. Congress directed EPA to propose a rule on \nJanuary 1, 2000 and to finalize the rule on January 1, 2001.\n  The Congress also made it very clear that we wanted to provide one \nyear from date of publication of a draft rule to publication of a final \nrule. The reason was to allow sufficient time for public comment and \nEPA review to finalize this very complex issue. Thus, the Congress \nstated that the final rule should be published on January 1, 2001, one \nyear after the publication of the draft rule.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA missed the January 1, 2000 deadline to publish \nthe draft rule by six months. There may be very good reasons for why \nEPA missed this deadline, but the fact is EPA missed the statutory \ndeadline for publication by six months.\n  EPA provided 90 days to comment on the proposed rule, however it is \nmy understanding that EPA will be having an additional comment period \non information that became available after the original draft rule was \npublished. So basically, we are not done with the public comment period \nEPA, less than three months from the statutory deadline to publish the \nfinal rule has not even received all the public comments.\n  What do these dates and missed deadlines mean? They mean, and EPA \nwill agree with me on this, that there is no way that EPA will meet the \nJanuary 1, 2001 statutory deadline to publish this final rule. In fact, \nEPA will probably not publish the final rule until late spring. I \nsupport EPA taking the time to consider all the stakeholders comments \nand the very complex information they have received. I support the \noriginal intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments to provide \none year to finalize this rule. Especially, in light of the controversy \nthis rule has brought on by a host of very credible institutions like \nthe EPA Science Advisory Board that questions the EPA proposal. But \nthat is not what we are down here today to talk about.\n  What happens unfortunately, is a host of groups will sue EPA on \nJanuary 2, 2001 for not publishing the final rule. Everyone knows that \nEPA will miss this deadline, YET, these organizations will waste \neveryone's time and tax payer's money by bringing an unnecessary \nlawsuit. So what am I down here to discuss today? I am here to discuss: \nunnecessary attorney's fees, waste of tax payer dollars, and place a \nburden on the judicial branch.\n  To avoid those three issues, I support the arsenic provision in the \nVA-HUD Appropriations Bill. This provision would extend the deadline \nfor finalization of the arsenic rule to no later than June 22, 2001. \nThis provides the EPA one year to finalize the rule--exactly the same \ntime frame as the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments.\n\n  Why is this needed? Because this is a complex rule and the Congress \nrealized that when they required EPA to take one year to finalize the \nrule. But just as important: we the Congress can make sure tax payers \ndollars are not wastefully spent on unnecessary judicial proceeding and \nattorney's fees.\n  Our constituents should not have to pay the price for the EPA's \nfailure to follow the mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Amendments of \n1996. This extension will have no impact on human health because it is \ncompletely consistent with EPA's time frame for finalizing the rule.\n  I am sure that is why the White House and the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality is not opposing this language.\n  Senator Boxer's amendment does absolutely nothing to protect human \nhealth. It only protects those environmental groups that want \nlitigation will benefit. This is unfortunate because the litigation \nwill produce the exact same outcome as this provision. However the \nlitigation has consequences, it will produce: unnecessary attorneys \nfees, an unnecessary burden on the judiciary, an unnecessary burden on \nthe EPA, and taxpayer dollars funding all of this. I cannot stand here \nand encourage unnecessary litigation. But I can proudly support the \noriginal intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act and allow EPA to take \nappropriate time to consider all the comments and information in \nproposing a final rule.\n  Now switching to the Clean Air Act issue. The motion to strike also \ncontains language that touches on another one of those complicated \nClean Air Act issues. I believe that this is exactly the type of thing \nthat must be addressed by the committee of jurisdiction rather than \nthrough a rider.\n  Last year the Environment and Public Works Committee first addressed \nthe issue of what limits were needed on the implementation of these air \nquality standards while the court was reviewing them. At that time, the \ncommittee was considering a bill to improve the transportation \nconformity provisions of the Clean Air Act. Senator Inhofe offered an \namendment to deal with this matter and the amendment was adopted.\n  Even as the Inhofe language was accepted, there was discussion \nregarding how it might be improved prior to floor consideration. During \nthe past few months, members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and especially Senator Inhofe and Senator Baucus, worked \nhard to develop language that is now broadly supported--and included in \nthis bill. The bill also contains controversial language on the same \nissue that came from a House appropriations bill and was not considered \nby the Environment and Public Works Committee. In fact, no authorizing \ncommittee in either body dealt with this language.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that we are borrowing trouble by taking \nthe House language because the language Senator Inhofe proposed speaks \nto precisely the same problem as the language Senator Boxer seeks to \nstrike. We do not need both.\n  Let me briefly address the substance of the issue. As many Members \nknow, the Supreme Court is currently reviewing the EPA's recently \nestablished air\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nquality standards for smog and soot, ozone and particulate matter.\n  At the same time, implementation of the standards is proceeding. The \nEPA is required by law to identify areas that violate the standards, \neven though the court might throw the standards out. More importantly, \ndesignating areas as violating the standards triggers automatic \nrequirements under the Clean Air Act. These include restrictions on \nhighway construction and expanding or building new facilities that \nwould emit air pollutants.\n  The problem we are trying to solve is that these requirements may be \ntriggered and then the standards could be overturned, leading to \nplanning chaos for many states. Senator Inhofe's language would delay \nthe effective date of the automatic requirements under the Clean Air \nAct to allow time for the Supreme Court to act. The language from the \nHouse bill that Senator Boxer seeks to strike would bar the use of \nfunds for making determinations about what areas would violate the \nstandards; thus preventing the triggering of the automatic Clean Air \nAct requirements.\n  So we have two ways of skinning the same cat. Senator Inhofe's \napproach has bipartisan support and is the work product of members of \nthis body's authorizing committee. The House language is controversial \nand has not received consideration from any authorizing committee.\n  The House language is controversial because many people believe that \nthe air data collected by the states should be analyzed by the EPA and \nmade public no matter what happens to the standards in the courts. \nAlso, the limit on the use of funds could delay implementation in the \nevent that the Court upholds the standards.\n  I believe that the Senate should recognize and reward the effort that \nSenator Inhofe has made to eliminate unnecessary conflict over this \nissue. I support the language in the bill developed by the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  If the motion by the Senator from California to strike the House \nlanguage was not attached to the arsenic issue, I would support the \nSenator in her motion, and I would encourage the entire Senate to do \nthe same. Because the arsenic matter is the overriding concern for me, \nI must oppose the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized to \noffer a second amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4309\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4309:\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the cleanup of \nriver and ocean waters contaminated with DDT, PCBs, dioxins, metals and \n                         other toxic chemicals)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than one-eighth of all sites listed on the \n     Superfund National Priorities List are river and ocean water \n     sites where sediment is contaminated with PCBs, dioxins, DDT, \n     metals and other toxic chemicals;\n       (2) toxic chemicals like PCBs, dioxins, DDT and metals tend \n     to be less soluble, and more environmentally persistent \n     pollutants;\n       (3) toxic chemicals like PCBs, dioxins, DDT and metals \n     polluting river and ocean sites around the nation may pose \n     threats to public health, safety and the environment.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Environmental Protection Agency should move swiftly \n     to clean up river and ocean sites around the nation that have \n     been contaminated with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metals and other \n     toxic chemicals in order to protect the public health, safety \n     and the environment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wanted the amendment read because I \nthink it is a pretty clear statement of what we ought to be doing; that \nis, expediting the cleanup of the Superfund sites.\n  To respond to Senator Bond, the staff of Senator Baucus has informed \nme that they received one call and they objected to the riders. They \ndon't believe Senator Baucus was ever called personally. We are going \nto check on that because I do want the record clear on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Moynihan, Schumer, and Kerry be \nadded on as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose report language included \nin this conference agreement that will delay the cleanup of waters \ncontaminated with toxic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. We tried to \nwork with my colleagues to change this language. We were unable to be \nsuccessful.\n  The language will remain in because you can't strike report language, \nbut we have a sense of the Senate that is very clear. Basically the \noperative language, which was just read by the clerk, is:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency should move swiftly to clean up river and \n     ocean sites around the nation that have been contaminated \n     with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metals and other toxic chemicals in \n     order to protect public health, safety and the environment.\n\n  The report language included in this bill--remember, this is an \nappropriations bill--prohibits the EPA from cleaning up river and ocean \nsites that are contaminated with these horrible pollutants until the \nNational Academy of Sciences completes a study or until June of 2000, \nwhichever comes first. That isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is, \nwe believe this language opens up a whole new loophole, which is really \ngoing to mean we are going to have many more court suits. I will get to \nthat in a minute.\n  We think this language could delay the cleanup of at least six \nSuperfund sites nationwide. One of them happens to be in California. \nThe report language that is extremely troubling, which we were unable \nto remove, requires EPA to ``properly consider the results of the NAS \nstudy'' before moving forward on the cleanup of these sites. Anyone who \nknows anything about litigation knows a lawyer will have a field day \nwith the phrase ``properly considered.''\n\n  What does that mean? You must properly consider before you move ahead \nwith a cleanup? You could have a whole year discussing what that means, \nand that is exactly what the polluters are going to do. They are going \nto haul this Government into court just to try to get out of their \nresponsibility. It will give polluters a hook to get into court and to \nlitigate.\n  I want to talk about a site off the Santa Monica Bay, the Montrose \nsite.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The Montrose Chemical Corporation holds the distinction of being the \nlargest producer of DDT in the world. That is not a great distinction \nsince we know what a poison DDT is.\n  It discharges tons of DDT through storm sewers into the ocean off the \nPalos Verdes peninsula, and 100 tons of it sits on the ocean floor \nthere.\n  DDT is classified as a probable human carcinogen. It is thought to \nhave severe liver and neurological impacts, and it has also recently \nbeen identified as a chemical which may promote breast cancer.\n  We know DDT is causing harm to the ocean, i.e. Santa Monica Bay, \nbecause the DDT goes up through the food chain where it reaches the \nbald eagles. Of course, we know those bald eagles were brought to the \nbrink of extinction by DDT, and we know it causes the eagle eggs to \nthin and to fail to successfully hatch. EPA estimates it will cost $150 \nmillion to restore the ocean where that dump is.\n  The report language, in our strong opinion, with legal authorities \nacross this country, tells us that it would prohibit the EPA from \ncleaning up this site until the NAS report comes out. And then even \nafter that, Montrose will go back into court. Mind you, they have \nalready spent $50 million fighting the cleanup. Their position is: Let \nthe DDT just sit there. Don't cap it off. Don't do anything. In the \nmeantime, it is poisoning the environment there.\n  I don't understand why we do these things. When I talk to my \nconstituents, their eyes roll. Arsenic, DDT, PCBs, these are not good \nthings. If we could agree on one thing around here, it would be to get \nrid of them. We do\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\neverything we can to help people who are good actors to clean up their \nact, if they made a mistake. We have a State revolving fund.\n  It stuns me that in this century we are still arguing over cleaning \nup arsenic out of the water, cleaning up DDT that is harming wildlife.\n  As to this argument by Montrose that they should do nothing, imagine \nhow strongly they feel. They have spent $50 million in order to do \nnothing. Why didn't they spend the $50 million cleaning up the site, \nand we would be rid of the DDT; we wouldn't have this poison moving up \nthe food chain.\n  What we hope to achieve--and we hope the managers will support this--\nis a very simple sense-of-the-Congress amendment. It is so clear. What \nwe say is: Look, we can't get your language out of the report. We \nunderstand you don't want to make changes because you don't want to go \nback to conference. All we are saying is, let's stand firm together. \nLet us pass the sense of the Congress. I will reiterate it, and then I \nwill save my 5 minutes. I am hopeful others will come to the floor.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency should move swiftly to clean up river and \n     ocean sites around the nation that have been contaminated \n     with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metals and other toxic chemicals in \n     order to protect health, safety and the environment.\n  Now, my colleagues say nothing in this bill would harm that. I hope, \ntherefore, they will support this amendment. I think it is very \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, I will take an additional 30 seconds to say Senator \nLevin wants to be added as a cosponsor. Senator Baucus was not \npersonally consulted by anyone on this matter. That is clearing up the \nrecord, straight from Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am sorry we have to get into this little \nbattle over who said what and who said what, when where, and why. Let \nit be clear that we on both sides made our best efforts to assure that \neveryone was advised. Twice, Mr. Tom Sliter, a staffer on EPW, was \nnotified and discussed this with my assistant, Ms. Apostolou. He also, \nI understand, participated in a briefing conducted by Mr. Carliner of \nthe minority staff.\n  Not everybody agreed with all of those things, and we never said that \nwe had 100-percent agreement. We don't get 100-percent agreement, but \nwe do extend the courtesy to all of the Members who are interested to \nlet them know what we are doing and give them an opportunity. I am \nsorry to get into this, but when it was said that we did this without \nnotification in an attempt to hide this, that is absolutely wrong. That \nis an unfortunate and unfair slam at our staff. I do not intend to let \nit stand.\n  The next point I will make, just to call it to the attention of my \ncolleague from California, is we have been advised that no California \nsites would be affected. EPA has indicated they will be sending a \nletter to assure the Senator that no California sites would be affected \nby the proposed managers' amendment, or the language in the statement \nof managers.\n  Let me say that while, technically, this issue is not before us at \nthis time, we do intend to include a statement which has been carefully \nworked out at painstaking meetings that Senator Mikulski and I had, \nalong with our House counterparts, with OMB Director Jack Lew and \nGeorge Frampton, CEQ Director. This language will be included to \naddress the concerns raised by EPA about House report language on this \nissue.\n\n  The report language simply requires EPA to take into consideration a \nNational Academy of Sciences study on contaminated sediments, which has \nbeen worked on for the past several years and is expected within the \nnext 3 months, before dredging or invasive remediation actions at sites \nwhere a plan has not been adopted by October 1, 2000, or where dredging \nhas not already occurred.\n  Exceptions are provided for voluntary agreements and urgent cases \nwhere there is significant threat to public health. Furthermore, EPA is \nnot prohibited from proposing draft remediation plans involving \ndredging or invasive remediation technologies.\n  In view of the time, effort, and resources that have gone into \nexamining the efficacy of dredging contaminated sediments, it would \ntruly be a shame not to consider the best science available before \ngoing forward. This is not going to result in undue delays, but it will \nresult in an informed process.\n  Dredging is very controversial and it is very costly. What do you do \nwith the dredge material if you dig up material that is contaminated? \nWhere do you put it? I can tell you that the answer will be NIMBY--not \nin my backyard. That is the first thing everybody will say. ``Can't you \nfind a better or safer place to put it?\"\n  Also, does dredging cause more harm, potentially, to the health and \nenvironment than leaving the contaminated sediments in place? When you \nstir it up and dig into the contaminated sediments, do you spread more \nout and do you get more in the water supply or in the air? These are \nthings that scientists ought to tell us. The National Academy of \nSciences is working on it. What would you do with thousands of \ntruckloads of dredge material if you dredged it up and the National \nAcademy of Sciences says you should have left it in place?\n  Well, it is important that we act on science around this place. I \nknow there are some groups that love to write letters and have their \nown agenda and say that we need to move forward. I believe most people \nin this body would agree that getting a peer-reviewed study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences before we engage upon a massive and \npotential danger-causing activity--dredging up sediments, or other \ninvasive remedies--makes sense. For that reason, I believe that \ncarefully crafted language, which was agreed on by the OMB Director and \nthe CEQ Director, is a far preferable resolution of this very serious \nquestion. Let's take the radical step of waiting to rely on the \nscience.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Maryland such time as she \nmay require.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains for the opponents \nto the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Chair inform me when I have \ntaken 4 minutes in the event that others also wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Chair will do so.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Boxer \namendment and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  This amendment will have to be disposed of by the House. It will not \nbe accepted by the House and therefore will kill this bill.\n  I would like to explain to my colleagues how our bill addresses the \nissue of contaminated sediments, why I am opposed to the Boxer \namendment and, why the administration is opposed to the Boxer \namendment.\n  The Boxer amendment is not necessary and its passage would \neffectively kill this bill.\n  Let me explain what we do in our bill.\n  The final version of the VA/HUD bill will contain report language in \nthe statement of the managers that prevents EPA from dredging any \ncontaminated site that does not have an approved plan in place by \nOctober 1, 2000 until the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, has \ncompleted its study on this issue and EPA has reviewed it.\n  This language sunsets on June 30, 2001. The NAS is expected to \nrelease its report in December. With an EPA review, the delay would \nlast probably no more than 120 days.\n  We have included some exceptions to this language that are very \nimportant and I want to outline them for my colleagues.\n  First, if a site has an approved dredging plan in place by October 1, \n2000, the language does not apply.\n  Second, if dredging or dredging activity is already occurring at a \nsite, the language does not apply.\n  Third, if a site has a voluntary agreement in place with a \npotentially responsible party, the language does not apply.\n  Fourth, if EPA determines that a site poses a threat to public \nhealth, the language does not apply.\n  These exceptions are very important and were carefully negotiated \nwith the administration.\n  This was no small victory for us.\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n  The House passed VA/HUD bill included report language that would have \ndirected EPA not to initiate or order dredging or other invasive \nremediation technologies, until the NAS report was complete and \nrequired that the results be incorporated into the EPA decision making \nprocesses.\n  This more extreme language would have effectively frozen work at \naffected sites for an indefinite period of time.\n  During our negotiations with the House, we successfully modified the \nprovision to remove the extreme language.\n  The report language that will be incorporated into the final version \nof the VA/HUD bill still leaves EPA with some discretion and does not \nmandate any solutions.\n  Our language also allows EPA to take comment on proposed remedial \nactions such as that for cleanup of the Hudson River.\n   Our language would also allow all cleanup plans to be finalized by a \ndate certain--June 30, 2001--even if the NAS report has not been \ncompleted in a timely manner.\n  The NAS is expected to use their final report, no later than January \n1, 2001, allowing the report to be properly considered by EPA while \nsites without final plans work on their drafts.\n  Mr. President, the administration supports our language and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  I wish to also respond to my colleague and friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, by saying this: No. 1, neither Senator Bond nor I wanted \nthe riders. The House insisted on the riders. So we attempted to remove \nthe draconian substance of the riders and put in more procedural \nissues, more procedural safeguards. The Senator thinks we wimped out. \nWe think we had a victory because of the draconian aspect. We fought \noff the dragons.\n  Also, I want to be clear to my colleagues, we are in a very unusual \nparliamentary procedure. If we pass this bill without any amendments, \nit will go immediately to the House and can go through a process of \nratification and will be done. If any of these amendments pass, we will \nhave to go into a parliamentary situation where the House will not \naccept this and, therefore, the bill will be dead. So I just lay that \nout for everyone to take into consideration.\n  So the funds for EPA, which are quite robust--matching, in many \ninstances, the President's request--housing, as well as veterans, \nscience and technology, and other consumer protection agencies such as \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission--I believe will be jeopardized.\n  Having said that, I don't want to make my argument on jeopardizing \nthe bill. I want to address the concerns that my conscientious \ncolleague has raised about jeopardizing the environment.\n  This bill prevents EPA from dredging at any site that does not have \nan approved dredging plan by October 1 until the National Academy of \nSciences has completed its study and EPA has reviewed it. In the \narsenic ozone debate we heard, the National Academy of Sciences \nelevated it to an icon status that said don't do anything on this rider \nbecause of what the National Academy of Sciences says. By the way, I \nthink the Senator from California and I would agree that we do need the \nNational Academy of Sciences. On the dredging issue, what we are saying \nis that the dredging sites cannot move ahead until the National Academy \nhas completed its study and EPA has looked at it. Guess when the study \nis going to be done. December 2000 or January 2001. Any delay will be \nmicro--90 to 120 days. Guess what. I say to my colleagues in the \nSenate, this is not permanent. It only takes this language to June 30, \n2001.\n  This language has a sunset provision of June 30, 2001.\n  What are these exceptions? The main one is that if EPA believes any \nsite poses a threat to public health, the language does not apply.\n  Let me repeat to anyone who thinks wisdom lies in Washington, with 21 \nadvocacy groups, that if EPA believes the site poses a threat to public \nhealth, this language does not apply.\n  Also, if the site has a voluntary agreement in place, it doesn't \napply. If dredging is already occurring at a site, the language does \nnot apply. If you have your plan approved by October 1, the language \ndoes not apply.\n  We have so many ``doesn't applys'' here that I don't think the \narguments made by the proponents of this amendment apply really in any \nway that has validity or attraction.\n  If you are worried about public health--I salute you for it--\nremember, it would not apply.\n  I join with my colleagues to say let the National Academy of Sciences \ncomplete its work. Let the EPA review it. Then it can move forth on all \nof this. If there is a delay, it would be 90 to 120 days.\n  That is basically what the argument is.\n  I hope the amendment offered by my colleague from California will be \ndefeated.\n  How much time did I consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes ten seconds remain.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve the right for either Senator Bond or me to do \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Sense of the \nCongress amendment on contaminated sediments offered by the Senator \nfrom California (Mrs. Boxer). I do so because I have concerns about the \nimplications that the report language accompanying this bill may have \nfor the remediation and restoration of the Fox River in my home state \nof Wisconsin.\n  My staff has tried repeatedly over the last several days to clarify \nthe report language with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and \nhas been unable to do so. I had wanted a letter from the EPA explaining \nthe impact of this language on the Fox clean-up. In fact, my office was \ntold by the Office of General Counsel that the EPA could not state with \ncertainty the effects of this language on the Fox River, because it was \none of the clean-ups that they had identified which might be delayed by \nthis report language. This leaves me with concern that the next few \nactions Wisconsin is about to take to clean up the Fox River may be \ndelayed, and my concern is shared by the Wisconsin Department of \nNatural Resources.\n  As members of this body know, the Senate's version of the VA-HUD bill \ndid not contain any report language on sediments. Only the version \nwhich passed the other body contained report language on this issue, \nand this language is retained and modified in the report accompanying \nthis bill. Therefore, I also raise concerns, Mr. President, because my \nWisconsin colleague in the House (Mr. Green), who represents the Fox \nValley, tried to clarify the House report language in a floor colloquy \nwhen the measure was considered in the House of Representatives. This \nbill before us now changes the very language my colleague from \nWisconsin specifically tried to clarify, and adds new and explicit time \nlines which do not mesh with the upcoming actions that will be taken to \nclean up the Fox River. As a Wisconsin Senator, I have no choice but to \ntry to enhance the understanding of what this language would do, and I \nbelieve that the amendment by the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nmakes it clear that Congress intends the EPA to move swiftly to clean \nup contaminated river and ocean sites.\n  I want to explain the status of the Fox River clean-up. The Fox River \nis currently not a National Priority List (NPL) site, commonly known as \nSuperfund site. Nonetheless, the Wisconsin Department of Natural \nResources (WDNR) is working to develop a final Remedial Investigation \nand Feasibility Study (RIFS) and is expected to release that study in \nlate December, 2000 or early January, 2001. The Wisconsin DNR intends \nto release the final RIFS jointly with the EPA, and the other trustees \nwhich include: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oneida Tribe of \nWisconsin. A final Record of Decision (ROD) could be reached between \nMarch and early June, 2001.\n  If the National Academy study is not yet complete and ``properly \nconsidered'' by EPA before the final RIFS is issued, as the Conference \nReport language requires, the report language is unclear about whether \npublic comment can be initiated on the final RIFS. The report language \nsays that public comment can be taken on ``proposed'' or ``draft'' \nremediation plans but is unclear with respect to comment on a\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\nfinal RIFS. Further the language says that ``no plans are to be \nfinalized until June 30, 2001 or until the Agency has properly \nconsidered the National Academy of Sciences report, whichever comes \nfirst.'' Potentially stalling comment on the final RIFS raises \nconcerns, as the final RIFS will finally indicate a preferred \nalternative for cleaning-up the Fox, an alternative which was not \nindicated in the draft RIFS. Interests on all sides of this issue--the \npaper companies that are potentially responsible parties in the clean-\nup, local governments that are concerned about liability, and local \ncitizens who have been waiting to see what will be done to address the \ncontaminants in the river--deserve to know what the preferred \nalternative is and to express their views.\n  Moreover, if the final ROD is issued before June 30, 2001, its \nimplementation could also be delayed by this language. Though some may \nview this as simply a delay of a few weeks, I remind my colleagues that \nWisconsin is a cold weather state. My State needs the certainty of \nbeing able to plan to contract to implement the remedy during the \nsummer and early fall construction season. If not, we risk having to \nput off the clean up for another calendar year due to cold weather \ndelays.\n  Given these uncertainties, I support my colleague from California's \n(Mrs. Boxer) amendment. This report language may have consequences for \nmy state which I simply feel must be addressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. I had not expected to speak on this matter. I came to the \nfloor to speak on the VA-HUD bill as a whole.\n  Let me share a couple of quick observations about these riders.\n  I congratulate my colleague from California for the fight she is \nmaking because it is an important fight as a matter of principle, and \nalso it is a matter of science and common sense. These riders don't \nfind their way into this legislation accidentally. There are powerful \ninterests in the country that made sure these riders were here. We \nconsistently see these attacks on environmental enforcement efforts in \nthe country because there are people who just do not want a change.\n  On the air quality standards and nonattainment designations, the \nAmerican Trucking Association is waiting for litigation with the EPA \nand wants to stop the EPA from keeping accountability with respect to \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  That is what this is about. I have great respect for truckers and \ngreat respect for their efforts across the country. They are important \nto our economy. No one here is going to suggest otherwise. But every \nAmerican has seen what happens at stoplights where they are sitting in \na car that is living up to emission standards and a truck starts out at \nthe stoplight. There is a great plume of black smoke that comes out of \nthat truck. It is all over our highways. We know it. SUVs are \npresenting us with an increased problem because they come in under the \nlight truck exception.\n  The fact is that the air standards of the country are not reaching \nthe levels they ought to reach. The EPA is our chosen entity to enforce \nthe Clean Air Act and to make sure that Americans are not subjected to \npollution and air quality standards that are less than high.\n\n  We are told by the EPA what happens with this delay. There is the \nexposure of some 15,000 premature deaths in the country. Some 350,000 \nmore Americans will suffer asthma as a consequence of the lack of air \nquality standards. That is the risk the Senate will take by allowing \nthis kind of rider. However innocuous it may seem or however people \nmake it sound going forward, there is a diminishment of the capacity of \nthe EPA to enforce the law Congress has already passed to allow \nAmericans to live by the highest air quality standards.\n  With respect to the dredging, I understand where that comes from. We \nhave all been through that struggle in Massachusetts to try to clean up \nthe Husatonic River. We are going to do some dredging there. There is \nnow a struggle about the Hudson River, and other rivers, about whether \nor not those are going to be cleaned up.\n  The fact is the National Academy of Sciences has already provided us \nwith not one but two studies that show dredging is a legitimate and \nimportant mechanism for cleaning up polluted areas. We are trying to do \nthat in the Bedford-Hartford area where we have PCBs. They fear if this \nrider passes, that cleanup may in fact be jeopardized because people \nwill use the excuse to say we don't have to proceed.\n  That is what is at stake. I know it is difficult to pull these bills \ntogether. There are a lot of different interests that have to be \nsatisfied. But the fact is the Senate ought to take a vote on these \nriders. We ought to vote appropriately--that they don't belong in this \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleague for her efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would you let me know when I have 1 minute remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be glad to do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for \nhis eloquent remarks. He is a leader on environmental issues in the \nSenate. It makes me feel really good that he came over.\n  I want to again try to set the record straight. Senator Bond said a \nletter is on its way from the EPA saying the California site is not in \nfact affected by the language in the bill regarding dredging. We have \ncalled them again. We called the general counsel last night. I told my \nfriend from Missouri. They tell us that no such letter is coming.\n  Be that as it may, whether the letter comes or it doesn't come, the \nfact is if it does not affect California--and I hope he is right--I say \nto my friend, if he gets that letter, I will be very grateful. It is a \nbad situation because the language, in fact, we believe will really \nslow down the cleanup of Superfund sites. That is why you have Senators \nMoynihan and Schumer concerned about the Hudson River. That cleanup \nwill be stalled.\n  As my friend, Senator Mikulski, said--she calls me the gentlelady \nfrom California. She is the gentlelady from Maryland. That goes back to \nour House days. Senator Mikulski pointed out that she said these riders \nare less draconian. I believe that. They are less draconian. They are \nstill bad, and they don't belong on their otherwise terrific bill. They \ndo harm.\n\n  My friend points out that it is very clear the language said this \nwill wreck the public health--no delay. It doesn't say ``affect'' the \npublic health or the environment. When you have an effect on the \nenvironment by the fish eating DDT, you do not have to be a rocket \nscientist; if the fish eat DDT, it it is bad for humans. When do you \nprove that? It may not come down the line much longer.\n  I know my friend worked very hard on this. She had people in the room \nwhom she trusted. But, again, I don't believe the administration sought \nout these riders. My friend is right; it was the House Members who did. \nThey simply don't belong here. It would be very simple for us to agree \nto this sense of the Senate. I think it would be helpful because my \nfriends say they don't want to delay these cleanups.\n  I want to make one point about science. Listen very carefully when \npeople stand up here and say it is silly science and we must act on \nscience. The EPA and the National Academy of Sciences acted on science \nwith their new rule on the arsenic standard. Guess what. They are \ncalling this silly science. This is the National Academy of Sciences. \nThey say arsenic is very dangerous.\n  The bottom line is you can't seem to win around here. You get a \nreport done by the National Academy of Sciences, and they say you have \nsilly science; forget about it; throw it away. When you don't have the \nreport, they say you can't act. As my friend pointed out, there have \nbeen many studies done by the National Academy of Sciences on port \ndredging as a way to get rid of these contaminants. We didn't know\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nthey were life threatening and dangerous. We know that now.\n  I hope we will have a good solid vote on these amendments.\n  I thank my colleagues. I retain 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now in the concluding minutes of \nthe debate.\n  First of all, on the three issues raised by the Senator from \nCalifornia, I want to say a couple of things.\n  No. 1, I am very proud of the Senate. When we moved our bill out of \nthe full committee, we had no riders. We were not authorizing on \nappropriations. We had no riders, and we attempted to stand firm. Yes, \nwe did face the dragons of the riders. What we ended up doing was not \neliminating the dragons but we defang them. We defang the riders. We \ntook the teeth out of them so they couldn't snarl up what this \nlegislation is trying to do.\n  I believe the language we have adopted through the committee, through \nthe managers' amendment, does have the riders. They are procedural. We \nacknowledge the flashing yellow light of the Senator from California \nwith her terrible situation in California. We will do everything we can \nto make sure the Senator has that letter. I know it is not a substitute \nfor the amendment. However, we want our colleagues to know the flashing \nyellow lights raised by the proponents are not valid.\n  Remember on the dredging, if the site has been approved by October 1, \n2000, the language doesn't apply. If the dredging is already occurring, \nthe language does not apply. If you have a voluntary agreement, the \nlanguage does not apply. And if the EPA certifies that the site posed a \nthreat to public health, the language does not apply.\n  I recommend the Boxer amendment does not apply to this bill and I \nurge its defeat.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I take 1 minute to say the ranking member \nand I have been advised by EPA the California sites that would be \naffected by the language--and it is the clear understanding of the \nmanagers of the bill in the Senate--are either pilot sites already \nunderway and would not be included or they are sites in which the final \naction would not be ready by the timeframe in which this action is \ndelayed.\n  We have been advised, and it is our understanding, there is no \napplication of this provision. It was intended to be included in the \nstatement of managers on any California site.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds added \nto my remaining 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends for the opportunity for the brief \ndebate. I say to my friends, these are not harmless riders. You can say \nthey will ``defang'' and that is in the eye of the defanger.\n  The bottom line is these are not harmless riders. It is not harmless \nto tell the EPA they are gagged from telling the people in my State and \nevery other State that they live in a dirty air situation. That is what \nthis rider does.\n  It is not harmless to tell the EPA they cannot set a new standard for \narsenic, a standard that essentially was set with data collected in \n1942. I will not tell anyone if I was born then or not. That is an old \nstandard, folks. We know it is much more dangerous.\n\n  Finally, it is not harmless to delay the cleanup of PCBs and DDT and \nall the other hazardous toxins that sometimes get into the bay and the \nocean floor and harm the wildlife and work up the chain.\n  Please support the Boxer amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I see we have more time than I anticipated. I ask \nunanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. I want to make sure that there is time for the ranking \nmember and myself.\n  What is the time situation, and how much time now does the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts at the present \ntime has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. And he is requesting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not object.\n  I amend that to ask unanimous consent that the remaining 20 minutes \nprior to the 12:30 vote be divided between the ranking member and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the legislation we will \nvote on shortly, the VA-HUD bill, with mixed feelings. I want to be \nclear to my colleagues, the distinguished Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from Missouri, those feelings have absolutely nothing to do \nwith the level of leadership they have provided on this legislation. I \nthink they have done an outstanding job under exceedingly difficult \ncircumstances. When I say ``difficult circumstances,'' they know better \nthan anybody in the Senate what we are talking about.\n  This bill is traditionally knocked around, almost always begins with \na significantly below realistic cap which makes it almost impossible \nfor them to do their work for months on end. And then at the last \nminute they get some kind of a reprieve and they are allowed the \nopportunity to try to fit the pieces together, satisfy their \ncolleagues, satisfy national priorities, and come to the Senate.\n  I think they have produced a housing budget that in light of recent \nyears--I emphasize this--is a very strong budget. They have done an \nexceptional job with respect to the existing housing programs that we \nhave in this country. They have increased funding for almost every \nsignificant Federal housing program that is already run by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. For that, I thank them--\nnot just for me but for countless numbers of people across the country \nwho depend on one or another of those efforts to have decent shelter \nand a competent housing program for their communities.\n  Let me share quickly a couple of examples where the work has been \nexceptional. They have provided about $6.2 billion for operating and \ncapital costs in public housing, which is an increase over the \nadministration's request. The HOPE VI program, which has been \nenormously successful in turning some of the Nation's worst public \nhousing developments into healthy, mixed-income communities, including \na number in my home State of Massachusetts, has received an additional \n$575 million.\n  The HOME program and the CDBG received significant funding increases. \nAny of us can go home and talk to a mayor and we will learn quickly how \nimportant those particular programs have been to the discretionary \ncapacity of mayors to be able to make a difference for their \ncommunities.\n  The Community Reinvestment Act has been able to extend credit. That \nhas assisted the communities. The bill also brought the homeless budget \nback up to where it was.\n  But let me just discuss, if I may, an area in which I know both the \nSenator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland share with me a \nsense of frustration and a sense of a priority not met by this \nlegislation. There is something the Congress of the United States could \nhave done about this, and has chosen not to do.\n  Very simply, we need a production program in this country. We used to \nhave a production program, but over the last years we have seen a \nretreat from the commitment by the Federal Government to provide \nproduction.\n  Last night, in the debate between Vice President Gore and Governor \nBush, there was an exchange where the Vice President said to the \nGovernor that he didn't doubt his heart, or his goodness as a person \nbut that he questioned his priorities. I come to the floor today to \nquestion the priorities of all of us in Washington, the Congress and \nthe administration, with respect to one of the most evident, compelling \nneeds that we face in this country, in community after community after \ncommunity. This is not a Boston or a Massachusetts issue. It is not a \nNew\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nEngland issue. There is not a community in the United States of America \nthat you go to today where there are not people having an \nextraordinarily difficult time being able to find adequate housing.\n  The reason is partly something we can celebrate, in the sense it \ncomes out of an economy that is so extraordinarily strong. But, on the \nother hand, because it is so strong and so many people are able to \nafford the few available places, the rents have risen to a point where \neven some vouchers are being refused. So we are upping the number of \nvouchers in this legislation to some 80,000 new vouchers, but there is \nno place for anybody to take them.\n  The result is, even as we live in a time of extraordinary economic \nexpansion, too many of our fellow Americans are not sharing on the up \nside and are finding it increasingly difficult to find decent housing. \nHUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have what we call \nworst case housing needs. These families are paying over half their \nincome towards housing costs or they are living in severely substandard \nhousing.\n  Since 1950, the number of families with worst case housing needs has \nincreased by 12 percent. That means 600,000 more of our fellow citizens \ncannot afford a decent and safe place to live, even though the United \nStates of America has the best economy we have had in maybe half a \ncentury. For these families, living paycheck to paycheck, one simple \nunforeseen circumstance such as a child getting sick or a big car \nrepair bill or some other kind of emergency can send them into \nhomelessness. That is not an exaggeration.\n  Earlier this year, on the front page of the Washington Post, an \narticle detailed these problems right here in our own backyard, the \nNation's Capital. That article detailed the plight of low-income \nfamilies living in apartments that are no longer affordable because the \nowners decided to no longer accept Federal assistance. For those \nfamilies, the loss of their affordable housing unit meant they could go \nwithout a home.\n  We have mistakenly viewed this crisis as limited to certain \ndemographic groups. I really caution my colleagues not to fall into \nthat stereotype. There is not one metropolitan area in the country \nwhere a minimum wage earner can afford to pay the rent for the average \ntwo-bedroom apartment. The minimum wage today--is it $5.15? You would \nhave to earn over $12 an hour to afford the median rent for the average \ntwo-bedroom apartment in this country. That figure rises dramatically \nin many metropolitan areas.\n\n  An hourly wage of $28 is needed in San Francisco; $23 on Long Island; \n$19 in Boston; $17 in Washington, DC, $16 in Chicago and in Seattle, \nand $15 in Atlanta. In every one of these cases, the affordability \ncrisis has grown worse over the course of the past year. Working \nfamilies are increasingly finding themselves unable to afford a house. \nA person in Boston would have to make over $35,000 a year just to \nafford a two-bedroom apartment, and we know that is well above the \nmedian earnings of folks in that area--as well, I might add, as most of \nthe country.\n  In Cape Cod, MA, a working mother of three children has been forced \nto live in a camper. The children actually live in a tent because the \ncamper is not large enough. The mother cooks on an outdoor grill. She \ncleans the campground toilets to help pay the rent on her campsite. She \nworks 40 hours a week, earns $21,000 annually, and she cannot find \naffordable rental housing.\n  There was another article in the Washington Post this week which \nemphasizes the impact of this issue. Because of the ability of higher \nwage earners in this area who have benefited from the booming economy \nto pay higher housing costs, we have seen a rise in the number of \nbuilding owners who refuse to rent to households that are assisted by \nsection 8 vouchers. In Prince Georges County, 300 tenants in an \napartment complex were recently told they have to move because the \nowner is no longer going to accept section 8.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri understands everything I have thus \nfar said and supports the notion that we need a production program. I \nam grateful to the Senator from Missouri for having not just seen that, \nbut put $1 billion into this bill for housing production. That is how \nthis bill went to the conference level. That bill could have received \nsupport from the House and the administration that would have left us \nin a position to fund.\n  When people say: Senator, what about the cap? What about the total \namount of money? In this year, the 2001 budget cycle, as a matter of \npriority, the administration and others are choosing to pay down $200 \nbillion of debt. I am all for debt paydown. I know that is a tax cut to \nall Americans. I have been one of those here who has supported the \nconcept that we ought to pay off the debt as rapidly as we possibly \ncan. But the key is in the words ``as rapidly as we possibly can.'' \nMaybe we should add words such as ``as is appropriate,'' or ``as is \nmeasured against other priorities of the country.''\n  I do not know where it is written in stone or otherwise made an edict \nof the budgeting process that we have to choose to pay down $200 \nbillion instead of paying down $199 billion or $198 billion, or some \nother figure. Would it really be so bad if the United States took 1 \nyear longer to pay off the entire debt while sufficiently addressing \nthe question of adequate housing for American families today?\n  The Senator from Missouri sought to put $1 billion into this bill. So \nwe are making our own priorities. I say to my colleagues, as a matter \nof common sense and sound investment policy in the future of the \ncountry, it makes sense to invest in production of housing for people \nwho cannot afford it because the alternative is that you have a lot of \nkids who are dragged out of schools, moving from community to \ncommunity, often becoming at risk as a consequence of the lack of \nadequate housing. We will pick up their costs. We will pick up their \ncosts when some Senator comes to the floor and says we need more \nFederal assistance to build prisons; or we need more Federal assistance \nfor the juvenile justice system to take care of those kids who are \ngetting into trouble; or we need more Federal assistance for the drug \nprogram because we have too many crack houses and too many communities \nthat are magnets for crime.\n\n  Why? Because we don't allow them to become the kinds of communities \nwe want them to be by investing up front in creating the kind of \nhousing the country needs. It is inexcusable, in a nation as rich as we \nare, doing as well as we are, that we cannot find $1 billion to make \ncertain we have a production program to help build the kind of housing \nthat will release the pressures on the marketplace and can be felt all \nup and down the ladder in housing costs in the country.\n  Some colleagues will say: Why should the Federal Government do that? \nYears ago, we made a commitment in this country about housing. We have \ncome to understand that there are certain things the marketplace \ndoesn't always do very well. I happen to believe we have the most \nefficient allocation of capital of any economic system anywhere on the \nface of the planet. I am proud of that. I support that in dozens of \nways--through the Small Business Committee, Banking Committee, Commerce \nCommittee, tax incentives, various ways in which we allow the private \nsector to do what it does best, which is create jobs. But sometimes \nthere are certain sectors of the economy where the marketplace does not \nwork as efficiently. We have always recognized that with one kind of \ntax incentive or tax credit or direct grant or other kind of incentive \nor another. Housing just happens to be one of them.\n  When the supply is very tight and the demand is very high, you have a \ncapacity for rents to rise and you have builders targeting their \nbuilding to that place where they can make the most money. That is a \nnatural instinct in a marketplace where you are looking for the \ngreatest return on investment. You do not get your great return on \ninvestment from the sectors where the people can least afford the \nrents.\n  That is why we need a production program, and that is why I hope in \nthese final days before the Congress adjourns we will find our way to \ninclude in the omnibus bill the production program we need so \ndesperately. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The time of the Senator from \nMassachusetts has expired.\n  There are now 20 minutes equally divided among the managers of the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we conclude our debate on the VA-HUD \nbill, there are differences of opinion on these riders. I do hope they \nare rejected. If they are adopted, it will have a serious parliamentary \nand maybe even fiscal consequence. However, it is a democracy; people \nneed to work their will. I am very proud of this bill because we do \nmeet the needs of our veterans, those who fought the war over there so \nwe could have peace here. I am very proud of what we have done in \nhousing and urban economic development because what we want to do is \ncreate an opportunity ladder so people can make sure they have the \nopportunity for a better life, that there is local control in \ndecisionmaking, strengthening communities whether they are in rural or \nurban America.\n  I am very proud of what we have done on the environment. We have \nfunded clean air, clean water, safe drinking water, the ongoing efforts \nto clean up the Chesapeake Bay and many other bays around the United \nStates of America. Also, in terms of science and technology, again, we \nhave increased the funding so we can come up with the new ideas that \nultimately will save lives, generate jobs, and save communities. That \nis what this bill is all about.\n  There are little known provisions, such as funding Arlington Cemetery \nwhere brave people who died in war are buried, and where Navy diver \nStethem, my own Maryland resident who died as a result of an act of \nterrorism, is buried. He was on an airplane, and he wore the Navy \nuniform. They beat him up. This bill is a tribute to what people fight \nand die for around the country: That people will have a better life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to follow up with some comments on \nthe issues we have discussed today and express, again, my sincere \nappreciation to my colleague from Maryland for the tremendous \ncooperation and guidance and valuable assistance she has provided, and \nher staff, Paul Carliner and others. We have had a lot of difficulties \nin working out this bill under unusual circumstances, but we both \nextend our thanks to the chairman and the ranking member, Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd, for assisting us and for providing us with \nthe resources we needed ultimately to put together a bill that meets \nthe needs in so many important areas, from veterans to housing to the \nenvironment to space to science and emergency management. It has been a \nchallenging time.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts noted that we had made an effort with \nrespect to the production of housing. Frankly, I believe there is \nnothing more important. I think we have finally gotten the attention of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had heretofore \nfocused solely on sending out new vouchers.\n  They wanted new vouchers overall. And my staff did what I thought was \na very helpful report--completed it a month or so ago--which pointed \nout in so many areas vouchers simply cannot be used. There is no place \nto use them. The nationwide average is about 19 percent. I think in \nJersey City some 65 percent of the vouchers cannot be used. In St. \nLouis County, MO, 50 percent cannot be used. It is an empty promise, a \nhollow promise, when we give a needy family a certificate that says \nthis will pay their rent, and they take it out someplace and find out \nthey cannot rent anyplace with that voucher, with that section 8 \ncertificate. That does not do much good.\n  So we did fight hard for the production program. People have \nobjected. I think they had legitimate concerns about the provisions. We \nagreed that these should be considered in an authorizing vehicle. We \nhope and we urge the Banking Committee next year to take up the problem \nof housing production. Let's get all these ideas out on the table.\n  My office has a lot of good ideas; I am sure others do. Let's get \nthem all out and work them out in authorizing language. How sweet it \nwould be if we had an authorized piece of housing legislation that \nwould make it unnecessary for us to include housing provisions in the \nappropriations bill. It might be a lot duller, but I believe the \nranking member and I could still pass the appropriations bill. So I \nurge them to deal with those housing questions.\n  We also thank our colleagues from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for their helpful comments. As a member of that committee, I \nurge them to take a look at these many provisions which are included in \nour bill because of concerns over the direction we are moving in the \nenvironment. I would like to deal with them on the authorizing basis. I \nhope that we may do so in the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank all our colleagues for their help.\n  I reserve 2 minutes for the chairman of the committee at such time as \nhe may choose for matters that he wishes to bring up.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield now?\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, who have \nworked so hard on this bill and brought us a bill now, through the \nnegotiations they have had with the House, that I believe will be \nsigned. It has been a very difficult bill. In working together, it is \nnice to see a good bipartisan effort on our appropriations bills.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4310\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for me to offer \nan amendment at this time. The amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4310.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to have the amendment read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, add:\n\n\n                               division c\n\n       Sec.  . In lieu of a statement of the managers that would \n     otherwise accompany a conference report for a bill making \n     appropriations for federal agencies and activities provided \n     for in this Act, reports that are filed in identical form by \n     the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to \n     adjournment of the 106th Congress shall be considered by the \n     Office of Management and Budget, and the agencies responsible \n     for the obligation and expenditure of funds provided in this \n     Act, as having the same standing, force and legislative \n     history as would a statement of the managers accompanying a \n     conference report.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4310) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are concluding. I express my \nthanks to Senator Stevens and to Senator Byrd, who enabled us to move \nforward with this very unusual process, and for the assistance they \ngave us in dealing with severe budgetary allocations.\n  I also thank Senator Bond, as well as Congressman Walsh, for \nincluding the Democrats as full participants, and also the courtesy \nextended to members of the executive branch at OMB and also to the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality.\n  I also thank Senator Bond's staff for, again, their really close work \nin relationship with us and for the professionalism that was afforded. \nAnd I thank my own staff. While we worked on this bill, a lot of people \nwere off enjoying themselves. They went home to dinner; they went to \nfundraisers; they played with their grandchildren; and we were out here \nworking. That is our job. We were happy to do it. But after we would go \nhome, the staff would work, often until 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night and \nthrough weekends. I thank them for their hard work. But, most of all, I \nknow the American people thank them for their hard work.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4308\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment strikes two riders which are \nharmful and unfair to the American people. That is why 21 environmental \ngroups support the amendment. And the League of Conservation Voters has \nindicated they are going to score this on their environmental \nscorecard.\n  The first rider delays the setting of a new standard for arsenic in \ndrinking water. The National Academy of Sciences tells us we must act \non a new standard for arsenic in water because arsenic is now a known \ncarcinogen. They urge swift action because they tell us that the old \nstandard was based on 1942 data. Arsenic causes cancer. That is \nscience. We should not delay.\n  The second rider gags the EPA from informing communities that their \nair quality is harmful to their health. That is, to me, in a democracy, \nan amazing thing that we would stand here and allow this to happen, \nwhere the EPA would be denied the free speech to go into communities \nand say: You have to watch out for your health.\n  Gag rules on clean air and delays on arsenic standards are bad \nriders. I hope we will strike them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, with respect to the arsenic rider, the \nNational Academy of Sciences says somebody must act, but the EPA has \nnot determined what action must be taken. Give them the full year that \nthe Clean Water Act envisioned. We are doing this so they can conduct \nthe process and not wind up spending their time in court.\n  With respect to the ozone nonattainment designations, this is simply \nsaying: Don't go out and put black eyes on communities when lower \ncourts have said that the EPA doesn't have the authority to issue those \ndesignations. Wait until you find out whether they actually have the \nauthority to go out and brand a community as being out of attainment \nwith this particular standard until you find out whether it is lawful.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 4308, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n4308. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Grams) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President on rollcall No. 270, I voted aye. It was my \nintention to vote no. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote since it would in no way change the outcome \nof that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the next votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4309\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do I have 1 minute to describe this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It is a sense \nof the Congress and says the following:\n  It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental Protection \nAgency should move swiftly to clean up river and ocean sites around the \nNation that have been contaminated with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metal, and \nother toxic chemicals in order to protect the public health, safety, \nand the environment.\n  I think this is very straightforward. I think we should all join \nhands and support the amendment. Why do I think we need it? There is \nreport language in this bill that we believe delays the cleanup of \nthese sites. The managers say, no, they don't think it will result in \ndelay. If that is the case, then why can't we all join hands and \nsupport this sense of the Congress?\n  My goodness; we ought to protect our environment in this way. It \nseems to me if we have PCBs, if we have DDT with an ocean environment, \na bay environment, or river environment, it is going to harm and it is \nharming the wildlife. That gets passed on to humans as the fish consume \nthe DDT.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, do not be deluded by the phrase ``sense of the \nCongress.'' This is not a free ride on the riders. There are \nconsequences if this passes. It is a dangerous amendment. This \namendment will then go to a formal conference. The House will not \naccept our decision. This bill will then die as so many other things \nare dying. It will die quickly, as a matter of fact.\n  Second, in terms of the consequences to policy, first of all, there \nare so many exceptions in this bill, one of which is that this language \ndoes not apply if EPA says the site poses a threat to public health. It \ndoes not apply if a voluntary agreement is in place, if dredging is \nalready occurring in a site. If a site has an approved plan by October \n1, 2000, it doesn't apply.\n  Guess what. It sunsets on June 30, 2000. Let's just sunset the \namendment and move on.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to table and ask for yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to a motion to table the amendment No. \n4309.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill will be \nread a third time.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n\n\n                              section 404\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to discuss \nwith the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, \nHUD and Independent Agencies the role of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA) in the Section 404 permitting process. FEMA \nand the Section 404 wetlands permitting program are subject to the \nauthorization jurisdiction of the committee I chair, the Senate \nEnvironment and public Works Committee, and receive their funding \nthrough this appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be delighted to discuss this matter with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator knows, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency was not established with the intent that it \nbecome a regulatory agency. Rather, the principal mission of the Agency \nis to administer relief to areas of our nation that are suffering from \ncatastrophic events such as floods or hurricanes. The Section 404 \npermitting program under the Clean Water Act, as the Senator also knows \nwell, is a complicated and controversial federal regulatory program \nadministered primarily by the Army Corps of Engineers. However, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency also has a major role in the \nimplementation of the program that includes the ability to veto \ndecisions by the Corps to issue specific Section 404 permits. I believe \nthat two agencies implementing a federal regulatory program is quite \nenough.\n  Mr. BOND. I am familiar with the Section 404 program and agree with \nthe Senator's observations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have two specific concerns regarding \nFEMA and the Section 404 program. First, I understand that a new rule \non nationwide permits was issued by the Corps effective June 7, 2000. \nNationwide permits are a streamlined permitting process that apply to \nminor wetlands disturbances that have a minimal impact on the nation's \nwetlands. These permits are very important to the operation of the \nprogram since as many as 85 percent of the permits issued by the Corps \neach year are nationwide permits. One aspect of this new rule makes it \nvery difficult to obtain nationwide permits in the one hundred year \nfloodplain. According to the Corps, 53 percent of the floodplain is \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Section 404 program. The rule \nprovides that certain nationwide permits can be obtained in a portion \nof the hundred year floodplain if approved by FEMA or the local flood \ncontrol agency.\n  Congress has not authorized a role for FEMA in the Section 404 \npermitting process. Is it your understanding that this new rule will be \nimplemented in such a fashion that FEMA will not become a regulatory \nagency with respect to Section 404 nationwide permits?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator that FEMA should not have a \nregulatory role in the Section 404 program and that there is some lack \nof clarity in the new nationwide permit rule regarding FEMA's role. The \nreport of the Committee that accompanies this legislation contains \nlanguage requesting detailed information from FEMA regarding their \nimplementation plans under this new rule. I can assure the Senator that \nwe will address his concerns as we work with FEMA on their funding \nneeds and requests.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator for his attention to \nmy concerns about FEMA's role in the 404 program. I would also call the \nCommittee's attention to the related problem of the issuance of \nindividual 404 permits in the 100 year floodplain. I believe it is \nimportant to emphasize that, just as in the case of nationwide permits. \nFEMA does not have a regulatory role in the issuance of individual \npermits under Section 404. Whether or not there should be such a policy \nin the hundred year floodplain is an issue that Congress may wish to \naddress in the future. However, for now, I believe that it must be \nrestated that FEMA has not been authorized a decisional role in whether \nor not an individual Section 404 permit should be issued nor the \nconditions of a Section 404 permit. We do not need a third federal \nagency with a decisional role in the Section 404 permitting program. \nObviously, FEMA may comment on applications for Section 404 permits, as \nmay any citizen or federal agency, but that opportunity must not be \ntransformed into a decisional role. Does the Senator agree with me on \nthis point? Is it the Senator's understanding that the funds in this \nbill will not be used by FEMA to play a decisional role in the issuance \nof individual Section 404 permits in the hundred year floodplain?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator on this point. The funds in this \nbill are not to be used by FEMA to play a decisional role in the \nissuance of individual Section 404 permits in the hundred year \nfloodplain.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Missouri.\n\n\n                  Assisting Veterans With Disabilities\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Chairman of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be pleased to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I want to compliment the Chairman and the Ranking \nMember, Ms. Mikulski, for bringing this bill to the Senator floor and \nfor the Subcommittee's attention to the health, rehabilitation and \nresearch programs funded by this bill that are critical to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  I also want to compliment the Chairman and the Ranking Member for the \nsubcommittee's report language that urges the VA's Rehabilitation \nResearch Office to conduct a demonstration project to assess the impact \nof a new mobility technology on the ability of veterans to perform work \nfunctions, thereby leading to increased opportunities for veterans with \ndisabilities to return to work. This innovative mobility device is a \nmajor advance in that it has\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\nthe ability to climb stairs, traverse all terrain and balance the \nseated user at standing eye-level. It should, I hope, provide veterans \nwho have mobility impairments with significant additional opportunities \nin the workplace. The demonstration project called for by the \nSubcommittee's language will help clarify the additional employment \nopportunities that such a device should create for our Nation's \nveterans. I thank the Subcommittee for its assistance in making process \non this matter.\n  With new and emerging technologies becoming available that can assist \nveterans with disabilities, it is vital that the VA keep pace with the \nmarketplace and ensure that veterans with disabilities have access to \nthese advancements. I have had the pleasure of seeing this new mobility \ndevice perform its functions and it clearly holds great promise. I am \nhopeful that this demonstration project will show a significant impact \nthat this device can have on the ability of veterans with disabilities \nto return to work and I am eager on review the findings of the \ndemonstration. Would the Chairman agree that the demonstration that is \nrequested in the Subcommittee's language be completed by May 1, 2001?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I think that the more than 7 months between now and \nMay 1, 2001, is ample time to complete the demonstration project. I \nthank Senator Levin for his work on this important issue and for \nbringing it to the Subcommittee's attention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chairman for his continuing leadership on this \nmatter.\n\n\n                                dredging\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Manager's Amendment contains language \nwhich would direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take no \naction to initiate or order the use of dredging or invasive remedial \ntechnologies where a final plan has not been adopted prior to October \n1, 2000, or where such activities are not now occurring until the NAS \nreport has been completed and its findings have been properly \nconsidered by the Agency. Would the Senator from Maryland be willing to \nclarify a few questions about this language?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would be pleased to offer information \nabout this Amendment to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it understood that the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas the discretion to define ``threat to public health'' and ``urgent \ncase'' as those terms are applied to the exceptions? Further, is it \nunderstood that the EPA has the discretion to define ``properly \nconsidered.''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Missouri, the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, agree with these clarifications?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator from Maryland and join in her \ninterpretation of this language.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the courtesy of the \ndistinguished Senators from Maryland and Missouri.\n\n\n                          great waters program\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we congratulate the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Appropriations Committee for presenting the Senate with \nan Appropriations bill which addresses so many of the water quality \nissues confronting America today. We also want to reiterate our support \nfor a program of great interest to our colleagues from the Great Lakes \nstates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Great Waters program, authorized by the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, assesses air deposition as a source of toxic \ncontamination to key water bodies, including the Great Lakes and \nChesapeake Bay. Research suggests that at least half of all new toxic \npollution loadings entering the Great Lakes may be transported and \ndeposited by the atmosphere. Consistent funding for the monitoring of \nair deposition of toxic contaminants is especially critical at this \ntime as the international community completes negotiations of an \ninternational treaty on persistent organic pollutants. The Great Waters \nprogram will provide a key component of the database used to judge the \neffectiveness of this international agreement in lowering the toxic \ncontaminants entering the Great Lakes, and other great waters of the \nUnited States, from foreign sources.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman if the \nbill provides sufficient funding through the parent account to restore \nfunding for critical monitoring under the Great Waters program to the \nfiscal year 1999 level of effort?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senators \nfrom Ohio and Michigan for highlighting the importance of the Great \nWaters program. We are pleased to recommend continuation of this \nprogram which is so vital to understanding the impact of airborne \ntoxins on aquatic ecosystems. I assure the Senator that the intention \nof this bill is to restore sufficient funding to allow assessment of \nour progress in reducing the amount of toxic pollution entering the \nnation's waters.\n\n\n                The Centredale Manor Restoration project\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking minority Member in putting together \nthis year's VA-HUD appropriations bill. I would like to clarify one \nmatter of importance regarding removing an environmental threat in a \nRhode Island community. The Centredale Manor Restoration Project is a \nSuperfund site in North Providence, RI. With my encouragement, the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has been moving quickly at this site. \nThe site was only added to the National Priorities List in February of \nthis year and several removal actions have been conducted at the site. \nRecently, the EPA released a proposed Engineering Evaluation/Cost \nAnalysis that recommends replacement of the Allendale Dam and \nexcavation of contaminated soils from residential properties along the \nWoonasquatucket River. These clean-up plans--requiring excavation of \napproximately 2,500 cubic yards of soils and sediments--were intended \nto be finalized later this year after the current public comment \nperiod, with design and construction work to follow shortly thereafter. \nThere is a great deal of local support for getting on with this clean \nup and removing dangerous contaminants from North Providence \nneighborhoods.\n  I understand that the report attached to this bill contains language \ndirecting EPA to wait until completion of the current National Academy \nof Sciences study of sediment remediation technology, and proper \nconsideration of the NAS study as it relates to EPA remedy selection, \nbefore finalizing any more dredging plans. The NAS study is scheduled \nto be completed no later than January 1, 2001. It seems to me this \nreport language would allow the EPA to continue planning associated \nwith the Centredale Manor cleanup, including replacement of Allendale \ndam and excavation of contaminated soils and sediments in and along the \nWoonasquatucket River, at the North Providence Superfund site. \nUltimately, I believe that following consideration of the NAS study, \nEPA will be able to finalize the cleanup plan and implement that final \nplan during the 2001 construction season. I would like to confirm with \nthe Chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee that the report \nlanguage is not intended to delay progress toward cleaning up \ncontamination at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project in North \nProvidence.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is correct. \nThe conference report language on dredging and EPA review of the \npending study by the National Academy of Sciences is not intended to \ndelay progress towards cleaning up contamination at the Centredale \nManor Restoration Project in Rhode Island. It is intended to ensure \nthat EPA considers the findings of the NAS study in selecting remedies \ninvolving contaminated sediments.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's \nclarification of this matter.\n\n\n                                 TEA-21\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on an \nimportant matter.\n  It is my understanding that the managers' amendment that we are \nadopting includes a rider which prohibits the EPA from making \nnonattainment designations under the new 8-hour ozone standard until \nJune 15, 2001, or the final adjudication of the American Trucking \nAssociation vs. EPA case now before the Supreme Court, whichever comes \nfirst. Is that right?\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from New Jersey is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. While I believe that inclusion of this rider is \nunfortunate as it will slow progress toward cleaner air, I understand \nthat it should have little practical effect. EPA is unlikely to make \nthose designations much in advance of June 15, 2001, in any case, even \nthough all but about 6 states have submitted proposed areas for \nnonattainment designation.\n  I would just like to make one thing very clear for the record. This \nrider is a prohibition on the expenditures of funds. It does not negate \nthe requirement included in TEA-21 that areas be designated under the \nnew ozone standard. It also does not in any way prejudice the \nlitigation pending before the Supreme Court. Would the distinguished \nChairman confirm that these points are true?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, Mr. President, the Senator is correct. This language \ndoes not modify section 6103 of TEA-21, nor is it intended to affect \nthe Supreme Court's consideration of the litigation on these standards \nin any way.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the Subcommittee Chairman and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n\n\n                                 CERCLA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a section in \nthe statement of the managers accompanying the conference report. The \nlanguage directs EPA to take no action to initiate or order the use of \ncertain technologies such as dredging until certain steps have been \ntaken with respect to the National Academy of Sciences report, with \nexceptions for voluntary agreements and urgent cases. It is my \nunderstanding that after June 30, 2001, or when EPA has properly \nconsidered the NAS report, whichever comes first, the conferees intend \nthat EPA could proceed to finalize any such plans and act on those \nplans through steps to initiate or order dredging and other \ntechnologies, as appropriate.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The statement of the managers is \nnot intended to limit EPA's authority to act on a plan that is \nfinalized in accordance with the conditions set out.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is also my understanding that in directing EPA to \nproperly consider the NAS report, the conferees are not intending to \nchange the normal criteria by which EPA selects remedies, such as the \nfactors laid out in CERCLA, the National Contingency Plan, and \napplicable guidance. Instead, the conferees are asking EPA to \ndisseminate the report to officials within the Agency who make remedy \nselection decisions and to ask them to review it as part of the larger \nbody of research on scientific and technical issues associated with \nhazardous waste cleanup. The NAS report is not being singled out for \nspecial deference greater than it would otherwise receive.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The statement of the managers \ncalling for EPA to properly consider the NAS report is not a change in \nthe CERCLA remedy selection process, it is not a call for an EPA \nresponse to the report, and is not a direction to give the report more \nweight than it would otherwise receive.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is also my understanding that urgent cases would \ninclude situations in which contaminated sediments, either alone or \nthrough their accumulation in fish, cause significant risks to public \nhealth such as increases in cancer risks, reproductive effects, or \nbirth defects.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the subcommittee chairman and Senator \nLautenberg.\n\n\n              EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to call the \nSenate's attention to a program that the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) is implementing in a way that I believe is inconsistent \nwith the original intent of Congress. The Endocrine Disruptor Screening \nProgram, EDSP, was created by EPA to implement language in the Food \nQuality Protection Act, FQPA, and Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n1996 requiring that EPA, and I quote, ``develop a screening program, \nusing appropriate validated test systems and other scientifically \nrelevant information, to determine whether certain substances may have \nan effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a \nnaturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect . . .'' \nThe Program was required to be implemented by August 1, 1999.\n  This program has been plagued by a lack of public participation from \nkey constituencies, an expansive interpretation of the Congressional \nmandate, questionable decisions as to the validation of testing \nprotocols, and neglect of money appropriated for the development of \nnon-animal tests.\n  In October 1996 EPA formed the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and \nTesting Advisory Committee, EDSTAC, under the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act to advise EPA on risk assessment techniques for endocrine \ndisrupting chemicals. EDSTAC included scientists and representatives \nfrom EPA and other government agencies, industry, national \nenvironmental groups, worker protection groups, environmental justice \ngroups, and research scientists. More recently, EPA set up the \nEndocrine Disruptor Standardization and Validation Task Force to \nperform the work needed to develop, standardize, and validate the \nscreens and tests proposed for the Program. However, one very important \nconstituency was not included in either of these groups--in fact they \nwere excluded--they are the animal welfare groups. Traditionally, these \ngroups have been left out of the consultation process of EPA regarding \nthe newly initiated chemical testing programs. Any program that \nincludes testing of chemicals for toxicity or other effects involves \nthe use of animals in such testing, however, the groups that advocate \nfor animal welfare were excluded from providing early input in the \nEndocrine Disruptor Screening Program.\n  As Chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the testing and \nhandling of toxic chemicals, the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, I am particularly concerned about how this program is being \nadministered. In addition to the lack of public input, a major concern \ndeals with the large number of animals used in testing that could occur \nas a result of EPA's implementation plan for this program. On August \n25, 2000, EPA published a report to Congress on the Endocrine Disruptor \nScreening Program that sets forth the findings, recommendations and \nfurther actions of EPA in implementing the EDSP. The implementation \nplan that EPA has come up with is broader than the plain language of \nthe FQPA. While obtaining better data on endocrine disruptors is \ncertainly a worthy goal, I am concerned about the expansion of this \ncongressionally mandated program. The broad interpretation by the EPA \nof the chemicals to test and the method of validation calls into \nquestion whether this program will be implemented in a manner \nconsistent with the intent of Congress. All of these expanded \ninterpretations increase the number of test animals needed to implement \nthe program.\n  The law specifically states that EPA is to ``use appropriately \nvalidated tests.'' EPA has interpreted the law to mean that animal \ntests can be validated through the EPA's own Science Advisory Board, \nhowever, non-animal tests must be run through a more rigorous \nInteragency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative \nMethods (ICCVAM) process. ICCVAM was created as a standing committee in \n1997 and is composed of representatives of fifteen Federal regulatory \nor research agencies that regulate the use of animals in toxicology \ntesting; EPA is a co-chair of ICCVAM. The ICCVAM process with input \nfrom the EPA Science Advisory Board reviews can ensure that the tests, \nanimal or non-animal, will produce good results. I believe all tests \nshould be assessed for validation by ICCVAM.\n  My comments up until now have been critical of the plan that EPA has \nput forth for future implementation of the Endocrine Disruptor \nScreening Program. Last year, Congress appropriated $5 million for the \ndevelopment and implementation of the test methods including the high \nthroughput pre-screen, a non-animal screening process. After spending \n$70,000, the Agency has stopped working to integrate the high \nthroughput pre-screen into the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. \nAlthough this specific example concerns me, it is only one example of \nthe general disinterest of EPA in integrating non-animal tests into the \nprogram. I\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nurge the EPA's Office of Research and Development to apportion funds to \nprioritize research, development and validation of non-animal tests.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you for your insight and comments on EPA's Endocrine \nDisruptor Screening Program. We are in agreement that EPA should \nimplement the Program better. EPA should also pursue the validation and \nincorporation of non-animal testing as soon as practicable.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I want to thank the Senator from Missouri \nfor his comments and hope we can continue to work together on the \nmonitoring of this and other EPA programs.\n\n\n                           Military Retirees\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, as you know, current law requires that for \na military retiree to receive his VA disability compensation he must \nwaive an equal part of his retirement pay. This issue is frequently \nreferred to as ``concurrent receipt,'' because it would involve the \nsimultaneous receipt of two types of benefits.\n  The service connected disabled military retiree is the only person \nthat is forced to pay for their own disability compensation. A worker \nin private industry is not forced to pay for his own disability. \nLikewise, local, State and federal civil servants, appointed and \nelected officials are not forced to pay for their own disability \ncompensation.\n  For several years I have worked closely with military retirees and \nveterans organizations to change the law to permit receipt of all \ndeserved benefits. This is a step that this Congress must take. It is \nunfair that a person who serves his or her country and has a service-\nconnected disability can't draw both benefits.\n  Legislation to fix concurrent receipt has been introduced during the \npast several Congresses. Last year, thanks in great part to the efforts \nof the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the Senate took a first step towards fixing this problem by \nauthorizing a concurrent receipt provision for severely disabled \nmilitary retirees. The existing concurrent receipt restrictions, \nhowever, remain in effect.\n  This year, the Senate again made an effort to solve the concurrent \nreceipt problem. During debate on the Department of Defense \nAuthorization bill, the Senate included an amendment to completely \nrepeal concurrent receipt laws. This would allow all veterans to \nreceive their full disability compensation along with their retired \npay. When the conference report to the Defense Authorization bill \nreached desk of the conferees, however, they were faced with an \ninsurmountable financial problem.\n  The Defense Authorization conference report that is being considered \ntoday contains crucial provisions that will enable the government to \nfulfill its first priority: to provide a strong national defense. In \naddition, the Act contains significant and necessary increases in \noverall defense spending, especially directed at improving morale and \nretention. One of the most important of these provisions is an \namendment, fulfilling a broken promise, which will give the same health \ncare benefits to military retirees as those available to active duty \nservice members. Therefore, I will support the Defense Authorization \nbill.\n  However, I want to take this opportunity to declare my intentions and \nto call upon my colleagues for their support. As part of the annual \nbudget process next year, I will work with my colleague from Nevada, \nMr. Reid, who has dedicated a great deal of time to this effort, to \ninclude budget cap room for concurrent receipt.\n  I want to remind my colleagues, the service connected disabled \nmilitary retiree is the only person who is forced to pay for his own \ndisability compensation. It is simply unfair that a person who serves \nhis or her country and has a service-connected disability can't draw \nboth his VA and disability benefits concurrently.\n  This is a situation that must be fixed and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our \nservicemembers, active duty and retired, receive the full benefits that \nthey deserve.\n\n\n                             housing needs\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for \ntheir good work on this year's VA-HUD appropriations bill. Also, I \nwould like to congratulate Secretary Cuomo on the hard work he has done \nto raise awareness of the critical housing needs many Americans are \nexperiencing around the country.\n  As the ranking member on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, I have a very keen interest in the portion of this bill that \nfunds the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  This year's budget is a strong step in the right direction. The bill \ncontains increases in spending for many of the critical housing \nprograms that serve middle- and low-income families.\n  It includes funding for nearly 80,000 new section 8 housing vouchers. \nThese vouchers will provide additional housing resources for families \nexperiencing critical housing needs.\n  Funding for the HOME and CDBG programs has been increased by $200 \nmillion and $300 million over last year's levels respectively. These \nare programs that local governments and non-profits rely on to build \nand rehabilitate affordable housing, as well as revitalize communities.\n  The Committee has also provided for an increase in the homeless \nbudget, which includes emergency shelter, permanent housing, \ncounseling, and job training services. For the approximately 500,000 \npeople that are homeless in this country on any given night, this \nadditional money will mean a better chance to find a bed in a shelter, \na soup kitchen at which to eat, or a permanent home.\n  They also took the important step of providing a stream of funding to \nrenew Shelter Plus Care vouchers. This will enable local providers to \ncontinue to build up the infrastructure they need to serve this \nvulnerable population.\n  This year's budget builds on the public housing reform legislation we \npassed two years ago by increasing the public housing operating and \ncapital funds, enabling local public housing authorities to maintain \nand invest in their properties.\n  Also included is a two year extension of The Federal Housing \nAdministration's Down Payment Simplification Program. This will allow \nthe FHA to continue using the simplified formula to extend \nhomeownership to more American families.\n  Additionally, there is an increase in spending for the Lead Paint \nHazard program, a very important program for cities trying to abate the \npoisonous lead paint found in their housing stock.\n  Lastly, I want to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their efforts \nin pushing one provision that did not make it into the bill, that is, a \nnew housing production program. While I am disappointed that we were \nunable to achieve this in the end, I appreciate their acknowledgment of \nthe housing crisis our nation is experiencing.\n  The long-term answer to this problem will have to be the dedication \nof new resources to building additional housing. While the nearly \n80,000 new section 8 vouchers will help to alleviate the severe housing \ncrunch that many working American families experience, I hope we will \nbe able to revisit the topic of production again next year.\n  All in all, this is a very good bill. I am very pleased and again \ncongratulate my colleagues on a well thought out, well funded, piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as all Senators are aware, I have taken the \nfloor on a number of occasions, not only this year, but over the past \nseveral years, to express my concern about the manner in which the \nSenate was disposing of certain appropriation bills. This year--as in \nthree previous fiscal years, fiscal years 1997, 1999, and 2000--the \nSenate has, until today, again been unable to take up and debate and \namend several fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills; namely, Treasury/\nGeneral Government, VA/HUD, and Commerce/Justice/State appropriations \nbills. I have been deeply concerned that the Senate is in danger of \nbecoming a mere adjunct of the House, when it comes to consideration of \nappropriations bills.\n  In light of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, so near the \nend of the 106th Congress, I was pleased to support the unanimous \nconsent agreement entered into yesterday. Under that agreement, the \nSenate has before it this morning the Fiscal Year 2001 VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill, as amended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nThat Committee-reported bill has been amended by a Committee\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\nsubstitute offered by Senators Bond and Mikulski. Despite the fact that \nthe Senate has not taken up the VA/HUD Appropriations bill until today, \nthe fact is that Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Mikulski have worked \ntirelessly on the substitute before the Senate today. They have worked \nwith the Administration and the other body to pound out an agreement \nthat is acceptable to all parties involved in those negotiations. So, I \nam pleased that the many hours that they have devoted to this effort \nhave resulted in the agreement now about to be adopted by the Senate. \nAs is always the case, when it comes to appropriations bills, no one is \nfully satisfied with the final agreements that are reached. I am sure \nthat there are areas where members would prefer to see changes made, \nbut the time has come and gone for us to complete our work on the \nFiscal Year 2001 appropriations bills--a fiscal year which began some \n12 days ago.\n  Mr. President, as I explained earlier in my remarks, the Senate, \nuntil today, had not taken up the VA/HUD bill, or the Treasury/General \nGovernment bill, or the Commerce/Justice/State bill. The amendment at \nthe desk places before the Senate the Committee-reported FY-2001 \nTreasury/General Government Appropriations bill.\n  This is the only opportunity that the Senate has had to consider the \nTreasury/General Government Appropriations bill, other than its being \npresented to the Senate on September 14th in a combined Legislative \nBranch and Treasury/General Government conference report, which was \nunamendable. The inclusion of the Treasury/General Government \nappropriations in the Legislative Branch conference report was not \namendable and precluded the Senate's opportunity to debate and amend \nthe Treasury/General Government bill on the Senate floor. Instead, on \nSeptember 14th, Senators were asked to vote on the unamendable \nconference report, which contained not only the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations for Fiscal Year 2001, but also the Treasury/General \nGovernment Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001. The vote on that \ncombined conference report was 28 yeas and 69 nays. The motion to \nreconsider that vote is still pending.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that several adjustments to \nthat Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference \nreport have been made in the form of amendments to the Transportation \nAppropriations bill, which were adopted in conference and were included \nas part of the Transportation conference report, which has now passed \nboth Houses of Congress and is awaiting the President's signature. I do \nnot intend to discuss those amendments in detail at this time, but \ninstead will point out that a concern by Senator Reid regarding the \nselection of a chief administrative officer for the Capitol Police has \nbeen resolved in that Transportation conference, together with \nsubstantial increases in funding for the IRS and certain other matters \npertaining to the Treasury/General Government portion of that combined \nconference report.\n  As a result of these amendments regarding the Legislative Branch and \nTreasury/General Government conference report, it is my understanding \nthat that conference report is now acceptable to the Chairmen and \nRanking Members of those two Subcommittees, and I believe it is the \nintention of the Leadership to bring up and dispose of that combined \nLegislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference report \nimmediately following completion of consideration of the VA/HUD \nAppropriations conference report, which is currently before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urged the Leaders to allow for the amendment to put \nbefore the Senate the Treasury/General Government Appropriations bill, \nas reported by the Appropriations Committee, in order to preserve, at \nleast to some extent, the Senate's right to take up appropriations \nbills prior to their being inserted into unamendable conference \nreports. I appreciate that the Leaders accommodated my request. \nAlthough, under the unanimous consent agreement, there will be no \nopportunity to amend the Treasury/General Government Appropriations \nbill, at least we have preserved the Senate's right to consider it. I \nam encouraged by the fact that the Majority Leader, at this late hour \nof the session, has attempted, as best he could, to allow some \nsemblance of Senate consideration of the VA/HUD and the Treasury/\nGeneral Government appropriations bills. I am hopeful that a similar \nagreement can be reached on the one remaining appropriations bill which \nthe Senate has not yet acted upon--the Commerce/Justice/State \nAppropriations bill.\n  I am also very hopeful that we can find a way to ensure that the \nSenate can return to the regular appropriations process in the next \nCongress and all congresses thereafter, whereby appropriations bills \nare reported by the Committee and taken up in the Senate for debate and \namendment prior to their being inserted into unamendable conference \nreports.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to explain my \nvotes on the amendments offered by Senator Boxer to the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill relating to legislative riders that were attached \nto the bill. Included in the bill were provisions that would \npotentially delay the issuance of rules on arsenic, the declaration of \nnew ozone non-attainment areas, and ordering dredging for the clean up \nof PCB's. Senator Boxer offered amendments that would have eliminated \nor weakened these provisions. She has worked hard for our environment, \nand has been a leader on ecological issues, so I regret I had to vote \nagainst her proposals. Unfortunately I had to oppose her for several \nreasons. First, the amendments, if accepted would have seriously \ndisrupted Congress's efforts to complete our work on the budget. These \namendments would have resulted in additional delays, and could have \njeopardized the fate of the bill.\n  I was also concerned because the Administration did not oppose, and \ndid not agree with the dire assessment of the effects of these riders. \nStaff at the EPA do not believe that these riders will result in any \nsignificant delays. EPA does not believe that the dredging language \nincluded in the bill will delay action on the Fox River in my state, \nbut it will ensure that we use the best science available when EPA \ndevelops clean up plans.\n  Senators Bond and Mikulski, along with the Administration, have done \ntheir best to neuter destructive language that was included in the \nHouse version of this bill, and I think they have done well. We would \nprefer that these riders not be included at all, but if they must, at \nleast they were included in a way that is unlikely to have any negative \neffect on the environment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this year's VA, HUD \nAppropriations bill contains $1 million for the City of Detroit for the \nDetroit River walkway or promenade. The riverfront is a focal point of \nDetroit's redevelopment efforts in connection with the City's upcoming \n300th anniversary and plans are underway to construct an extensive, \npedestrian-friendly walkway or promenade along the shoreline. I have \npersonally been able to obtain support from this body for that purpose. \nThe grant provided for in this bill will help defray the costs of the \nproject, such as land acquisition, walkway installation and building \ndemolition, and will help give Detroit a world-class waterfront.\n  We also have before the Senate today two very important amendments to \nthis bill. The first would strike language in the report which delays \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from making a final regulation for \narsenic in drinking water. The National Academy of Sciences has found \nthat the current regulations for the levels of arsenic in our water are \nunacceptable. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed to lower \nthe standard from the current 50 parts per billion to 5 parts per \nbillion. I support that proposal and regret that I had to vote against \nthis amendment. However, this amendment contained two provisions and it \nis the other provision I do not support.\n  That part of this amendment would strike language in the report which \nprevents the Environmental Protection Agency from designating an area \nin nonattainment under the Clean Air Act pursuant to the 8-hour \nnational ambient air quality standard for ozone. I agree that an ozone \nstandard should be in place to protect public health and\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\nthe environment. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's \nauthority to issue the 8-hour standard is currently under review by the \nUnited States Supreme Court. The Court will hear argument on November 7 \nto decide whether to uphold a Court of Appeals decision that \ninvalidated the 8-hour standard on the grounds that the agency had \nassumed an ``unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.'' Even \nthe EPA has agreed that it cannot actually implement efforts with \nrespect to the 8-hour standard. Until the Supreme Court hears this \ncase, we do not know whether the EPA even had the authority to make \nthis new rule. Therefore, I agree that the EPA should refrain from \nusing the standard--a standard that may be struck down as \nunenforceable--until the Supreme Court has made its determination \nregarding the constitutionality of the EPA's actions.\n  Now this isn't a frivolous matter. A nonattainment designation can \ndetrimentally affect an area and, if not justified, would cause \nneedless economic hardship, such as costly transportation conformity \nmeasures, should the Supreme Court rule that the 8-hour standard is \nunenforceable. Further, this standard could impose unfair economic \nburdens on a number of communities in Michigan that suffer from \nsignificant ozone and other pollution transported from more severely \npolluted areas. And it could be all for nought if the Supreme Court \nstrikes down the standard.\n  Mr. President, I support the goals of the Clean Air Act. However, it \nneeds to be applied in a common sense equitable manner if it is to \nretain the support of the American People. It is not equitable to \ndesignate an area in nonattainment if that designation may become null \nand void in a matter of months. For these reasons I voted against the \nBoxer Amendment.\n  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. President, I am pleased that, with my \nsupport, the Senate took another step today toward fulfilling our \ncountry's commitment to provide health care for our veterans. The \nfiscal year 2001 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report that passed \nthe Senate this afternoon contains a $1.4 billion increase in veterans \nhealth care funding from the last year's appropriations level.\n  While I am pleased that we have finally come around to talking about \nadditional funding for veterans health care, as opposed to three years \nof flat-line budget levels, I am disappointed that the funding level in \nthe FY2001 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report falls short of the \nlevel proposed by veterans organizations.\n  The authoritative Independent Budget is produced by major veterans \norganizations including AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, the \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and the VFW. The Independent Budget and \nThe American Legion agree that the Veterans Administration will need at \nleast $500 million more in funding than provided by this conference \nreport.\n  I am pleased to have led the effort last year in the Senate to \nincrease veterans health care funding. Through my efforts on the Senate \nBudget Committee and on the Senate floor, we were able to start \nreversing the negative effects of three years of flat-lined veterans \nhealth care budgets with an increase of $1.7 billion. I am pleased that \nmy efforts appear to have convinced the Administration and Members of \nCongress to start talking about increases in veterans health care \nfunding instead of keeping this budget stagnant.\n  This year, I was successful in getting a bipartisan amendment passed \nto the Senate Budget Resolution that added an additional $1.9 billion \nto last year's funding for veterans health care. The conference report \nthat passed the Senate today fell $500 million short of this goal and \nwill prevent the VA from adequately funding a number of important \nprograms including medical care, research, long term care, and \nnecessary facility construction and renovation.\n  While the $1.4 billion increase in this year's VA budget and the $1.7 \nbillion increase from last year are important improvements, I'm afraid \nthe funds are simply providing budgetary backfill for the years when \nthe veterans health care needs were ignored. We need a VA veterans' \nhealth care budget that can adequately offset years of underfunding, \nthe higher costs of medical care caused by consumer inflation, wage \nincreases, and legislation passed by Congress. For the first time in a \nnumber of years, we're working with overall budget surpluses instead of \nbudget deficits. Clearly, the funds are there to provide for veterans \nhealth care. It is simply a question of whether the political will is \nthere to make veterans health care a priority instead of an \nafterthought.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will continue to do all \nI can to encourage my colleagues to approve adequate funding levels for \nveterans health care. I look forward to continue working on a \nbipartisan basis with my Senate colleagues as well as with \nrepresentatives of the veterans community in South Dakota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President. I rise to speak about a provision in \nthe VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill, which was \npassed by the Senate today. Specifically, I want to speak about the \nsubstantial backlog of civil rights claims that have been filed with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, Office of Civil Rights, \nOCR.\n  As my colleagues know, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nprovides that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of \nrace, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be \ndenied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. \nFor thirty-five years, this law has been a cornerstone of our nation's \ncivil rights protections. To better implement Title VI in federal \nenvironmental programs, President Clinton issued an Executive Order in \n1994 requiring each federal agency ``to make achieving environmental \njustice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as \nappropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or \nenvironmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on \nminority populations.''\n  Under EPA's Title VI implementing regulations, 40 CFR Section 7, EPA-\nfunded permitting agencies are prohibited from taking actions in the \npermitting process that are intentionally discriminatory or have a \ndiscriminatory effect based on race, color, or national origin. Under \nthese regulations OCR is required to ``promptly'' investigate all \ncomplaints filed under Title VI unless all parties agree to a delay [40 \nCFR Section 7.120]. OCR is first required to initiate complaint \nproceedings within 5 days of receipt of a complaint [40 CFR Section \n7.120(d)]. Then it must review the complaint for acceptance, rejection, \nor referral to another agency and make a determination within 25 days \nof the receipt of the complaint [40 CFR Section 7.120(d)(1)]. If a \ncomplaint is accepted, EPA must make a preliminary finding in the \nmatter, including recommendations, if any, for achieving voluntary \ncompliance, and OCR must notify the recipient of these finding within \n180 days of the start of the complaint investigation. [40 CFR Section \n7.120(d)(2)].\n  Unfortunately according to the OCR's most recent log of cases filed \non October 4, 2000, 103 Title VI claims have been filed since September \n1993. Of these, over half, 56 cases, are still pending. The remainder \nwere either rejected or dismissed over jurisdictional issues. Eleven of \nthe still active cases have been pending for 5 years or more, without \nresolution. Only one case has been resolved by a decision of the OCR, \nwhich found that there was not a legally recognizable ``adverse \nimpact'' on the community and denied the community's request for \nreconsideration.\n  To further complicate resolution for these civil rights claims, in \n1998 a rider was inserted in the VA-HUD Appropriations bill that \nblocked the implementation or administration of the interim Guidance to \nenforce Title VI claims issued on February 5, 1998. This rider has \neffectively stopped the EPA from investigating and responding to claims \nof race or national origin discrimination that have been filed with the \nAgency after October, 1998. That same rider has been on all subsequent \nVA/HUD bills, including this one.\n  This summer the EPA revised it's Guidance, which was noticed in the \nFederal Register for public comment. The revision is titled ``Draft \nRevised Guidance for Investigating Title VI Administrative Complaints \nChallenging Permits.'' I am pleased that the rider,\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nincluded in this VA/HUD Appropriations bill, would not apply to the \nEPA's revised Guidance.\n  However a there still remains a large backlog of cases to be acted \nupon. There were 35 complaints filed after the first rider in 1998. To \ndate only one has been accepted for investigation. Although the step of \nacceptance or rejection is required under Federal Regulation within 25 \ndays of the receipt of the complaint, 34 of these complaints are more \nthan 25 days old and over half of them, 20 of 34 cases, have been \n``under review'' for more than a year.\n  The EPA's own regulations are clear, regardless of any Guidance. \nFurthermore, the rider does not account for the entire backlog of \nunresolved complaints. There are still 21 complaints pending that were \nfiled before the rider blocking the EPA's 1998 Guidance went into \neffect. Of these cases, 19 have been accepted, but no preliminary \nfindings have been made. Two cases are still under review after 4\\1/2\\ \nyears, and as you will recall the deadline in the federal regulations \nfor accepting cases is 25 days from the initial complaint date. And \nagain, half of the still active cases,--11 of 21--have been pending for \n5 years or more, without resolution.\n  It appears the EPA is out of compliance with it's own regulations for \nprocessing civil rights complaints, both for cases filed before and \nafter the effect of the rider. While the rider has no doubt been a \nhindrance to the Agency, it clearly does not absolve the Agency of its \nresponsibilities under the 36 year old civil rights law. And the \nAgency's own regulations lay out a clear framework for processing and \nacting on complaints.\n  Several environmental and civil rights organizations have written to \nCongressional leaders on this backlog. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter to the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee from the NAACP, and a letter from the Earthjustice Legal \nDefense Fund be entered into the Record following my statement.\n  In closing, I am pleased the Administration appears to be working to \nfinalize the revised Guidance. However, I remain concerned that the EPA \nhas established no clear way of dealing with the backlog of civil \nrights claims that have built up over the past seven years.\n  Therefore, as a Senator from Minnesota, I call on the EPA, as \nexpeditiously as possible, to resolve the many backlogged civil rights \nclaims, several of which have been pending for years. Only then will we \nbe able to fulfill the intent of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond, Chairman,\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski, Ranking Member,\n     VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski: The National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the \n     nation's oldest and largest grassroots civil rights \n     organization, strongly opposes the anti-civil rights, anti-\n     environmental rider in the House version of the VA, HUD, and \n     Independent Agencies Appropriations bill that, for the third \n     year in a row, attempts to interfere with the obligation of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate and \n     resolve Title VI Civil Rights complaints filed with its \n     Office of Civil Rights. We urge you to not accept this rider \n     in the final version of the bill, and to instead insist on \n     bill language that requires the EPA to begin immediately \n     resolving the growing backlog of civil rights complaints \n     filed since 1993 by communities of color struggling for \n     environmental justice.\n       The rider, as well as the backlog of civil rights \n     complaints, has had the effect of undermining one of the most \n     important laws in this country, Title VI of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     race, color or national origin. The NAACP worked for the \n     enactment of Title VI and continues to work against any \n     actions that may result in racial discrimination. Therefore, \n     we are deeply troubled by acts of Congress and actions of \n     government agencies that may result in having a disparate \n     impact on communities of color.\n       Any community in this nation that feels that it is \n     threatened by a state environmental agency decision must have \n     access to legal recourse to address its concerns. \n     Historically, these communities have been low-income areas \n     with high concentrations of African Americans, Latino \n     Americans and Asian Americans. The fact that communities of \n     color are disproportionately over-represented among \n     communities with these complaints leads to inevitable \n     concerns that their basic civil rights are being violated. \n     According to the EPA's Office of Civil Rights, there are now \n     56 complaints lodged with the agency that remain unresolved. \n     Many of these claims were filed with the EPA several years \n     ago. However, the agency has not even notified complainants \n     about whether their complaints have been accepted or \n     rejected--a duty required of the EPA by federal regulations. \n     Of the 21 unresolved complaints that were accepted for \n     investigation, over half were filed more than five years ago. \n     The EPA has failed to render preliminary findings for all of \n     the complaints accepted for investigation. However, federal \n     regulations require the EPA to make preliminary findings \n     within 180 days of the complaint's acceptance for \n     investigation. EPA's failure to comply with federal \n     regulations has blocked resolution of civil rights \n     complaints. As a result, people of color who lack the \n     resources for federal court civil rights litigation are \n     effectively denied access to legal redress at the \n     administrative level. This is a completely unacceptable \n     situation.\n       The House anti-civil rights, anti-environmental rider makes \n     a bad situation worse. For the last two years and as proposed \n     for next year, the riders expressly prohibit the EPA from \n     investigating and resolving new civil rights complaints. The \n     result has been a maintaining the status quo of concentrating \n     polluting sources in communities of color. By blocking the \n     EPA from developing and implementing concrete manners of \n     resolving these complaints, the rider creates a chilling \n     effect on the EPA for investigating the backlog of \n     complaints. As a result, the riders clearly have added to the \n     problem of the growing backlog of unresolved civil rights \n     complaints.\n       The rider is an unjust denial of a civil rights remedy for \n     people of color struggling to protect their children and \n     communities from environmental hazards and pollution. It \n     violates the spirit, if not the outright language, of the \n     Constitution of the United States that guarantees every \n     American the right to ``life, liberty and the pursuit of \n     happiness.''\n       We urge you to delete all language from the final bill that \n     could interfere with EPA's ability to investigate civil \n     rights violations, and to insert into the final bill a \n     provision that requires the EPA to resolve the backlog of \n     civil rights complaints as expeditiously as possible. I hope \n     that you will feel free to contact me with any questions or \n     comments you may have on this matter. I look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that the rights of all Americans \n     are protected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     EarthJustice,\n\n\n                                           Legal Defense Fund,\n\n                                                 October 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: EarthJustice Legal Defense Fund is \n     a non-profit environmental law firm whose mission is to \n     enforce laws that protect our environment through litigation \n     and advocacy. One of these laws is Title VI of the Civil \n     Rights Act, which expressly prohibits discrimination on the \n     basis of race, color or national origin in federally-funded \n     programs. In 1993, the New Orleans office of Earthjustice \n     successfully represented African American citizens groups in \n     Mississippi by filing the first Title VI Civil Rights \n     complaint with the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), \n     which was against the state's environmental programs that \n     concentrated waste sites in African American communities. Our \n     civil rights complaint protected Mississippi citizens, who \n     were unfairly targeted for additional proposed waste sites.\n       Clearly, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act is an important \n     remedy to protect people of color who are disproportionately \n     burdened by toxic facilities and waste sites. There have been \n     numerous governmental and academic reports that demonstrate \n     the racial disparities that exist in environmental permitting \n     decisions, which concentrate polluting sources in communities \n     of color. The gains that people of color have made in the \n     struggle for environmental justice have heightened public \n     awareness about this form of racism and established \n     institutional changes at the EPA and other government \n     agencies to address this issue. However, actions taken by \n     Congress over the past three years have taken away the \n     ability of people of color to exercise their civil rights in \n     defense of their health and environment.\n       The right of citizens to seek legal redress--a cornerstone \n     of our democracy--is blocked by Congressional riders that \n     have prevented the EPA from investigating civil rights \n     complaints for the last two years. This rider is also \n     inserted in this year's VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies \n     bill. Through this rider, Congress has effectively repealed \n     civil rights protections for people who live in fear of \n     industrial accidents and daily breath a cocktail of toxic \n     chemicals spewed by facilities and waste sites in their \n     neighborhoods. As a result of the rider, there has been an \n     increase in the number of civil rights complaints filed with \n     the EPA by people of color\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\n     that go unanswered. There are now 56 civil rights complaints \n     pending before the EPA's Office of Civil Rights that remain \n     unaddressed, in violation of the agency's own Title VI \n     regulations requiring prompt resolution of claims. The \n     rider's offensive prohibition against investigating new civil \n     rights complaints with tools and analyses developed by the \n     EPA silences people of color. We find that such legislation \n     is a dangerous erosion of our civil rights, which opens the \n     door to new riders that can dismantle civil rights \n     protections in housing, education, employment, and \n     transportation. We find it profoundly disturbing that with \n     one brushstroke of a pen, Congress can set back the gains of \n     the civil rights movement in this country.\n       The anti-civil rights and anti-environmental rider in the \n     present VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies bill sets a \n     dangerous precedent in this country for taking away the \n     rights of citizens. We deeply appreciate your leadership in \n     opposing this rider and supporting a safe and healthy \n     environment for all communities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Monique Harden,\n       Staff Attorney.\n     Joan Mulhern,\n       Senior Legislative Counsel.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered? I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Before we begin the vote, I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this measure. Senator Mikulski and I have worked long and hard. \nObviously, we have not made everybody happy, but that is not in our \npower. We hope we have done well by all of the functions and all of the \nfacilities and departments we serve. We hope our colleagues will be \nsullen but not rebellious and join us in passing a measure which has so \nmany good things to provide for veterans, housing, environment, space, \nscience, and emergency management.\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues for their indulgence as we had to go \nthrough this unusual episode. I thank our staff, Jon Kamarck, Carolyn \nApostolou, Cheh Kim, and Joe Norrell. On the minority side, Paul \nCarliner and Alexa Mitrakos have been outstanding.\n  The most valuable ally I have on this measure is the very \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, to whom I am deeply \ngrateful, and I appreciate her leadership and guidance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I echo the expression of thanks to our \nstaff and to our colleagues. I urge we move immediately to a vote and \nserve the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Grams) \nand the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 8, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 272 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--8\n\n     Allard\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Feinstein\n     Grams\n     Helms\n     Kennedy\n     Lieberman\n  The bill (H.R. 4635), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 4635) entitled ``An Act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n                               DIVISION A\n\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2001, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                    Veterans Benefits Administration\n\n\n                       Compensation and Pensions\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For the payment of compensation benefits to or on behalf of \n     veterans and a pilot program for disability examinations as \n     authorized by law (38 U.S.C. 107, chapters 11, 13, 18, 51, \n     53, 55, and 61); pension benefits to or on behalf of veterans \n     as authorized by law (38 U.S.C. chapters 15, 51, 53, 55, and \n     61; 92 Stat. 2508); and burial benefits, emergency and other \n     officers' retirement pay, adjusted-service credits and \n     certificates, payment of premiums due on commercial life \n     insurance policies guaranteed under the provisions of Article \n     IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as \n     amended, and for other benefits as authorized by law (38 \n     U.S.C. 107, 1312, 1977, and 2106, chapters 23, 51, 53, 55, \n     and 61; 50 U.S.C.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4392, the intelligence authorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate on the bill H.R. \n     4392, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States Government, the Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed that \n     the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of \n     the Senate, and agreed to the same with an amendment, and the \n     Senate agree to the same, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of the Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 11, 2000.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Senate has before it the conference \nreport to H.R. 4392, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001. The conference report reflects the legislation, S. 2507, that was \napproved unanimously by the Select Committee on Intelligence on April \n27, 2000, and amended and approved by the Senate on Monday, October 2.\n  I thank Senator Bryan, the vice chairman of the committee for his \nassistance in expediting this conference report. This is Senator \nBryan's first year as vice chairman. It has been a pleasure to work \ncooperatively with him on a wide range of issues, and I regret that \nthis also will be his last year on the committee and in the Senate.\n  The committee has been increasingly troubled by the NSA's growing \ninability to meet technological challenges and to provide America's \nleaders with vital signals intelligence, SIGINT. Success in NSA's \nmission is critical to our national security. Therefore, the conference \nreport reflects the start of our investment in resources and support \naimed at restoring the NSA's' capabilities.\n  I am proud to report that the conference report addresses the growing \nproblem of leaks of classified information. The conferees endorsed the \nSenate provision that will close a gap in U.S. law to ensure the \nprosecution of all unauthorized disclosure of classified information. \nSuccessive directors of Central Intelligence have decried the growing \nproblem of leaks of classified information and the damage it causes to \nour national security. DCI Tenet has publically stated that the U.S. \nGovernment ``leaks like a sieve.''\n  Arguments that section 304 will stifle the freedom of the press \nsimply don't pass muster. This provision has nothing to do with \nrestraining publication. It simply criminalizes knowing and willful \ndisclosure of properly classified information by those charged with \nprotecting it. The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously approved \nthis provision and worked closely with the Attorney General and the \nintelligence community to incorporate changes requested by the \nDepartment of Justice. The Departments of Justice and State and the CIA \nall support the provision as approved by the conference committee.\n\n  Another provision of the bill is designed to ensure that the State \nDepartment corrects the serious, systemic security weaknesses that have \nrepeatedly placed at risk sensitive classified intelligence information \ncollected at considerable risk and expense. This provision would \nrequire that the Director of Central Intelligence certify that the \nretention and storage of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) by \nany element of the State is in full compliance with all applicable DCI \ndirectives relating to the handling, retention, or storage of such \ninformation.\n  The bill requires the Director of Central Intelligence, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense, to create an analytic \ncapability for intelligence relating to prisoners of war and missing \npersons. The analytic capability will extend to activities with respect \nto prisoners of war and missing persons after December 31, 1990.\n  Also, the bill strengthens the IG's requirements to be fully engaged \nin investigating and responding to possible wrongdoing by senior CIA \nofficials. In the wake of the investigation of former Director of \nCentral Intelligence John Deutch this provision will ensure that the \nCIA policies its senior officials.\n  The conference report also contains the Counterintelligence Reform \nAct of 2000. S. 2089 was introduced by Senators Specter, Torricelli, \nThurmond, Biden, Grassley, Feingold, Helms, Schumer, Sessions, and \nLeahy in April in the wake of Congressional and other investigations \ninto PRC espionage against the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons \nlaboratories and other U.S. government facilities, and the U.S. \ngovernment's response. Those investigations focused attention on the \napplication of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and \nhighlighted coordination, information-sharing, and other problems \nwithin and among the Department of Energy, FBI, and Department of \nJustice. The amendment will correct some of the problems in \ncoordinating and sharing information between federal agencies, and will\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\nclarify procedures and the statutory roles of various agencies in the \ninvestigation and prosecution of espionage and other cases affecting \nnational security.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation in this conference report, \nparticularly the members of the committee. I also thank the staff of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence for their hard work in developing \nthis legislation.\n\n\n                              Section 304\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the Vice \nChairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Bryan, for purposes of \nclarification with respect to one definition in the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill. And that's the definition of ``classified \ninformation'' in Section 304 of the bill which amends Section 798A of \nTitle 18. Section 304 establishes as a crime the willful disclosure of \nclassified information to an unauthorized person. In paragraph (c)(2) \nit defines ``classified information'' as ``information that the person \nknows or has reason to believe has been properly classified by \nappropriate authorities, pursuant to the provisions of a statute or \nExecutive Order. . .''\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Vice Chairman's assurance that \nthis bill is not intended to alter in any way the existing definitions \nof classified information contained in other statutes relevant to the \nprotection of classified information and whistleblower rights.

SPENCE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                        2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate on the bill H.R. \n     4205, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year and for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceeding of the Record of \nOctober 6, 2000.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my privilege as chairman, together \nwith my distinguished friend and ranking member, Mr. Levin, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, to at long last bring to the Senate the annual \nconference report from the authorizing committee in the Senate and the \nauthorizing committee in the House.\n  To refresh the recollection of Senators, I will read the time \nagreement: 2 hours under the control of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Mr. Warner; 2\\1/2\\ hours under the control of the \nranking member, Mr. Levin; 1 hour under the control of Senator Gramm; \n30 minutes under the control of Senator Wellstone. Following the debate \njust outlined, Senator Robert Kerry will be recognized to make a point \nof order. The motion to waive the Budget Act will be limited to 2 hours \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We hope to yield back some time because I know many of \nour colleagues are anxious to make commitments, but this is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. I am certain the Senators who are going \nto participate, whom I have identified, will do so in a manner that \nfits the importance of this annual piece of legislation.\n  This is the 39th consecutive authorization bill passed by the \nCongress, assuming it passes this Chamber. It passed the House by a \nvote of 382-31. That will give some clear indication of the importance \nof the legislation and the strong support that it merits and has \nmerited in the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate, as I have been with my colleagues here for \nthe past hour or so for the voting, reflects a very somber note on this \nsad day for America--indeed, for all those who, throughout the world, \nstand guard for freedom. We have suffered a tragic loss to the U.S. \nNavy. This is in parallel with frightful losses taking place elsewhere \nthroughout the Middle East. It brings to mind that this is a most \ndangerous world that faces us every day. Men and women in the Armed \nForces of the United States go forth from our shores, serving in \ncountries all over the world. They, of course, now are on a high alert \nbecause of the tragic terrorist act inflicted upon one of our \ndestroyers, the U.S.S. Cole.\n  First in mind are thoughts for our sailors who have lost their lives, \nand most particularly their families and the families who, at this \nhour, are still waiting definitive news with regard to the crew of that \nship. The casualties number four dead, approximately 12 missing, and \nsome 35 to 36 suffering wounds. Still the facts are coming in.\n  This clearly shows the danger; it shows the risks the men and women \nof the Armed Forces are taking--not only in the Middle East region. \nThis, of course, happened in a port in Yemen. The ship was on a routine \nrefueling, a matter of hours, as it worked its way up towards the \nPersian Gulf to take up its duty station in enforcing the United \nNations Security Council sanctions against Iraq. Because of the \nsmuggling that is taking place in violation of those sanctions, those \nare dangerous tasks and they are being performed every day by men and \nwomen of the U.S. Armed Forces, Great Britain, and other nations. Air \nmissions are being flown over Iraq every day, and often those missions \nare encountering ground fire and other military activity directed \nagainst them. We must be a grateful nation for the risks that are \nconstantly assumed by the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and \ntheir families.\n  The Senate will have an opportunity to get further facts in the \ncourse of the day.\n  I will now direct my attention to this particular bill, and I see the \ndistinguished President pro tempore, the former chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. It is my privilege to succeed him. As an \nhonor to our distinguished former chairman, I ask he lead off the \ndebate on this bill today.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much. I appreciate your fine work as \nchairman.\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\n  Mr. President, before I discuss the conference report on the Defense \nauthorization bill, I want to join my colleagues in expressing my \ncondolences to the families of the sailors killed and wounded in this \nmorning's attack on the U.S.S. Cole. This heinous attack again \ndemonstrates the constant peril faced by our military personnel and \nreinforces the need for this Nation to maintain its vigilance at all \ntimes.\n  Mr. President, I join Chairman Warner and Senator Levin, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in urging my Senate \ncolleagues to support the conference report to accompany the Floyd D. \nSpence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The \nreport, which is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work by the \nSenate and House Armed Services Committees, is a continuation of the \nCongress' efforts to reverse the decline in the readiness of our armed \nforces. It increases the President's budget request by more than $4 \nbillion. More important, it directs the additional resources to the \ncritical areas of procurement, research and development, and improving \nthe quality of life for our military personnel and their families.\n  The chairman and ranking member have already highlighted the \nsignificant aspects of this bill. However, I do want to comment on the \ncomprehensive health care provision for Medicare-eligible military \nretirees and the Energy Employees' Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram, both of which I consider significant aspects of this \nlegislation. The health care provision is long overdue legislation that \nwill ensure our military retirees and their families receive life-long \nhealth care committed to them as a condition of their service. It will \nsignificantly ease the uncertainty regarding health care and financial \nburden for thousands of military retirees who have dedicated their \nlives to the service of the Nation. The occupational illness \ncompensation provision provides fair and just compensation to the \nthousands of workers who were exposed to dangerous levels of hazardous \nmaterial and other toxic substances while they worked on the Nation's \nnuclear weapons programs. Although I understand that these benefits \ncome at a significant financial cost, we must keep in mind our \ncommitment to these patriots and remember the greatness of a Nation is \nnot how much gold or wealth it accumulates, but on how it takes care of \nits citizens, especially those who serve in the Armed Forces.\n  As with all conference reports, there are disappointments. I am \nparticularly disappointed that the provision to increase the survivor \nbenefit plan basic annuity for surviving spouses age 62 and older was \ndropped during the conference. The provision would have increased the \nsurvivor benefit plan annuity for these individuals from 35 percent to \n45 percent over the next four years. I understand that despite the \nobvious merit of the legislation it was dropped during the conference \nbecause it would have cost $2.4 billion over the next 10 years. I find \nthis ironic, since there is more than $60 billion in direct spending \nattributed to this conference report.\n  Despite my disappointment regarding the survivor benefit plan \nprovision, this is a strong defense bill that will have a positive \nimpact on the readiness of our armed forces. It is also a fitting \ntribute to my friend Floyd Spence, the Chairman of the House Armed \nServices Committee, to have this bill named in his honor. Floyd has \nworked tirelessly for our military personnel throughout his long and \ndistinguished career in the House of Representatives. Regrettably, due \nto the House Rules he will give up the chair of the Armed Services \nCommittee at the end of this session. Although he will be missed as \nchairman, his leadership and concern for our military personnel will \nhave a lasting legacy in this conference report and Floyd will continue \nto serve the people of South Carolina and the Nation as a member of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee.\n  I congratulate Chairman Warner and Senator Levin on this conference \nreport and urge my colleagues to give it their overwhelming support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe there is a parliamentary inquiry \nfrom our colleague. I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan, I be allowed \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, of course, his request is in the unanimous \nconsent agreement, and, of course, we will observe it.\n  Today the Senate begins consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4205, the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2001.\n  Before I discuss the provisions of the conference report, I want to \nreport that my fellow Senators on the conference panel and I \nenthusiastically joined the House conferees in naming this bill. \nRepresentative Floyd Spence has served as the chairman of the House \nArmed Services Committee for the last six years. His chairmanship, \nhowever, represents only a portion of the almost 30 years \nRepresentative Spence has been a tireless and dedicated supporter of \nthe military men and women in uniform. As chairman of the committee, in \nparticular, he has led the committee and the House of Representatives \nin addressing the many challenging national security issues that have \nconfronted our nation in the wake of the cold war. Representative \nSpence has accomplished this undertaking with distinction. From this \nformer Marine captain to a retired Navy captain, I salute him for his \nleadership. Under the rules of the House, he will relinquish command of \nthe committee at the end of this Congress. Representative Spence will \nremain a member of the committee, and I look forward to continuing to \nwork with him in the many years to come.\n  This legislation will have a profound, positive impact on our \nnation's security and on the welfare of the men and women of the Armed \nForces and their families. For the second year in a row, the conference \nreport before the Senate authorizes a real increase in defense \nspending. We have built on the momentum begun last year by authorizing \n$309.9 billion in new budget authority for defense for fiscal year \n2001--$4.6 billion above the President's budget request. And how have \nwe allocated this increase? This bill authorizes $63.2 billion in \nprocurement, which is $2.6 billion above the President's budget \nrequest; $38.9 billion in research, development, test and evaluation, \nwhich is $1.1 billion above the President's request; and $109.7 billion \nin operations and maintenance funding, which exceeds the budget request \nby $1.0 billion.\n  It is said that success has a thousand fathers and failure is an \norphan. The majority of credit for the successes in this bill however, \ncan be attribute to five distinguished and decorated fathers: the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four service chiefs. \nGeneral Shelton, General Shinseki, Admiral Clark, General Jones, and \nGeneral Ryan came to Congress repeatedly during this session and \npresented to the Senate Armed Services Committee their concerns about \nthe state of the Armed Forces today. They also shared with us their \nobservations about the future. They have consistently shared this \ninformation with us in a reasonable, earnest, and nonpartisan manner. \nWe greatly appreciate their candor and contributions to this process.\n  We all recognize that our military today is over deployed and under \nrecourced--both in terms of people and money.\n  Since the early 1990s, the U.S. military has been sent on operations \noverseas at an unprecedented rate; at the same time that force \nstructure was reduced by a third and defense spending was declining. \nFrom the end of the Viet Nam War until 1989, there were 60 military \ndeployments. From 1990 to today, there have been 343 deployments--a 571 \npercent increase. These statistics accurately tell the story. This \ntrend has increased the risk to our forces and has exacerbated the \nrecruiting and retention problems in the military. This cannot \ncontinue.\n  While the rate of military deployments is established by the \nPresident, the Congress, within our constitutional powers, is \ncontinuing to support the Armed Forces by improving the quality\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nof life for the men and women in uniform and their families, by \nproviding for funding increases to address declining readiness \nproblems, aging equipment, and recruiting and retention difficulties. \nThe conference report does this. For the servicemen and women deployed \naround the world, and the families at home that wait their return, they \nshould know that the Congress is steadfastly behind them.\n\n  I turn now to what is one of the most important single item in this \nconference report--military healthcare, particularly for our retired \npersonnel and their families. History shows they are the best \nrecruiters of all.\n  The conference report before the Senate fulfills an important \ncommitment of ``healthcare for life'' made by the recruiters--the U.S. \nGovernment--beginning in World War II and continuing through the Korean \nwar and the Viet Nam war. The goal of making that commitment was to \nencourage service members to remain in uniform and become careerists. \nSimply put, a commitment of health care for life in exchange for their \ndedicated career service.\n  Again, this convergence report fulfills the promise of healthcare for \nlife. I am proud of the bipartisan unanimity with which the Senate \nArmed Services Committee supported this initiative--an initiative never \ntaken before by an congressional committee.\n  Let me describe for my colleagues and for our active and retired \nservice members around the world the legislation in this conference \nreport to authorize health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military \nretirees and their families, and how we arrived at this outcome.\n  For as long as I can remember, military recruits and those facing re-\nenlistment have been told that one of the basic benefits of serving a \nfull military career is health care for life. We all know now that this \ncommonly offered incentive was not based in statute, but was, \nnonetheless, freely and frequently made; it is a commitment that we \nmust honor.\n  Let me briefly review the history of military health care. Military \nmedical care requirements for activity duty service members and their \nfamilies were recognized as early as the 1700's. Congressional action \nin the last 1800's directed military medical officers to attend to \nmilitary families whenever possible, at no cost to the family. During \nWorld War II, with so many service members on activity duty, the \nmilitary medical system could not handle the health care requirements \nof family members. The Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program was \nauthorized by Congress to meet this road. This program was administered \nthrough state health agencies.\n  The earliest reference in statute defining the health care benefit \nfor military retirees was in 1956 when, for the first time, the \nDependent's Medical Care Act specified that military retirees were \neligible for health care in military facilities on a space-available \nbasis. In 1966, this Act was amended to create the Civilian Health and \nMedical Program of the Uniformed Services, CHAMPUS, to supplement the \ncare provided in military facilities. This legislation, in 1966, \nspecifically excluded from coverage military retirees who were eligible \nfor Medicare--a program which had been enacted by the Congress one year \nearlier, in 1965.\n  The exclusion of over age 65, Medicare-eligible military retirees \nfrom guaranteed care from the military health care system was masked \nfor many years because the capacity of military hospitals an the \nmilitary medical system exceeded that required to care for active duty \nservice members; therefore, many Medicare-eligible retirees were able \nto receive treatment, on a space-available basis, at military \nfacilities. In the 1990s, we began to reduce the size of our military \nservices and the base realignment and closure, BRAC, rounds began to \nclose bases--and military hospitals--all across the Nation. The \ncombined effect of fewer military medical personnel to provide care and \nthe closure of over 30 percent of the military hospitals eliminated the \nexcess capacity that had been so beneficial to military retirees. Also \nduring this decade the retiree population grew dramatically, adding \npressure to the military health care system. The true magnitude of the \nproblem was finally exposed.\n\n  All of us have heard from military retirees who served a full career \nand, in so doing, made many sacrifices. Many times the sacrifices these \nheroic veterans made resulted in serious medical conditions that \nmanifested themselves at the time in their lives when they were pushed \nout of the military health care system. As a nation, we promised these \ndedicated retirees health care for life, but we were ignoring that \npromise.\n  On February 23, 2000, I introduced a bill, S. 2087, that provided for \naccess to mail order pharmaceuticals for ALL Medicare-eligible military \nretirees, for the first time. The legislation also would improve access \nto benefits under TRICARE and extend and improve certain demonstration \nprograms under the Defense Health Program.\n  On May 1, 2000, I introduced S. 2486, which added a retail pharmacy \ncomponent to the previous legislation, providing for a full pharmacy \nbenefit for all retirees, including those eligible for Medicare.\n  On June 6, Senator Tim Hutchinson and I introduced S. 2669, a bill \nthat would extend TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and \ntheir families, regardless of age. Later that same day, I amended the \ndefense authorization bill to add the text of S. 2669. This legislation \nprovided uninterrupted access to the Military Health Care System, known \nas TRICARE, to all retirees.\n  While the Senate bill extended TRICARE eligibility to all military \nretirees and their families regardless of age, the defense \nauthorization bill passed by the House of Representatives took a \ndifferent approach. The House bill expanded and made permanent the \nMedicare subvention program. Medicare subvention is a program that is \ncurrently being tested in ten sites across the country. Under Medicare \nsubvention, the Health Care Financing Agency of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services reimburses the Department of Defense for \nproviding health care to Medicare-eligible military retirees in \nmilitary hospitals.\n  There are several problems with Medicare subvention. First, the \namount of the reimbursement from Medicare to DOD falls well short of \nthe actual cost of providing that care, causing DOD to absorb a loss \nfor each retiree covered by the program. Second, expanding Medicare \nsubvention nationwide would provide access to health care only for \nthose beneficiaries living in proximity to the remaining DOD medical \nfacilities. In contrast, the Senate bill covered 100 percent of the \nMedicare-eligible military retirees, regardless of where they live.\n  As many of you know, since the defense authorization conference began \nin late July, Senate and House conferees have been working toward the \nmutual goal of adopting legislation which would provide comprehensive \nhealth care to all military retirees, regardless of age. I am pleased \nto announce that the conference report to accompany the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 includes a permanent \nhealth care benefit for retirees--modeled on the Senate bill. I am \ndelighted that we have honored the commitment of health care for life \nthat was made to those who proudly served this nation. This is long \noverdue.\n\n  It had always been my intent to make this health care benefit \npermanent. In fact, when I originally introduced my legislation in \nFebruary, with the support of many in the Senate, there was no time \nlimit on the benefits contained in my amendment. During Senate floor \nconsideration, a discussion arose about whether a budget point of order \ncould be made against the bill due to the mandatory costs of the \namendment. At that point, I made the decision to limit the provision to \na preliminary 2-year period to ensure that there would be no point of \norder against the authorization bill. We knew of Senators who had a \nlegitimate interest in raising such a point of order, and I did not \nwant to put the bill at risk.\n  All through this process, I have made clear my commitment to work to \nmake these benefits permanent at the earliest opportunity.\n  During the defense authorization conference we had an opportunity to \nmake my retiree health care provisions permanent by converting the \nbenefit to an entitlement and creating an accrual account in the \nTreasury. This conversion to an entitlement would not occur until \nfiscal year 2003.\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\n  Let me describe how funding the health care benefit through an \naccrual account would work. Accrual method of financing is more of an \naccounting mechanism than a change in funding. Using an accrual method \nof financing does not, in itself, increase the costs of a program. \nAccrual funding is commonly used in entitlement programs; one example \nof an accrual account is the military retirement account. The \nDepartment of Defense would annually deposit such funds, as determined \nby the actuarial board, into the accrual account in the Treasury. The \nTreasury, which would absorb the liability for certain costs attributed \nto providing health care, would also make an annual deposit to the \naccrual account. The costs of the health care benefit would than be \npaid from the accrual account.\n  The net effect of funding this important program as an entitlement \nwould be similar to funding it from within the discretionary accounts \nof the Department of Defense. While a significant portion of the burden \nof funding this program is moved from the Department of Defense budget, \nthere is little net cost to the federal government.\n  Permanently funding the military retiree health care benefit will be \nseen by retirees, active duty service members and potential recruits as \nthe nation keeping it's commitment of health care for life to military \nretirees. Those serving today and those who are joining the military \nwill see that the promise of a lifetime of health care, in return for \nserving a full career, will be honored in perpetuity.\n  Two weeks ago, in testimony before both the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the House Armed Services Committee, General Hugh Shelton, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and each of the service chiefs \nstrongly supported making this benefit permanent and using the accrual \naccount method of financing. The Joint Chiefs have repeatedly testified \nthat failing to honor the commitment to our retirees has been \ndetrimental to their recruiting and retention efforts.\n\n  During our conference we made many tough decisions on issues that are \nvery important to many Senators. I resisted every proposal that would \npotentially generate a point of order against the conference report. \nThe accrual funding mechanism and the direct spending associated with \nthe retiree health care benefit will make our conference report \nvulnerable to a motion to raise a point of order against our bill which \nwould require a 60 vote majority to overcome. It is any Senator's \nlegitimate right to take such an action. While I respect the right of \nany Senator to raise a point of order, I am urging my colleagues to \nconsider the benefits of the health care provisions in this bill, which \nare fully justified. We would not want to leave our over-65 military \nretirees in doubt about our intentions with respect to their medical \ncare. They must make critical decisions regarding their medical \ninsurance plans and medical care. By making this health care plan a \npermanent entitlement, we are truly fulfilling the commitment made to \nall those who have completed a career in uniform.\n  If such a point of order is sustained, then the Defense authorization \nconference report will have to be recommitted to a new conference. \nThere is simply not enough time in this Congress to commence a new \nconference.\n  If the Defense authorization conference report is not passed, there \nwill be no health care benefit for Medicare-eligible military retirees. \nIf the defense authorization conference report is not passed, this \nwould be the first time in 38 years that the Congress has not passed a \nDefense authorization bill. That would be a tragedy. What a terrible \nsignal to send to our brave men and women in uniform defending freedom \naround the world.\n  In addition to restoring our commitment to our retirees, the \nconference report also includes a number of important initiatives for \nactive and reserve men and women in uniform today. The conferees \nauthorized a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel effective \nJanuary 1, 2001 and a revision of the basic pay tables to give \nnoncommissioned officers an additional pay increase, effective July 1, \n2001. I cannot understate the importance of providing our \nnoncommissioned officers with this support. They are our career \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines; tried and true, they are the \nbackbone of our military and are more than deserving of this pay raise.\n  We included a provision to reduce the number of military personnel on \nfood stamps. The conference report would provide up to $500 per month \nin an additional, special pay for military personnel who are eligible \nfor food stamps. By our estimates, this provision should reduce the \n6,000 military personnel estimated by DOD to be on food stamps today by \nabout half. To further assist our most needy service members, the \nconferees agreed to eliminate the requirement that service members pay \n15 percent of their housing costs out of their own pocket and directed \nimplementation of the Thrift Savings Program of active and reserve \nservice members.\n  The conference report extends current and authorizes additional \nrecruiting and retention bonuses and special pays. If the bill is not \nenacted into law, all of these bonuses will expire on December 31, \n2000. If the services are not able to offer the recruiting and \nreenlistment bonuses, their recruiting and retention progress of this \npast year will be for naught.\n  Also important to improving the quality of life for servicemen and \nwomen and their families is our continuing support for the \nmodernization, renovation, and improvement of aging military housing. \nThis conference report contains $8.8 billion for military construction \nand family housing, an increase of $788.0 million above the \nadministration's request. More than $443.0 million of this amount is \nfor the construction of 2,900 family housing units--800 more homes than \nlast year. The conference report also provides more than $585.0 million \nto renovate and upgrade critical barracks space for unaccompanied \nmilitary personnel and more than $660.0 million for vital military \nconstruction projects for reserve components.\n\n  This conference report also supports a group of dedicated men and \nwomen, who, while not in uniform, provided an equally important \ncontribution to the defense of the Nation. The conference report \nestablishes a new program to compensate Department of Energy, DOE, \nemployees and DOE contractor employees who were injured due to exposure \nto radiation, beryllium, or silica while working at certain DOE \ndefense-related nuclear facilities. This new program is intended to \ncompensate those employees who, for the past 50 years, have performed \nduties uniquely related to nuclear weapons production and testing. \nEligible employees would receive a lump sum payment of $150,000 and \npayment for all future medical costs related to the covered illness.\n  At this point, I recognize the important contributions of Senators \nThompson, Voinovich, McConnell, and DeWine and their staff in crafting \nthe final conference outcome on DOE workers compensation. Although they \nwere not conferees, they were involved every step of the way as we \nnegotiated this important issue with the House. They are to be \ncommended for their tireless efforts on behalf of DOE workers.\n  I will now briefly highlight just a few of the important measures in \nthis bill which support modernization and operations of our land, sea, \nand air forces, and which support our continuing efforts to identify \nand counter the emerging threats--information warfare or the use of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The conference report:\n  Increases funding by over $888.0 million for the primary military \nreadiness accounts for ammunition, spare parts, equipment maintenance, \nbase operations, training funds, and real property maintenance. While \nthe additional funds that the conferees have provided will help with \nsome of the most critical shortages in these areas, further efforts \nwill be required over the next several years if we are to restore the \nArmed Forces to appropriate levels of readiness;\n  Supports the Army's transformation efforts by: authorizing an \nadditional $750.0 million for this initiative; directing the Army to \nprovide a plan that charts a clear course toward the fielding of an \nobjective force in the 2012 time frame; and requiring an evaluation of \nequipment alternatives for Interim Brigade Combat Teams;\n  Adds $560.0 million to the President's budget request for ship \nconstruction;\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\n  Adds $15.7 million for five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction \nCivil Support Teams, WMD-CST, which will result in a total of 32 WMD-\nCSTs by the end of fiscal year 2001. WMD-CSTs, formerly known as Rapid \nAssessment and Initial Detection, RAID; Teams, are comprised of 22 \nfull-time National guard personnel who are specially trained and \nequipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, \nor radiological events in support of local first responders in the \nUnited States.\n\n  Includes a provision that would designate one Assistant Secretary of \nDefense as the principal civilian advisor to the Secretary for \nDepartment of Defense activities for combating terrorism. This \nprovision--which is critically needed--ensures that there is a single \nindividual within the Department responsible for providing a focused, \ncomprehensive and well-funded DOD policy for combating terrorism.\n  Provides additional funding to address several of the Department of \nDefense's most critical shortfalls in combating cyber-warfare threats. \nThe conference report adds $15.0 million to create an information \nSecurity Scholarship Program to address shortages in skilled DOD \ninformation assurance personnel by providing essential training and \neducation in exchange for a service commitment, and $5.0 million to \nestablish an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information \nProtection to conduct critical research and development that is \ncurrently not being done by DOD or the private sector, and to \nfacilitate the exchange of information regarding cyberthreats and \nrelated issues;\n  Adds $146.0 million to accelerate technologies leading to the \ndevelopment and fielding of unmanned air combat vehicles by 2010 and \nunmanned ground combat vehicles by 2015. This initiative will allow the \nDepartment to exploit the opportunities created by the rapid pace of \ntechnological development to provide our men and women in uniform with \nthe most advanced weaponry and leverage these developments in a way \nthat minimizes the risk to those deployed in harm's why;\n  Authorizes a net increase of $391.8 million for ballistic missile \ndefense programs including a $129.0 million increase for National \nMissile Defense risk reduction, an $85.0 million increase for the \nAirborne Laser program, and an $80.0 million increase for the Navy \nTheater Wide missile defense program;\n  Reduces the congressional review period from 180 days to 60 days for \nchanges proposed by the administration on the export control levels of \nhigh performance computers;\n  Ensures service contractors receive prompt and timely payment from \nthe Department of Defense by requiring a plan for the electronic \nsubmission of supporting documents for contracts and the payment of \ninterest for service contracts for payments more than 30 days late;\n  Authorizes $470.0 million in federal assistance to the Nation's \nfirefighters over the next two years. The conference report also \nestablishes a framework for the review and reauthorization of the \nprogram at the end of that time.\n  I would now like to take a few moments to address a provision which \nis not in the final conference report--the Warner-Kasich amendment on \nKosovo.\n  As my colleagues know, I started the legislative effort to get our \nEuropean allies to live up to the commitments they have made to provide \nassistance to the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo shortly after \nreturning from a trip to the region in January. I was greatly troubled \nby what I saw in Kosovo--a U.N. peacekeeping mission that was out of \nmoney; a civil implementation effort that had barely begun, almost \nseven months after the war had ended; and U.S. and other NATO troops \nhaving to make up for shortfalls on the civilian side by performing a \nvariety of non-military missions, from performing basic police \nfunctions to running towns and villages, to acting as judges and \njuries. I could not allow this situation to continue without reviewing \nthe issue with our allies and bringing it to the attention of my \ncolleagues.\n  The United Sates bore the major share of the military burden for the \nair war on behalf of Kosovo--flying almost 70 percent of the strike and \nsupport sorties, at a cost of over $4.0 billion to the U.S. taxpayer \nand great personal risk to our aviators. In return, the Europeans \npromised to pay the major share of the burden to secure the peace. \nEuropean nations and institutions quickly volunteered billions in \nassistance and thousands of personnel for the effort to rebuild Kosovo. \nUnfortunately, as I discovered in January, these resources and \npersonnel were not making their way to Kosovo--commitments were simply \nnot becoming realities.\n  I introduced legislation that had a very clear and simple purpose: to \ntell our European allies that we would not allow the commitment of U.S. \nmilitary personnel to Kosovo to drift on endlessly because of the \nfailure of the Europeans to live up to their commitments. My \nlegislation would have done no more than hold our allies accountable \nfor the pledges and commitments they freely made.\n  For a variety of reasons, a form of the legislation that I originally \nsponsored failed in the Senate on a close vote. However, Congressman \nKasich, after consulting with me, pursued similar legislation as an \namendment to the defense authorization bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. The Kasich amendment passed the House by an \noverwhelming margin--over 100 votes. It was this amendment that we \naddressed during our conference.\n  I believe that the legislation Congressman Kasich and I jointly \npursued this year has had a very positive effect. Money and personnel \nfor civil implementation efforts are now flowing into Kosovo. Our \nallies are making credible progress in fulfilling their commitments. \nThe civil implementation effort in Kosovo is now moving forward. While \nmore clearly needs to be done, it was the feeling of a majority of the \nconferees--myself included--that the Kosovo legislation had largely \nachieved its purpose, and keeping this legislation in the final \nconference report could have a negative impact on relations with our \nallies and, perhaps, developments in Kosovo.\n  In place of the Kasich language, the conferees included a provision \nwhich requires the President to submit semiannual reports to the \nCongress, beginning in December of this year, on the progress being \nmade by our allies in fulfilling their commitments in Kosovo. Such \nreports will allow the Congress to keep track of developments in this \nimportant area. If these reports reveal that progress again lags, it is \nthe intention of this Senator to pursue legislation in the future \ndesigned to ensure greater burden sharing by our European allies in \nthis crucial venture.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank all of the members and staff of the \nSenate and House Armed Services Committee for their hard work and \ncooperation. This bill sends a strong signal to our men and women in \nuniform and their families that Congress fully supports them as they \nperform their missions around the world with courage and dedication.\n  I am confident that enactment of this conference report will enhance \nthe quality of life for our service men and women and their families, \nstrengthen the modernization and readiness of our Armed Forces, and \nbegin to address newly emerging threats to our security. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to adopt the recommendations of the conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I especially thank my distinguished friend and ranking \nmember for the cooperation he has given me. This is the 22nd year we \nhave served together in the Senate. We have been partners all these \nmany years. We are proud to have the joint responsibility of the \nleadership of the committee that tries at every juncture to exert \nwisdom and decisions reflecting bipartisanship and, as in the famous \nwords of another Senator, we check politics at the water's edge, \nparticularly as it relates to the forward-deployed troops of our Armed \nForces.\n  We are proud of that record. We have worked together very well. There \nwas unanimous signing of the conference report which is presently \nbefore the Senate. I am very proud of the participation of all members \nof our committee and, indeed, the superb staffs of both the majority \nand minority.\n  I join my distinguished colleague, the President pro tempore and \nformer chairman, in recognizing this bill is named for Floyd Spence, \nthe chairman\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\nof the House committee. Chairman Spence has served many years. He was a \nWorld War II veteran in the Navy and rose to the rank of captain. He \nhas had a distinguished public service record in the United States. It \nis most fitting that this bill be named in his honor.\n  Mr. President, I see the presence of our distinguished colleague from \nAlabama. Perhaps he would like to follow the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If that is appropriate, I will be honored to follow the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Wellstone, to be correct. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent he be recognized following Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, unless the managers, Mr. Levin or myself, \nfor some reason need to be recognized.\n  For the second year in a row, the conference report before the Senate \nauthorizes a real increase in defense spending. We have built on the \nmomentum of last year by authorizing $309.9 billion in new budget \nauthority for Defense for the fiscal year 2001, $4.6 billion above the \nrequest of the President of the United States.\n  That additional funding over and above the President's request was \nthe result of the actions of many Senators, most particularly our \nSenate leadership, Republican and Democratic, the Budget Committee \nchairman, Senator Domenici, the ranking member, and others, and I \ncertainly had a strong hand in it. We had a record to take before the \nSenate to justify that increase, and that record, in large measure, was \nput together by the Joint Chiefs of Staff; specifically, the Chiefs of \nthe Services who have periodically come before the Congress and, in \naccordance with the clear understanding between the Congress and the \nService Chiefs, to give us their opinions with regard to the needs for \ntheir respective military departments and, indeed, the other \ndepartments. They give us those professional opinions, even though \nthose opinions at times are at variance with the statements of the \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, and possibly even the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The Service Chiefs have come forward repeatedly and told us about the \nneeds over and above budget requests. Therefore, at this time, I \nspecifically thank them for their service and thank them also for \nstanding up for those in uniform and their families in their respective \nmilitary departments.\n  When you are down there, whether it is an enlisted man or junior \nofficer, looking up to those four-stars, it is a long way, but they are \nthe leaders and they are the most trusted of all, the most unbiased. \nWhen it comes to politics, there is not a trace. They are there for the \ninterest of our Nation and most specifically for those who every day \nfollow their orders. I thank them.\n  They confirmed what we all know: That today, the U.S. military is \noverdeployed and underresourced, resource in terms of people, dollars, \nprocurement, and O funds. I will go into detail about them in the \ncourse of this debate.\n  Since early 1990, the U.S. military has been sent on operations \noverseas at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, that force \nstructure was reduced by a third and defense spending was declining \nevery year up until 2 years ago. From the end of the war in Vietnam \nuntil 1989, the records of the Pentagon show there were 60 military \ndeployments.\n  From basically 1989 until today, there have been 343 deployments in \nsharp contrast to the 60 in the preceding period. This represents over \na 500-percent increase in our deployments. These statistics tell the \nstory.\n  I am not suggesting in any way that most of these deployments were \nabsolutely essential. Many were in the vital security interests of the \nUnited States. As I think quite properly, those contending for the \nPresidency today, both Republican and Democrat, have pointed out that \nthey will watch very carefully what has been brought to the attention, \nlargely by the Congress and the Chiefs, that they are overdeployed and \nunderresourced. Those are the statistics of this period basically from \n1989 until today.\n  While the rate of military deployments is established by the \nPresident, the Congress, with our constitutional powers, is continuing \nto support the Armed Forces by improving the quality of life for the \nmen and women in uniform and their families, and the President, in his \nbudget submissions, has done that. But each time in the past 3 years, \nthe Congress has gone above the President's request to add what we can, \ngiven the budget constraints, to further improve the quality of life of \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces, to further increase procurement, \nto further increase O funds because we are highly aware of that \ntheme--overdeployed and underresourced.\n  The conference report takes great strides in the direction to \nimprove, over and above that requested by the President, the quality of \nlife of our men and women and, I may say, the retirees.\n  I am proud of our committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nrecords show, is the first committee in the Senate to recognize the \nneed for revising the health care program for career military retirees. \nBasically, that is 20 years or, in the case of those who have medical \nretirement, earlier than 20, but the career military have long been \nneglected.\n  I want to credit the many organizations and many individuals who \napproached this chairman, who approached, I believe, every Member of \nthe Senate, and brought to their attention the need for correction. \nThat correction, I am proud to say, is incorporated in this conference \nreport and will be given in great detail.\n  Basically, these retirees, in my judgment, have been entitled to this \nfor many years. In my judgment, they were promised this. At a later \npoint in this debate, I will go into the specifics because I have \nresearched it way back. And now, at long last, in this 2001 \nappropriations, we make the start for a health care program to have the \ncare for those retirees which they deserve and to which they have been \nentitled for many years. One of the most important single items in this \nconference report is this military health care.\n  History shows that our military retirees are the best recruiters of \nall. One of the direct consequences of our military being overdeployed \nand underresourced--I will use that refrain over and over again--has \nbeen the difficulty in recruiting the needed personnel, the difficulty \nin retaining the middle grade officers primarily, and the middle grade \nenlisted, particularly those with skills that are in direct competition \nwith our ever-burgeoning economy in the private sector, who know full \nwell that to get a military person--trained in computers, trained in \nelectronics--they know they get a well-trained, well-disciplined, \nreliable employee.\n  That is quite a lure to these young men and women who are \noverdeployed, who suffer so much family separation. There has been an \nover 500-percent increase in these military deployments in the past \ndecade or so. So that is the reason we are having difficulty in meeting \nour recruiting goals.\n  But we are beginning to put a fix in to take care of the retirees, so \nonce again they can go out, as they have done in the past--I am not \nsuggesting they withstood recruiting, but certainly some of the \nincentive has been lacking because they have not been treated fairly--\nand, once again, they will be in the forward vanguard of recruiting. \nThey are the best recruiters of all.\n  I have to say on a personal note, my father served in World War I. I \nam very proud of his service and believe he recruited me in World War \nII by simply saying: It is your duty, son. Although I had very modest \nservice at the conclusion of, the end of that war, fathers like him all \nthroughout the country--and some mothers--were the recruiters long \nbefore we got to the recruiting station.\n  The conference report before the Senate fulfills an important \ncommitment of health care for life, as we have determined because in \nWorld War II, history shows, and continuing through the Korean war, and \nindeed through Vietnam, the goal of making that commitment was to \nencourage service members to remain in uniform and become careerists. \nSimply put, there was the commitment of health care for life in \nexchange for their dedicated career service.\n  Let me describe for my colleagues and for our active and retired \nservice\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nmembers around the world the legislation in this conference report to \nauthorize health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees \nand their families. First, our committee, we were in the forward \nvanguard of this. Then we were joined by the House. But let me describe \nwhat we have done in this bill jointly--Senate and House--in this \nconference report.\n\n  Military medical care requirements for active duty service members \nand their families were recognized as early as the 1700s. That is how \nfar back in the history of our country it goes--George Washington's \nContinental Army. Congressional action in the late 1800s directed \nmilitary medical officers to tend to military families, whenever \npossible, at no cost to the family.\n  During World War II, with so many service members on active duty, the \nmilitary medical system could not handle the health care requirements \nof many family members. The Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program \nwas authorized by Congress to meet that need in that wartime period. \nThis program was administered through State health agencies. The \nearliest reference in statute defining the health care benefit for \nmilitary retirees was in 1956, when for the first time, the Dependent's \nMedical Care Act specified that military retirees were eligible for \nhealth care in military facilities on a space-available basis.\n  In 1966, a decade later, this act was amended to create the Civilian \nHealth and Medical Care Program of the Uniformed Services, called \nCHAMPUS, to supplement the care provided in military facilities. This \nlegislation, in 1966, specifically excluded from coverage military \nretirees who were eligible for Medicare, a program which had been \nenacted by the Congress 1 year earlier, in 1965.\n  All of us have heard from military retirees who served a full career \nand in so doing made many sacrifices. Many times the sacrifices these \nheroic retirees made resulted in serious medical conditions that \nmanifested themselves in a time in their lives when they were pushed \nout of the military health care program. As a nation, we promised these \ndedicated retirees health care for life, but at that period we were \nignoring that promise of America.\n  On February 23, 2000, I introduced a bill, S. 2087, that provided for \naccess to mail-order pharmaceuticals for all Medicare-eligible military \nretirees. This was the first time that has ever been done. The \nlegislation would also improve access to benefits under TRICARE and \nextend and improve certain demonstration programs under the Defense \nHealth Program.\n  On May 1, 2000, I introduced S. 2486, which added a retail pharmacy \ncomponent to the previous legislation, providing for a full pharmacy \nbenefit for all retirees, including those eligible for Medicare.\n  Now, I staged this purposely because throughout this period I was in \nconsultation with the many veterans groups who came forward in that \nperiod, experts who had studied this for a long time and brought to my \nattention the added requirements in the legislation.\n  While I and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were \nworking on this legislation, we were doing so in consultation regularly \nwith those organizations representing the retired military and the \nDepartment of Defense. It is interesting, Secretary Cohen had some \ndifficulty, understandably, because of his budget constraints. But I \nknow in his heart of hearts he was concerned about the military \nretirees, as were the Chiefs. But the time came when the Chiefs had the \nopportunity to express their opinions, which, as I say, were at \nvariance with those of the Secretary of Defense and, indeed, the \nPresident. They told us about the need for this legislation.\n  So while I thank the Senate and most particularly our committee for \npioneering this effort for the first time in the history of the \nCongress, we owe a debt of gratitude to so many others who helped us, \ngave us the encouragement, and, indeed, showed us the path to follow.\n  On June 6, Senator Tim Hutchinson and I introduced S. 2669, a bill \nthat would extend TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and \ntheir families regardless of age. Later that same day, I amended the \nDefense authorization bill to add the text of S. 2669. This legislation \nprovided uninterrupted access to the military health care system, known \nas TRICARE, to all retirees.\n  While the Senate bill extended TRICARE eligibility to all military \nretirees and their families regardless of age, the Defense \nauthorization bill passed by the House of Representatives took a \ndifferent approach. I respect their approach, but it was different from \nours.\n  The House bill expanded and made permanent the Medicare subvention \nprogram. Medicare subvention is a program that is currently being \ntested in 10 sites across the country. Under Medicare subvention, the \nHealth Care Financing Agency of the Department of Health and Human \nServices reimburses the Department of Defense for providing health care \nto Medicare-eligible military retirees in military hospitals.\n  There were two significant problems with Medicare's subvention in the \njudgment of the Senate, and particularly the conferees, when we got to \nconference.\n  First, the amount in the reimbursement from Medicare to DOD falls \nwell short of the actual cost of providing that care, causing DOD to \nabsorb a loss for each retiree covered by the program.\n  Second, expanding Medicare subvention nationwide would provide access \nto health care only for those beneficiaries living in proximity to the \nremaining DOD medical facilities. In contrast, the Senate bill covered \n100 percent of the Medicare-eligible military retirees, regardless of \nwhere they live.\n  This is important; I emphasize that. Many of the military retirees \nlive under very modest circumstances and have sought places in our \nNation for their retirement homes which cost less and, therefore, very \noften are not co-located with large military facilities and military \nmedical hospitals. They are scattered. It has been a burden on some of \nthose people through the years to travel considerable distances to \navail themselves of such medical assistance as was afforded to them \nprior to this bill.\n  Since the Defense authorization conference began in late July, Senate \nand House conferees have been working towards the mutual goal of \nadopting legislation which would provide comprehensive health care to \nall military retirees regardless of age. I am pleased to announce that \nthe conference report to accompany the National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2001 includes a permanent health care benefit for \nretirees modeled on the Senate's original version to have it permanent.\n  I am delighted that we have honored the commitment of health care for \nlife that was made to those who proudly served the Nation on a \npermanent basis.\n  I acknowledge the strong participation by the House conferees; \nindeed, the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the House \nSubcommittee on Personnel, and Chairman Spence, Chairman Stump. I could \nmention many who worked on this. That was a subject of some concern in \nthe conference because Senator Levin and I, when we had our bill on the \nfloor with provisions which would, in an orderly way, have enabled us \nto have permanency to this program, were going to be challenged on a \npoint of order. That may occur again today. Frankly, I would rather \nhave it occur today than when this bill first was on the floor 2 months \nor so ago for various reasons.\n  So the conferees made the decision--a bold one--that they would make \nthis permanent, and we now present that to the Senate. It had always \nbeen my intent to make this health care permanent. In fact, when we \noriginally introduced the legislation in February, with the support of \nmany in the Senate, there was no time limit on the benefits contained \nin the early Senate bills and amendments. I have covered the history of \nhow we have gotten where it is now permanent.\n  The net effect of funding this important program as an entitlement \nwould be similar to funding it from within the discretionary accounts \nof the Department of Defense. There is little net cost to the Federal \nGovernment. Permanently funding the military retiree health care \nbenefit will be seen by retirees, active duty service members, and \npotential recruits, both enlisted\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\nand officers, as the Nation keeping its commitment to health care for \nlife to military retirees. Those serving today and those who are \njoining the military will see that the promise of a lifetime of health \ncare in return for a career will be honored by America.\n  Two weeks ago in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the House Armed Services Committee, Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and each of the Service Chiefs strongly \nsupported making this benefit permanent and using the accrual account \nmethods of financing. While I respect the right of any Senator to raise \na point of order, I am urging my colleagues to consider the benefits of \nthe health care provisions of this bill which are fully justified. We \nwould not want to leave our over-65 military retirees in doubt about \nour intentions with respect to their future medical care.\n  This issue is on the 1 yard line, ready to be carried across for a \ntouchdown by the Senate, hopefully within a matter of hours.\n  These retirees must make critical decisions regarding their medical \ninsurance plans and medical care. By making this health care plan a \npermanent entitlement, we are truly fulfilling the commitment made to \nall those who have completed a career in uniform and to those \ncontemplating a career in the future.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this time so as to move along. I \nwill return to my remarks at a later point.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague. Again, I thank \nSenator Levin for his untiring efforts on our behalf to create this \nhistoric piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me congratulate Senator Warner, \nour chairman, for his distinguished service, as always, for his total \ncommitment to the men and women in the military, for trying to produce \na bipartisan product which we have produced again this year. Without \nhis leadership, this would not be possible. I, first and foremost, \nthank my good friend John Warner for again coming through with a really \ngood bill that I think will command the large number of votes which \nwill be forthcoming.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I know he would wish \nto share, with me, such credit for this legislation with all members on \nboth sides of the aisle of the Armed Services Committee. We have a \ngreat team.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That was indeed the next point. We are blessed with a \ncommittee which operates on a bipartisan basis. The members of the \ncommittee work well together. The chairmen of our subcommittees work \nwell. Our staffs work well together. We have many blessings to count \nbeing able to serve in this body and to serve our Nation, but surely \none of our great blessings is being on a committee which is able to \noperate on such a bipartisan basis.\n  I echo Chairman Warner's comments about the tragedy in Yemen this \nmorning that involved the Navy ship, the U.S.S. Cole. Our hearts and \nprayers go out to the families of those who have been lost in this \ndespicable act of terrorism. Our hearts and prayers go out to the \nsailors who have survived who are now struggling for life. Our hearts \nand prayers go out to their families. We are in, as we surely \nunderstand, for a long battle against terrorist acts.\n  I notice my good friend from Kansas on the floor, chairman of the \nsubcommittee that addresses new threats we face. The terrorist threat \nwhich was exemplified this morning in Yemen has been repeatedly pointed \nout by him and other members of the subcommittee and of the Senate as \nbeing the type of threat that we face. That kind of terrorist act is a \nreal world threat which is here and now.\n  That was not a weapon of mass destruction, but it was a weapon that \ncaused massive injury, massive death. We must put our brains and our \nresources together with allies to try to prevent these kinds of actions \nfrom occurring and, when they do occur, to bring the perpetrators to \njustice.\n  The Senator from New York has requested that I yield 5 minutes to him \nso he may make a statement at this time. The order that we had \nestablished by unanimous consent was that after my opening statement \nthe Senator from Minnesota would be recognized, and then the Senator \nfrom Alabama would be recognized. I want someone on the other side of \nthe aisle to hear this, but I ask unanimous consent that that be \nmodified at this time so I may defer my opening statement to yield to \nthe Senator from New York 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nMichigan. He is gracious as always, and I appreciate the opportunity to \nbriefly interrupt this proceeding. I also compliment him and Senator \nWarner on the bill they have put together. As was mentioned, the whole \nChamber admires the bipartisan way in which the Senators from Michigan \nand Virginia have worked together.\n  I rise today to say I am stunned and saddened by the violence which \nhas erupted in the Middle East. I am saddened by the loss of four \ninnocent and brave American sailors, victims of malicious, malevolent, \nmaddening terrorism that has no rationale, no justification.\n  My prayers and thoughts are with their families, as well as with \nthose who have been injured and those who are missing, and their \nfamilies as well. Terrorism can strike anywhere at any time. We have to \nbe doing all we can in this Chamber to deal with it.\n  I am stunned also that after 7 years of good faith negotiations all \ntoo many Palestinians still see violence as the means to achieve their \nends. The violent pictures we saw of the two Israeli reservists being \nthrown from a window and brutally beaten is enough to turn anyone's \nstomach. Pictures such as that and so many other pictures that we have \nseen are not only very disturbing to us, but it lessens the chances for \npeace in the Middle East.\n  I am disappointed and sad that Chairman Arafat has failed to stop or \neven condemn the violence. Yasser Arafat says he is for peace and he \nhas signed agreements for peace. Yet violence has erupted in the Middle \nEast and not only has he failed to stop it, you don't hear a word of \ncondemnation. Instead, one may feel that he misguidedly thinks violence \nis a means to an end. I am saddened that a peace process which saw the \ncourage and sacrifice of leaders such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak \nmay be crumbling before our eyes. The prospect for peace, at least in \nthe near future, has been shattered by today's events.\n  I have been a supporter of the Oslo peace process because I truly \nbelieve that peace is the only realistic, long-term alternative for \nIsrael and Israel's Arab neighbors. It will be through peace that they \nachieve strength and security. It will be through peace that Israel \nwill have its future aglow with possibilities. But now, to be honest, I \nam not so sure what will come of the Oslo peace process, let alone how \nmuch more Israel can sacrifice in the name of peaceful compromise which \nmay never come to be. Prime Minister Barak went further than anyone \ndreamed he could go, and even those exceedingly generous and courageous \noffers were rejected.\n  Peace has to be a two-way street; otherwise, it is just empty \npromises.\n  Chairman Arafat must be called to task for his inability to control \nthe violence and to embrace peace. The sad truth is that while Israeli \nleaders were preparing their citizens for peace by bringing them to \naccept the compromises necessary for peace, Arafat was doing the \nopposite. He was making false promises to his people and raising false \nhopes.\n  If there is to be real peace in the Middle East, Chairman Arafat has \na responsibility to prepare his people for peace, not violence. That \nmeans changing Palestinian textbooks which still call for the \ndestruction of Israel. It also means stopping the rhetoric of hate \nconcerning Jewish claims to Jerusalem's holy sites. Most of all, it \nmeans telling his people, as Ehud Barak has, that compromise is the way \nto attain a fair and just settlement, and that violence is no longer an \noption.\n  As a result, today, sadly, extremists on both sides have been \nstrengthened. Who has benefited from what has happened in the last 10 \ndays? Ideologues, and only ideologues; not average people, whether they \nbe Jew, Arab, Christian, or Moslem.\n  I believe Mr. Arafat will rue the day he let this genie out of the \nbottle. He\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\nhas let forces loose and he now has a tiger by the tail, and I even \nwonder whether he can survive.\n  To the Israelis, I say: Stay the course, even at this painful moment. \nIt will be very easy to throw up one's hands and give up. Yes, be \nstrong, and make sure that when a horrible thing such as happened to \nthe two in Ramallah happens, there will be a price paid. But don't give \nup on the course to peace; don't give up to those who will tell you \nthere is another solution. There is not.\n\n  To my fellow Americans, I say: First, we are so saddened, again, by \nthe loss of innocent lives--people defending America as Americans have \nfor more than 200 years. I also say to my American brethren that we \ncan't isolate ourselves, that this conflict in the Middle East is not \none on which we can turn our backs. Just look; not only are four \nAmericans dead; several more are missing and many more injured, and oil \nprices are up. We are carefully watching movements of troops in Iraq \nand Iran at this moment. We are worried about terrorism even on our own \nshores. No, we all must stay the course.\n  As I mentioned, the prospects for peace in the Near East have been \nshattered by today's actions. Only by strong, courageous but careful \nand judicious action by people of good will--Americans, Israelis, and \nArabs--can those pieces be put back together. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for 30 \nseconds, I know other colleagues want to respond, but I say to my \ncolleague from New York in as sincere a way as I can, I thought his \nwords were powerful and eloquent. They were beautifully written, \nbeautifully said, and very important. I want to associate myself with \nhim. I know I can't speak on it as well as the Senator did, so I \nassociate myself with what he said. It is just the way I think about it \nand feel about it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Presiding Officer \nthis: It is my understanding that the Senator from Michigan will be \nrecognized next, to be followed by the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, to be followed by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized \nfollowing the remarks by Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the Senator from New York is still on \nthe floor, I commend him for his thoughtful comments about the Middle \nEast. I was not only struck by the content of his comments, but also by \nthe way in which they were so forcefully and calmly delivered, which I \nthink will reverberate throughout this Chamber.\n  These are times of great violence in the Middle East. One of the most \nstriking things to me is the silence of Chairman Arafat relative to \nviolence. Prime Minister Barak has said to his own citizens, ``I urge \nour Jewish citizens to refrain from attacking Arabs and their property \nunder any circumstances.'' From Chairman Arafat, we have had silence \nabout the actions of the Palestinians in the streets. That silence \nspeaks volumes. It was referred to by the good Senator from New York, \nand I want to again say that I thought his comments were exactly the \nright substance and tone.\n  I also want to expand on that one thought, about what we have not \nheard once from Chairman Arafat, which is a statement saying that \nviolence--by whoever--is wrong. We have not even gotten that much from \nChairman Arafat, and it is a huge and very obvious and intentional \nomission on his part, which speaks very loudly about what his \nintentions are.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New York summed up \nmy feelings. I think Americans have to understand that tiny, little \nIsrael, the only democracy in that part of the world--surrounded by \nsome of the worst tyrannies in the world--is having a very difficult \ntime right now. If there was ever a country in the history of the \nUnited States that has shown their friendship to the United States it \nhas been Israel. During this time of need for Israel, we have to show \nour friendship toward them--no one wants to see the violence taking \nplace--and recognize that Israel is a democracy. It was in 1948. It is \ntoday.\n  As my friend from Michigan said, I hope we will have Chairman Arafat \ncome forward and do something publicly to denounce what is taking place \non the Palestinian side. It has been despicable--from the raiding of \nthe tomb, to the terrible murders of these two Israeli soldiers today.\n  I support the statement made by my friend from New York, and \ncertainly my friend from Michigan who is managing this bill. Today, of \nall days, signifies to me the importance of the work that he and \nSenator Warner have done to get this bill to this point so we can \nauthorize the many things that need to be done by the U.S. military. We \nhave talked about the act of terrorism against our U.S. Navy, and this \nbill addresses that.\n  As I said yesterday, the Senator from Michigan is to be commended for \nhis work on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. He is \nalways thoughtful and on the point. He joins those of us who have \ncommented on the tragic loss of our sailors and on the injuries to our \nsailors on the U.S.S. Cole because not only is it happening at the \nmoment--this act of terrorism--but it is dramatizing what the major \nthreats to our security are. But it is just another reminder of the \nsacrifices of the men and women of our military and the risk that they \nface every day in this world.\n  I thank him for his comments.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues for not \nonly their kind remarks but for their leadership on this and some other \nissues. It is a pleasure to serve in the Senate under such leaders as \nthe Senators from Michigan and Nevada. I thank them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the good Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, let me now continue with my remarks relative to the \nDefense authorization bill itself.\n  The most far-reaching step that we have taken in this conference \nreport is to answer the call of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff to address shortcomings in the health care program. We provide \nhealth care for our military personnel and our retirees and their \nfamilies. But there are shortcomings. There are gaps. There are holes. \nThere are lapses. We are trying to fill those. We are trying to make \nthe commitment of health care to our military men and women and to \ntheir families, and after they retire, a real-world commitment. We want \nto fulfill the promise of lifetime health care to those who complete a \nmilitary career by providing, as we do in this bill, that retired \nmembers and their families remain in the TRICARE health program for \nlife. When they become eligible for Medicare, TRICARE would serve as a \nMedigap-type policy and pay virtually all costs for medical care that \nare not covered by Medicare itself. This means that retirees will be \nable to choose any medical provider that accepts Medicare, and TRICARE \nwould pay the deductibles and the copayments.\n  Second, the budget request that we approved improves access to health \ncare for families of active duty members by eliminating deductibles and \ncopayments for care provided by the TRICARE program.\n  We would also make TRICARE Prime available to the families of service \nmembers assigned to remote locations where they don't have access to \nmilitary treatment facilities. And we provide for physical exams for \nfamily members when required for school enrollment.\n  Finally, we would address the rising price of prescription drugs by \nproviding a generous pharmacy benefit for military retirees. Under this \nprovision, prescriptions filled in a military facility will be free. \nPrescriptions filled through the military's national mail-order \npharmacy will cost $8 for a 90-day supply. Retirees would pay a 20-\npercent copayment for prescriptions filled in a way which is on an \napproved list of retail pharmacies. There is the so-called ``network \nretail pharmacy.'' They\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\nwould pay a 25-percent copay for prescriptions filled in a non-network \nretail pharmacy; in other words, from a pharmacy not on the approved \nlist.\n  I am appalled, as so many Members of this body are appalled, by the \nrising costs of pharmaceuticals in this country, and by the growing gap \nbetween the prices paid for drugs by our citizens and people who live \nin other countries--frequently, by the way, for prescription drugs \nmanufactured in this country and often subsidized either directly by \ntaxpayers in the form of NIH grants to people who develop those drugs \nand do the research on them, and indirectly through the Tax Code. We \nprovide credits for research and development. We have this gap between \nwhat our citizens pay and citizens in other countries pay for drugs \nmanufactured in the United States. We are not curing that gap in this \nbill, except we are taking a step relative to military retirees. This \nstep at least addresses that problem for military retirees.\n  It is my hope that before the end of this session or in the next \nCongress that we will provide a similar benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  The importance of this prescription drug program is shown by the \neffort that was made to achieve it. The importance of this benefit is \nreflected in the fact that military retirees brought to our attention \nthe extraordinary expense to them of prescription drugs. We are \nresponding to that. We have a moral obligation to respond to that \nbecause we made a commitment to them.\n  This country has a moral obligation surely to our seniors--I think to \nall of us, but at least to our seniors--to make prescription drugs \naffordable. We haven't made the same kind of commitment technically to \nour seniors. But surely we should feel the moral obligation to make \nsure our seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs. That \ncommitment that we surely should feel, I believe, will be advanced by \nthis action that we are taking relative to our military retirees. \nHopefully it will prod us to do the same for all of our seniors as we \ndo for our military retirees in the area of prescription drugs.\n  We cannot overlook the fact that these provisions are going to be \nexpensive to implement. This bill would establish a new entitlement \nprogram for military retiree health care at an estimated cost of $60 \nbillion. The $60 billion cost of this program is over the next 10 \nyears. It is actually, technically, a $40 billion net cost to the \nGovernment for reasons that I will go into when we get to the waiver of \nthe point of order relative to the budget.\n\n  It is a significant amount of money, $60 billion of direct spending, \nor $40 billion net, over the next 10 years. Either one of those numbers \nis a big number. We should be very conscious of what we are doing. That \nis why it is very important this body act openly and forthrightly on \nthis proposal.\n  Senator Warner mentioned that we had made a proposal in committee \nwhich would have achieved this same goal on a phased-in basis, first \nfor 2 years and then permanently, in a way which would have met the \nrequirements of the Budget Act without creating a point of order.\n  In the wisdom of the conferees, we made this a permanent benefit. It \nis the right thing to do. But there is a cost to it which exceeds the \namount of money this committee has been authorized to allocate under \nour mandatory spending limits. This body will then be offered the \nopportunity and presented with the question: Do we wish to waive that \nlimit, to use the waiver authority as provided for us in the Budget \nAct, in order to approve this permanent benefit?\n  That will be argued at a later time in this debate. I intend to vote \nto waive the Budget Act and permit this benefit to go into effect for \nour retirees. However, it is important that this body, when it exceeds \nthese spending allocations, does so in a way where everyone has a \nchance to recognize what it is we are doing in that regard.\n  As I said, there was no provision made in this year's budget \nresolution for this level of mandatory spending. We were given a very \nsmall amount, closer to half a billion. There was a way we could have \noperated within that level in a 2-year program, then expecting to make \nthat permanent later on in a way which would have complied with the \nBudget Act. But this conference went in a different direction. It is a \nreasonable approach, perhaps even a more straightforward approach. In \nany event, it does create this point of order which we now need to \naddress in this bill.\n  I believe these steps to address problems in the military health care \nsystem are the right thing to do. Again, we just should do so openly. \nWe should not do so blindly. The problem is not with this bill but in \nthe budget resolution itself, which is not realistic in the amount of \nmoney it provided for this and for other purposes.\n  The conference report also includes a title numbered 35 in the Senate \nbill which is the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nProgram. This Nation now has a great debt to the many workers in our \nnuclear weapons facilities who played such a vital role in winning the \ncold war, a deterrent which they produced which was able to deter \naggression to help maintain security and peace. But we now know that \nmany of these workers were exposed to dangerous radioactive and \nchemical materials in the course of their work, and they are now \nsuffering from debilitating and often fatal illnesses as a result. It \nis simple justice that these workers and their families should be \ncompensated for those illnesses.\n  The Department of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nAct provides that compensation, and it does so in a fair and balanced \nmanner. We were able to overcome significant opposition in the House of \nRepresentatives and provide compensation to the loyal Department of \nEnergy workers who were poisoned by that work in support of our \nNation's defense. Now there is a cost. We should be aware of that cost. \nIt is a cost of $1.1 billion over 5 years and about $1.6 billion over \n10 years.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conferees rejected a House \nprovision which would have prohibited the continued deployment of \nUnited States ground combat forces in Kosovo under \ncertain circumstances. What the House provision said was, if the \nspecified contributions by our allies for civilian policing and \nreconstruction were not met by a target date, then our troops would \nautomatically be withdrawn.\n\n  First of all, our European allies are almost to those levels. They \nare now clearly the senior partner in Kosovo. That is the right thing. \nWe want our allies to be senior partners and the United States to be \nthe junior partner. Many times we are not the senior partner. That is a \nvery good development.\n  It would be a mistake, and this body voted it would be a mistake, to \nput in an automatic withdrawal date because of the uncertainty that \nwould create, the weakening of the NATO alliance which would be \ncreated, and the negative impact of morale on our men and women who \nwould then believe, somehow or other between now and that automatic \nremoval date, that our troops may be removed. That kind of uncertainty \nis not healthy either in terms of who our adversary was and could still \nbecome theoretically; it is not healthy in terms of the NATO alliance; \nit is not healthy in terms of the morale of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  We have all put pressure on our European allies to do more. It is \nsomething in which many of us, if not most of us, believe. They are now \ndoing more. Our response should be a positive response rather than this \nautomatic threat that unless they meet a specified numerical target by \na fixed date, something would automatically happen without any further \naction of the Congress.\n  The process in the House bill, which was rejected by the Senate after \na lengthy floor debate, but adopted by the House, would have led to the \nautomatic withdrawal of our forces, even if there was no action in the \nfuture by Congress. That at least, in my judgment, would not have been \na responsible exercise of congressional authority but rather its \nabdication. Putting this on automatic pilot would not have been the \nbest way to exercise congressional authority.\n  We have the power of the purse, and we have a right to exercise it. \nIf we want to withdraw troops, we have the right to do that. If we have \ntroops in too many places, we have the right to say: Pull them out, \ndon't spend any money to keep them there. We have that responsibility. \nIf we are in too many places, we are the ones with the\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\npower of the purse. We can say: Pull forces out of here, pull forces \nout of there.\n  The specific effort to do that was made relative to Kosovo. It was \nrejected. I am glad, by the way, that both the candidates for President \nrejected that approach. But if we are going to do it, we ought to be \naccountable ourselves for doing it and not put something on automatic \npilot so that something will happen in the future even if we do nothing \nbetween now and then. That is not the way I believe the power of the \npurse should be used.\n  I believe very deeply in the power of the purse, and I believe there \nare occasions when we want to say we believe that troops should not be \nin a certain place and we are not going to provide money for it. But \nthat ought to be done directly and not be done at a future date in the \nabsence of a decision by the Congress.\n  The conferees also rejected a provision that would have placed \nburdensome restrictions on our efforts to support the antidrug effort \nin Colombia. We rejected a provision that undermined our ability to \nimplement agreements designed to prevent development of nuclear weapons \nby North Korea. We rejected a provision which implied that a national \nmissile defense would be deployed immediately without regard to the \nsystem's operational effectiveness or affordability or the impact that \nit might have on our overall national security. Those were unwise \nprovisions, in my judgment, and I am pleased they were not included in \nthe conference report. I am pleased the conferees did adopt a series of \nprovisions implementing the agreement between President Clinton and the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico regarding the status of training exercises by \nthe Navy and Marine Corps on the island of Vieques. Training on \nVieques, as we know, was suspended last year after the tragic death of \na security guard at the training range. The Secretary of the Navy, the \nChief of Naval Operations, and others have testified that there is just \nno adequate substitute for that training on the island of Vieques.\n\n  As of today, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has lived up to its \nobligations under the agreement. The training range on Vieques has been \ncleared of protesters with the assistance of the government of Puerto \nRico, and Navy training exercises have now resumed on the island with \nthe use of inert ordnance, as provided for in the agreement.\n  The Navy is working with the citizens of Vieques and others \nthroughout Puerto Rico towards the resumption of live-fire training on \nVieques. This bill, hopefully, provides the framework for the \nresumption of that training.\n  The President's budget request added $12 billion of defense spending \nto last year's appropriated levels, and the Congressional Budget \nResolution added an additional $4.5 billion. For the most part, the \nconference report spends this money wisely, to meet needs that were \nidentified as priorities by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or to accelerate \nitems that are included in the Future Years Defense Plan.\n  The bill also provides funding support and legislative guidance for \nkey Department of Defense priorities, including the Army's \ntransformation plan and the Joint Strike Fighter Program.\n  On the first point, the conference report provides appropriate \nsupport for the Army transformation plan, the plan that was put forward \nby Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki. The conferees concluded that \nthe Army needs to transform itself into a lighter, more lethal, \nsurvivable, and tactically mobile force. We approved all of the funds \nrequested by the Army for this purpose, and we actually added some \nresearch money to the amount requested to help the Army in the long-\nterm transformation process.\n  At the same time, we directed the Army to prepare a detailed roadmap \nfor the transformation initiative and to conduct appropriate testing \nand experimentation to ensure that the transformation effort is \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. President, I have a few more minutes but I have taken a little \nlonger than I expected. I would like, at this point, if the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is ready, to yield to him for his presentation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not want to break up the flow of \nmy colleague. I am pleased to follow the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Actually, if the Senator from Minnesota is ready to speak \nat this time, it will work to my convenience if I interrupt myself at \nthis moment and yield to the Senator, but I ask unanimous consent I \nthen be given back the floor for perhaps 10 more minutes of remarks \nfollowing the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Roberts was seeking \nto speak. Perhaps with that exception? The two of you could talk about \nthat, perhaps.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to comment on the request of the Senator \nfrom Alabama because he is correct. As I understand it, the order now \nis that at the end of my remarks Senator Wellstone is to be recognized, \nthe Senator from Alabama is to be recognized, and then the Senator from \nKansas is to be recognized.\n  What I am suggesting is that the remarks of the Senator from \nMinnesota come now in the middle of my remarks, I then complete my \nremarks following the Senator from Minnesota, and then we go back to \nthe Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Kansas; if that is all \nright?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is fine. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It will just take me 10 minutes more when Senator \nWellstone has finished. I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me again thank Senator Warner of \nVirginia for his statement about the crew of the U.S.S. Cole. My \nunderstanding is four American sailors have lost their lives, others \nhave been injured. As a Senator from Minnesota, I want to express my \nsupport and my concern. I do not think we have as yet knowledge of who \nis behind this. It certainly looks like a well-planned terrorist \nattack, but I echo the words of my colleague from the State of \nVirginia.\n  The chair of the committee, Senator Warner, and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Levin, are two of the best Senators in the Senate. \nTherefore, I want to speak with a little bit of humility because I \ndon't want this to come off as arrogant. I want to express my \nopposition to this bill. I don't think there will be many opposed, but \nI want to give this at least my best effort.\n  Let me start out with my own framework. I believe part of the \ndefinition of real national security for our Nation is a strong \nmilitary, but I also think part of the definition of real national \nsecurity is the security of our local communities--whether it is \naffordable housing, whether it is affordable child care, whether it is \ngood health care for citizens, or whether we have the best education \nfor every child. It is within this framework that I rise to speak \nagainst this bill.\n  The bill provides $309.8 billion for the military. That is $4.5 \nbillion more than the administration's request and $19 billion above \nfiscal year 2000 levels. Yet the majority party could not find the \nadditional money for more school counselors, could not find additional \nmoney for Head Start. One of the scandals is we keep talking about how \nimportant the early years are, we keep talking about how important the \nHead Start Program is to give children a head start. Yet I think we \nprovide funding for about 3 or 4 percent of the children who could \nbenefit from the Early Head Start Program.\n  The majority party could find the additional $4.5 billion, above and \nbeyond the administration's request, but they could not find the \nadditional money for affordable housing. They could not find additional \nmoney up to this time for prescription drug benefits for elderly \npeople. It is a matter of priorities. I think as long as our country is \nfirst in the world when it comes to spending on the military but ranks \n10th in the world when it comes to spending on education, we will never \nachieve our strength and our greatness.\n  The cry for more money, the rallying cry from some of my colleagues \nfor more Pentagon funding, was for readiness. We have heard about the \ncrisis in\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\nreadiness, lack of spare parts, inadequate training funds, difficulty \nretaining pilots and other key personnel, declining quality of life. I \nam all for the part of this budget that increases funding in these \ndecisive areas. But if you look at the category of spending with the \nlargest increase from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001, it is \nprocurement of weapons. It is not military readiness, with an 11-\npercent increase; or operations and maintenance, which funds most of \nthe readiness programs, which goes up 4 percent; or family housing, on \nthe other hand, which actually declines by 3 percent; military \nconstruction declines by 6 percent. These figures are from the Pentagon \nbudget authority.\n  But the real increase in the funding--if you look at fiscal year 1999 \nto fiscal year 2005, procurement increases 39 percent. This is the \nlargest increase in this Pentagon budget. In fact, 53 percent of the \nincrease in budget authority during this 6-year period goes to new \nweapons.\n  I have to ask the question in this post-cold war period, in an \nopportunity to redefine some of our priorities and to redefine national \nsecurity and to have a strong military, but also to make sure that we \nconcern ourselves with national security as in the security of local \ncommunities--good education, good health care, good jobs, affordable \nhousing. It seems to me this budget does much more for the military \ncontractors than it needs to do, is beyond the President's request. \nAnd, frankly, we are in a zero sum game. You cannot have it all. Money \nspent in one area is money not spent in another area.\n  I believe that overall what we have before us in this piece of \nlegislation, and the amount of money it calls for, for the Pentagon and \nmilitary, reflects some distorted priorities. It is for that reason I \nwill oppose this conference report.\n\n  Related to this question I have raised about budget priorities is an \namendment which was dropped from the conference report. This was an \namendment I offered, which was accepted, which asked that we in the \nCongress do a careful study of child poverty under welfare ``reform'' \nto find out how children are doing, to find out whether not only has \nthere been a decrease in poverty of children but among those children \nwho are poor--from the last report we received--we have an increase in \npoverty among children who are poor. I wanted us to do an honest policy \nevaluation.\n  Over the last 2 years I have offered this amendment four or five \ntimes, and every time it is dropped in conference committee--every \nsingle time. It seems to me we would want to know, as we move into the \nreauthorization of the welfare bill, what this dramatic decline in the \nwelfare roll means. Any fool can throw people off the welfare rolls. \nThat is easy. The question is, Where are the mothers and where are the \nchildren and are they better off?\n  Some I think are better off. For that I am grateful. Some have \nliving-wage jobs and can support their families, and that is what it \nwas supposed to be about. But I am telling my colleagues, I traveled \nsome of the country--I am going to do more over the next 2 years \nbecause obviously we need to know what is happening out there--and it \nis my observation that the vast majority of the women and children are \nin the following situation: These women are working but now they are \nworking poor. These jobs do not provide anywhere close to our salaries \nor even close to what would be called a living wage; in other words, on \nwhat they can support their families.\n  From the studies of Families USA and what I have seen with my own \neyes, too many of these women no longer have medical assistance for \nthemselves and their children and in all too many situations--Yale and \nBerkeley did a study on the child care situation--2- and 3-year-olds--\nthese are mothers with children--are in child care situations which at \nbest are inadequate and quite often are dangerous.\n  We have seen, roughly speaking, a 25- to 30-percent decline in food \nstamp participation, the major safety net for poor children.\n  I want to know what is happening out there. I would think colleagues \nwould want to know, but sometimes we do not want to know what we do not \nwant to know.\n  For the fourth or fifth time, this amendment has been dropped, and I \nhave come to the floor to express my opposition to the dropping of this \namendment. The majority party found $4 billion more than the \nadministration requested, I am sorry, but is unwilling to do an honest \npolicy evaluation of the welfare bill, its effect on children, the \npoverty of children, and whether we can do better for poor children. \nThat is a misplaced priority.\n  When we come back next year--we will be moving into the period of \ntime of reauthorization of this welfare bill--one of my commitments as \na Senator from Minnesota is to do everything I can to focus the Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans, on an honest policy evaluation of what is \nhappening to poor women and poor children in our country.\n  I can think of better uses for some of this money in the Pentagon \nbudgets as opposed to new weapons systems, for example. I can see \nputting more into child care. I can see putting more into education. I \ncan see putting more into expanded health care coverage. I can see \nputting more into affordable housing. I can see putting more into \nmaking sure there is long-term care so elderly people are able to stay \nat home and live at home with dignity as opposed to being forced into \nnursing homes. I can see some other priorities.\n\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was passed by the Senate as an \namendment, was taken out of the conference. In the United States of \nAmerica, surely we as a people no longer accept the proposition that a \ncitizen can be killed or injured because of his or her race, national \norigin, religion, gender, disability and, yes, sexual orientation.\n  Not that long ago, James Byrd was dragged to death by the most \nvicious of racists, and he was killed for only one reason: He was \nblack.\n  It was less than a year ago that two men were killed and three others \nwere injured in Pittsburgh when a gunman shot them down for only one \nreason: They were white.\n  It was only a few months before that when a man went on a shooting \nspree in Chicago aiming at people for one reason and one reason alone, \nand that was because they were either black, Asian or Jewish.\n  Let's not forget Matthew Shepard who was killed in Wyoming for one \nreason and one reason only: He was gay.\n  The amendment we adopted in the Senate with 57 votes and was taken \nout of this conference report would have permitted Federal intervention \nin serious violent crimes. In addition, the crimes that would have been \ncovered would have included gender, disability, and sexual orientation.\n  There is not one Senator who can say that Matthew Shepard was not \nmurdered because of hate. By failing to keep this amendment in this \nconference report, we have communicated a message that says we still \ntolerate these hate crimes; we are not willing to take strong action.\n  The majority party took that amendment out of this conference report. \nThe majority party took the hate crimes amendment out of this \nconference report, and I think we have communicated a terrible message \nto the country.\n  Hate crimes are a kind of terrorism. They are not just meant to \nintimidate the victim but all those who belong to the group and make \nall of the people victims. They are meant to instill fear. They are \nmeant to communicate the idea that one group of people has supremacy \nover others. They are meant to dehumanize people. They say not just to \nthe victim but to all those who are like the victim: You are vulnerable \nand you could be next because you are gay, lesbian, transgender, or \nbisexual; you could be next because of your disability; you could be \nnext because of your religion; you could be next because of the color \nof your skin; you could be next because of your national origin. And \nthey took this amendment out of this conference report. I believe that \nis shameful, and that is another reason I am going to vote against this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, I have 30 minutes reserved. How much time do I have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 47 seconds.\n\n\n                     State Department Authorization\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Alabama, I will take a \ncouple more minutes to speak on one\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\nother related issue, not so much to this conference report.\n  While I am on the floor of the Senate, I express my disappointment--I \nhave to do this with a little bit of a twinkle in my eye--at the \neleventh hour attempt by some of my colleagues to ram through--and this \nis not, I say to the Senator from Virginia, in this conference report; \nthis is separate--an ill-conceived, unjust, and unbalanced ``bankruptcy \nreform'' through the Senate by co-opting an unrelated conference \nreport, although I am not surprised.\n  The fact that the House and the Senate Republican leadership is \nwilling to trample the traditions of the Senate in their rush to pass \nthis legislation speaks to the tremendous clout and the financial \nresources of the financial services industry.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is why I say I have to have a twinkle \nin my eye. This is a tactic straight out of ``Invasion of the Body \nSnatchers.'' Listen to this. House and Senate Republicans have taken a \nsecretly negotiated bankruptcy bill--I am sorry; I do no damage to the \ntruth when I say this--and they have stuffed it into a hollowed-out \nhusk of the State Department authorization bill. Not one provision of \nthe original State Department bill remains.\n  Of course, the State Department authorization is the last of many \ntargets. The majority leader has talked about doing this on an \nappropriations bill, on a crop insurance bill, on the electronic \nsignature bill, on the Violence Against Women Act. So desperate are we \nto serve the big banks and the credit card companies that no bill has \nbeen safe from this controversial baggage.\n  Colleagues, there is no question that this is a significantly worse \nbill than the one that passed the Senate. In fact, there is no \npretending that this bill is designed to curb real abuse of the \nbankruptcy code.\n  Does the bill take on wealthy debtors who file frivolous claims and \nshield their assets in multimillion-dollar mansions? No. Let me repeat \nthat--no. It guts the cap on the homestead exemption which was adopted \nby the Senate. Nor does this bill contain another amendment adopted by \nthe Senate, that Senator Schumer worked on, that would prevent \nviolators of the Fair Access to Clinic Entrances Act--which protects \nwomen's health clinics--from using the bankruptcy system to walk away \nfrom their punishment.\n  Indeed, colleagues, this legislation would deny a fresh start to low- \nand moderate-income families who file bankruptcy out of desperation. It \nhas an arbitrary test making it very hard for people to go to chapter \n7. But at the same time, this legislation has no balance, does not hold \nthe credit card industry accountable, does not hold the financial \ninstitutions accountable. It has now been stuffed into a hollowed-out \nState Department bill, and it is going to come over to the Senate, I \nsuppose, sometime around Wednesday.\n  I just want to say--I could go into all of the detail, but I will \nnot--should the majority leader follow through on this strategy, I \nannounce I will use my procedural rights as a Senator, of course, as \nany other Senator would, to slow down this conference report. The \nconference report would be hard to stop, but we could take at least a \ncouple of days of the Senate's precious remaining time to consider the \nramifications of this legislation on working families.\n  And finally----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I ask my distinguished colleague, on \nmy time--I was momentarily off the floor due to the unfolding crisis in \nregard to one of our Navy's ships in the Middle East. He made reference \nto the hate crimes legislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. At an appropriate time, I would like to give to my \ndistinguished friend and colleague from Minnesota, and also to inform \nthe Senate precisely, my role as chairman of the conference and what I \ndid in that context. So at the appropriate time, I would like to do \nthat. And perhaps the Senator would like to make a reply to what I have \nto say. Indeed, perhaps my distinguished friend and colleague, the \nranking member, would like to make a comment. But I think that should \nbe made a part of the Record.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to hear from my colleague from \nVirginia.\n  To expedite matters, included with my statement about this so-called \nbankruptcy reform bill I just will include a letter from the White \nHouse. This is from John Podesta, announcing that the President will \nveto this bankruptcy bill that has been stuffed into a hollowed-out \nState Department authorization bill. The President just makes it clear \nthat none of the fundamental problems with this piece of legislation \nhas been addressed and that he fully intends to veto this. I thank the \nWhite House for their very strong support. The President is doing the \nright thing.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, October 12, 2000.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I understand that the House will take up \n     today the conference report on H.R. 2415, which apparently \n     incorporates the text of S. 3186, a recently filed version of \n     bankruptcy legislation. if this bankruptcy legislation is \n     sent to the President, he will veto it.\n       Over the last few months, this Administration has engaged \n     in a good faith effort to reach agreement on a number of \n     outstanding issues in the bankruptcy legislation. The \n     President firmly believes that Americans would benefit from \n     reform legislation that would stem abuse of the bankruptcy \n     system by, and encourage responsibility of, debtors and \n     creditors alike. With this goal in mind, we have pursued \n     negotiations with bill proponents on a few key issues, \n     notwithstanding the President's deep concern that the bill \n     fails to address some creditor abuses and disadvantages all \n     debtors to an extent unnecessary to stem abuses by a few.\n       An agreement was reached in those negotiations on an \n     essential issue--limiting homestead exemptions--with \n     compromises made on both sides. Unfortunately, H.R. 2415 \n     fails to incorporate that agreement, instead reverting to a \n     provision that the Administration has repeatedly said was \n     fundamentally flawed. The central premise of this legislation \n     is that we must ask debtors, who truly have the capacity to \n     repay a portion of their debts, to do so. This would benefit \n     not only their creditors but also all other debtors through \n     lower credit costs. Unlimited homestead exemptions allow \n     debtors who own lavish homes to shield their mansions from \n     their creditors, while moderate-income debtors, especially \n     those who rent, must live frugally under a rigid repayment \n     plan for five to seven years. This loophole for the wealthy \n     is fundamentally unfair and must be closed. The inclusion of \n     a provision limiting to some degree a wealthy debtor's \n     capacity to shift assets before bankruptcy into a home in a \n     state with an unlimited homestead exemption does not \n     ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead cap.\n       Moreover, the President has made clear that bankruptcy \n     legislation must require accountability and responsibility \n     from those who unlawfully bar access to legal health \n     services. Yet the conference report fails to address this \n     concern. Far too often, we have seen doctors, health \n     professionals and their patients victimized by those who \n     espouse and practice violence. Congress and the States have \n     established remedies for those who suffer as a result of \n     these tactics. However, we are increasingly seeing the use of \n     the bankruptcy system as a strategic tool by those who seek \n     to promote clinic violence while shielding themselves from \n     personal liability and responsibility. It is critical that we \n     shut down this abusive use of our bankruptcy system and \n     prevent endless litigation that threatens the court-ordered \n     remedies due to victims of clinic violence. The U.S. Senate \n     was right in voting 80-17 to adopt an amendment that would \n     effectively close down any potential for this abuse of the \n     Bankruptcy Code. We fail to understand why the bill's \n     proponents refuse to include this provision and shut down the \n     use of bankruptcy to avoid responsibility for clinic \n     violence.\n       I repeat President Clinton's desire to see balanced \n     bankruptcy reform legislation enacted this year. The \n     President wants to sign legislation that addresses these \n     known abuses, without tilting the playing field against those \n     debtors who turn to bankruptcy genuinely in need of a fresh \n     start. He will veto H.R. 2415 because it gets the balance \n     wrong.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Podesta,\n                                  Chief of Staff to the President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed, \nas the manager, on my time, to address this issue for such time as I \nbelieve may be necessary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \njust want to, while the Senator from Alabama is on the floor, alert him \nthat\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\nthis will delay his place. He has been very patient here.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know he has been patient, but this is important. It \nwill be put in the Record. I shall probably not take more than 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the annual Armed Forces bill should really \nbecome almost an omnibus bill because so many amendments can be \nattached under the rules of the Senate, which I support. I do not \ncriticize any Member exercising his or her rights under the rules of \nthe Senate to put on bills, subject to a vote, such legislation as they \ndeem appropriate.\n  There are other rules that preclude that in certain areas, but in \nthis instance we had a freestanding, amendable piece of legislation on \nthe floor. Senator Kennedy courteously informed me, the ranking member, \nand others that he was going to raise the issue of what is generically \nreferred to as the hate crimes legislation. Senator Hatch likewise said \nhe had a version and he was going to put it before the Senate. Both \nSenators brought those bills. Both bills passed. Both bills went to \nconference as a part of the Senate bill.\n  My decision, as chairman of the conference, was made to drop those \npieces of legislation--both of them; Senator Kennedy's bill, Senator \nHatch's bill--because I looked upon it as my duty to get this bill \npassed and enacted into law. That is my principal responsibility as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, working with my ranking \nmember and other members of the committee.\n  I have been here 22 years. I understand Senators quite well. I \nrespect their rights, and I know when they speak with sincerity. I was \nadvised, not by one, not by two, but by many Senators on both sides of \nthis issue, of the gravity of the issue and the seriousness of the \nissue. It was made clear to me that if this legislation--either Senator \nKennedy's bill or Senator Hatch's bill--were left in the conference \nreport, in all likelihood we would have a series of filibusters. And \ngiven the very short period of time which is remaining in this \nsession--even though we have been active as a committee and got the \nbill timely to the Senate; even though we were on the floor for weeks \nintermittently, having to have it laid aside--we are here in the final \nhours of this session of this Congress. If we do not act on this bill \ntonight, and if we do not pass this bill tonight, it is questionable \nwhether the leadership will find additional time for consideration. \nAnd, as we say, it may be that pieces of it would be put into some \nappropriations bills or a CR or something--some parts--but much of it \ncould well be lost, unless this conference report is enacted. So I made \nthe decision. I take full responsibility for the decision of urging the \nconferees to drop this legislation.\n  My distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the committee, I \npresume, will address the Senate in a moment on this point. Exercising \nhis rights in a very courteous way, he said he wished for me to convene \nthe full Committee on Armed Services and have a vote: That we did. By a \nnarrow margin, my recommendation was sustained by the full committee, I \nmight add, in a bipartisan exchange of votes.\n\n  So that is the history as to why this legislation was dropped, I say \nto my colleague from Minnesota. I take responsibility. I believed it \nwas necessary that this bill should be passed. On this day when the \nworld is in such a tragic situation, whether it is the violence in the \nMiddle East or the attack on an American ship, all of America expects \nCongress to do its duty on behalf of the men and women of the Armed \nForces, and this is the most important piece of legislation done every \nyear.\n  So I do not regret for a minute the decision I had to make in the \nface of representations, fairly and honestly made to me, by colleagues \non both sides, as to the tactics that would be used if this bill would \nbe brought up in a conference report before the Senate with either \npieces of that legislation contained in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, on the hate crimes legislation \nissue, my good friend from Virginia has accurately presented the facts. \nThere are some additional facts, though, which should also be brought \nto bear.\n  I can't remember a time, although there may have been one, when the \nSenate has adopted language, as we did by a vote of 57-42, and when the \nHouse of Representatives has adopted language, as they did by 30 or 40 \nvotes--when I say ``adopted language'' in the House, let me be clear, \nwhat the House of Representatives did was even more precise than adopt \nthe hate crimes language; they instructed their conferees to agree to \nour hate crimes language by 30 or 40 votes--I cannot remember a time \nwhen one body has adopted language and the other body has instructed \ntheir conferees to yield to the first body's language where that \nlanguage has then been dropped in conference.\n  I am not saying that has never happened because I haven't checked the \nrecords to be sure. I can say I can never remember it happening. Think \nabout it. We had a big debate on this issue. We adopted Senator \nKennedy's hate crimes language by a vote of 57-42 in this body. Then \nthe House had a debate, instructing their conferees to agree to our \nlanguage, and somehow or other it is dropped in conference.\n  Let it be clear as to what happened. The House conferees would not \naccept our language, despite the instruction from the House of \nRepresentatives. Then we were faced with the question, Do we then give \nit up, despite the vote in the Senate?\n  There was a vote among Senate conferees. Ten Republicans and one \nDemocrat voted basically to give it up, which was the 11-vote majority. \nEight Democrats and one Republican voted not to give it up; let us \nmaintain this fight; let us bring this language back in the conference \nreport. If someone wants to filibuster a conference report, they have \nthat right. But this legislation is too important. This is the hate \ncrimes bill that this body adopted. It is simply too important a \nsubject to be dropped because of the threat of a filibuster after being \nadopted in the Senate and having the House telling their folks to yield \nto us. If we refused to adopt important legislation around here \nwhenever there was the threat of a filibuster, we would never adopt \nanything important. The civil rights legislation of the 1960s was \nadopted after weeks of debate, a filibuster that lasted weeks, with \nnumerous cloture votes, because it was important legislation.\n  Let me say this about our chairman: He is absolutely correct that he \nfelt that his responsibility was such that he had to bring a bill to \nthe floor. He made the judgment, as he indicated, and it was a good \nfaith judgment. I may disagree with him, which I do, but I don't in any \nway disagree with the fact that the chairman made a good faith judgment \nthat it was necessary to drop this language because the House would not \naccept it. And even though I disagree with it and think we should have \nput this language in here and let someone filibuster, nonetheless, I \nsurely agree that as always he acts in the best of faith.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I express to my colleague my respect \nfor his acknowledging the fact that my judgment was predicated on sound \nfacts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia was gracious \nenough to say I may want to respond. Other colleagues want to speak, \nand I believe the exchange between my two colleagues covered the ground \nand spoke to the question I raised. If I had spoken, I would have said \nwhat Senator Levin said. I just wouldn't have said it as well. I \nappreciate the forthrightness of the Senator from Virginia, his \ndirectness and, as always, his intellectual honesty.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I only say to him, the fervor with \nwhich he addresses issues and pursues his goals in the Senate for this \ncause, be it hate crimes in favor, I think he will recognize that that \nsame fervor is matched by others who have a different point of view \nvery often. Therein lies the issue which I had to take responsibility \nto resolve, and this bill was of paramount interest to anything else \nbefore the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I apologize to my good friend from \nMinnesota. I assumed he had yielded the floor. Has the Senator yielded?\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank him for his contribution to this debate, so many \ndebates of this body.\n  I am going to be briefer than I had actually planned to because our \ngood friends from Alabama and Kansas have been waiting for some time. I \ndo want to spend a couple more minutes.\n  One of the items in this conference report which should be noted is \nthe fact that we have agreed to the language in the Senate bill that \nwould replace the Army's School of the Americas with a new Western \nHemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. This new institute is \ngoing to provide professional education and training to military \npersonnel, law enforcement personnel, and civilian officials of Western \nHemisphere countries in areas such as leadership development, \ncounterdrug operations, peace support operations, disaster relief, and \nhuman rights.\n  The legislation specifies that the curriculum of this institution \ninclude mandatory instruction for each student of a minimum of 8 hours \nof instruction on human rights, the rule of law, on due process, on \ncivilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a \ndemocratic society. In a very significant addition, we have a Board of \nVisitors, which includes, among others, four Members of Congress and \nsix members from academia, the religious community, and the human \nrights community, to review the institute's curriculum and its \ninstruction. The Board of Visitors will submit an annual report to the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Defense, after consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, will submit an annual report to Congress \non the operation of the institute.\n  I am hoping that this will be a positive, new chapter and that some \nof the controversial history of the School of the Americas can now be, \nin fact, in the history books and that we can turn to a new approach in \nterms of our relationship with the leadership, both civilian and \nmilitary, in the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere.\n  We have some important beliefs that we want to share with others in \ndemocratic societies about civilian control of the military and human \nrights. These and other subjects, such as due process, are vital to us \nand, we believe, vital to the success of any democratic institution. \nThey have been under challenge, under stress in too many countries in \nthe Western Hemisphere. They have been too often violated. We have a \npositive role to play in this area. This provision, particularly now \nwith the kind of Board of Visitors we are going to have that includes \nmembers of the religious community, human rights communities, and \nMembers of Congress, I think is now going to make it possible for us to \nhave a new Western Hemisphere Institute which is going to have a proud \nrecord of achievement.\n  Second, the bill contains an amendment that I offered to prohibit DOD \nfrom selling to the general public any armor-piercing ammunition or \narmor-piercing components that may have been declared excess to the \nDepartment's needs. This prohibition was enacted on a one-year basis in \nlast year's Defense Appropriations Act, and Senator Durbin has \nintroduced a bill in the Senate to make the ban permanent. There is no \npossible justification for selling armor-piercing ammunition to the \ngeneral public, and I am pleased that we have taken this step toward \nenacting the ban into permanent law.\n  Third, the conferees rejected House language that would have \neffectively restricted the bidding when DoD privatizes its utility to \nthe sole utility authorized by a state government to operate in that \nparticular area. The conference agreement requires competitive bidding, \nwith a level playing field for all bidders, when DoD privatizes these \nassets, and allows DoD to determine the rates they will pay after \nprivatization as a matter of contract rather than by state regulation. \nThe conference agreement also protects people on military installations \nby requiring DoD to enforce prevailing health and safety standards.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill as far as it goes. But I am deeply \ndisappointed, however, by the failure of the conference to include \nseveral important provisions that were added in the Senate.\n  First, I am disappointed that conferees refused to include title XV \nof the Senate bill--the Kennedy hate crimes legislation--in the \nconference report despite the clear support of a majority of both \nHouses for this legislation.\n  Hate crimes are a special threat in a society founded on ``liberty \nand justice for all.'' Too many acts of violent bigotry in recent years \nhave put our nation's commitment to fairness to all our citizens in \njeopardy. When Matthew Shepard, a gay student was severely beaten and \nleft for dead or James Byrd, Jr., was dragged to his death behind a \npick-up truck, it was not only destructive of the victims and their \nfamilies, but threatens more broadly to others, and to the victims' \ncommunities, and to our American ideals.\n  When a member of the Aryan Nations walked into a Jewish Community \nCenter day school and fired more than 70 rounds from his Uzi submachine \ngun, and then killed a Filipino-American federal worker because he was \nconsidered a ``target of opportunity,'' it not only affected the \nfamilies of the victims and their communities, but the broad group of \nwhich they were a part of.\n  The conferees had an opportunity to address this problem and send a \nmessage that America is an all-inclusive nation--one that does not \ntolerate acts of violence based on bigotry and discrimination. Sadly, \nwe failed to do so.\n  Despite a 232-192 vote in the House of Representatives instructing \nthe conferees to adopt the Senate provision, the House majority \nrefused. And then despite a 57-42 vote in the Senate to make the hate \ncrimes legislation part of the bill, the Senate conferees voted 11-9 to \ndrop the legislation.\n  Mr. President, this issue will not go away. If this Congress will not \npass legislation addressing the acts of hatred and violence that \nterrorize Americans every day, I am confident that another Congress \nwill, and I will continue to work toward that objective.\n  The Senate bill also included landmark legislation authored by \nSenator Cleland that would have permitted our men and women in uniform \nto extend the benefits of the GI bill to family members in appropriate \ncircumstances, and would have addressed an inequity toward disabled \nveterans by eliminating the requirement that disability pay be deducted \ndollar-for-dollar from retirement pay. I am disappointed that we were \nunable to find a way to include these important provisions.\n  Overall, however, this is a bill which should become law. Once again, \nI want to thank our chairman, Senator Warner, all of the members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, and the staff on both sides of the \naisle, for their long hours of hard work on this legislation. I hope \nthe Senate will join us in passing this bill and sending it to the \nPresident for signature.\n  I thank my good friend, the chairman of the committee, for his fine \nleadership, and all the members of the committee and our staffs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in expressing \nmy support for the Defense authorization bill. I salute Senator Warner \nand Senator Levin, the ranking member, for the work they have given in \ncreating a bill that strengthens our Nation's defenses and allows us to \nbe more efficient and innovative as we move forward into the future. I \nwish we could have done more, but irregardless, we will in the future. \nI must give Senator Warner credit. Under his leadership, for the last 2 \nyears, we have produced a defense budget with real increases in defense \nspending. A defense spending increase that has outpaced the inflation \nrate.\n  For 15 consecutive years, we had a net reduction in the defense \nbudget. As a result, we have some real problems today, as the Joint \nChiefs of Staff told us 2 weeks ago in a very important Armed Services \nCommittee hearing. We need to focus on the It is also important for us, \nall of us who care about the men and women in uniform, to pause and \nremember the men and women of this Nation who risk their lives daily, \nincluding the five who were killed in a dastardly attack by terrorists \nin the Middle East today. Unfortunately, this is the kind of world we \nlive in. I wish it weren't so.\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n  This is a $310 billion bill. In fact, it is $4 billion above what the \nPresident requested. It is above what the Joint Chiefs, who are \nappointed by the President, said they needed to maintain an adequate \nforce, although they told us after the budget had been written they \nreally needed a lot more over a sustained period of time.\n  Two weeks ago, in the Armed Services Committee, which I am honored to \nbe a member of, we had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Shelton, and the Chiefs for each of the service branches--Army, \nNavy, Air Force, and Marines. They were asked by Senator Warner: Tell \nus the truth, what is the situation in with the military?\n  Each one of these men were appointees of this administration, but \nunder oath they came forward and told the truth. That is, they \ntestified that they have thankfully restored and maintained the \nreadiness of two Army divisions that had fallen to the lowest readiness \nrating possible last fall. In other words, the Chiefs in the past were \nforced to take resources from other areas to maintain readiness. I \nbelieve Senator Roberts, who will speak in a minute, used the phrase, \n``The point of the spear then is OK, but it is the shaft that is \nwrong.'' That is what they agreed to. At least three of the five used \nthe phrase, ``We are mortgaging our future.''\n  What did they mean by that? They meant that this Nation has been \nrobbing research and development, recapitalization, new equipment, and \nthe kinds of things we need to maintain the greatest military in the \nworld. But to maintain that, you have to continue to invest in those \nrequirements. We are not doing that. The Chiefs stated it plain and \nsimple, and I emplore anybody who doubts it to read the transcript of \nthat hearing. They agreed with the phrase that one Senator used, \nquoting the Clinton Assistant Secretary of Defense, that the defense \nbudget is in a death spiral. What he meant by that was that when you \nspend more and more money to try to maintain equipment that is worn \nout, you are pouring money down a bottomless pit. What we should have \ndone, and what we have not done these past 8 years when we have had \ngood economic times, is increase this defense budget. We could have \nrecapitalized and replaced wornout equipment. But we haven't been doing \nthat. As a result, we will face a future readiness crisis.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, testified earlier this year \nthat this Nation has been living off Ronald Reagan's military buildup \nof the 1980s. He said we are going to be facing a crisis in the years \nto come. That is testimony by the Secretary of Defense and this \nadministration has not listened to that warning. They are going to let \nthis burden fall on the American people in the immediate future. The \nSecretary of Defense says it, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsays that, and the chairman of our committee who has been involved in \nthese issues for so many years says that. It has been complicated, as \nthey testified, with our excessive and unusually high number of \ndeployments of our men and women around the world. This wears out \nequipment, it drains additional resources, and it tires our men and \nwomen in uniform. In addition, it separates them from their families \nfor extraordinary periods of time.\n\n  We have a real problem because we have a peace dividend. Oh, they \nsay, President Bush cut the Defense Department when he was in there. \nWell, of course, he did. We had a legitimate peace dividend. The Berlin \nwall fell. We had a tremendous change as a result of the will of \nPresident Reagan and President Bush to maintain an unwavering stand \nagainst the Soviet Union. Consequently, we were able to save a lot of \nmoney.\n  So, yes, he was cutting; yes, we wanted to reduce manpower and reduce \nany costs we could, and use those savings to strengthen this country. \nBut he didn't pretend to have it go on forever.\n  So that is where we are. I have to say that we have not yet faced up \nto the challenges of our future. I am reminded by the gulf war and our \nsoldiers taking on the Iraqis. Our fighting men and women did an \noutstanding job. At that time, I heard the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone, say we needed more preschool teachers and we needed more \nguidance counselors, and anything else you can think of that he would \nspend money on, but when we committed those men and women in the \ndesert, what did they use? They used the finest equipment the world had \never seen. We were able to put missiles in the windows of buildings and \nour tanks were able to destroy the enemy's before they new it.\n  Our forces were able to defeat the enemy and devastate them with \nminimum loss of life on our side. That is what we want to do. We do not \nwant to get into a war in which this Nation is not able to carry out \nits just national interests and suffer a huge loss of life. We want to \nbe able to carry out our just national interests effectively. We do not \nwant to over extend ourselves and become engaged in conflicts all over \nthe world. But we need to be ready to execute to defend our legitimate \nnational interests. We can't do that if we don't spend some money on \nit.\n  We are heading to a time where we can't live off the Reagan buildup \nanymore. We are going to be at a time where we will have to do \nsomething about it. We will be at a time when we need to improve our \ncruise missiles and our smart bombs and during the gulf war, we had \nsuperiority in the Middle East. We avoid wars by being strong.\n  Senator Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, understood \nthese issues and fought for them. When the conflict occurred, we \nprevailed at minimum loss of life to American citizens.\n  I agree with Senator Warner. This bill does not need to be \njeopardized by adding such measures as hate crimes legislation, that \nshould have come out of Judiciary on a law enforcement bill, rather \nthan on a Defense bill. This type of ploy only adds to the complication \non these matters.\n  I think we are making a solid step forward. It would have been better \nif the Commander in Chief had told us we needed more money and \nchallenged us to find more. It is hard for Congress to find more money \nwhen the President says, as Commander in Chief, he doesn't need it. \nNevertheless, we spent $4 billion more than he asked for, which is hard \nto do. But the core function of Government ultimately is to defend our \nnational sovereignty. We have a leadership role in this world, whether \nwe want to have it or not. We have the ability to lead this world into \nthe greatest century in the history of mankind. We can avoid wars if we \nremain strong. If we have competent leadership, we can maintain peace. \nWe need a steady, mature funding of defense so that we are always above \nand ahead of our competitors. We do not want to go into a war on a \nlevel playing field. If we do have to go to war, we must have the \nresources available to prevail at a minimum loss of life.\n  All of this could create a more stable world order, and promote \npeace. Goodness knows, the events in the last few days are enough to \nmake an impact and to see what happens in Belgrade, to see what happens \nin the Middle East, to see what happens now with an attack on our \nwarship. Doesn't that tell us we live in a very dangerous world? The \nhistory of the world hasn't changed. There will always be struggles, \nfights, and wars, it seems. But if we are prepared, if we lead, and if \nwe have a strong military that allows us to speak softly but carry a \nbig stick, we can do great things. We can fulfill our destiny at this \npoint in time; that is, to lead this world into a peaceful future.\n  I will just say this: We need to maintain the ability to act \nunilaterally when we need to. This Nation cannot allow some \nmultinational group to decide for us how to use the power that we have. \nOf course we want the support and friendship of every nation in the \nworld, but we don't need to be in a position where we have to have NATO \nvotes to tell us whether or not we can deploy our forces. We don't need \nto have the U.N. voting with a single veto in the security council \nstopping us from deploying either. Would that be wiser than the \nleadership within the United States? Not at this point in time. I \nbelieve we can help the world. We need to maintain our independence. We \nneed to maintain a strong national defense.\n  If I haven't used my time, I will yield it back and thank the \nchairman for giving me this opportunity.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Warner and Senator Levin for their \nleadership\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\nand bringing a bill that I believe will help preserve this Nation's \nstrength in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as chairman of the committee, I thank the \nSenator from Alabama for his service on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. He has only recently joined the committee. But his voice and \nhis wisdom are brought to bear on many key issues. His attendance at \nthe hearings is among the highest. I thank him for the time that he has \nbeen working for our committee. We very much value his judgment and his \nwisdom as we deal with these tough issues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I am honored to serve with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to my colleague, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction.\n  At this time, may I say, Mr. Chairman, it is essential that the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, and most specifically the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, and the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, and, indeed, our two ranking members--\nSenator Byrd, is on the Armed Services Committee, as well as the \nAppropriations Committee--our ability to work together as a team is \nessential. In my many years on their committee, I can recall where the \nrelationships between the chairman and the various committees was \nsomewhat strained. I say to Senator Stevens that he has been an \nexemplary and wonderful working partner on our two bills in tandem on \nbehalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces. I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield all of my time, or such time as \nour distinguished colleague and a very valuable member of the Armed \nServices Committee may wish to take\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I believe the regular order is that I \nhave the time. But I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee be recognized prior to my \nremarks at this time, and I would be delighted to have him speak, or I \nwill yield to the distinguished chairman, whatever is his preference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank both Senators. I am delighted \nthat I was able to be here at the time Senator Sessions made his \nremarks. I thank him for his kind remarks about my service, and I am \ndelighted that he is on the Armed Services Committee because I like \nvery much what he said.\n  I had intended to make a statement on the Defense bill. But I have \nbeen engaged this week in sort of herding turtles around this place. If \nit is agreeable to my friend from Virginia, I will make my statement \nconcerning the Defense bill next week and ask it be printed in the \npermanent record as part of this Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield to my distinguished friend and colleague from \nOklahoma for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized at \nthe conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, there has been some discussion on the \nfloor in reference to this bill, the Defense authorization bill, on the \nmerits of including a hate crimes provision. I am struck by the fact \nthat we have just witnessed an international terrorist hate crime with \nthe attack on the U.S.S. Cole, leaving, according to my notes, 5 dead \nand 36 wounded, 12 missing. All of our U.S. military are on alert in \nterms of force protection. Our intelligence services are working full \ntime to make sure that we have the proper force protection as they do \ntheir duty. In fact, I think that is a hate crime to which this \nparticular bill speaks.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished chairman. \nWhile Members on both sides have strong feelings about the hate crimes \nbill, in no way should this defense authorizations bill be further held \nup or impeded.\n  I express my sincere condolences, as my colleagues have, to the \nfamilies and friends of the crewmembers of the U.S.S. Cole who were \nkilled and injured today in the Port of Aden in Yemen. They died or \nthey were injured in the services of this Nation, and we all feel their \nsacrifice. The apparent--I say ``apparent''; I think we all know it \nwas--terrorist attack on the U.S. ship was brutal, it was unprovoked, \nit was an act of terrorism. All the information is not yet available to \ndetermine the source and the motivation of the attack. The Government \nof Yemen has said they are certainly not involved, so we have to \nreserve judgment on the response, if this is a terrorist strike.\n  No matter what the cause of the explosion, this again points out the \nrisks that our service men and women face every day. We have to be \nready every day. There is no strategic response to terrorism in regard \nto the service they provide to our Nation.\n  We must never forget that we ask the members of the military to be on \nthe front line of U.S. diplomacy, and, unfortunately, they are the \nobvious targets of terrorist groups.\n  I have the privilege of being the chairman of the Emerging Threats \nand Capabilities Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee. As has \nbeen indicated by Senator Levin and others, we have the responsibility \nto make sure we are ready and we have the proper resources to combat \nterrorism.\n  I can make a solemn promise to the families involved and to our \nmilitary: We are going to continue to do our very best budgetwise and \nour very best in regard to legislation and policy to assure the force \nprotection that we must have to protect our troops.\n  I rise to add my compliments to the chairman and the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Levin, of the Armed Services Committee on a job \nthat I think is well done. Through their hard work and their \nperseverance over the last legislative year, and in particular in \nregard to the conference with our colleagues in the House, we are \npresenting to the Senate a bill that will make significant progress.\n\n  Senator Sessions has made what I consider to be an excellent speech \non the state of military readiness, the problems and the challenges we \nface. I see the distinguished chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Inhofe, who does a splendid job \nin that regard. He has been sounding the alarm for years in regard to \nthe readiness problems we face. We will make significant progress \ntoward stopping what I call the readiness drain now facing our \nmilitary. It is not enough, but this bill does actually lay down a \nmarker that the Congress is very serious, that the committee is very \nserious about its commitment to reversing the damaging readiness cuts. \nWe owe the men and women of the Armed Forces nothing less.\n  Over time, the last several years, we have authorized significant \nincreases in pay. We have certainly done a better job in regard to the \nretirement system. We reformed that. As the distinguished chairman and \nthe ranking member have pointed out, under the health care banner, we \nare now providing health care for the military retired. That is an \nobligation we must keep.\n  As I have indicated, I have the privilege to serve as the chairman of \nthe Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I am very proud of \nour accomplishments this year in the subcommittee. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his \nassistance, as well as all the members of the subcommittee, working in \na bipartisan fashion to produce this work product.\n  Behind the success was the hard work of our staff. I have always said \nthat there are no self-made men or women in public office today. It is \nyour friends who make you what you are. I put staff in that category. \nWe are only as good as our staff in terms of the work product we are \nable to pass. I take this opportunity to thank them. They are not \nexpecting this, but I want to take this opportunity to present: The \nhead of our Emerging Threats and Capabilities ``posse,'' if I can refer \nto us in that\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nvein, and who I consider to be the iron lady and the iron fist of the \nscience and technology world, Ms. Pam Ferrell; Mr. Military \nTransformation, who did an outstanding job, Mr. Chuck Alsap; the strong \nduo dealing with counterterrorism, the very subject we are dealing with \ntoday, even as I speak, as the 250 members of the U.S.S. Cole try to \nright the ship and save the ship, is Mr. Ed Edens and Mr. Joe Sixeas; \nthe guy, the young man or the staffer that the drug cartels probably \nfear as much as anybody, Mr. Cord Sterling; our cyber warrior, Mr. Eric \nThommes; and our tough negotiator in dealing with the Russian programs, \nthe counterthreat reduction programs, an investment for us, and we \nthink an investment for the Russians, as well, Miss Mary Alice Hayward; \nand the cleanup hitter, Miss Susan Ross.\n  I thank each and every one of them for their hard work, their \nprofessionalism, and the work product we were able to produce.\n  There are many successes for this year I want to address, but time is \nan issue. I know the Senators from Oklahoma and Iowa want to make some \nremarks, but there are four areas I would like to highlight of which I \nam especially proud.\n\n  First, we have two educational programs designed to increase research \nand the number of technically trained Americans. We have a technology \npersonnel gap. I do not know what the acronym is for that. We hear \nabout gaps in the past in terms of arguments in regard to the military. \nBut, boy, this is a gap that is real and it is a gap that must be \nfilled.\n  We have authorized $15 million to establish what is called an \nInformation Security Scholarship Program for the Secretary of Defense \nto award grants to institutions of higher education to establish or \nimprove programs in information security and to provide scholarships to \npersons who would pursue a degree in information assurance in exchange \nfor a commitment of service within the Department of Defense. That is a \nbreakthrough.\n  Senator Warner gave his personal leadership to this. As a matter of \nfact, it is his initiative. I like to think I had something to do with \nit, as well as all members of the committee in a bipartisan fashion.\n  We have also authorized $5 million to establish something called an \nInstitute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection. \nThis institute will conduct research in technology development in the \narea of information assurance and to facilitate the exchange of \ninformation with regard to cyber threats, technology tools, and other \nrelevant issues.\n  Again I go back to the technology personnel gap. This will assist us \nto really close that gap. As a matter of fact, when we asked the \nexperts in our subcommittee, What keeps you up at night? they mentioned \na lot of things, but they mentioned two things of priority interest. \nNo. 1 is the possibility of the use of biological weaponry by some \nstate-supported terrorist or non-state-supported terrorist. The second \nthing they worry about is cyber attacks, information warfare. So we \nthink this institute is long overdue. We have authorized $5 million. \nThat is going to get it started.\n  The second thing I would like to mention is that we ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense will focus real coordination in their \nresponsibilities to combat terrorism activities through a single \noffice. We had four people before the subcommittee testifying in regard \nto DOD responsibilities and the challenge they face in regard to \nterrorism, so I asked the witnesses: Would you sit in order of your \nauthority. Nobody knew where to sit--No. 1, 2, 3, 4--because they \ndidn't know. We had so many people within the DOD who shared partial \nresponsibility for this that we did not find one person in charge. So \nthat is what we are going to have after this bill passes.\n  We made a suggestion on the Senate side; we really singled it out and \nput it in a particular person's area of responsibility. The House came \nback and said let's let the Secretary of Defense decide that. But I \nwill tell you again, we are going to ensure the Department of Defense \nis focused in regard to their responsibilities to combat terrorism \nthrough one single office.\n  We included a provision that would designate one Assistant Secretary \nof Defense as the principal civilian advisor to the Secretary for \nDepartment of Defense activities for combating terrorism--one guy in \ncharge, one lady in charge, one person in charge. This provision \nensures there is a single individual within the Department responsible \nfor providing focused and comprehensive and well-funded DOD \nantiterrorism policy.\n\n  I have said that about three times now, but three times I want to say \nhow important that is. I think it is a real step forward.\n  The third area is to reduce the risk of the expansion of weapons of \nmass destruction and to help provide opportunities to Russian \nscientists outside of their weapons development. We authorized over $1 \nbillion for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs for the \nDepartments of Defense and Energy to assist nations of the former \nSoviet Union in preventing the expansion of their weapons of mass \ndestruction and dissemination of their scientific expertise. This is a \nprogram really started by Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar. Conferees \nincluded several initiatives to obtain greater Russian commitment to \nthese programs--these programs are not without controversy--and the \nnecessary U.S. access to ensure these programs do achieve their threat \nreduction goals.\n  We authorized $443.4 million for the Department of Defense \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program for fiscal year 2001 to reduce the \nthreat posed by the former Soviet Union weapons of mass destruction. \nSo, let's see, there is $443.4 and $1 billion for the nonproliferation \nand threat reduction programs. That is quite an investment to assist \nthe Russians, to work together with the Russians to reduce that kind of \ncapability.\n  Last, I would like to say to help the military continue to put a \nsolid effort in the invaluable area of science and technology and to \nensure we are ready to address the emerging threats, we added $209 \nmillion for the Defense Science and Technology Program; that is the S \nprograms, the science and technology programs. We focused on \nrevolutionary technologies to meet the emerging threats. And we \nrequired the services to undertake a comprehensive planning process to \nidentify long-term technological needs in consultation with the \nwarfighting and the acquisition communities, and to ensure that the \nservices' programs in regard to science and technology are \nappropriately designed to support these needs.\n  I could list some other significant accomplishments in the joint \nwarfighting area, in the continued focus on helping our military \ncommunities prepare for the possibility that they may have to handle \nthe consequences of a terrorist attack on our homeland.\n  We all know about the U.S.S. Cole. That threat exists in regard to \nour domestic situation as well and in several other key areas where we \nhave jurisdiction. But I am going to let that go. I will probably put \nsomething in the Record at a later date in regard to what I think we \nhave done in meeting our responsibilities in that area.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Warner, who has labored long and \nhard. We did this several months ago. We have been in conference for 2 \nor 3 or 4 months. In the rush to complete our business, we had all \nsorts of things pop up out of the woodwork, almost a gauntlet to get \nthis bill done. I thank Senator Warner, Senator Levin, all members of \nthe committee for their leadership, their guidance, their help during \nthe development of this year's Defense bill.\n  There is no more important bill. Our first obligation as Members of \nthis body is to do what we can in behalf of our national security. \nToday's events certainly prove that is the case. That has been spoken \nto by the distinguished chairman.\n  I think it is a good bill. We need to get it passed, and it needs a \nbig vote. It needs a big, solid vote for the responsibility we have to \nour men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may interject, I thank Senator Inhofe \nfor the work he has done on Vieques. I ask unanimous consent that, \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Inhofe, Senator\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nHarkin be recognized for up to 10 minutes and Senator Robb then be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I join in the remarks that were made by \nthe Senator from Kansas about the U.S.S. Cole, the tragedy that took \nplace. We are all so saddened to hear about that. It was a complete \nsurprise to all of us. Also, his comments about our chairman--our \nchairman, the Senator from Virginia, has done just an incredible job of \nleading the way and getting this bill done.\n  I see this bill we are about to vote on as turning the corner. After \n7 years of neglecting our military, we are actually starting to improve \nsome things. We have some things in this bill that I think are long \noverdue. In our readiness funding, the conferees add more than $888 \nmillion to the primary readiness accounts. That included areas of \nneglect: $125 million to the war reserves and training munitions. We \nhave places where they actually do not have enough bullets, enough \nammunition to train with; $222 million for spare parts--that is not \nnearly enough, but there is a trend going up in the right direction \nnow.\n  I go around as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee to quite a few of the places around the \ncountry and around the world and find the cannibalization rates, \ngetting spare parts out of engines. I have seen them open up a new, \ncrated F-100 engine just to pull off spare parts. That becomes very \nlabor intensive. As a result of that, we are having terrible retention \nrates.\n  We hear about the pilots, but we don't hear about the mechanics and \nsome of the other MOS, military occupational specialties, where we \nreally are having a crisis.\n  This bill also goes a long way to try to get us back into opening up \nthe live range on the island of Vieques.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague yield for \na question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Certainly.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he is familiar with \nthe statement made by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \nand Technology--this is somebody who appeared before his subcommittee \nand mine--Secretary Jacques Gansler?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, he has appeared before our committee on three \noccasions I can recall.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. He made a recent statement in regard to the very issue \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is pointing out. I think it will be helpful \nif I read this, if the Senator from Oklahoma will permit me. This is \nsomebody from the administration. He stated this:\n\n       We are trapped in a death spiral.\n\n  I do not think one could make it any more plain than that.\n\n       We are trapped in a death spiral. The requirement to \n     maintain our aging equipment is costing us more each year in \n     repair costs, down time, and maintenance tempo. But we must \n     keep this equipment in repair to maintain readiness. It \n     drains our resources--resources we should apply to \n     modernization of the traditional systems and development of \n     new systems.\n\n  Then the Secretary went on to say:\n\n       So we stretch out our replacement schedules to ridiculous \n     lengths and reduce the quantities of new equipment we \n     purchase, raising the cost and still further delaying \n     modernization.\n\n  I do not think one can be any plainer than that. So the Senator's \nremarks are backed up not only from what we hear in testimony but also \nfrom the many bases at home and overseas. I thank my distinguished \ncolleague for all the effort he makes from his personal time and other \nduties to go to bases all over the world. He checks with the enlisted; \nhe checks with the NCOs; he checks with the officers; and he checks \nwith the commanders and shows them his candor and integrity. We talked \nabout this at great length.\n  In terms of readiness, there is no other person in the Congress of \nthe United States or, for that matter, whom I know in this city who \nknows better the readiness problems we have, and it is backed up by \nthis statement by a Secretary of the administration. We owe the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma a debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much getting that into \nthe Record because that testimony came out in our committee meetings. \nThe Senator from Kansas is right. Sometimes when you sit in a committee \nmeeting in Washington, everything is filtered. You do not really get \nthe truth you find in the field.\n  This bill is going to put $449 million in real property and \nmaintenance. The RPM accounts are accounts that are mandatory that we \nhave to get down, and yet I have been down to Fort Bragg during a \nrainstorm. Go into the barracks and one will see our soldiers are \nactually covering up their equipment with their bodies to keep it from \nrusting. It is a crisis. We are addressing that crisis with this bill. \nIt is a start. We should be doing more than we do with this particular \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to express not only my appreciation \nbut that of the whole committee, on both sides of the aisle, for the \namount of travel the Senator has done. I heard the Senator talk about \nhow he made these inspection trips. He spent a great deal of his time \ntraveling to our military bases in the continental United States and \nabroad. There is no one who pulls harder on their oar than the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n\n  I especially credit him with trying to resolve in a very fair and \nbalanced manner the diversity of positions regarding the Vieques issue. \nThe President had his views, the Government of Puerto Rico had its \nviews, colleagues in the Senate had their views, and the Senator worked \nhis way through that problem, and I know in this bill we have a fair \nand good solution to that difficult problem. I thank him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman. Also I thank the ranking member, \nSenator Levin, who was very helpful on this whole issue. I believe we \naddressed it properly in this bill.\n  If we let an agreement go that had a financial motivation for the \n9,000 residents of the island of Vieques to vote to kick out the Navy \nforever and lose that as a range, that had to be changed. This bill \ndoes that. We changed it so that the western land is not going to the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico but to the people of Vieques.\n  A lot of people do not realize that Vieques is like a municipality in \nPuerto Rico, and the people of Vieques are very fond of the Navy. I am \nthe first one to admit the Navy had some PR problems, but I say to our \nchairman, they have worked very hard, and I see a change in attitude \nthere.\n  I was recently in Vieques meeting with a group of people. I left \nfirmly convinced that if we have this referendum and if the referendum \nhas a motivation for them to vote right--and that is to accept the Navy \nand the live firing range--then I believe they are going to do it.\n  The other day, I was on a talk show and someone called in. Actually, \nit was someone who was on the other side of this issue. They said: How \nwould you like to have a live range in your State of Oklahoma?\n  I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know the answer to that question. It is \nthe same thing with the State of Virginia. Less than 30 miles from this \nChamber is a live-fire range for the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly right. My concern has been, I hope and I \nwill go on record right now and I am already on record saying, if we \nhave this referendum, this will be the last time that we should allow a \nreferendum to take place on closing a live range. When one stops and \nthinks about the domino effect this will have on other places, such as \nCapo Teulada in Sardinia or Cape Wrath in northern Scotland, it would \nbe a real crisis if we lose those, and yet they logically ask the \nquestion--I have seen it in print in Scotland: Wait a minute, if they \ndo not allow the training to take place on land they own, why should we \nlet them come here to our country and bomb it?\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The western land now will go not to the politicians in \nPuerto Rico but to the residents of the island of Vieques, and in the \nevent something should happen that they should vote to reject the Navy, \nthen it is not going to go into some developer's hands where someone is \ngoing to stand to get rich over this.\n  We have done a good job----\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a \nvery brief comment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I add my voice to that of my senior \ncolleague in thanking our colleague from Oklahoma for the way he has \nworked on this particular problem. For a number of months, this seemed \nto be one of those intractable problems that was probably not going to \nbe resolved.\n  I know the very strong feelings the Senator from Oklahoma has and \nbrought to bear on this question in particular. We may disagree on \nother matters, but on this question in particular, he struck just the \nright balance, represented the long-term interests of the United States \nin a way that allowed us to come to closure on an issue that might not \nhave closed at all and certainly would have created all kinds of \ndifficulty for the United States in our long-term relations in the \nhemisphere with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and others.\n  I add my voice to others in thanking the chairman of the Readiness \nSubcommittee for his very important and tireless work on this issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, who is \nthe ranking member on the Readiness Subcommittee, for the contributions \nhe has made. The Senator from Virginia is in the same position I am in, \nhaving live ranges in his home State.\n  I can recall going out on one of the carriers before one of the \ndeployments from the east coast to the Persian Gulf. They have this \nintegrated training on the island of Vieques. They have F-14s and F-18s \ndoing air work; they have the Marine expeditionary, with which the \nSenator is familiar, since he was a marine, doing their work, and at \nthe same time they have live Navy fire. They say they can get that \ntraining elsewhere but not at the same type of place. The analogy was \ncalled to my attention by someone who was on one of the deploying \nbattle groups. It is like you have the very best quarterbacks, the very \nbest offensive line, and the very best defensive line. If one is \ntraining over here, one is training over here, and one is training over \nhere, but they never train together. On the day of the big game, of \ncourse, they lose. The integrated training is necessary.\n  I believe the language in this bill is going to offer the self-\ndetermination of the people of Vieques to support the Navy live range, \nand I have every expectation that is exactly what is going to happen. \nAmerican lives are at stake.\n  I want to make one last comment. I have mentioned several times we \nshould have probably gone further with this bill. I have been concerned \nabout our state of readiness, and we outlined some of these things in \nthe real property and maintenance accounts and others.\n  But I was reading, the day before yesterday, in the Wall Street \nJournal, an editorial by Mark Helprin. Mark Helprin is a contributing \neditor to the Journal but is also a senior fellow of the Claremont \nInstitute. He talks about the crisis that we are going to have to take \ncare of, and that we should not be talking about the fact that we right \nnow, today, are better equipped than we have been. We are not better \nequipped than we have been before. He goes on to talk about the fact \nthat in Kosovo, 37,000 aerial sorties were required to destroy what \nGen. Wesley Clark claimed were 93 tanks and 53 armored fighting \nvehicles. That is approximately 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively, \nof which Milosevic actually had.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Twenty percent of carrier-deployed F-14s do not fly, \n     serving as a source of spare parts instead. Forty percent of \n     Army helicopters are rated insufficient to their tasks. Half \n     of the Army's gas masks do not work.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Lastly, let me just say I am glad that defense has become \nprominent in this Presidential election. We have had a degradation in \nwhat has happened to our defense. We have great troops, but right now \nwe are operating at roughly one-half the force strength we were during \nthe Persian Gulf war. And that can be quantified.\n  So often when people stand up politically and say we are stronger now \nthan we were, or as strong as we were back during the Persian Gulf war, \nthat just isn't true. We are approximately 60 percent of where we were \nin terms of force strength. That can be quantified.\n  I am talking about 60 percent of the Army divisions, 60 percent of \nthe tactical air wings, 60 percent of the ships floating around, going \nfrom a 600-ship Navy to a 300-ship Navy. It is true some of that was \nfrom the previous administration. The Bush administration wanted to go \ndown from 600 to 450 ships. But now we are far below that.\n  I think this administration has done a bad job the last 8 years. We \nare going to have to turn that around and do a massive rebuilding in \nthe next administration. I think we are probably going to do it. I \nthink we are going to see our Defense authorization committees of the \nHouse and the Senate do that. As well the Appropriations Committees are \nprimed and ready, as is evidenced by the bill we are discussing today \nthat we are going to pass. We are going to turn that corner and start \nrebuilding America's defense again.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 10, 2000]\n\n                           Mr. Clinton's Army\n\n                           (By Mark Helprin)\n\n       Many people have come to believe that thinking about war is \n     akin to fomenting it, preparing for it is as unjustifiable as \n     starting it, and fighting it is only unnecessarily prolonging \n     it. History suggests that as a consequence of these beliefs \n     they will bear heavy responsibility for the defeat of \n     American arms on a battlefield and in a theater of war as yet \n     unknown. Theirs are the kind of illusions that lead to a \n     nation recoiling in shock and frustration, to the terrible \n     depression of its spirits, the gratuitous encouragement of \n     its enemies, and the violent deaths of thousands or tens of \n     thousands, or more, of those who not long before were its \n     children.\n       They will bear this responsibility along with \n     contemporaries who are so enamored of the particulars of \n     their well-being that they have made the government a kindly \n     nurse of households, a concierge and cook, never mind a \n     resurgent Saddam Hussein or China's rapid development of \n     nuclear weapons. They will bear it along with the partisans \n     of feminist and homosexual groups who see the military as a \n     tool for social transformation. And they will bear it with a \n     generation of politicians who have been guilty of willful \n     neglect merely for the sake of office.\n\n\n                               Abject Lie\n\n       So many fatuous toadies have been put in place in the \n     military that they will undoubtedly pop up like toast to \n     defend Vice President Gore's statement that ``if our \n     servicemen and women should be called on to risk their lives \n     for the sake of our freedoms and ideals, they will do so with \n     the best training and technology the world's richest country \n     can put at their service.'' This is an abject lie.\n       To throw light on the vice president's assertion that all \n     is well, consider that in Kosovo 37,000 aerial sorties were \n     required to destroy what Gen. Wesley Clark claimed were 93 \n     tanks, 53 armored fighting vehicles, and 389 artillery \n     pieces; that these comprised, respectively, 8%, 7%, and 4% of \n     such targets, leaving the Yugoslav army virtually intact; and \n     that impeccable sources in the Pentagon state that Yugoslav \n     use of decoys put the actual number of destroyed tanks, for \n     example, in the single digits.\n       To achieve with several hundred sorties of $50-million \n     airplanes the singular splendor of destroying a Yugo, the \n     United States went without carries in the Western Pacific \n     during a crisis in Korea, and the Air Force tasked 40% of its \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets, and \n     95% of its regular and 65% of its airborne tanker force, in \n     what the chief of staff called a heavier strain than either \n     the Gulf War or Vietnam.\n       One reason for the ``inefficiency'' of Operation Allied \n     Force is that this very kind of farce is funded by \n     cannibalizing operations and maintenance accounts. Such a \n     thing would not by itself be enough to depress the services \n     as they are now depressed. That has taken eight years of \n     magnificent neglect. Case in point: The U.S. Navy now focuses \n     on action in the littorals, and must deal with a burgeoning \n     inventory of increasingly capable Third World coastal \n     submarines that find refuge in marine layers and take comfort \n     from the Navy's near century of inapplicable blue-water \n     antisubmarine warfare. But our budget for surface-ship \n     torpedo defense will shortly dip from not even $5 million, to \n     nothing in 2001.\n       The reduction of the military budget to two-thirds of what \n     it was (in constant dollars) in 1985, and almost as great a \n     cut in force levels, combined with systematic demoralization, \n     scores of ``operations other than war,'' and the synergistic \n     breakdown that so often accompanies empires in decline and \n     bodies wracked by disease, have produced a tidal wave of \n     anecdotes and statistics. Twenty percent of carrier-deployed \n     F-\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\n     14s do not fly, serving as a source of spare parts instead. \n     Forty percent of Army helicopters are rated insufficient to \n     their tasks. Half of the Army's gas masks do not work. Due to \n     reduced flying time and training opportunities within just a \n     few years of Bill Clinton's first inauguration, 84% of F-15 \n     pilots had to be waived through 38 categories of flight \n     training. The pilot of the Osprey in the December 1999 crash \n     that killed 19 Marines had only 80 hours in the aircraft, and \n     the pilot who sliced the cables of the Italian aerial tram in \n     1998, killing 20, had not flown a low-altitude training \n     flight for seven months. It goes on and on, and as the sorry \n     state of the military becomes known, the administration \n     responds by doing what it does best.\n       In the manner of Gen. Clark presenting as a success the--\n     exaggerated--claim of having destroyed 8% of the Yugoslav \n     tank forces in 78 days of bombing, the administration moved \n     to ``restructure'' the six armored and mechanized divisions \n     by shrinking force levels 15% and armor 22%, while expanding \n     the divisional battle sector by 250%, the idea being that by \n     removing 3,000 men and 115 tanks and Bradley Fighting \n     Vehicles while vastly expanding the area in which it would \n     have to fight, a division would somehow be made more \n     effective.\n       The two failed Army divisions cited by George W. Bush in \n     his acceptance speech were returned to readiness with speed \n     inversely proportional to the time it takes the White House \n     to produce a subpoenaed document, perhaps because, according \n     to the Army, ``new planning considerations have enabled \n     division commanders to make a more accurate assessment,'' and \n     ``the timelines for deployment . . . have been adjusted to \n     better enable them to meet contingency requirements.'' In \n     1995, brigade officials told the General Accounting Office \n     that they felt pressured to falsify readiness ratings, and \n     that the rubric ``needs practice'' was applied irrespective \n     of whether a unit scored 99% or 1% of the minimum passing \n     grade.\n       But there is more. Mainly by coincidence but partly by \n     design, several broader measures exist. The Army rates its \n     echelons. In 1994, two-thirds of these were judged fully \n     ready for war. By 1999, not one of them was. More than half \n     the Army's specialty schools have received the lowest \n     ratings, as did more than half its combat training centers \n     (although the chaplains are doing very well). These training \n     centers serve as an instrument that illuminates the \n     character of all the units that pass through them. By \n     examining their ratings it is possible to get a \n     comprehensive view of the Army's true state.\n       I have obtained National Training Center trend data that \n     are the careful measure of unit performance in 60 areas over \n     three years. Of 200 evaluations, only two were satisfactory. \n     This 99% negative performance, stunning as it is, is echoed \n     in the preliminary findings of a RAND study that, according \n     to sources within the Army, more than 90% of the time rates \n     mission capability at the battalion and the brigade levels as \n     insufficient. RAND has voluminous data and doesn't want to \n     talk about it until all the t's are crossed, long after the \n     election.\n       If Gov. Bush becomes president, the armies his father sent \n     to the Gulf will not be available to him, not after eight \n     years of degradation at the hands of Bill Clinton. Given that \n     their parlous condition is an invitation to enemies of the \n     United States and, therefore, Mr. Bush might need them, and \n     because the years of the locust are always paid for in blood, \n     he should take this issue and with it hammer upon the doors \n     of the White House at dawn.\n       In the Second World War, Marine Brig. Gen. Robert L. Denig \n     said, with homely elegance, ``This is a people's war. The \n     people want to know, need to know, and have a right to know, \n     what is going on.'' Nothing could be truer, and the vice \n     president of the United States does not speak the truth when \n     he characterizes as he does those forces that for two terms \n     his administrations have mercilessly run down. The American \n     military does not deserve this. It is not a cash cow for \n     balancing the budget, a butler-and-travel service for the \n     president, an instrument of sexual equality, or a gendarmerie \n     on the model of a French Foreign Legion with a broader \n     mandate and worse food.\n\n\n                            caesar's legions\n\n       If we are, in effect, the enemies of our own fighting men, \n     what will happen when they go into the field? The military \n     must be redeemed. Should Gov. Bush win in November he should \n     bring forward and promote soldiers and civilians who \n     understand military essentials and the absolute necessity of \n     readiness and training, people both colorful and drab, but \n     who would, all of them, understand that these words of Gen. \n     George S. Patton are the order of the day:\n       ``In a former geological era when I was a boy studying \n     latin, I had occasion to translate one of Caesar's remarks \n     which as nearly as I can remember read something like this:\n       `` `In the winter time, Caesar so trained his legions in \n     all that became soldiers and so habituated them in the proper \n     performance of their duties, that when in the spring he \n     committed them to battle against the Gauls, it was not \n     necessary to give them orders, for they knew what to do and \n     how to do it.'\n       ``This quotation expresses very exactly the goal we are \n     seeking in this division. I know that we shall attain it and \n     when we do, May God have mercy on our enemies; they will need \n     it.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this conference report contains a number \nof provisions of great importance to our troops and our veterans. \nFirst, I am very glad that one of the top priorities of this conference \nreport is improving the military health care system. The expansion of \nTRICARE, the military health care system, to Medicare-eligible retirees \nprovides a permanent comprehensive health care benefit to military \nretirees, regardless of age. All military retirees and their families \nwill now be able to remain in the TRICARE health program for life.\n  At least as important, military retirees will now have complete \nprescription drug coverage. With this new benefit, there is an even \nstronger case for Congress passing a Medicare prescription drug plan \nfor all seniors this year before we go home.\n  I am also pleased that this bill provides our troops a significant \npay raise as well as supplementary benefits for troops on food stamps \nand increased WIC nutritional support for troops overseas. These are \nissues on which I have worked for several years on the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  I am especially pleased that we have overcome significant opposition \namong the House majority to provide compensation to some of those who \nwere harmed by dangerous conditions at our nuclear weapons plants. I am \nsure that by now all my colleagues are aware that many of our citizens \nwere exposed to radioactive and other hazardous materials at nuclear \nweapons production plants in the United States. While working to \nprotect our national security, thousands of workers were subjected to \nsevere hazards, sometimes without their knowledge or consent.\n  I would like to address in more detail another provision that is \nimportant for former workers at our nuclear weapons facilities. The \ndangers at these plants thrived in the darkness of Government secrecy. \nPublic oversight was especially weak at a factory for assembling and \ndisassembling nuclear weapons at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant in \nMiddletown, IA. I first found out about the nuclear weapons work there \nfrom a constituent letter from a former worker, Robert Anderson. He was \nconcerned that his non-Hodgkins lymphoma was caused by exposures at the \nplant. But when I asked the Department of Energy about the plant, at \nfirst they denied that any nuclear weapons work took place there. The \nconstituent's story was only confirmed when my staff saw a promotional \nvideo from the contractor at the site that mentioned the nuclear \nweapons work.\n  The nuclear weapons production plants were run not by the Defense \nDepartment but by the Atomic Energy Commission, which has since been \nmade part of the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy has \nsince acknowledged what happened, and is now actively trying to help \nthe current and former workers in Iowa and elsewhere by reviewing \nrecords, helping them get medical testing and care, and seeking \ncompensation.\n  I compliment Secretary Richardson for his foresight and for taking \nthis matter very seriously and making sure that the Department of \nEnergy is forthcoming in regard to getting testing and care and \ncompensation.\n  I was pleased this past January to host Energy Secretary Richardson \nat a meeting with former workers and community members near the plant \nin Iowa. The Department specifically acknowledges that the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant assembled and disassembled nuclear weapons from 1947-\n1975. And their work has helped uncover potential health concerns at \nthe plant, such as explosions around depleted uranium that created \nclouds of radioactive dust, and workers' exposure to high explosives \nthat literally turned their skin yellow.\n  And while the Department of Energy is investigating what happened and \nseeking solutions, the Army is stuck, still mired in a nonsensical \npolicy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to ``neither \nconfirm nor deny'' the presence of nuclear weapons were assembled in \nIowa without admitting that there were nuclear weapons in Iowa. So they \nwrite vaguely about ``AEC activities,'' but don't say what those \nactivities were.\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n  There have been no nuclear weapons at the Iowa site since 1975, but \nit is well known that weapons were there before that. The DOE says the \nweapons were there. A promotional video of the Army contractor at the \nsite even says the weapons were there. But the Army can't say it.\n  What this does is, it send the wrong signal to the former workers. \nThese workers swore oaths never to reveal what they did at the plant. \nAnd many of them are still reluctant to talk. They are worried that \ntheir cancers or other health problems may be caused by their work at \nthe plant. But they feel that they can't even tell their doctors or \nsite cleanup crews they worked there or what the tasks were they did. \nThey don't want to violate the oaths of secrecy they took. One worker \nat the Iowa plant said recently: There's still stuff buried out there \nthat we don't know where it is. And we know people who do know, but \nthey will not say anything yet because they are still afraid of \nrepercussions. Instead of helping these workers speak out, the Army has \nforced them to keep their silence.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes a provision I \noffered to help these workers. It is narrowly targeted to require the \nDefense Department, in consultation with the Energy Department, to \nreview their classification and security policies to ensure they do not \nprevent or discourage workers at nuclear weapons facilities from \ndiscussing possible exposures with their health care providers and \nother appropriate officials. The provision specifically recognizes that \nthis must be done within national security constraints. It also directs \nthe Department to contact people who may have been exposed to \nradioactive or hazardous substances at former Defense Department \nnuclear weapons facilities, including the Iowa plant. The Department is \nto notify them of any exposures and of how they can discuss the \nexposures with their health care providers and other appropriate \nofficials without violating security or classification procedures.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the conference \ncommittee for joining with me in a colloquy to clarify that this \nprovision applies to all workers at such facilities, and not just DOD \npersonnel.\n  I am pleased we are passing this provision today. I thank the \nmanagers of the bill for including this provision and for the fine work \nthey have done on all aspects of this bill.\n  Lastly, I am very concerned about the recent upsurge of violence in \nthe Middle East. I strongly support the efforts of President Clinton \nand U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to negotiate a cease-fire. This \ncycle of killings and destruction must end so there can be a return to \nthe negotiating table to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace \nagreement in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin for his wonderful \ncommitment to the workers, particularly in his State, but really the \nworkers in America. He noticed something in our bill which \ninadvertently could have left out some workers we wanted to cover and \nhe wanted to cover.\n  We worked out the colloquy with Senator Harkin which will be made a \npart of the Record. I thank Senator Harkin for his intrepid effort on \nbehalf of the workers of America and Iowa. It has really paid off.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague. The three of us \nsigned the colloquy. I thank the Senator. He does look after his \npeople.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might reciprocate, I thank the chairman and Senator \nLevin, the ranking member, for including this in the bill. These were \nhard workers. They were good people. They work for a contract employer, \nnot the Department of Defense. With this change, it makes it clear they \nare covered also. I thank them both.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  While I have the floor, Mr. President, I would like to advise \nSenators that there is an effort being made to try and get the vote on \nfirst, presumably, a point of order that will be raised and then, \nfollowing that, on final passage. We hope to begin to move to those \nvotes possibly as early as 6 o'clock. So we are condensing down the \nperiod of time prior to the vote that Senators wish to speak.\n  Of course, we can arrange for such time after the votes as Senators \ndesire. This is to accommodate both sides of the aisle and many \nSenators. I thank my colleagues for working with me to achieve these \ngoals. We now have in place two Senators ready to speak, then I will \nconsult with our leadership.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Virginia will yield for \nan additional minute, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allard be \nrecognized immediately after Senator Robb for up to 5 minutes, and then \nthat Senator Byrd be recognized immediately after Senator Allard. I \nwill talk to Senator Byrd about the time situation in which we find \nourselves.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Byrd is a member of our committee and he has a \nkey piece of legislation in here. It is my hope that we can have \nSenators speak briefly so that we can get on to the issue by Senator \nKerrey.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will speak with Senator Byrd about the amount of time.\n  Mr. WARNER. And Senator Robb, our valued colleague, a member of the \ncommittee, is about to address his issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the defense authorization bill before us \ntoday has historic qualities. It represents another year of real growth \nin our commitment to national defense and the readiness of the men and \nwomen who serve this Nation in uniform. It represents our reinvigorated \nand growing national consensus on the importance of American military \npower, and our military's continuing relevance to world peace, \nstability, and prosperity. Friends and allies around the world will see \nin this bill America's commitment to leadership and our willingness to \nkeep our military the most powerful ever and equal to the challenge.\n  This bill continues to chip away at the quality of life issues that \nmake service in today's military a greater sacrifice than it needs to \nbe. This bill raises pay, improves housing, authorizes additional \nbonuses to improve retention, and improves medical care for \nservicemembers and their families.\n  I am particularly proud that this bill at last acknowledges the \npromise of lifetime health care made to America's thousands of military \nretirees and their families. The program put in place by this bill sets \nthe conditions for keeping our promise, but we should have no illusion \nthat this fulfills our debt. The devil, as usual, is in the details and \nthere is much work ahead ensuring that the system we create is up to \nthe requirements of this benefit and accomplishes its purpose. In a \nrespect our real work lies before us, now that we are over the \npolitical and budgetary hurdles of keeping the promise.\n  This bill, thankfully but modestly, also increases our procurement, \nreadiness, and research and development accounts. Anyone reading this \nbill will see our clear intent to deal with our daunting maintenance \nchallenges. Anyone reading this bill will see our clear intent to \nmodernize our tactical aircraft. Anyone reading this bill will see our \nclear intent to increase shipbuilding rates necessary to sustain a \nglobally capable 300-ship Navy. Anyone reading this bill will see our \nclear intent to accelerate research and development to bring forward \nthe next generation of aircraft--manned and unmanned, ships, and combat \nvehicles necessary to our future readiness and security.\n  Unfortunately, the rush, early this year, to massive tax cuts and \npolitical fears over new spending worked against us in making the kinds \nof real and significant increases necessary to address the challenges \nto our readiness today and tomorrow.\n  There is no doubt that significant increases in the defense top line \nare ahead. But regrettably, we have missed an opportunity to apply \nadditional resources this year to some of our more chronic military \nrequirements such as aviation spare parts and ship depot maintenance.\n  Equally regrettable, we fail again, in my judgement, to take on the \nissue of excess infrastructure.\n  One of the best ways we can help pay for current readiness is through \nreducing the DOD's large ``tail'' of infrastructure and support, which \nis taking away critical funding for the teeth--\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nour warfighting troops and equipment that will fight the next year.\n  And the best place to reduce tail is to cut more bases.\n  I am encouraged by the Armed Services Committee chairman's commitment \nto making additional BRAC legislation his first priority for our next \nsession. It is time to get over the history of this issue and get on \nwith supporting defense establishment requirements.\n  Mr. President, there are very exciting days ahead for America's Armed \nForces. The benefits of a strong national economy with projected budget \nsurpluses provide a historic opportunity across the range of national \npriorities--from paying off our national debt to tax relief. But we \nalso enjoy a historic opportunity to address today's military \nchallenges and reach deeply into the future assuring our continued \npeace and prosperity.\n  At the same time, we must be careful and have the courage to make \ntough choices where necessary ensuring that we get the most for our \ndefense dollars. We must not become embroiled in an arms race with \nourselves. We are the best already, we need only stay ahead of our \ngreatest threats.\n  Mr. President, for the last couple years one of our greatest \nreadiness challenges has been recruiting and retention. I believe a \nyoung American today should see not only a tremendous opportunity to \njoin the best military in the world, but an opportunity to join a \nmilitary that will get the resources it needs to stay trained and \nready. And, more importantly, a military that will get even better.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I rise to talk about events earlier \ntoday.\n  The explosion and loss of life this morning aboard the U.S.S. Cole is \ndeeply disturbing and has affected all of us. The U.S.S. Cole, her \ncrew, and their families are homeported in Norfolk, VA, and are proud \nmembers of Virginia's Navy family. Our prayers go out to those sailors \nkilled and injured or missing. Our prayers go out to the courageous \ncrew members right now dealing with the aftermath of this attack, and \nour prayers go out to the families of the U.S.S. Cole who live, as Navy \nfamilies always have, with quiet courage, with this kind of danger, and \nin the face of this kind of tragedy.\n  I can confidently report that the extended Navy family in Virginia \nand around the country is coming together in this tragic moment to \nsupport and comfort the families of the U.S.S. Cole. The resources of \nthis Nation will be there for them in this time of great sorrow and \nneed.\n  The U.S. Navy sails into harm's way every day around the world \nprotecting America and her interests. Today's attack is a painful \nreminder that the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place. \nAmerica's young men and women in uniform are truly on freedom's \nfrontier. As the CNO reminded us this afternoon, the U.S.S. Cole is one \nof 101 warships that are currently deployed.\n  We stand ready to provide the Navy whatever support is necessary at \nthis painful time. We are doing everything we can to ensure the rapid \nevacuation of our casualties, to ensure the security of the crew and \nship, to determine who is responsible for this attack, and to take \nappropriate action in response.\n  Even in the best of conditions, service in the U.S. Navy, afloat or \nashore, is inherently dangerous, difficult work. Ships and aircraft at \nsea in all types of weather, during the day and during the night, are, \nover the long haul, as hazardous as any conditions we ever ask \nAmericans to serve under. We owe these men and women and their families \nthe best possible leadership, a reasonable quality of life, modern \nships, aircraft and equipment, and realistic training. We owe them a \nfighting chance to serve in harm's way and to come home safe and proud.\n  The Navy is appropriately treating this as a suspected terrorist \nattack and has responded with antiterror-capable Marine security \nforces, in addition to the medical support flowing to the aid of the \nship and her crew. If we determine that this was a terrorist attack, we \nshould respond in a manner that guarantees that anyone or any state \nthat might use terror against our military or civilians understands \nthat they will pay a heavy price for misjudging either our capability \nor our will.\n  The U.S. Navy provides an indispensable contribution to world peace \nand stability. This incident cannot deter us from our commitment to \ndefend our interests wherever they are, anyplace in the world. America \nwill never retreat from our responsibilities, and we will take steps to \nbring to justice those responsible for this tragic loss of American \nlife.\n  In this time of shock and sorrow, American resolve is called upon \nonce again. We will meet this challenge.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Virginia in \nhis expression of concern about the crew and members of the U.S.S. \nCole. It still shows that we do live in a dangerous world, and our \nfighting men and women are exposed to danger every day they do their \njob.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to also make reference to the \nremarks of my colleague from Virginia. He and I have a very special \nresponsibility in this tragedy. We will undoubtedly, working together \non that, do what we can on behalf of the families, particularly, in \nthis instance.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my senior colleague from Virginia. We will be doing \neverything we can to respond to this tragedy.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is aware of the availability at 6 o'clock of \nthe briefing on this matter?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I say to the senior Senator, I am and I have \nalready availed myself of other briefings today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before I begin my statement regarding the \nconference report, I want to say that my heart goes out to the families \nof the crewman of the U.S.S. Cole in the Aden Gulf who were killed, \ninjured, or are missing. Let it be said, that if this was a terrorist \nattack, the United States shall not allow this to stand without a \nstrong response by the United States and no matter where these \nterrorists go, they will be found and they will be held accountable.\n  Now to the conference report, I want to thank Chairman Warner for \nallowing me the opportunity to speak in strong support of this \nessential Defense authorization conference report which provides the \nneeded resources for our men and women in the armed services. I believe \nthis bill is a fitting tribute for those who served, are serving, and \nwill serve in armed services in the future.\n  The Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act conference report has \nbeen a bipartisan effort and for the second year in a row we have \nreversed the downward trend in defense spending by increasing this \nyear's funding by $4.6 billion over the President's request, for a \nfunding level of $309.9 billion.\n  As the Strategic Subcommittee chairman, I would like to point out a \nfew key provisions in the subcommittee's jurisdiction, plus a few of \nkeen interest to myself.\n  As has been the pattern over the last several years, we had to \nincrease the funding for our ballistic missile and space programs. This \nbill increases the ballistic missile defense programs by $391.8 \nmillion, a very important increase of $78 million for military space \nresearch and development programs, an increase of $91.2 million for \nstrategic nuclear delivery vehicle modernization, and $80.5 million \nincrease for military intelligence programs.\n  Regarding a few specific items--an increase of $85.0 million the \nAirborne Laser Program which requires the Air Force to stay on the \nbudgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and a 2008 deployment; \nan increase of $10 million for the Space Based Laser Program; a $129 \nmillion increase for National Missile Defense risk reduction; an \nincrease of $80 million for Navy Theater Wide; an extra $8 million for \nthe Arrow System Improvement Program; and for the Tactical High Energy \nProgram an increase of $15 million.\n  Beyond the budget items, there four very important legislative \nprovisions I would like to point out.\n  First, the Secretary of Defense is required to conduct comprehensive \nreview of our nuclear posture--the first major review since 1994. \nSecond, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of \nEnergy, must develop a long range plan for the sustainment and \nmodernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. We are concerned \nthat the Department does not have a long term vision beyond their \ncurrent modernization efforts.\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  Third, in 2002, the Space-Based Infrared System Low or the SBIRS Low \nprogram will be transferred from the Air Force to the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization. And fourth, in order to assess an emerging \nthreat, a commission has been established to assess the threats to the \nUnited States from an electromagnetic pulse attack.\n  This conference report also authorizes the activities at the \nDepartment of Energy in regards to their defense activities. In order \nto ensure that America's nuclear weapon stockpile is safe and reliable \nand that our nuclear waste is managed responsibly, we have authorized \n$13 billion for Atomic Energy Defense activities at the Department of \nEnergy.\n\n  However, unfortunately, DOE has had a few problem areas in keeping \nand protecting our nation's most valued nuclear secrets. That is why we \nestablished in the fiscal year 2000 authorization bill the National \nNuclear Security Administration or the NNSA and this year's bill \nprovides a total of $6.4 billion for the NNSA. This total includes $4.8 \nbillion for weapons activities, $877.5 million for defense \nnonproliferation activities, and $695 million for naval reactors \nactivities.\n  A priority for me is the timely and efficient cleanup and closure of \nformerly used DOE weapons facilities, such as Rocky Flats in my State \nof Colorado. This bill moves the cleanup and closure of these forward \nwith strong funding lines and some key legislative provisions. For \nexample, DOE believed it would be best if they moved all the security \nand safeguards funding into one line and into one office at the DOE \nWashington, DC, headquarters. The problem is that this would have taken \nthe responsibility away from the people who are responsible for the \nsafeguards and security at each individual site, plus would have \nremoved the needed flexibility to manage the sites effectively. For \ninstance, once the material requiring security are removed from Rocky \nFlats, the savings from the reduction of these security needs would \nthen be used to accelerate the cleanup and closure at the site. That is \none of the reasons why we have a provision which would keep the funding \nand responsibility at each Environmental Management site.\n  In regards to the workers at Department of Energy sites, we provide \nemployee incentives for retention and separation of federal employees \nat closure project facilities. These incentives are needed in order to \nmitigate the anticipated high attrition rate of certain federal \nemployees with critical skills.\n  Another key provision which is very important not just for the \nworkers I know at Rocky Flats, but for workers throughout the DOE sites \nin the United States is the establishment of an employee compensation \ninitiative for DOE employees who were injured, due to exposure to \nradiation, beryllium, or silica, as a result of their employment at DOE \nsites. These workers performed a unique, important, but sometimes \nthankless task, of producing and testing our nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  Finally, I would like to mention a few important highlights of the \nconference report outside of the Strategic Subcommittee. In last year's \nauthorization bill, we enacted a much needed and deserved pay raise for \nour military personnel. This year's bill continues that progress with a \n3.7-percent pay raise beginning January 1, 2001. Along with the last \nyear's pay raise, we also made major retirement reforms, including a \nThrift Savings Plan for our service personnel. After many delays at the \nPentagon, this year's bill directs the Department to implement the \nThrift Savings Plan, in order to allow our military to prepare for life \nafter their military service is complete.\n  Let me finish with a provision that by no small measure is the most \nexpensive but couldn't be more deserving for those who have served. \nBeyond the many changes we have made in the pharmacy benefit and \nextension of benefits for active duty family members, we provide a \npermanent comprehensive health care benefit for Medicare eligible \nmilitary retirees. This has been a priority for this committee and \nCongress and I believe we are doing the right thing for our military \nretirees who have served and protected this Nation.\n  I want to thank Chairman Warner for the opportunity to point out some \nof the highlights in the bill which the Strategic Subcommittee has \noversight and to congratulate him and Senator Levin in the bipartisan \nway this bill was developed and ask that all Senators strongly support \nthe Defense Authorization Conference Report. I also want to \ncongratulate the chairman in the way he shepherded this conference \nreport down the long arduous road this bill saw.\n  One of Congress' main responsibilities is to provide for the common \ndefense of the United States and I am proud of what this bill provides \nfor men and women in uniform. I see this bill as a tribute to the \ndedication and hard work of these young men and women. I ask for a \nstrong vote on this bill in order to get that much needed and well \ndeserved resources to our military personnel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, consideration of the annual Defense \nAuthorization conference report is generally an occasion for \ncelebration and congratulation in the Senate as we reflect on the \nstrength and superiority of America's armed forces. The report that we \nare considering today is indeed a solid achievement in our efforts to \nkeep this nation on the right track as we work to bolster America's \nmilitary readiness and national security.\n  Unfortunately, the circumstances under which we are taking up this \nreport offer no cause to celebrate. The United States today is mourning \nthe loss of at least five American sailors, a death toll likely to \nrise, and the injury of dozens more in an apparent terrorist attack on \nthe destroyer U.S.S. Cole in Aden, Yemen. At the same time, the Gaza \nStrip and the West Bank are in chaos as the escalating violence between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians threatens to erupt into all-out war.\n  Our thoughts and our prayers are with the crew of the Cole and their \nfamilies, and with the entire Navy family. The attack on the Cole was a \nvile and contemptible act. We must leave no stone unturned in working \nto determine the origins of this attack, to bring those responsible to \njustice, and to redouble our efforts to protect our forces overseas. \nAnd we must renew our calls to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders to \nquell the violence in the Middle East, to stop the fighting between the \ntwo sides from spiraling out of control. Too many lives have been lost \nalready in this latest round of violence, too many children have been \nsacrificed to the disputes of their governments. It is time for the \nIsraelis and Palestinians to each accept responsibility for their \nactions, to stop the fighting, and to resume talking.\n  These grave crises are a stark reminder of the importance of \nmaintaining a strong and ready U.S. military, and the FY 2001 Defense \nAuthorization conference report that we considering today does a good \njob in meeting that goal. Like the Defense Appropriations conference \nreport that was passed earlier this year, this authorization measure \nprovides needed funding increases and policy directives to meet the \nchanging nature of our national security challenges and to respond to \ncrises affecting our national security as they arise.\n  With the current focus on the readiness of America's military, this \nis a timely package that makes a clear statement about the Senate's \ncommitment to our men and women in uniform. There is no question that \nthis is a big bill, topping out at $309.9 billion--$4.6 billion over \nthe President's budget request. It is a broad and complex measure, \naffecting virtually every facet of our nation's military forces and \nreadiness capabilities. It has not been an easy task to finalize the \nconference and reach this point. Many controversial issues had to be \nconfronted and resolved along the way. Conferees began their work \nbefore the August recess, and have labored intensely over the past \nseveral weeks to complete the conference. I commend our Chairman, \nSenator Warner, and Ranking Member, Senator Levin, for their guidance, \nskill, and leadership during the conference. While not every Senator \nmay agree with every provision of this conference report, all Senators \ncan be assured, thanks to the leadership of Senators Warner and Levin, \nthat the conferees never lost sight of the essential purpose of this \nlegislation, which is to provide for America's national security and \nmilitary readiness.\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\n  I am particularly pleased that the authorizers concurred with the \nappropriators in funding a 3.7 percent pay raise for military \npersonnel. We can never adequately compensate our men and women in \nuniform for their dedication and service to this nation, but we must \nalways strive to provide the best pay and benefits package that we can. \nIn that regard, I also welcome the comprehensive package of improved \nhealth benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees, although I \nunderstand the concern that has been raised over the cost of the so-\ncalled ``TRICARE for life'' provision that was included in this \nconference report. The cost of health care for aging Americans, be they \nmilitary or civilian retirees, is an issue that this nation is going to \nhave to confront, and that Congress will have to provide for in future \nbudgets. I have no doubt that whatever we do, as we have seen in this \nmeasure, the price tag will be steep.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees agreed to accept the provision \nthat I offered on behalf of myself, Senator Warner and Senator Levin \nestablishing a United States-China Security Review Commission to \nmonitor and assess the national security implications of the U.S.-China \ntrade relationship. In the wake of the recent enactment of legislation \nto extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China, this Commission \ncan play a key role in assuring that an enhanced economic relationship \nbetween the United States and China does not undermine our national \nsecurity interests.\n  The purpose of the U.S. China Security Review Commission is to \ndetermine whether China, which is working hard to gain entry to the \nWorld Trade Organization, or WTO, and to extend its economic dominance \nthroughout the hemisphere, will use its enhanced trade status within \nthe WTO and income from increased international trade to compromise the \nnational security of the United States. Given the circumstances--\nincluding the fact that the Chinese Central Committee just this week \napproved an economic plan that calls for doubling China's economy over \nthe next decade--this is a timely and serious issue to address.\n  Mr. President, we have good reason to be wary. I think it is \nsignificant that even before the President signed the PNTR legislation \ninto law, the Chinese started waffling on promises they had made to \nsecure entry to the World Trade Organization. I note that the \nPresident's top trade negotiator was dispatched to Beijing this week, \nshortly after the PNTR signing ceremony, to attempt to nail down \nChina's commitment to reduce tariffs on imports and open markets to \nforeign companies.\n  Let me read from an item in Wednesday's New York Times, entitled \n``Clinton Warns China to Abide by Trade Rules.''\n  I will read from the article.\n\n       Mr. Clinton sent Charlene Barshefsky, the United States \n     trade representative, on her mission on the same day that he \n     signed into law the legislation to grant China permanent \n     normal trade relations, the culmination of 14 years of \n     negotiations and a protracted struggle on Capital Hill.\n       But even as administration officials and bipartisan \n     Congressional leaders gathered on the White House lawn to \n     hail what they called China's integration into the world \n     economy, American officials acknowledged that China was \n     slipping on pledges to open its markets that it had made as \n     part of its efforts to join the World Trade Organization.\n\n  I wish I could say I was surprised by China's apparent backing away \nfrom its WTO commitments, but I was not. I predicted this. China's \nrecord on trade agreements is abysmal. Since 1992, six trade agreements \nhave been made, and broken, by China. In addition to its record of \nbroken promises on trade agreements, China also has a history of \nweapons proliferation, religious repression, poor labor protections, \nand aggressive foreign policy postures. Is this the kind of behavior we \nwant to reward with permanent normal trade relations?\n  I opposed PNTR for China, and I have grave reservations over the \nimpact of China's membership in the WTO. We are entering uncharted \nwaters in our economic relationship with China, and it is absolutely \nessential that we do so with our eyes open. We gave away our only means \nto bring the issue of trade with China before the Congress on an annual \nbasis when we passed PNTR.\n  I believe there were 13 Senators who had their eyes open when they \nvoted on that matter and they voted against it. I was one of the 13.\n  This U.S.-China Security Review Commission will restore a vital \nmeasure of scrutiny to the economic relationship between the United \nStates and China. It is a fundamental safeguard, and I am glad that we \nare moving forward with it.\n  It is not a trade commission. It is a national security commission.\n  Let's have some group that will advise the Congress as to what impact \nthe trade engaged in by China with the United States might have on our \nnational security. We are not depending upon the administration. We are \nnot depending upon the executive branch. We have a commission that will \nadvise the Congress so that we will know, we will have some idea as to \nwhat the impact on national security is of this permanent normal trade \nrelations legislation.\n  So it is a fundamental safeguard, and I am glad that we are moving \nforward with it.\n  Once again, we stand at a time when tensions throughout the world are \nhigh. In the span of only a few days, we have ricocheted from the \neuphoria of democracy--this is the way of making China a democratic \nnation. We will have great influence upon China. It is laughable that \nwe, the people of 212 years, will have influence upon the people of \n5,000 years. No. We have ricocheted from the euphoria of democracy \nsweeping through Yugoslavia, to the despair of escalating violence in \nthe Mideast, to the horrific images of dead and injured American \nsoldiers on the U.S.S. Cole, the victims of an apparent anti-American \nterrorist attack. We are reminded that peace remains an elusive goal, \nand that America must remain vigilant.\n  The first order of business is to ensure that the United States \nmaintains the finest, the best equipped, the best protected, and the \nbest managed military in the world; a military force--but we will have \nto make it all of these things--a military force suited for the \nemerging challenges of the 21st century. This conference report goes a \nlong way to meet that test. It is a good package.\n  I urge its adoption, and I again commend Senators Warner and Levin \nfor having led the way for others of the conferees to the final \ndevelopment of this package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank our dear friend from \nWest Virginia for his nice remarks about the chairman and myself. I am \nwondering if we could line up some speakers. We have Senator Reed of \nRhode Island and Senator Cleland on our side who need some time on the \nconference report before we get down to the point of order. I have not \nhad a chance to talk to Senator Hollings on that issue. But I am \nwondering if we could set up a line of speakers with Senator Reed for 5 \nminutes on our side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make sure I hear because I have \nSenator Domenici and Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  I, first, want to thank our very valued Member, Senator Byrd, of the \ncommittee. I was privileged to join him on the legislation on the China \nCommission. I can't tell you how our committee benefits from his work \nand wisdom that he has given us through the many years.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Virginia was \na sterling and very steadfast advocate of this legislation. I am deeply \nin debt to him for his leadership in the committee, and also to my \nfriend, Mr. Levin, for his support of this commission.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me join our chairman in commending \nSenator Byrd for the way in which he worked so hard for this \ncommission, and for the valuable function this commission is going to \nperform for all of us. Whichever side of that debate we were on in \nterms of PNTR, and however we voted on it, this commission is going to \nbe very helpful to all of us.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I will endeavor to see \nwhat we can do to convenience the Senate and keep this bill moving.\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\n  Our esteemed colleague, Senator Kerrey, has his time reserved. We \nwant to have several others before we get to his issue, if that is \nagreeable. Senator Reed has been waiting, Senator Gramm, and Senator \nDomenici.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Cleland.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Cleland, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Let's alternate between sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Reed, who has been waiting the longest, wishes 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Domenici, on my time for another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And back to Senator Cleland for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then we go to Senator Gramm, who has his time under the \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  It would be our hope the Senator will consume less than the allocated \namount under the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was hoping our distinguished chairman would consume less \nthan allocated on the budget but he consumed 10 times as much.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will have the opportunity, Mr. President, to have a \nfew words on that subject.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman will yield, it is my understanding under \nthe existing unanimous-consent agreement after the 2 hours under your \ncontrol, either used or yielded back, 2\\1/2\\ hours under my control, \neither used or yielded back, the 1 hour under the control of Senator \nGramm of Texas, either used or yielded back, and Senator Wellstone, I \nbelieve, has already utilized his time, at that point we then turn to \nthe point of order, and Senator Kerrey would be recognized for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. For those who are following this, you \nwill make a point of order, at which time I will seek recognition to \nhave that point of order waived.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We jointly ask unanimous consent the order of speakers be \nfollowed for such length of time that we outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the fiscal \nyear 2001 Defense authorization conference report.\n  I believe this bill contains many excellent provisions which will \nensure that our military remains the finest in the world.\n  As to personnel benefits, this bill also takes great steps to improve \nhealth care, pay and benefits for armed services personnel.\n  For the second year in a row, Congress approved a pay raise for \nmilitary personnel. This year's 3.7 percent pay raise will go into \neffect on January 1, 2001.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of Defense to implement the Thrift \nSavings Plan for active and reserve service members.\n  Many Members of Congress have been outraged to learn that a number of \nactive duty service members qualify for food stamps. This bill \naddresses that issue by directing the Secretary of Defense to implement \na program which provides additional special pay of up to $500 per month \nfor those service members who qualify for food stamps.\n  This bill also eliminates co-payments for active duty family members \nfor health care received under TRICARE Prime. In addition, Congress \nextended TRICARE Prime to families of service members assigned to \nremote locations.\n  For military retirees, this bill goes far to fulfill the promise made \nto our military retirees when they enlisted that they would be given \nlifetime healthcare.\n  Congress approved a permanent comprehensive health care benefit for \nMedicare-eligible retirees which effectively makes all military \nretirees eligible for health care within TRICARE.\n  Under this plan, military retirees and family members may keep their \nMedicare coverage and use Tricare as a Medicare supplement to pay costs \nnot covered by Medicare.\n  This provision can save military retirees thousands of dollars in \nout-of-pocket costs.\n  Congress also expanded the comprehensive retail and national mail \norder pharmacy to benefit all Medicare eligible retirees and their \neligible family members, without enrollment fees.\n  On submarines, this bill also provides significant resources for the \nNavy's submarine fleet, a military asset very close to the hearts of \nthe residents of my home state Rhode Island:\n  Authorizes funding for the construction of the third Virginia class \nsubmarine, the U.S.S. Hawaii;\n  Authorizes a block buy of submarines from FY03-06 which will greatly \nincrease the efficiency and lower the cost of our next generation of \nsubmarines.\n  In transforming for future threats, the Navy will soon be faced with \na decision on whether to refuel old Los Angeles class submarines or \nconvert four Trident submarines which are scheduled to be retired to \nspecial operations boats. I believe that this decision must be made \nvery carefully and so I am pleased that this report contains language \ndirecting a study of the advantages of Trident conversion over \nrefueling.\n  I am also pleased that significant funding has been authorized for \ncountermine measures. I believe this is a necessary program that has \nbeen woefully underfunded in recent years.\n  As to Army transformation, in October 1999, senior Army leaders \nannounced a new vision to enable the Army to better meet the diverse, \ncomplex demands of the 21st century.\n  At present, in some instances the Army faces strategic deployment \nchallenges that inhibits its ability to negotiate rapidly the \ntransitions from peacetime operations in one part of the world to \nsmall-scale contingencies in another.\n  Army heavy forces have no peer in the world, but they are a challenge \nto deploy.\n  The Army has the world's finest light infantry, but it lacks adequate \nlethality, survivability, and mobility once in theater.\n  The Army Transformation Strategy will result in an Objective Force \nthat is more responsible, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, \nsurvivable and sustainable than the present force.\n  A force with these capabilities will allow the Army to place a combat \ncapable brigade anywhere in the world, regardless of ports or \nairfields, in 96 hours.\n  It will put a division on the ground in 120 hours. And it will put 5 \ndivisions in theater in 30 days.\n  This bill supports the Army Transformation efforts by authorizing an \nadditional $750 million for the initiative, of which $600 million is \nfor procurement requirements and $150 million for R requirements.\n  On impact aid, I am also pleased that the conference report contains \nlanguage I authored to address the considerable financial strain on \nschool districts educating military children with severe disabilities \nand help military families get the best education for their children \nwith severe disabilities.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, military personnel with children \nwith severe disabilities often request and receive compassionate-post \nassignments to a few districts known for their special education \nprograms.\n  The cost of providing such education is disproportionately high for \nthese communities. In fact, for some of these children, the cost is \nupwards of $50,000 to $100,000 a year (as compared to an average per \npupil expenditure of $6,900).\n  In my home state, Middletown, Portsmouth, and Newport are districts \nwith many military children with disabilities. This year, Middletown \nalone is providing education to 66 high need military children with \ndisabilities at a total cost of nearly $1 million.\n  This experience, however, is not unique to Rhode Island. In fact, \ndistricts ranging from San Diego and Travis Unified in California to \nFort Sam Houston Independence in Texas also face considerable financial \nstrain in their endeavor to educate military children with \ndisabilities.\n  Section 363 of the conference report, Impact Aid for Children with \nSevere Disabilities, requires a report containing information on \nmilitary children with severe disabilities, and authorizes funding to \nease the strain on local communities providing education to high \nnumbers of such children.\n  Mr. President, this critical program will help ensure that military \nfamilies get the best education for their children with disabilities, \nwhile providing needed relief to school districts, and I am very \npleased that it has been adopted.\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\n  I look forward to working with my fellow committee members, the \nDepartment of Defense, impact aid organizations, military personnel, \nand affected communities to press for funding for this program next \nyear.\n\n  Under the Montgomery G.I. bill, Mr. President, I would now like to \nturn to some items that I regret have not been included in the \nconference report.\n  First, I would like to mention the expansion of Montgomery G.I. bill \nbenefits that have been advocated for years by our colleague, Senator \nCleland.\n  One of the most innovative provisions he proposed would have allowed \nservice members to transfer Montgomery G.I. bill benefits to family \nmembers.\n  I believe this transferability would have been an effective tool for \nrecruiting new members and retaining trained and skilled service \nmembers.\n  This provision would have had a negligible impact on the budget: The \nprovision was not written as an entitlement, but rather would have been \nimplemented at the discretion of the service Secretaries.\n  However, this provision, which was included in the Senate bill, was \nultimately eliminated from the conference report because it was too \nexpensive.\n  Yet while this provision was considered too expensive, in conference, \nmajority leaders created and approved a greatly expanded entitlement \nfor retirees which will cost $60 billion over ten years.\n  I am disappointed that we were not able to include both of these \nworthy items in this conference report and I will continue to work with \nSenator Cleland to ensure it is included next year.\n  As for hate crimes, Mr. President, I would like to express my extreme \ndisappointment regarding the stripping of the hate crimes legislation \nfrom the Department of Defense (DOD) authorization conference report.\n  Fifty-seven United States Senators voted to add this important \nlegislation to the DOD authorization bill, 232 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives instructed the conferees to keep the hate crimes \nlegislation in the DOD authorization bill, and both the President and \nVice-President have expressed unwavering support for this legislation.\n  Although some argue that hate crimes legislation has nothing to do \nwith authorizing our nation's defense programs, a majority of the \nSenate added it to the DOD authorization bill because we were never \ngiven the opportunity by the Republican leadership to vote on it as a \nstand alone bill.\n  I support this legislation because it sends a message that society \nfinds crimes motivated by bias especially heinous and worthy of \npunishment.\n  Hate crime laws recognize that a violent act committed against \nsomeone just because of who they are, is intended to intimidate and \nfrighten people other than the immediate victim. While a hate crime \nmight be targeted at one person, it is really directed at an entire \ncommunity.\n  Considering the intent behind a person's action in committing a crime \nis not a new development. Deeply ingrained in our nation's laws is the \nrecognition that intentions count when it comes to crime. That's why \npremeditated murder is punished more severely than manslaughter.\n\n  Hate crime laws express society's judgment that a violent act \nmotivated by bigotry deserves greater punishment than a random crime \ncommitted under the same circumstances.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Act does not trample on our nation's ideals \nof free speech and equal justice under the law.\n  The Supreme Court has held constitutional state legislation that \nenhances penalties for hate crimes, respecting findings that hate \ncrimes often provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional \nharms on their victims, and incite community unrest. The Court affirmed \nthat it is reasonable to have greater punishments for crimes that cause \ngreater individual or societal harm.\n  Hate crimes are very real offenses, combinations of uncontrollable \nbigotry and vicious acts of personal injury. These crimes not only \ninflict physical wounds, but wreak mental and emotional devastation by \nattacking a person's identity.\n  People who hurt or kill someone because that person represents a \ncertain community, deserve harsher penalties.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that he hoped that one day all \npeople will be judged by the content of their character.\n  A majority of the U.S. Senate, a majority of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President and Vice President believe this to be \nthe case. Our nation's hate crime laws should be extended so that we--\nthat all people can have the freedom to be themselves without fear of \nbeing attacked for who or what they are.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we were not able to accomplish all that \nwe set out to do with this conference report.\n  However, I believe that it is ultimately a solid legislative effort \nthat will help our military and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I commend Chairman Warner and the ranking member, \nSenator Levin, for their great work in bringing to the floor a \ncomprehensive and critically needed reauthorization of our defense \nprograms. This is legislation which recognizes the extraordinary \nsacrifices of our military personnel around the globe--sacrifices which \nwere certainly highlighted today in the gulf.\n  One part of this legislation is an enhancement of personnel benefits, \nboth pay and health care. There is a sentiment which I subscribe to, \nfrankly, as a veteran and as an American, that we cannot reward our \nservice men and women enough for what they do each day. There is a very \npractical consideration, and that is the limits of our budget.\n  This legislation does many good things, but it raises an important \nquestion. It raises the question of whether we are reaching the limits \nof resources that we can effectively devote to personnel concerns, not \nonly in terms of overall economic strategies in the country but also in \nterms of the inherently limited defense dollars because dollars we \ncommit to personnel force cannot be used for operations, cannot be used \nfor modernization, cannot be used for a host of programs that give us \nthe qualitative education, and give our service men and women serving \ntoday the tools to do this very critical job. That question keeps \nemerging in the context of this legislation. For those personnel \nenhancements, certainly no one deserves more recognition or reward than \nour men and women in uniform.\n  Let me speak about several other topics included within this \nlegislation. First, I am pleased to see that submarines have been \nrecognized. This is a very valuable aspect of our national security. \nThis legislation would authorize funding for the construction of a \nthird Virginia class submarine, the U.S.S. Hawaii, and authorize a \nblock buy program of submarines for fiscal years 2003 to 2006. It is \nmore efficient, a better way to spend our dollars to get the quality \nsubmarines we need. It also recognizes the requirements to augment our \nsubmarine fleet by either new construction or by refueling existing 688 \nattack submarines.\n\n  This legislation, I am pleased to say, contains legislation language \nthat directs a study of conversion of Trident over refueling, \nconversion of certain submarines over refueling, and that type of study \nis inherently positive and useful for future deliberations.\n  What is happening to our services today as we speak is a profound \ntransformation based upon new threats, a transformation based upon new \npolitical realities in the post-cold-war world. It is a transformation \nwe have to undertake with each service. I believe this legislation lays \nout some good guidelines for the transformation.\n  With respect to the Army, it does support the Chief of Staffs' \ncommitment to forming five to six new interim Army brigades that would \nbe more mobile, better able to be positioned around the world. It also \nsets up testing requirements that will ensure these new concepts are \nthoroughly tested.\n  With respect to the Air Force, it recognizes what has already been \ndone in terms of organizing 10 aerospace expeditionary forces in \nproviding resources and certainly support for that.\n  With respect to the Navy, it recognizes and, again, as evidenced \ntoday, the Navy now has responsibilities close in shore, along the \nlittorals. They have to be prepared to meet the hostile fleet\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\nat sea. But more often they are called upon to be close in, supporting \noperations, supporting political and diplomatic issues. That, too, is \nrecognized here.\n  So we have legislation that is comprehensive, legislation that \nrecognizes the need to reward our service men and women, legislation \nthat recognizes the need to transform our military services because of \nour new world, and legislation that I think goes a long way in building \nthose vital programs, such as submarines, but there are others, that \nare critical to our future national security.\n  There are several regrets, though, and one regret is that included \nwithin the Senate version of the legislation was the hate crimes bill--\nimportant legislation that could match our ideals with our legislative \nintent. We all profess, indeed, would say stoutly and without \nreservation, our abhorrence for hate crimes, the need to condemn them. \nUnfortunately, this language which was included in the Senate version, \nand which the House also favorably supported for at least an \ninstruction of the conferees, could not be included in the final \nversion of the legislation. I regret that.\n  What it means is that we have to return next January with a \ncommitment to pass this legislation. Hopefully we can pass it standing \nalone; hopefully, if that is not the case, on some legislative vehicle. \nBut this legislation is necessary. Certainly I will be supporting this \nlegislation because it will make us more capable, it will help us \nmodernize our forces, and will reward those forces who are serving so \nvaliantly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is next to be \nrecognized under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support for the Defense Authorization \nConference Report of 2001. The conferees have worked very hard to \nachieve consensus or reach compromises on the provisions found in this \nyear's report.\n  The conference report contains many positive things for ensuring \nAmerica's continued military dominance; in addition, it also includes \nseveral authorizations for defense activities in the state of New \nMexico. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member for their \ncontributions.\n  I would like to specifically address what has been achieved in this \nbill with respect to laser programs and directed energy technologies. I \nstrongly believe that lasers, like THEL and Airborne Laser, will offer \noffensive and defensive military means far beyond our current \ncapabilities. These programs deserve our full support. At the same \ntime, we need better coordination of our nation's efforts in lasers and \nother directed energy technologies.\n  I am pleased the Committee accepted my amendment that requires the \nSecretary of Defense to implement the High Energy Laser Master Plan and \nauthorizes up to $30 million for these vital technologies. This \namendment also requires selection of a site for the Joint Technology \nOffice (JTO) by the Secretary of Defense. The JTO will perform a \ncritical role in achieving better coordination and execution of our \nnation's laser programs. The bill also underscores the vital role of \nthe High Energy Laser Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range and \nthe importance of DoD's close coordination with other federal agencies, \nacademia and industry in creating a stable foundation for further \nprogress in these technologies.\n  Although my original legislation encompassed all directed energy \ntechnologies, including microwaves, in this defense-wide effort, the \nconferees would not support this position. Instead, the legislation \nwill require the Pentagon to take a hard look at integrating all other \ndirected energy technologies into the current structure for High Energy \nLaser programs. From my perspective this would be a logical next step \nin the Pentagon's efforts to streamline and better coordinate its \nresearch programs. This would also accelerate progress and maximize \nefficiencies for these related technology areas.\n  The conferees also addressed shortfalls in some specific ongoing \nlaser weapons programs. They authorized $85 million to restore the most \nof the Airborne Laser (ABL) program funding. The Air Force's ABL \nprogram is the only missile defense system currently contemplated that \nwould strike and kill missiles in their boost phase.\n  In addition, the conferees reached a reasonable compromise on the \ncontrol of funding for Airborne Laser after the Air Force radically cut \nthat program's budget. The Air Force will retain funding control for \nABL; however, it must have the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's \n(BMDO) approval before making any changes to any aspect of the program, \nincluding its budget.\n  The Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) was authorized at $15 million \nfor FY2001. THEL represents one of the first weapons systems being \ntested that utilizes high energy lasers for the purposes of missile \ndefense. I led the charge to obtain an additional $5.7 million in FY00 \nfunding for continued testing of this weapon system this year. Since \nthe passage of the Senate bill earlier this year, THEL has shown that \nlasers can provide effective, speed of light defenses against Katyusha \nrockets. In the coming months, THEL will be tested against other \ntargets and will provide us additional insights into the lethality of \nthis particular type of system.\n  I am committed to addressing the shortfalls in the science and \ntechnology funding to ensure more rapid development and fielding of \nhigh energy laser weapons. However, I am also committed to expanding \nthese efforts to all directed energy technologies. While I appreciate \nthe Committee's attention to these vital programs, more must be done to \nensure the directed energy science and technology is fully streamlined \nand sufficiently funded. These technologies can assist in countering \nsome of the most prevalent threats confronting us.\n  This long-awaited conference report will have a positive impact on \nthe day-to-day concerns confronting our military. For example, quality \nof life received much needed attention. I applaud the 3.7 percent pay \nraise for military personnel and the comprehensive health care for \nMedicare-eligible military retirees. The conference report also \nretained the extension of the TRICARE Prime benefit to families of \nservice members assigned to remote locations and the elimination of co-\npayments for services received under TRICARE Prime.\n  This legislation contains landmark provisions with respect to \nhealthcare for our military retirees. Many complicated and situation-\nspecific problems currently exist with the health care programs for \nactive and retired military members as well as for veterans. It will \ntake more than one year of fixes to find the right combination of \npolicies and ensure that the funding for military health care is not \nforced to compete with other defense priorities.\n  These will aid in addressing the health care crisis within our \nmilitary and provide proof of our desire to keep our promise. I applaud \nthe conferees for enacting sweeping reform to a broken system.\n  Military Construction and family housing is authorized at $8.8 \nbillion, an increase of $788 million over the Administration's request. \nI am pleased that projects critical to the operational effectiveness \nand well being of the service members and military families residing in \nNew Mexico were addressed in this bill. These are not glamourous \nprojects. These authorizations will replace critical crumbling \ninfrastructure, such as repair of the Bonito pipeline between La Luz \nand Holloman Air Force Base.\n  Five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams were \nincluded at a cost of $15.7 million. This will provide us with a total \nof 32 Civil Support Teams by the end of fiscal year 2001. These teams \nare comprised of full-time National Guard personnel trained and \nequipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, \nor radiological events in support of local first responders. One such \nteam is currently being trained and fielded in New Mexico, ensuring \nthat New Mexico constituents and its vital assets have better \nprotection against such attacks.\n  The bill authorizes a total of $13 billion for Atomic Energy Defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy. A total of $6.4 billion of this \nfunding is for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n  Over $1.0 billion is authorized for the nonproliferation and threat \nreduction\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\nprograms of the Departments of Defense and Energy. These programs \ncontinue to make great strides in the critical process of securing \nweapons of mass destruction and retaining scientific expertise in the \nformer Soviet Union. To further ensure that these threat reduction \nprograms achieve their goals, the committee has also included several \ninitiatives to obtain greater commitment and necessary access from \nRussia.\n  Earlier this year I introduced a bill to improve the structure and \nsignal a meaningful U.S. commitment to DOE's nuclear cities initiative. \nI strongly believe that without significant restructuring in nuclear \nweapons production complex of Russia the progress in strategic arms \nreductions could readily be reversed. Further, the proliferation threat \nof underemployed and underpaid Russian weapons scientists could create \na direct, negative impact on international security. I thank the \nCommittee for focusing efforts on this issue.\n  While I am pleased with the authorization levels to support stockpile \nstewardship and nonproliferation, I am dismayed that the conferees took \nit upon themselves to adopt additional provisions on polygraphs. These \nnew requirements will entail polygraphs for an estimated 5,000 \nadditional persons working in our nuclear complex. I find it \nastounding--especially in light of the findings in the Baker/Hamilton \nReport--that the conferees included these provisions. That report \nstated unequivocally that ``(t)he current negative climate is \nincompatible with the performance of good science. A perfect security \nsystem at a national laboratory is of no use if the laboratory can no \nlonger generate the cutting-edge technology that needs to be protected \n. . .''\n  There is little evidence that polygraphs administered as a screening \ntechnique is an effective use of security resources. The Conferees \napparently view mass polygraphs of everyone at the Labs as a silver \nbullet that will ensure no future security breaches. That is a naive \nview of security that fails to recognize that polygraphs are simply one \ntool among many, that must be wisely and judiciously used to ensure a \nstrong security culture that will allow science to thrive. Otherwise, \nthe silver bullet of mass polygraph will end up killing the labs, not \nprotecting them.\n  In sum, security is a moot point if our national laboratories fail to \nachieve scientific advances worth protecting. The Baker/Hamilton Report \nclearly indicated that we should avoid further ``made in Washington'' \nrules that frustrate scientific pursuits and only serve to further \ndemoralize laboratory personnel. I believe these provisions will only \nmake a bad situation worse.\n  Finally, $38.9 billion is provided for the defense research, \ndevelopment, test and evaluation programs--an increase of $1.1 billion \nover the President's budget. This funding will focus on the \nrevolutionary technologies to address emerging threats and ensure that \nAmerica's military remains dominant in the future.\n  In years past I have repeatedly emphasized the need to stop the \nebbing tide and end the lengthy decline in defense budgets. We must not \ntire in our efforts to maintain a strong, ready and professional \nmilitary. Quality of life is central to recruitment and retention. \nCombat readiness of our armed forces must never be at risk. And we must \nensure that we are developing and leveraging new technologies to the \nmaximum extent. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines require the \nmeans necessary to respond to international uncertainty and address \ndifferent and diffuse security threats. We must not fail them or U.S. \ncitizens in rising to this challenge.\n  One of the most dangerous things confronting the United States of \nAmerica is the current situation of morale at the three nuclear \nlaboratories of the United States. These are the three labs that for \nthree generations we have sent the greatest scientists in America, the \nbest young scientists who wanted to go because it was a great place to \nwork. We used to get the top graduate Ph.D.s from Texas A in physics. \nThey would cherish going to one of the nuclear laboratories for 10 or \n12 years. From MIT, from Harvard, from Cal Tech, everywhere.\n  We were being told about a current report available to this \ncommittee, while it was in conference, the committee that produced this \nbill, called a Baker-Hamilton report, named after Senator Baker and \nRepresentative Hamilton. It is about 6 weeks old. They were asked to \ncheck the current situation in our laboratories. They are more worried \nabout the morale of the scientists there than any other single thing. \nThey have concluded that the recruitment of young, bright scientists is \noff in excess of 50 percent because of the constant bombardment of \nthose laboratories over the last 18 months with references to security, \nsome of which has been corrected.\n  They also concluded that a laboratory which is perfectly secure but \ncannot maintain the highest degree of science in the world is not a \nvery good laboratory. They maintain that we should do less polygraphs, \nnot more, be more targeted, and more efficient and more effective.\n  Guess what the bill does. This bill permits 5,000 additional \nlaboratory employees. This may even permit them to go down to a \njanitor, I don't know, and submit polygraph tests to them. And believe \nit or not, they provide a waiver for the Secretary of Energy. Then they \nsay you cannot use the waiver if, in fact, the reason for it is that \nthe laboratory is having morale problems and cannot keep its personnel \nto stay alive. That is paraphrasing.\n  I read the exact words: This amendment would prohibit the Secretary \nfrom using the waiver to maintain the scientific viability of a DOE \nlaboratory. That is the precise reason you should be able to use a \nwaiver, the viability of the laboratories.\n\n  Frankly, I am not at all sure everyone who signed this conference \nreport and produced the bill that they really think is a great bill \nknows that provision is in there.\n  I say to my good friend, the chairman of the committee, I worked hard \nand fast and side by side with the Senator from Virginia to get a new \nlaw to create a new, semiautonomous agency with which he helped so \nmuch. It is now known as the National Nuclear Safety Administration, \nheaded by a great general whom you know, General Gordon. If you asked \nhim, Can these laboratories work under these kinds of conditions? he \nwould tell you: Please don't do that. He would say: Please don't do \nthat. That is the wrong thing to do.\n  Frankly, all I am asking is that the Senate take heed of what I am \nsaying. I am not asking for anything more. I am not even asking the \ndistinguished chairman for anything today. I only hope he is listening \nand next year, early on, when the Senator from New Mexico tries to \nchange this provision consistent with the Baker-Hamilton report--and \nalmost everybody who has looked at our National Laboratories since the \nWen Ho Lee case would agree, too--I hope the distinguished chairman and \nthe chairman's staff will consider, early in the year of the next \nCongress, something that will fix this provision; 5,000 additional \npolygraph employees is not the way to go with the laboratories in the \nposition they are in now.\n  There is no evidence that polygraphs of the type they are talking \nabout have anything to do with security, veracity, or anything else. I \nknow the people who work there. It is somewhat of an insult to consider \nthe average employee, some of whom have been there 30 years, has to be \nsubject to a polygraph because security has gone awry in the \nlaboratories.\n  I really wish I had had a chance to present this issue. I think it is \nexactly the kind of thing we should not be doing. I am going to do \neverything I can, starting next year with the first legislation that is \naround, to change this. In the meantime, I am glad the Secretary does \nnot have to go next month and start immediately imposing these \npolygraphs. He has a little bit of time. I hope he squeezes the time so \nnext year we can fix it. That is all I have on this subject.\n  I say to the distinguished chairman, thank you for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on my time I thank my colleague for \nbringing this to our attention. I commend him for the fervor with which \nhe has taken the interest of these very vital laboratories, some of \nwhich are in his State, and spent inordinate amounts of time\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\nin his Senate career trying to strengthen them and look after the \nemployees. I know how difficult it was for him to work through the \ncomplicated case which was recently disposed of.\n  I worked with the Senator in the creation of this new entity in the \nDepartment of Energy. I am about to get some new documents. Once I get \nthem, I want to show them to you and we may find a little time to \namplify this record. But I am advised, subject to the documents coming, \nwe did take into consideration the concerns the Senator has expressed, \nand we do have a letter from the individual primarily responsible for \nsecurity saying they could work with this proposal, this language.\n  Until I get that letter, I will withhold. But I may ask unanimous \nconsent to have documents printed in the Record, should I get them in \nmy possession, after showing them to my good friend and colleague, the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know the Senator from Georgia is prepared to speak. Will \nhe allow me to intervene for a moment? I do not want to take away from \ntime that may be reserved, so I yield myself such time from my leader \ntime as is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief. I want to commend Senator \nWarner for the effort he and his staff have put into this bill. I am \nhoping we can wrap up the debate and get to the votes that are going to \nbe required on the point of order and final passage before too late in \nthe evening.\n  This has been a long time coming. It has been a laborious process. \nSenator Warner stuck with it. Obviously, he had help from his colleague \non the other side of the Capitol, the gentleman from South Carolina, \nCongressman Spence. He worked with Senator Levin, the ranking member. \nBut this is a monumental achievement.\n  There are some people who have the idea we do not need the Defense \nauthorization bill if we have already done the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill and military construction appropriations bill, but \nwe need this bill because it authorizes important programs; it \nauthorizes important changes in the law; it authorizes the money that \nwe need. I want to touch on a few of those very briefly.\n  The funding level for new budget authority for the Department of \nDefense in this bill is $309.9 billion, which is $4.6 billion above the \nPresident's budget request. It is an increase over what was requested \nfor procurement, for research, development, test and evaluation, and \noperations and maintenance. It also has a 3.7-percent pay raise for \nour military personnel effective January 1, 2001.\n\n  Last year, when we had a pay raise for our military men and women, \nthe word I got from the rank-and-file troops, and also from the Joint \nChiefs, including specifically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was \nthat it absolutely transformed the attitude of our military men and \nwomen who were leaving and were not ``reuping,'' as the saying goes in \nthe military, because they really wondered if we appreciated them and \nknew they were there. At least by improving their pay, by dealing with \ntheir retirement benefits, and now in this bill, another pay raise, and \ndealing with this question of health care, it is going to have a good \neffect on morale. Obviously, we want the morale to be good. We want \nquality of life in the barracks. We want the ships and tanks and \neverything we need. But if we do not begin with decent living \narrangements for our military men and women, then all is lost.\n  This bill comes at a critical time. Just today we see what the risks \nare--the U.S.S. Cole, built in my hometown of Pascagoula--I believe I \nwas there when it was commissioned--300 sailors on the ship, and now we \nsee 3 dozen or more of them are killed or injured and others are \nmissing. Yet this is one of the most sophisticated ships in the world. \nBut it shows once again, if we have kamikazes who are willing to put it \nall on the line, to get killed, to do damage, they can do damage to our \nequipment and to our men and women. This is no time to nitpick this \nbill and turn away from it.\n  There are those who say we should not be starting these new programs \nor make them permanent. But for our military men and women, active duty \nand retirees, and for their families, we need to address this health \ncare question. For our military people to be told, at 65, you are off, \nyou are off this program, go there and get on Medicare or find some \nother arrangement, is wrong. When we talked to our military personnel \nand our retirees and we said: what is really the thing that you want \nthe most in helping you deal with your health care needs, they cited \nthe pharmaceutical problem, the need for pharmacy benefits, either mail \norder or, in this bill, through retail.\n  This is a major achievement. I have already had military retirees and \nveterans call my office literally in tears to say thanks for what we \nare doing here. Maybe it was not done exactly the prettiest way, or in \nthe way it should have been done early on, but this is a major \nachievement. I do not want to be the one to explain to some veteran, \nbecause of a procedural issue or a point of order, that we don't \naddress this need of our military men and women and their families and \nour retirees. I am not going to explain that. I am going to vote for \nthis bill, and I am going to do it proudly.\n  Then there is another provision that objections have been raised \nabout, and that is the Department of Energy employees who were injured \ndue to exposure to radiation and other problems at our DOE facilities \nand nuclear facilities. Again, there may need to be more work on it. \nMaybe it should have been handled in a different way. But who wants to \ntell these people who have been injured by our Government operation, \n``There is no program for you.'' Not me. I do not think we should walk \naway from this at this point.\n  This is a reasonable compromise. Both the retirement and the DOE \nprogram that was added as we went along, and expanded, while it may \npresent certain difficulties for some of our people, in the end it is \nthe right thing to do. Also, it is attached to a bill that we need \ndesperately--a good bill, a bill that has been a long time coming.\n  I thank all those involved. There are so many parts of it I could \nrefer to that are important, but I didn't want us to get to final \npassage without me saying we should do this bill--we should defeat the \npoint of order, and we should pass this bill. It is the right thing for \nthe defense of our country, for our veterans, and the right thing for \npeople who have been injured and haven't been properly compensated. We \ncan fine tune the program as we learn more about the extent of the \ndamages and how much they are injured and the proper way to deal with \nit, but for now I urge my colleagues, vote for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished majority \nleader. This bill had a long and tortuous course through the Senate, \nbut he stood by our side, not only me, as chairman, but the members of \nthe committee from both sides of the aisle, and the Democratic leader \nlikewise.\n  I see the presence of the distinguished Senator from Nevada. On those \ndays when we were on again and off the next, you stood by. Last year, \nyou were the first one to cosponsor the bill on the pay raise, the \nfirst one this year to cosponsor the bill on the medical benefits. \nWhile you are no longer a member of our committee, having once been \none, you have stood with us throughout this whole process. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I inquire how much time our distinguished colleague and \nvery valuable member of the committee, without whose wit and function I \ndoubt we could function, requires.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. Two minutes.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to remind \nMembers that the news today reminds us why we need a Defense \nauthorization bill; why we need pay increases for our military men and \nwomen abroad; why we need our Armed Forces to be strong; why we need to \ntake care of our military retirees, especially in terms of their health \ncare needs; why we need a defense of this country at all.\n  Our young men and women are in 121 nations around the globe, and they \nstand on watch in defense of this country. In doing so, they \nvoluntarily, every one of them, place themselves in\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nharm's way. We saw the cost today of that terrible price that is \nexacted from time to time on our service men and women. All of us have \nin our hearts and in our thoughts and in our prayers the families of \nthose service men and women on board the U.S.S. Cole as they struggle \nwith taking care of their dead, their wounded, and their missing.\n  This year's Department of Defense authorization conference report \nrepresents months of hard work and compromise on behalf of our Nation's \nmilitary, as has been discussed. I thank Chairman Warner and ranking \nmember Carl Levin for their leadership throughout this entire process \nthis year and for their support particularly of my initiatives to \nenhance the GI bill. Stephen Ambrose, the historian, particularly of \nthe greatest generation of World War II, said the GI bill is probably \nthe finest piece of legislation ever devised by the Federal Government.\n  I thank Senator Hutchinson, chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, \nwith whom I have worked closely this year on issues pertaining to the \nquality of life of our service men and women.\n  This conference report has been a long time coming, as has been \ndiscussed. We began the authorization process earlier this year. Here \nwe are in the closing days of this session of the Congress and finally \ndebating the conference report for the DOD authorization bill.\n  The extended time we have taken on this year's bill has been \nworthwhile, though. It represents our continued effort in the Senate to \nbuild upon a firm foundation by providing a substantial increase in \nfunding for the U.S. military, and Lord knows we need it.\n  Last year was the first step in addressing some of the pressing needs \nof those who defend our Nation by providing pay increases--and by the \nway, with last year's pay increase and this year's 3.7-percent pay \nincrease, we will have provided just in the last 2 years the biggest \npay increase in a generation.\n  This bill not only provides pay increases but reform of the military \nretirement pay system, targeted bonuses, critical investments in spare \nparts, and continued support for the next generation of weapons \nsystems.\n  We have taken an even bigger step this year throughout this process. \nWe have talked with our men and women in uniform. This year I have been \nto Kosovo. I personally have been to Japan and the Korean peninsula. I \ntalked with our men and women in uniform serving around the world. I \nconsulted with the leadership of the services. We have taken yet \nanother step to fulfill the promises to support those who put on the \nuniform and carry our flag every day.\n  Our people, as we now know, and are so painfully reminded today, face \ndangers every day in what seems the most routine of tasks. Our hearts \ndo go out to the sailors and families of those serving, especially on \nthe U.S.S. Cole, tonight in the Middle East. Those sacrifices are just \na recent reminder of what our men and women face every day.\n  This year we continue the support of the modernization of our Armed \nForces by funding the next generation of weapons systems, such as Joint \nStrike Fighter providing critical funding for the F-22 aircraft. We \nhave authorized additions to some of our most trusted aircraft systems \nby increasing the funding for C-130s made in my home State of Georgia \nand funding additional JSTARS aircraft, without which we could not \nconduct modern warfare.\n  Also included in this bill is increased funding to support the Army's \nplan to transform itself into a leaner, more mobile fighting force. We \nhave authorized funding of $222 million for our spare parts accounts \nand over $407 million for equipment maintenance accounts to address \nsuch critical readiness issues.\n  This year, as with last year, we have increased funding in support \nfor the most critical weapon in our arsenal--our military men and \nwomen. It is their hard work and selfless service that make America's \nmilitary the strongest force in the world.\n  This year, we provided that 3.7-percent pay increase to all military \npersonnel. We have eliminated TRICARE copayments for our military \nfamilies and extended TRICARE Remote to active duty family members \nassigned to remote locations who do not have access to military \ntreatment facilities.\n  We have authorized almost $9 billion for military construction and \nprovided improvements to family housing, which is much needed. We have \nincluded full implementation of a thrift savings plan for service \nmembers.\n  We have also authorized those military families eligible for food \nstamps to qualify for an extra $500 a month. Most importantly, this \nyear, we have taken an enormous step by providing health care access \nfor our military retirees. Since my election to the Senate, I have \nheard from military retirees in Georgia and across the Nation regarding \nhealth care benefits. When they were asked to serve their country, they \ndid not turn their backs on our country. Time and again, we have heard \ntheir call for keeping this country's promises to them.\n  This year, we are living up to that promise. In this conference \nreport, we have authorized the Warner-Hutchinson provisions granting \nTRICARE for seniors as a lifetime benefit for our retirees over the age \nof 65. For the first time, we are granting health care insurance for \nmilitary retirees over 65. Though in the beginning this was a 2-year \npilot program to be fully implemented and fully funded in the outyears, \nwe worked to make this benefit permanent.\n  Additionally, I worked with my colleagues to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit, prescription drugs being the biggest out-of-pocket \nexpense for military retirees, for our Medicare-eligible retirees. This \nis the first prescription drug benefit to be offered by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Our military retirees have earned these benefits, and I am proud to \nsupport both of these vital provisions.\n  One quality of life issue I have been working on during the past 2 \nyears has been educational benefits. I was pleased that two provisions \nof my educational initiative are included in the conference report: \nauthorizing the services to pay 100 percent of tuition assistance for \ngoing to school while in the military and allowing VEAP participants to \nbuy into the Montgomery GI bill. However, we have to do more. I will \ncontinue to work to address the quality-of-life issues, especially \neducational benefits. I still believe we must make the GI bill more \nfamily friendly. We must work to offer a transferability option to our \nmilitary families, as recommended by the congressionally mandated \nPrincipi Commission.\n  I note this conference report is subject to a budget point of order. \nThere are important concerns about the increases in mandatory spending \nthat are included in the legislation. However, this spending which is \nmainly for health care benefits is needed and justified. Therefore, I \nwill not support the budget point of order and will support final \nadoption of this conference report.\n  In the next congressional session, we have to continue to work hard \nto establish meaningful benefits for service members who serve our \ngreat Nation by taking additional steps along the road to maintaining \nthe finest military in the world. We must honor the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines who serve this country. They deserve it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again thank our distinguished colleague \nfrom Georgia. His knowledge of the military and his real love and deep \nrespect for them to this day is an invaluable contribution to our \ncommittee. I thank him for his hard work and his extensive travel to \nmilitary bases and installations in the United States, as well as \nabroad.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could just ask my friend from Virginia to yield, let \nme join in his thanks to our good friend from Georgia for the really \nnot only invaluable but unique contribution based on his experience, as \nwell as his judgment, on so many issues that come before us.\n  It is hard to imagine the committee without the Senator. I just want \nto add my thanks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we should add to that--Senator Levin and \nI--how hard the Senator fought with respect to amendments on the GI \nbill for portability of the benefits, enabling\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nthe service person to have a quantity of those benefits--whatever \nfraction might be agreed on in law--to be passed on to a spouse or a \nchild. I supported that and fought that battle with you, I say to the \nSenator. We did not win. We lost in conference. But, I say to the \nSenator, we will start that next year.\n  Now I would like to refer to the UC agreement which is governing this \ndebate. I will read from it: That following the debate just outlined--\nthat is basically what we have had to date--Senator Bob Kerrey be \nrecognized to make a point of order, and that the motion to waive the \nBudget Act be limited to 2 hours, equally divided in the usual form.\n  It also states: I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nuse or yielding back of time on the motion to waive, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the motion and, if waived, a vote occur immediately on \nadoption of the conference report, without any intervening action, \nmotion, or debate.\n  The one remaining thing is, I intend to fairly--and I am sure my \ncolleague from Michigan does as well--deal with Senator Phil Gramm, who \nunavoidably had to leave the floor. But let us proceed now under this \norder with the recognition of our colleague, Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not know if that is a unanimous \nconsent request or not.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I didn't put it in the form of a UC.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my good friend from Nebraska would yield for one moment \nfor me to comment on that, the situation we are in is the following: We \nwere to use all of the time on the conference report prior to turning \nto the point of order. We were to either use it or yield it back. We \nhave not done that yet. Yet the Senator from Virginia is suggesting we \nturn to the point of order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator raises a correct point. But I \nwant to protect Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could just finish my thought, I fully agree with the \ndetermination to protect the Senator from Texas. On the other hand, I \ndo not know where that leaves us in terms of this unanimous consent \nagreement. And if I could complete my thought, everyone reasonably \nwants to have some idea as to when the votes will begin, and to a large \nextent that is going to depend upon Senator Gramm's decision of how \nmuch time he wants to use of his time.\n  I want to, as a factual matter, see if my good friend from Virginia \nhas the same understanding. Both of us have time remaining, I believe, \non our time.\n  The 2 hours under the control of the chairman, how much of that time, \nif I may ask the Chair, is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes is remaining under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that time now still remaining under the approach we are \ntaking, if we turn to----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it would be, because I have not yielded \nback time on the UC. I was just trying to keep this thing moving in an \ninformal way, protecting our colleague from Texas. I would be willing \nto yield back my 14 minutes. I presume the Senator would be willing to \nyield back his 59. Because the two of us have time under the debate of \nthe motion of the Senator from Nebraska. So I think we are adequately \nprotected. That would move this forward and shorten the time between \nnow and the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would concur in that approach that we \nyield back the remainder of our time on the conference report. I \nunderstand Senator Wellstone has yielded back the remainder of his \ntime. That would leave 1 hour under the control of Senator Gramm. We \nwould then modify the unanimous consent agreement so that hour, in \neffect, would be placed into this second tier of debates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I want to clarify, I am \nnot certain at what juncture Senator Gramm would be recognized. Again, \nhe is unavoidably away from the floor. But we could proceed, presumably \nunder Senator Kerrey's motion and my motion that I would make, and \nreally have the vote on that, and then Senator Gramm could be \nrecognized if he can't be recognized beforehand.\n  So I am prepared to yield back 14 minutes. As I understand it, the \nSenator from Michigan yields back 59 minutes. Let's have action on \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Virginia restate his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. The unanimous consent request is that I yield back my 14 \nminutes remaining under the existing unanimous consent agreement, and \nthe Senator from Michigan yields back 59 minutes, with the \nunderstanding that the UC agreement which provides 1 hour under the \ncontrol of Senator Gramm remain intact.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection to that. I think that is a good \ncourse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I make a point of order the pending \nDefense authorization conference report violates section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant provisions of \nthe Budget Act with respect to the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4205, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the 106th Congress appears to be heading \ntowards an ending which will be regarded by many as an orgy of \nspending. Over the past 12 years when I was approached by citizens who \nsought additional spending I would invariably reference the spending \ncaps contained in the Budget Act as a way to encourage restraint. But \nthis year, the total spending contained in thirteen FY2001 \nappropriations bills will be $100 billion over the original spending \ncaps. By drastically increasing the spending baseline, we are adding \nmore than $1 trillion in additional spending over the next ten years. \nThis additional spending is in excess of one dollar of every ten \ndollars in total U.S. Gross Domestic Product which we propose to \ncollect in taxes and spend. This will be done with nary a debate about \nthe wisdom of our actions.\n  In addition, there are active discussions under way about spending \nmore to ``fix'' the changes we made in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, to \ncut taxes, and to create a prescription drug benefit for seniors. \nBefore we go any further, we need to step back and take a look at the \nchoices we are making about the budget surplus.\n  The Defense authorization conference report is our first opportunity \nto do so. Contained in this bill is an authorization that drastically \nexpands the health care entitlement of military retirees over the age \nof 65--a provision that costs more than was allocated to the Armed \nServices Committee under current law. The cost of this provision \nviolates our budget rules because it mandates $60 billion in new \nmandatory spending beyond what is authorized in our budget resolution. \nBecause this provision violates the Budget Act, at least 60 Senators \nmust vote to ignore the budget resolution. While fully I expect 60 \nSenators will vote to do just that, I hope the debate this afternoon \nprovides us with a better perspective on what we are about to do with \nthe people's money.\n  The provision we are debating about increases health care spending on \n1.2 million military retirees and will cost, according to CBO, $60 \nbillion over the next 10 years. But this number is deceiving. By 2010, \nthe annual cost will be nearly $10 billion. I think we have a duty to \nask ourselves what problem are we attempting to solve at an eventual \nannual cost of $10 billion? The provision in the conference report \nwould allow military retirees to remain in TriCare when they turn 65 \nand would allow these retirees to continue to receive health care \nprovided by the Department of Defense. Currently, when military \nretirees turn 65, they must transition from a more generous health \ninsurance program called TRICARE to\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\na less generous program called Medicare where co-payments and \ndeductibles are higher. By changing the law, we will in essence be \nproviding a subsidy for military retiree health insurance coverage that \ncontains no deductibles or co-payments and a generous prescription drug \nbenefit. Imagine the cost if we did the same for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I oppose the provision both for policy and budgetary reasons. First, \nthe rhetoric in support of this spending exaggerates the promise that \nwas made to the men and women who volunteered and served in our Armed \nForces. Worse, it undermines and reduces the value of the motivation of \nmillions who volunteered with no expectation or desire of being repaid \nwith taxpayer-financed benefits. Our motivation was that it was our \nduty, and that the service would be good for the nation and for us. In \nmy case, I got a bargain and I do not like the feeling I get when I \nhear former comrades-in-arms claim they are entitled to some benefit on \naccount of their service.\n  A second objection to this provision is that it is in essence an \nadmission that Medicare is an inadequate program whose coverage is \nunacceptably poor. Military retirees are not the only former employees \nin America who must transition from health care provided in the work \nplace to Medicare. You could probably find millions of current Medicare \nbeneficiaries who would stand in line to have their co-payments and \ndeductibles paid as this provision will do for military retirees. If we \ngrant this benefit to military retirees, how soon do you think it will \nbe before non-military retirees will be asking Congress to do the same \nfor them?\n  My third objection is based upon considering the source of the money \nwe will use to pay this subsidy. The source of the money will, of \ncourse, be individual and corporate income taxes. Please don't tell me \nthe government is paying for this. That is a euphemism used by \npoliticians and military retirees alike to hide the truth: we will be \ncollecting individual income taxes from millions of working families \nwho cannot afford to buy health insurance in order to subsidize the \npurchase of Medigap coverage for millions who could afford to pay their \npremiums.\n\n  Unfortunately--as is often the case--beneficiaries of this income \ntransfer are better organized and better informed than those who will \nbe paying the bills. As a consequence, there will likely be 60 votes to \nwaive the budget point of order. I doubt there would be 60 votes if the \ntransfer of funds was in the opposite direction: from those who have \nhealth insurance to those who do not.\n  My final objection is that the extension of this benefit conflicts \nwith the need we have to invest in our current forces: their salaries, \ntheir training, their equipment, and their benefits. Every dollar we \ncommit to increased spending on the mandatory side of our budget--which \ncurrently represents two-thirds of total spending--comes at the expense \nof appropriated spending, defense and non-defense alike.\n  It is very possible that this business of breaking the budget caps \nmay become a habit. If that's the case, then the conflict between \nmandatory and discretionary spending may become moot. That's the good \nnews. The bad news is, if this happens we will have spent our way back \ninto fiscal deficits.\n  Under the budget law that governs our spending, we should be spending \nno more than $540 billion on defense and non-defense appropriations. \nThe budget resolution enacted by Congress earlier this year allowed for \n$600 billion in spending. The appropriations bills we are trying to \nfinish will contain at least $40 billion more.\n  Most Members of Congress are aware--even if most Americans are not--\nthat we cannot do this under the law. To appropriate $640 billion, 60 \nSenators will have to vote to waive our own budget act to lift the \nspending caps or to waive the imposition of $100 billion sequester of \nall defense and non-defense appropriated accounts.\n  My fear is that we will likely take this action as a consequence of \nour desire to get out of town quickly. We will have minimal debate and \nwill hope that the American people do not notice what we have done \nuntil after the election. However, if we were to have an actual debate \non this issue, I believe there would be at least two positive outcomes \nbeyond informing the American people of what we are doing. First, \ndomestic spending levels dictated by our budget act are too low. \nSecond, in less than ten years, the pressure of mandatory spending, \neven presuming lower interest costs, will become enormous.\n  Mr. President, I do not expect to win this vote given the margin of \nvictory when it was considered in the Senate earlier this year. \nTherefore, I will not take more of my colleague's time with further \narguments against this provision. Instead, I want to present a case for \nincreasing defense and non-defense spending, but against the willy-\nnilly process which will lead to the greatest expansion of domestic \nspending since Lyndon Johnson was President. After I make this case, I \nwill briefly describe the looming problem of mandatory spending.\n  The good news on spending is that a synergistic combination of \nfederal fiscal discipline and economic growth has shrunk domestic \nspending as a percentage of total U.S. income to its lowest levels \nsince the middle 1970s. Ten years ago, total Federal spending consumed \n22 percent of U.S. GDP. This year, federal spending will be 18 percent \nof our GDP. According to CBO, if current law is unchanged, total \nspending will fall to 16 percent in ten years, the lowest percentage of \nour income since the Eisenhower administration.\n  In current dollars, each 10 percent of GDP represents nearly $1 \ntrillion. It is a tremendous amount of money that causes the people of \nmost other nations on this earth to shake their heads and wonder at our \ngood fortune. Leaving $4 trillion in the economy over the next 10 years \nfor private sector purchases and investments adds a lot of constructive \nsteam to our economy. This fact gets too little attention when we are \ndebating how to sustain our current economic recovery.\n  Mr. President, this is why we need to stop and to consider what we \nare doing before we quietly agree to spend $1 trillion beyond the \noriginal discretionary spending caps. We would be better-served if we \nmade this decision to increase the caps with a coherent and holistic \ndebate about how to invest the surplus. A spending strategy that would \nincrease the productivity of our work force by increasing the \npercentage of college graduates, and by increasing the number of high \nschool graduates who have the necessary technical training to succeed \nin the American economy. A thoughtful debate on our spending strategy \nwould no doubt also lead to higher spending levels on early childhood \neducation and adult education. A thoughtful debate on our spending \nstrategy would no doubt recognize the need to invest in our non-human \ninfrastructure of roads, research, sewer and water. And a thoughtful \ndebate on our spending strategy would no doubt contain safeguards to \nmake certain that we do not throw good money after bad.\n  Instead, we are going to commit ourselves to dramatic increases in \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending without any unifying motivation \nbeyond the desire to satisfy short term political considerations. To be \nclear, Mr. President, I do not believe most of these considerations are \nbad or unseemly. Most can be justified. But we need a larger purpose \nthan just trying to get out of town.\n  On the mandatory side of the spending equation we have allowed the \nheady talk of surpluses as far as the eye can see to prevent us from \nseeing the wave of baby boomers that will begin to become eligible for \ntaxpayer subsidized health and retirement benefits in less than 9 \nyears. In less time than our most senior colleagues have served in the \nSenate, the ratio of American workers being taxed to pay the benefits \nfor those who are eligible will shrink from 3 workers per retiree to 2 \nworkers per retiree. If we continue to vote for more and more \nspending--as a percentage of our income--on Americans over the age of \n65 and less and less on Americans under the age of 18 we will create \ntwo terrible problems: workers who do not have the skills to earn the \nmoney needed to support their families and a collective working \npopulation whose total income is smaller than needed to avoid higher \npayroll taxes.\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\n  And yet that is exactly what we are doing with this provision in the \nDefense authorization conference. We obligate another $60 billion of \ntax revenue to reduce the burden of buying Medigap insurance. Just this \nyear, a majority of the Senate has voted for a prescription drug \nbenefit, an end to the Social Security earnings test, a decrease in the \nincome tax of Social Security income, and this military retiree \nprovision. Together, these mandatory spending items will cost the \nAmerican taxpayer more than $500 billion over the next ten years.\n  These spending levels may in fact be justified and affordable. \nHowever, they could also end up squeezing our domestic spending further \nas a percent of GDP. Because entitlement spending programs are locked \ninto law, because those who favor these benefits are well organized and \neasily provoked come election time, they tend to be protected from \nspending cuts forever.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider how many votes there would be for a \nproposal to waive the budget act in order to spend $60 billion more on \nour children to improve the quality of their health, their education, \ntheir lives. How many votes would there be for such a proposition? Less \nthan 60, I assure you.\n  Mr. President, I regret the proposed expansion of tax payer \nsubsidization of military retirees' health benefits will not take place \nin the context of a more thorough debate of current and future Federal \nspending. In my view, it would be far less likely that this entitlement \nexpansion would occur if we understood how it will add to the problems \ncreated by rapidly growing mandatory spending that begins again just as \nthe full cost of this new benefit kicks in. And it would be far more \nlikely that if we did vote for such an expansion we and the American \npeople would understand the future consequences of our actions.\n  Mr. President, let me say, I regret this may be my last speech on the \nSenate floor and that it be a speech against extending additional \nbenefits to my fellow veterans or, stated another way, which I think \nneeds to be thought about as we do this, asking other taxpayers to pay \nsome things that I currently pay for myself by asking them to subsidize \nme even more for the service.\n  I am military retired, let me fully disclose to my colleagues. I will \nbenefit from this provision regardless of what my income is, regardless \nof what my need is. I say to you, I am personally offended by some of \nthe rhetoric around this. I did not volunteer for the U.S. Navy in \norder to get anything. And you take away the most important value that \nI have from my service: I served; I volunteered. You did not have to \nbuy that. You did not have to give me a health care benefit.\n  If you want to give me a health care benefit, give it to me, but \nplease do not say you owe it to me. You may decide it is necessary, but \nI got more from my service than my country got from me. I am the one \nwho benefited from my service. And I am much less likely to benefit if \nall of a sudden I become a mercenary. You would owe me money because \nwhat this bill does is it says that when our veterans reach age 65, \nMedicare is not good enough; Medicare will not be good enough for the \n1.3 million veterans over the age of 65 who are military retirees; it \nis not good enough.\n  We are going to buy their Medigap insurance. Oh, no, Medigap isn't \ngood enough. It has to have a prescription benefit in it. That is what \nthis does. It asks one group of taxpayers to pay the Medigap insurance \nfor another group of Americans who say Medicare is not good enough.\n  Look, I know it is a hot issue. I have received lots of phone calls \nalready from people who say: Gee, Kerrey is down here trying to stop \nthis.\n  I do not expect to get more than 40 votes. I hope there aren't 60 \nvotes to waive the Budget Act. I say to my colleagues, nothing would \nsend a better signal from this Congress right now than for us to say \nthat we will not waive the Budget Act--that we will not waive the \nBudget Act.\n  We are not getting much leadership down at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. And there is a spending orgy going on. We are \ngoing to have another vote to waive the Budget Act on appropriations. \nThe cap, prior to the budget resolution, was $540 billion. The budget \nresolution raises it to $600 billion. We all sort of privately know it \nis going to be $640 billion or $645 billion. That is $100 billion over \nthe previous cap. That is $1 trillion over 10 years. There is a meeting \ngoing on amongst Senate Democrats on the Finance Committee, talking to \nSecretary Summers about a tax cut package. There are lots of \ndiscussions going on about putting more money back in, as a consequence \nof the BBA of 1997, for health care providers.\n  I do not know what it all adds up to, but I will tell you, I have \nnever been in a situation where I took a phone call from somebody who \nsaid: Senator, this only costs $60 billion over 10 years--it only costs \n$60 billion over 10 years. That is what I am getting from people right \nnow.\n  So I think we would send a very important signal, right now, saying \nthat we will not waive the Budget Act, we will not waive the Budget Act \nthat has created the fiscal discipline that enabled us to get to where \nwe are today. I think it would send a very important signal. I \nunderstand that you would have to take this thing back to \nconference tell the House Members we are coming back next week anyway. \nIsn't it worth $60 billion to spend a little more time to get this \nthing right?\n\n  Let me get into the substance of this. I think it is important for us \nto send a signal that we will not waive the Budget Act to spend only \n$60 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Let me make the case against the provision. First of all, I \nreiterate, you don't owe me any additional benefits. This Nation \ndoesn't owe me anything. I will make that case, and I will make it \nrepeatedly because I have heard an awful lot of rhetoric here that \nimplies that I am a mercenary.\n  I am a better person because of my service. I learned from my \nservice. I believe I am a part of a nation as a consequence of my \nservice. I wasn't just in the Navy; I was in the U.S. Navy. It has \nenriched me. It has benefited me. You didn't have to pay me to get me \nto do it. I did it as a consequence of believing that it was my duty. I \nthought I was going to be the one who came out ahead, and I have.\n  Please, in the rhetoric you are using to describe why this is \nnecessary, don't tell me it was a promise. I am one of the \nbeneficiaries of this language, and I wasn't promised any benefit when \nI signed up. If you want to give it to me, fine, but please don't tell \nme that you owe it to me.\n  Secondly, it is important for us to do some sort of evaluation of \nneed. The last time I checked, I didn't see an awful lot of military \nretirees out there foraging in the alley for food. We need to do some \nsort of evaluation of need. Remember, we are taking $60 billion over \nthe next 10 years from one group of Americans, and we are going to pay \nfor the Medigap insurance, including a prescription drug benefit, for \nanother group of Americans.\n  I don't know how many Americans we are going to tax who are out there \nright now saying, I don't have enough income to pay for my health \ninsurance, but there are a number who are. They are sitting out there, \nhard-working families, paying their bills, who are an important part of \nour country as well, who are an important part of our society.\n  We are not saying to them, you are entitled to Medigap insurance. We \nare not saying to them, you are entitled to a prescription drug \nbenefit. What you are entitled to is to pay somebody else's bills. \nRemember, the Government doesn't pay for anything. All we do is collect \nthe money and pay the bills for somebody else. We are obligating $60 \nbillion over 10. In the tenth year, this thing is knocking on the door \nof being $10 billion a year at the very moment--which is my third \npoint--at the very moment when we have this unprecedented baby boom \ngeneration that begins to retire.\n  I know this surplus goes as far as the eye can see. I understand that \nit has gotten more difficult to say no to people as a consequence of \nthat; the fiscal discipline is lucid. But we are not going to change \nthis demographic boom that is heading our way. It is not going to be \naltered. There aren't enough H-1B visas we can issue to immigrate our \nway out of this problem. We aren't going to have three people working \nwho we tax to pay the retirement and health care benefits of those who \naren't working. We are only going to have two. We are going to have two \nworkers\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\nper retiree. You don't get to pick Warren Buffet and Bill Gates to tax. \nYou tax an average.\n  As a consequence of taxing that average, we are going to have a very \ndifficult time paying the bills. Everybody who has examined this says \nthat is the case. It is true that right now, under the previous CBO \nevaluation, we have stabilized the cost of mandatory programs, but not \nfor long. We are going to be right back off to the races again starting \nin 2009. Our Federal Government, unless we exhibit some restraint, is \ngoing to become an ATM machine. We are going to be collecting money \nfrom one group of taxpayers and shipping it on to another group of \ntaxpayers.\n\n  The reason it is a problem can be seen in the way our authorizers had \nto deal with this. They didn't want this money to come out of Defense \nappropriations. They didn't want it to come out of readiness accounts. \nThey didn't want it to come out of our ability to be able to recruit, \nto train, and equip our forces. No. They want to protect that. So they \npush it all over into mandatory.\n  Well, you can only push it so far. I am sure the chairman of the \nBudget Committee will say at some point you have a limited amount of \nmoney you can extract from the U.S. economy. If you have a limited \namount of money and you have mandatory programs going, it is going to \neventually put pressure on appropriated accounts. The paradox, in my \nview--not shared by all--is that we probably are underinvesting right \nnow in things that will increase productivity and will increase the \nstrength of our economy. It is a paradox because we are going to be \ntaxing the very people in whom we are underinvesting because we don't \nhave a sufficient amount of resources in the appropriated accounts.\n  As I said, on the basis of policy, I think on the basis of fiscal \ndiscipline, on several other bases I could talk about, this sounds \ngood. Again, I understand the pressure. Nobody organizes better than \nAmericans over the age of 65 in order to get something they think they \nare entitled to. In a relatively short period of time, I have generated \nwell over 75 phone calls, including one misguided human being who said \nhe was going to do everything in his power to make sure that my Medal \nof Honor was taken away from me. Well, more power to him; have at it. \nIt is not likely. I am not offended by that. It is just an indication \nof the intensity of people's feelings, to which they are entitled. They \ndon't tell us where we are going to get the money. The Government is \ngoing to pay for it; that is as far as they will go. Let the Government \npay for it.\n  The Government--I say again, for emphasis--doesn't pay for anything. \nIt collects. It taxes one group of people in order to pay the benefits \nfor another. That is what we are doing. You have a very difficult time, \neither on the basis of promise or on the basis of need, making the case \nthat this group of Americans needs to have us pay their Medigap \ninsurance, including a prescription drug benefit.\n  I hope my colleagues, at this moment when we seem to have lost our \nfiscal discipline, will come to the floor and say: I might have, under \nnormal circumstances, liked to be able to help these military retirees, \nbut we have to stand up and say, no, we are going down a road where, \nwhen the smoke clears, we are going to find ourselves looking pretty \nfoolish for having spent all the money or committed all the money that \nwe have done.\n  I hope my colleagues, even those who might say they like this \nbenefit, will not vote to waive the Budget Act. The Budget Act has \ngiven us the discipline that enabled us to get this far. To sort of \nwilly-nilly come down here and say, fine, my phone is ringing off the \nhook, I will not be able to stand up to that, I have to say, yes. The \nBudget Act allowed us to turn to our citizens and say, we have to be \ndisciplined. It gave me, for 12 years, a method by which I could say, \nlook, I support what you are doing, but we don't have the money. We \nhave to say no sometimes to things we want to spend money on.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and muster the will to \nvote no on waiving this Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there are moments in the life of a \nSenator that they will never forget. This is one I will not forget. I \ndon't have a better friend in the Senate than my good friend from \nNebraska. I don't know of any Senator--well, perhaps Senator Inouye, of \ncourse--who has more rightfully earned the respect of this body and, \nmore specifically, the men and women of the Armed Forces for his \ncourageous acts in the field of battle in Vietnam. I was privileged to \nbe in the Navy Secretariat with our recently departed, beloved former \nSenator Chafee, who was then Secretary when the Medal of Honor was \nawarded my good friend.\n  I have to say to my friend that, yes, in law, it is not clear about \ntheir entitlement, but in every other respect--sometimes the law is \nsilent--these people were, time and time again, told they would have \nfor life their health care.\n  I want to draw a distinction which was not clear in the Senator's \notherwise very able presentation. He talked about his service, indeed \nmy service, which was very insignificant compared to his, but we both \nserved in the Navy at different times. I think I have some faint \nrecollection of this, but it was long ago; I won't rest my laurels on \nthat.\n  You went in initially not with the idea of becoming a careerist, and \nthere may have been a point in your career when you did think about \nstaying for 20 years.\n  The people who are entitled under this legislation are the ones who \ndevoted their careers--a minimum of 20 years and often more years of \nservice--to the military. It is not those like myself who served for \nbriefer periods in World War II and brief periods in Korea. This \nlegislation doesn't cover them. It would not cover you, regardless of \nyour injuries which entitled you to other medical care that you \nreceived that was service connected. My point is, the person who goes \nin for one hitch as an enlisted man, one tour as an officer, they are \nnot the beneficiaries under this. It is that class of individuals who, \ntogether with their families, have dedicated a career, who have moved, \nwho responded to the call to go overseas many times, in most instances. \nThat is what this legislation is for. I would like to have the Senator \ncomment on that.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to, Mr. President. First of all, I am a \nretired Naval officer for medical reasons. The Senator is quite right; \nthere is a difference between the reason I signed up, how I did it as a \nreserve officer, and somebody who signs up for 20 years. No question, \nthat is true. I don't mean to imply there isn't a difference; there is \na significant difference. When I hear people describing what this \nbenefit does, that we are only talking about people who are in 20 \nyears, the rhetoric is far afield on this.\n  I feel like I can't go home and talk to friends and neighbors and say \nI am getting one more thing from my Government here. I am just telling \nyou that I don't feel as if this country owes me anything. I want my \ncolleagues, especially those who didn't have any military service, to \nknow that. I have gotten more out of it than my Nation got. You say, \nwell, somebody who has been in 20 years should be promised health care. \nThere are employees we promised health care to. I say this to the \nSenator from Virginia: Medicare is health care. What do you say to \nsomebody who has been in the workforce who says, ``My employer promised \nme health care, and I get to be 65 and I have to have Medicare.'' Do we \nsay we are going to pick that up as well? That will be the next thing \nknocking on our door.\n  Mr. WARNER. It should be knocking on our door.\n  Mr. KERREY. Are we going to pay the Medigap insurance for every \nsingle Medicare beneficiary?\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the obligation of the Congress to fix Medicare and, \nindeed, I know of initiative----\n  Mr. KERREY. I don't disagree, but to fix Medicare by saying there \nwill not be copayments or deductibles, I don't think there is anybody \non the floor who would argue that eliminating copayments and \ndeductibles is the way to save money in health care. Quite the \nopposite. The argument on the other side of the aisle--joined by me in \n1997--is we should go in the opposite direction. This eliminates \ncopayments and deductibles.\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. It was intentionally devised that way. When I made \nreference to the nonmilitary people in this country who are not, of \ncourse, eligible because of absence of a career in military service, \nCongress should be addressing that issue. I know of initiatives time \nand again to try to do that. Regrettably, it will probably not be done \nin the waning days of this Congress, but we have an obligation to these \npeople. Do you realize if we had not made this program permanent, we \nwould be casting on these individuals--most of whom are over 65 to 70, \nand some are medically retired--they would be forced to make a decision \nto drop their private insurance, which they had to go out and buy? They \nhave to make other decisions because they would not be certain that \nCongress at some future date would make it permanent. So that is why we \nhad to go down this road.\n\n  I will yield in a moment. First, I want to show my good friend \nsomething that I found. I went out and did some research on this \nbecause I have spent endless hours trying to figure out the facts. I \nhave found this recruiting poster for the U.S. Army. Can the Senator \nread it from there?\n  Mr. KERREY. I can imagine.\n  Mr. WARNER. ``Superb health care. Health care is provided to you and \nyour family members while you are in the Army, and for the rest of your \nlife if you serve a minimum of 20 years of active Federal service.'' \nThis is an actual official recruiting document. I daresay there are \nmany others like it from World War II to this date. If you are a young \nman or a young woman enlisting today and this is printed by the U.S. \nArmy, you believe it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. It will take 30 seconds to respond. On that basis, my \nGovernment owes me a lot of travel. They promised me I was going to see \nthe world. All I saw was Vietnam, right? So I go to OCS for, they told \nme 16 weeks; it was 18 weeks. Guess what they said. ``We lied to you. \nBig deal.'' We have a lot of promises we have to keep if we are going \nto fulfill every promise made at every recruiting office in the United \nStates. Come on, this is about deciding how much we can afford. There \nis a limit. I know the chairman understands there is a limit. There is \na point beyond which one can't go. Are we going to do long-term care? \nAre we going to promise to pay for that? There are lots of things we \ncan pay for and say we have an obligation.\n  The question before us is, Are we going to waive the Budget Act? This \nDefense conference authorization requires $60 billion worth of spending \nbeyond the budget resolution. That is the question, not do you like \nwhat this is. You may like this particular provision. But I am telling \nyou, with just a couple of days left in this Congress, we are on a \nspending orgy. I am having people saying to me: Don't worry about \nwaiving the budget resolution on appropriations; don't worry about \nwaiving the budget resolution on Defense authorization; don't worry, we \nhave to get out of town. Well, we are going to get out of town having \ndone an awful lot of damage if we take that attitude.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Nebraska have any time to yield \nme?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, if I might reply, I respect the \nSenator from Nebraska. I associate myself with his remarks that the \nmilitary did more for him than he gave to the military. That is \ncertainly true in my case. I don't think it is true in his. I think he \nserved with the greatest distinction, and this country is everlastingly \nin the Senator's personal debt. Certainly, for this humble soul, the \nmilitary did more for me than I did for it. I have said that on the \nfloor a dozen times.\n  There is living proof of promises made. I have shown you the \ndifficulty facing the aged people over 65 and into their seventies who \nhave to make a decision depending on the vote about to be taken in this \nSenate. They were made to commit one way or another by their Nation. I \nthink they are deserving, having given their careers, families, \nspouses, whatever. I urge that Members of the Senate join me in waiving \nthis Budget Act.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield briefly?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I will be as quick as I can because I understand \nSenator Gramm wants to comment at more length than I. Let me say to the \nSenator from Nebraska, when you came to the Senate, I had already been \nhere a while. I didn't know anything about you. I didn't know you were \na Medal of Honor recipient of the United States. I know you don't like \nto hear this, but I want to tell you that what you are doing tonight \nshows that you have something about you that is intuitively or \ninstinctively courageous because what you are down here doing is not so \neasy for many Senators because, obviously, there is going to be a lot \nof guff for what you have proposed tonight, asking that we not waive \nthe Budget Act.\n  I wish to also say to everyone that neither of us--including Senator \nGramm--are saying we should not do what we are doing tonight for our \nveterans. What we are saying is, with 2 days left in the session, \nneither the House nor the Senate having any detailed hearings, nor the \nMedicare people having detailed hearings on this, we come out of a \nconference with an agreement and propose a little item that over a \ndecade will cost $60 billion.\n  That may be something veterans are entitled to, but I believe we are \nall thinking that there is no end to American prosperity and to \nAmerican surpluses. I think we have come to the conclusion that they \nwill be here forever and they are in quantities beyond anything we can \nimagine--and whatever goes in the waning moments goes. I think I can \nsupport this; I just don't believe we ought to do it now, with 2 days \nleft, without sufficient hearings on the effect on the rest of \nGovernment. I might say, without trying to figure out who we are going \nto give prescription drugs to under Medicare, who are also people who \nare hurting very much and who think Medicare should have covered them \nbetter--there are millions of those people.\n  I believe the Budget Act singularly permitted the Congress to get its \ndeficit under control. There are benefits from that. Every single \nAmerican, every single veteran, and everyone in this country \nparticipates in a prosperity movement, with low interest rates and \nthings people thought they would never acquire because when we used to \nstand up and say, ``Don't waive the Budget Act,'' nobody waived it. In \nfact, I didn't check tonight to see how many years had gone by when \nneither Senator Domenici, nor Senator Gramm, nor Senator Kerrey, nor \nwhomever would say that violates the Budget Act to see if you could get \n61 votes. That is why the decade of the 1990s became the decade of \ndiscipline.\n  Do you know the Government of the United States, on average, for the \ndecade of the 1990s grew 3.3 percent, the most formidable in terms of \nsmall growth in the last 50 years? There is no reason other than that \nas to why this deficit has come down the way it has and prosperity has \ngrown the way it has.\n  I believe next year is a year to look at the big picture, to fit this \ninto all of the other things we have to do. But I don't believe we \nought to waive a Budget Act which has protected our people, protected \nour veterans, and protected the cost of military equipment because of \ninflation coming down.\n  Those are all great big benefits that we don't quite understand, but \nthey are very important.\n  Again, tonight by insisting that we comply with the Budget Act, you \nare showing me a degree of courage that makes me understand who you \nare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute for a question of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the good chairman is here, I ask a factual question: \nWhat is the estimate as to how much the appropriations bill that we are \nabout to vote on in the next few days will go over the discretionary \nceiling in the budget resolution?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We predict it is $40 billion for 1 year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. I don't. If you say that is the case, I disagree.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I say it is not the case. We have heard the figure. Is it \nclear\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\nthat there will be a point of order that will lie against one of these \nappropriations bills coming up?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For exceeding the caps of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at some point there will be a vote on a \nwaiver of the Budget Act for that purpose--I don't want to estimate the \nnumber of billions because I am not privy to it--but for a significant \namount of money. I want to put that in this context. This is not going \nto be the last time this year that there is going to be a vote on \nwhether to waive the Budget Act because the ceiling is exceeded.\n  I fully agree with Senator Domenici. I couldn't agree more in terms \nof what his comment was about Senator Kerrey's instincts. As always, he \nseems to me honest and open. That is what this point of order is going \nto force. Even though I will vote for waiving the Budget Act--I am \ngoing to vote that way on this point of order--I must say that I think \nit is very important that this point of order be made. It is so \nimportant that if Senator Kerrey had not made it, I was going to make \nit, because I think the Senate has got to understand what we are doing. \nI think we are doing the right thing. But we are not going to be doing \nit quietly in a closed way, which is hidden. We are going to be doing \nit openly or we are not going to do it at all. Maybe there will not be \nenough votes to do it at all.\n\n  But the important point that Senator Kerrey and others are making, it \nseems to me, No. 1, is in their judgment we should not do it. That is \nthe matter of disagreement. But where I think there is agreement is \nwhen we do it and when we consider it, we should not be burying it in \nsome bill that nobody knows about. That is why this point of order is \nvaluable, in my judgment.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  One other point: That the size of this item is a 10-year item. The \nquestion I asked the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, was approximately how much will the appropriations bills for \njust 1 year go above the budget ceiling and discretionary spending. It \nis that figure which perhaps by the end of the evening I can try to get \nan estimate of from the staff of the Appropriations Committee. But it \nwill be a significant amount. We are going to have to vote on it. I \nhope we vote on that explicitly. I hope we vote on that in that final \nappropriations bill just as openly as we are going to vote on this. I \nhope it is not just going to be buried in the final appropriations bill \nand fly through here without a conscious decision on whether or not to \nwaive the Budget Act. Otherwise, there is no fiscal discipline at all. \nIf it is not done openly, there will be even less fiscal discipline.\n  I want my comments to go against my time, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am stunned that we are talking about \nfiscal discipline and asking whether a bill is over the budget when we \nhave a bill before us where we set out funds in the budget knowing that \nthis was a problem that needed to be dealt with. We set out $400 \nmillion in the budget to try to begin to deal with this problem. The \nbill before us creates a brand new program never debated anywhere and \nwhich no Member of this Senate can really explain how it will work. It \nhas never been tested anywhere. It will cost $59.9 billion.\n  Let me quote from Senator Warner's letter and his initial cost \nestimate, which is now out of date because additional benefits were \nadded to this bill. But let me quote from his letter of September 27. \n``The cost of this proposal is scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice at $42.4 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years.'' That has \nnow risen to $59.9 billion. ``In addition, the Treasury would accept a \n$200 billion liability that would be amortized over 70 years.''\n  Not only is this bill a budget buster--it will win the blue ribbon in \nCongress this year. There will be no bill in this Congress that will \napproach this bill in terms of fiscal irresponsibility and lack of \nfinancial discipline. And all of this was done not in a committee, not \nin a public debate, but by a group of conferees who got together in \nclosed sessions. The House entered that conference with a program that \ncost $945 million. The Senate went into the conference with a program \nthat cost $466 million. They came out of conference with a program that \ncost $60 billion, and committed us to a 70-year debt of $200 billion.\n  I believe there is no parallel in the history of appropriations and \nauthorizations in America to the bill before us in terms of a bill \nwhich has never been debated and a program that has never been \ndiscussed.\n  Let me make a couple of points.\n  First of all, it is obvious that all of us here tonight should praise \nour dear colleague, Senator Kerrey, who is retiring. You can get a lot \nof praise around here by dying or retiring. Given the choice between \nthe two, he has chosen the right one.\n  Let me say that many people have congratulated Senator Kerrey for his \nphysical courage. I don't know much about that type of courage. So far \nas I know, nobody has ever shot at me. Nor do I have any reason to \nbelieve I would have been shot at. I don't know much about that kind of \ncourage.\n  But there is a different kind of courage that I know a little bit \nabout. It is a courage that has to do with standing up to peer group \npressure. There is something very human about the fact that somewhere \naround the first or second grade we start caring terribly about what \npeople around us think. It is something we never escape from until they \nlower us in the grave. One would think grown men and women, Members of \nthe Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world, \nwould be immune to it. But as my colleagues know, we are not immune to \nit. We want to be loved. We want to be accepted by our colleagues. You \ndon't get love by opposing this giant expenditure of money. You don't \nget appreciated by your colleagues by standing up to it. Senator Kerrey \nis getting a lot of praise tonight. My guess is when the votes are \ncounted, we may have three votes to sustain this point of order. But I \ndon't know. I wasn't there when Senator Kerrey won the Congressional \nMedal of Honor, but I was there when he stood up in this Congress and \npointed out to America and to this Congress that the largest federal \nentitlement programs tax young working people who are just starting \nout, and give that money to seniors, many of whom have built up \nretirement savings over a lifetime.\n  And it's being done because older people vote and younger people \ndon't vote. We are digging a hole in Medicare and Social Security that \ncan destroy America and that will destroy our prosperity if we don't do \nsomething about it.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has been a leader in that and I want to say \nI appreciate it. I believe America does, but America is not embodied in \nthe way it can speak and, since it hasn't been elected, it couldn't \nspeak on the floor of the Senate anyway. On behalf of working people in \nmy State and my country, I thank you, Bob Kerrey. I'm sorry you are \nretiring. I want to thank you for what you have said and what you have \nstood up for.\n  Now, let me try to put all this in perspective. First of all, I agree \nwith Senator Warner's poster. I hope my colleagues will forgive me \nbecause I want to give a little bit of history to establish my bona \nfides on this issue, if I can.\n  First, my dad was a career soldier. He joined the Army on his 15th \nbirthday in his brother's clothes. He was in the Army for 28 years, 7 \nmonths, and 27 days. He believed when he joined the Army that part of \nwhat the Government had committed to him was that if he served for 20 \nor more years, they were going to take care of him and his family and \ntheir health care needs. I am proud to say--and I say it with certainty \nbecause I know; I was born in the same hospital my dad died in, and it \nwas a military hospital at Ft. Benning, GA--the Government never, ever \ntook that benefit away from my dad.\n  We are here today for two reasons. We are here in part because the \npolicies of our Government changed. They changed in a remarkable way, \nand it is an interesting thing how benefits are lost. They changed \nbecause Medicare was going broke. So our government\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nmade everybody join Medicare, including men and women in the Armed \nServices. This problem came about because people who retired from the \nservice qualified for two medical programs: One, by paying Medicare \ntaxes; and two, by serving 20 or more years. The military health care \nbenefit was a right not to Medigap insurance or any of the things we \nare talking about today, it was a right to go to a military hospital on \na space-available basis and get military medicine.\n  What happened--which was terribly wrong, in my opinion--is that, in \nthe midst of a period of very tight budgets, the military gave retirees \ntheir military health benefit until they turned 65 when they became \nqualified for Medicare. As they got close to their 65th birthday--I \nknow this because I have a brother who is a career soldier. I don't \nknow whether he likes military medicine because they know his name--\n``Colonel.'' He goes to a regular hospital and they call him ``Mister'' \nalthough, obviously, they don't know who he is. They don't know \nanything about him. So I don't know whether it is that or whether he \njust is comfortable with having been a career soldier and having served \nin the Army for some 27 years--the point is, as he gets closer to 65, \nunder the current system he will get a sheet when he goes in, and \nmembers of the staff know this, he will get a referral sheet. And they \nwill say, ``Colonel, you are going to turn 65 in August. So these are \nthe medical areas that we are aware of that are relevant to you, and \nthese are private practitioners in Dallas, Texas, that you can go to \nunder Medicare.''\n  Here is a person who got military medicine on active duty for 27 \nyears, and then he retired and continued to get it up to the day he was \n65, but because he earned two benefits, they shoved him out the door \nwhen he turned 65.\n  My disagreement with Senator Warner is not about that recruiting \nposter. I believe that poster is true. And I believe the benefit is \nowed. Where we split company is on what we are doing here tonight.\n  Let me explain. Just to complete the history, because I felt that I \nhad some personal knowledge about this problem, I was the leader in \nCongress in putting together a test program called Medicare Subvention. \nThe idea was simple. A lot of simple ideas don't work. It is not clear \nhow well this one is working. In some ways, I think it is working well \nalthough costs are up because utilization is up. But the basic idea was \nsimple. Let's pick ten facilities in America that have big retirement \npopulations near them and let people stay in military medicine and let \nMedicare pay what they would pay had they gone to the private sector. \nWe are in the midst of a test of that program right now.\n\n  Earlier this year, while Medicare Subvention was still being tested, \nthis bill came up, and while we were debating military retiree health \ncare, a proposal was made to spend $92 billion. Senator Domenici will \nremember that. That proposal failed. And it should have. I voted \nagainst it.\n  During that debate, Senator Warner offered a 2-year program to build \non the test that we had underway. Senator Warner's program cost $466 \nmillion. I supported it. In fact, I think all the rest of us supported \nit. I am not sure Senator Kerrey did, but I think Senator Domenici \nsupported it.\n  The Senate had put in the budget enough money that to try Senator \nWarner's program out for 2 years. Why was it important to do it in 2 \nyears? I will talk about the money, but let me talk about the policy. \nWhat is wrong with committing to $60 billion worth of new programs that \nhave never been debated, never been tested, and committing to a $200 \nbillion liability over the next 70 years? What is wrong is, as anybody \nwho has ever served in public office knows, once this program is in \nplace, a vested political interest will build up around it in the \nmedical sector, in the retirement sector, and in the communities where \nit is provided. What happens is even if this program doesn't work, even \nif it is terribly inefficient, even if people are unhappy with it, the \nchances of ever getting rid of it or fundamentally changing it are very \nlow.\n  We have in Medicare, as Senator Kerrey, better than anyone else knows \nhaving served on the Medicare Commission, we have a 1965 medical care \nsystem. In Medicare, we have an old Edsel. Yet we can't change it. We \ntried to change it on the Medicare Commission as the Senator remembers. \nBut the vested interest in it, even though it is inefficient, even \nthough it doesn't serve the public well, even though it costs \ntremendous amounts of money, once it is in place, it is hard to change.\n  Here is the point. The first problem with this huge program is that \nwas never debated, never discussed, and was written by a handful of \npeople that, quite frankly, are very intelligent people, very \nknowledgeable people about defense. As far as I am aware, it was never \ndiscussed in the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nMedicare. It was never debated in any public forum. It has never been \ntested anywhere. The point is, tonight on the verge of adjournment, we \nare getting ready to commit $60 billion in spending on a program that \nmay or may not work, may or may not satisfy people, and which is going \nto be virtually irreversible.\n  The second point I want to make is the House went into conference \nwith a program that extended the Medicare Subvention demonstration, \nmade it permanent within 6 years, and costs $945 million. So the Senate \nwent to conference with a temporary program of $466 million to build on \na concept, that basically, we had started in the test; and the other \nHouse of Congress went with a program that made a judgment to move \ntoward full implementation of the test, and it cost $945 million. But \nwhat happened?\n\n  What happened--and Senator Kerrey was making the point, I thought \nvery effectively--they got to conference and suddenly somebody said, \n``The sky's the limit. We have a huge surplus. This is an election \nyear.'' So what happened is one House, with a program for $466 million, \nand the other House, with a program for $945 million, got together and \nsuddenly we have a $60 billion entitlement program. Actually the new \nprogram is $39 billion, but the committee just gratuitously took \nexisting health care programs and said let's just put $21 billion on \nautomatic pilot in a permanent entitlement program so we do not have to \naccount for spending it.\n  That is what happened. Why did it happen? Because the surplus is \nburning a hole in our pocket. This surplus is the greatest danger we \nface in terms of our economic stability--not just now, but 10 or 12 \nyears from now when the baby boomers start to retire. It is not just \nhappening here. I am not just being mean to our dear friends on the \nArmed Services Committee, a committee I had the privilege to serve on \nfor 6 years. It is happening everywhere.\n  We have a railroad retirement proposal that lowers the retirement \nage. We are raising the retirement age in Social Security. Yet, we \nwould lower it in railroad retirement. We have a proposal to give \nAmtrak $10 billion.\n  We have proposals--we are giving back Medicare savings that we have \npreviously adopted at a rate where, in 10 years, we will have given \nback more than we ever had in savings, yet Medicare is going broke \nevery day. What is happening to us? What is happening to us is this \nsurplus is affecting our judgment and we are spending it as fast as we \ncan spend it.\n  Let me sum up. I want to make a point about the economy, one I had \nnot thought of until I was talking to Alan Greenspan today, and I want \nto bring it up because I think it is relevant.\n  What is my position? My position is we do have an obligation to \nmilitary retirees and we have to find a way to fix the health care \nsystem for military retirees. But I think we need to do it so we know \nwhat we are doing, so we know what it costs, so we know it is going to \nbe efficient, and we have to do it after there has been a clear, \neffective, public debate and where we have actually tested the program \nso we know what we are doing.\n  The problem here is this bill is immensely popular, as my colleagues \nknow if any of you have paid any attention to your telephone calls \ntoday, but it is popular because we are spending massive amounts of \nmoney.\n  My point is I do not disagree with Senator Warner. We owe these \nbenefits, and we are going to have to provide a way for our military \nretirees to have quality medical care, which we promised. But the idea \nof doing it by busting the budget by $59.9 billion on a\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\nprogram nobody ever debated, nobody ever tested, nobody has ever seen \nwork, I think is clearly the wrong way to do it.\n  We have a point of order that is going to be raised by Senator \nKerrey. What is the point of order about?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He has already raised it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, he has raised it. What it is about is, in our budget \nwe agreed we were going to spend $400 million to begin to try to fix \nthis problem. The committee with jurisdiction to fix it was not willing \nto abide by that budget, and they came up with a program that did not \ncost $400 million, they came up with a program that cost $59.9 billion \nand committed us to a $200 billion debt to be amortized over 70 years.\n  So Senator Kerrey has raised a point of order saying: This may be \nwonderful, this might actually be the right thing to do someday, but \nthis violates what we voted to do and the constraints we imposed on \nourselves.\n  I do not suffer any delusion. My guess is we are going to get 3 or 4 \nor 5--maybe 10 votes here. We are going to waive this point of order, \nand we are going to spend this $60 billion. We are going to spend it on \na program which was never debated, never tested, never analyzed in any \nsystematic way. My fear is that we are going to have a very difficult \ntime fixing it. I am afraid 10 years from now we may be here debating \nhow we can fix it, but with the vested interests that have built up, it \nwill be very difficult to do.\n  So I believe this point of order should be sustained. I am going to \nvote to sustain it.\n  Why should we care about this spending? I was talking to Chairman \nGreenspan today about the economy and about the stock market. We were \ntalking about spending. I basically had raised the issue with him, was \nhe worried about this runaway spending? He made a point to me that, in \nApril and May, something clearly started happening because long-term \ninterest rates started going up in America. Some people say that is \ncaused by Fed policy. No, the policy of the Fed, as our colleagues \nknow, affects short-term interest rates. But the economy affects long-\nterm interest rates.\n  Let me tell you what was happening in May. What was happening in May \nis it started to become clear we were not going to abide by our budget. \nIt started to become clear we were losing control of spending. These \nlong-term rates went up and the economy started to cool, and that is \nbeing reflected in the stock market today, in my opinion.\n  I am not saying we are going into a recession. But I am saying the \ninterest rates went up on the long-term because we are losing control \nof spending. We are losing fiscal discipline. They went up until the \neconomy slowed down enough that they started to back off.\n  I think we ought to be concerned about spending this surplus. I think \nwe need to make rational decisions about it. It may very well be, after \na debate, we write a budget and we spend $60 billion on this problem. I \ndo not think I would do it this way. I think we need efficiency, I \nthink we need copayments, I think we need incentives for cost \nconsciousness. I don't think I would support doing it this way, but I \nmight support a program that costs this much, more or less.\n  But doing it this way, where two or three people put together this \nproposal, is fundamentally wrong and is dangerous. This is a noble \ncause, and a cause that I support--military retirees were promised a \nbenefit. They weren't promised these kinds of benefits, but they were \npromised access to military medicine. I want them to have it.\n  As bases have closed and as people now do not live near military \nbases, we have to come up with another program. But I think it ought to \nbe a rational program. I think it ought to be one we look at over time. \nSo I am going to vote to sustain this point of order.\n  I think this bill is simply an outward and visible sign of what is \nhappening in our Congress. I wish America could be awakened to it. We \nare on a spending binge that has no precedent in my period of service \nin Congress. You have to go all the way back to Lyndon Johnson to find \nspending at the level we are now talking about in the Congress. At \nfirst it was just discretionary spending. Now we are into entitlements. \nAs we all know, these things start out small. This one didn't start \nsmall, but a lot of them do. But they get bigger and bigger and bigger \nand bigger.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' listening. I think this is an issue such \nthat you have to explain to people what you are trying to do. I think \nit is a very easy issue to say, boy, I am trying to deliver on the \ncommitment in that recruiting poster. I believe in the commitment in \nthe recruiting poster, but you don't deliver on it with a huge program \nthat has never been tested, that was put together by people who do not \nspecialize in this area of government, and where there has never been a \ndebate. I think this is a mistake, and I think we are going to end up \nregretting it.\n  I think we will someday come back and fix it, but we will not fix it, \nin my opinion, until we have spent a lot of money and until we have \nproduced a system that--unless we are extraordinarily lucky--is not \ngoing to provide the kind of efficient care we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I say to the chairman and ranking member, \nI am not going to make any additional arguments on the specifics. I \nwant to make some closing comments. I am prepared to yield back time \nand go to the vote. I don't know where they are, but I will start \ntalking so they understand that is where I am.\n  The Senator from Texas made an effort to establish his bona fides and \ndid a very good job referencing his father, who was a career military \nofficer.\n  In my closing, I need to do a little subtracting in my bona fides. I \nhave received the Medal of Honor, as was mentioned several times. The \nSenator from Texas said he was not there that night and does not know \nwhat happened. When I saw the citation, I didn't know if I was there \nthat night. I didn't receive the Medal of Honor because of my heroism. \nI received it because of many men out there, heroic beyond me, who did \nnot have a witness or had a witness who did not like them or could not \nwrite or something got lost in the food chain, as some of these \nsometimes do. I am a recipient for others, and I do not say that in any \nsense of false modesty at all. I say it sincerely and genuinely.\n  I understand Reserve officers, which I am, and career officers are \nsubstantially different. I praise the chairman and the ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee and all the members of the Armed \nServices Committee, some of whom already spoke, for their efforts to \nmake certain we take care of the men and women who volunteer and say: I \nwill make a life career. I do not want anything I said previously to \nsubtract from the enormous respect and admiration I have for them. \nIndeed, many times I have been moved to tears to see the risks the men \nand women who wear the uniform of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine \nCorps, and Coast Guard take for all of us, and we have a painful \nexample of it today in sailors who are trying to keep an embargo in \nplace on Iraq.\n  We started that embargo many years ago, and we take it for granted. \nAll of a sudden, we have 5 dead, 10 missing, and another 30 or so who \nare injured executing a mission. My guess is many of those people in \nquestion are lifers, as we call them, people who have made a life \ncommitment.\n  I appreciate very much the chairman making an effort. It may be he is \nright, that he has a provision here that ought to be done. I tried to \nargue as to why I think it goes beyond. He is the chairman of this \ncommittee. Senator Levin spent a lot of time on it. I supported them \nalmost every time in the past when they tried to get benefits in line \nwith what we need in order to recruit and retain. I do not want \nanything I said previous to this to be interpreted by anybody either on \nthis floor or out in America that I have any disrespect at all for the \ncommitment that men and women make when they say: I will make a life \ncareer.\n  Again, I will use the observation of the Senator from Texas that you \ncan support this provision and still say at some point you have to say \nno. We all understand that. We are asked to spend the taxpayers' money \non many things, and you need a method by which at some point you say \nno. You can't say yes to everything. There are a lot of things I would \nlike to spend money on, but there is a limit, and you have to figure \nout what that limit is.\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\n  For years we had a Budget Act. For years we had budget caps. The \nSenator from New Mexico is right. It used to be, not that long ago, \nwhen you came down to the floor and there was a motion to waive the \nBudget Act, that was a tough vote. It was tough to waive the Budget \nAct. All of a sudden, it is not anymore. It used to be a mechanism that \nenabled us to have the fiscal discipline.\n  I am proud of many things in which I had the opportunity to \nparticipate. One of them is the opportunity to help get rid of the \nfiscal deficit over the last 12 years. The only way that was possible \nwas for us to have a mechanism by which we could look at a friend, look \nsomebody in the eye who deserves to have more spending, and say: No, I \njust can't do it.\n  At this moment, we are poised to spend far beyond what we intended \nwhen this year started. I hope colleagues will vote against the motion \nto waive the Budget Act and send this bill back to conference and say \nto the House Members: We cannot get it in because we have to say no, \nand we have to reassert the fiscal discipline that got us to where we \nare today.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are all prepared to yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield back my time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the conference report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 contains direct spending \nthat far exceeds the Armed Services Committee's allocation of mandatory \nspending under the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this conference report \nwould increase mandatory spending by over $19 billion over the next 5 \nyears, and by $61 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Most of this increased spending is for the new ``Medigap'' \nentitlement for Medicare-eligible military retirees. This new benefit \nwould add $18.7 billion in new direct spending over the next 5 years, \nand $59.9 billion in new direct spending over the next 10 years. This \nyear's congressional budget resolution established a $400 million \nreserve fund for mandatory spending on military health care benefits \nover the next 5 years; the mandatory spending on health care in this \nconference report would exceed that allowance by $18.3 billion.\n  The net cost to the federal budget is somewhat less, because current, \ndiscretionary spending must be subtracted out. While the net cost to \nthe federal budget--that is, the amount of the projected future \nsurpluses that these health care benefits would consume--is somewhat \nsmaller, it is still a very substantial amount of money. The health \ncare provisions in this conference report, when both the mandatory and \ndiscretionary components are added together and the costs that are \nmoved from one category to another are netted out, would require $14 \nbillion of new spending over the next 5 years and $40 billion of new \nspending over the next 10 years. That is a lot of money.\n  This new spending was not contemplated in this year's congressional \nbudget resolution. When Congress enacted the budget resolution earlier \nthis year, we provided only $400 million for new military health care \nbenefits over the next 5 years. So this conference report contains over \n$13.6 billion over the amount of direct spending on health care that \nwas approved in the budget resolution.\n  I support the new medical benefits provided by this conference \nreport. I support them because I believe that it is incumbent upon the \nCongress to answer the call of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff to address shortcomings in the health care that we provide for \nour military personnel, military retirees, and their families. The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton, told the \nArmed Services Committee earlier this year.\n\n       For years our recruiters have promised health care for life \n     for career members and their families. As we all know, that \n     is not what they receive. . . . Keeping our promise of \n     ensuring quality health care for military retirees is not \n     only the right thing to do, it also is a pragmatic decision \n     because it sends a strong signal signal to all those \n     considering a career in uniform.\n\n  General Shelton went on to point out that we have actual recruiting \nposters that specifically state that military members and their \nfamilies would receive health care for life. That, he said, is \n``basically what we committed to at the time they were recruited to the \narmed forces.''\n  Last year, we enacted pay and retirement reform provisions to send a \nstrong message that we recognize the demands that we place on our men \nand women in uniform, the circumstances in which they must live and \nwork, and the fact that we often pay them less, and expect them to do \nfar more, than employes in the private sector. The health care \nprovisions in this year's bill should send an equally strong message, \nand will hopefully have an equally strong positive impact on military \nrecruitment and retention.\n  I believe that providing these health care benefits is the right \nthing to do, and that we should use the waiver open to us to provide \nthem. At the same time, however, Senator Kerrey has done the right \nthing in raising a point of order relative to these provisions under \nthe Budget Act. We have the responsibility, if we are going to spend \ntens of billions of dollars on a new benefit, to do so openly and in \naccordance with our budget rules. Those rules allow us to exceed the \nspending limits we set for ourselves should we deem it wise and prudent \nto do so.\n\n  We do so by voting to waive the Budget Act. That is our way of \nstanding up openly and acknowledging what we are doing, acknowledging \nthat we are about to use some of our surplus for a benefit that was not \nincluded in the fiscal plan the Congress adopted in April. We owe it to \nourselves and our constituents to be willing to stand up and say either \nwe think this is a good idea worth doing and we should waive the Budget \nAct, or to say we shouldn't be doing this and voting not to waive it.\n  There is one other significant new entitlement in this conference \nreport and that is the compensation program for contract and federal \nemployees of the Department of Energy who became ill due to their \nexposure to radiation, beryllium, or other hazardous materials while \nworking to build our nuclear weapons. While much less expensive than \nthe health care benefit, this compensation program also entails direct \nspending of $1.1 billion over 5 years, and $1.6 billion over 10 years, \nthat was not provided for in the Budget Resolution. As with the health \ncoverage for our military retirees, I think this is the right thing to \ndo, but we have to be willing to waive the Budget Act to do it.\n  Either this bill is wrong, or the congressional budget resolution was \nwrong in the limitations that it placed on Federal spending. In my \nview, the problem is not with this bill, but with the budget resolution \nitself, which was never realistic in the amount of money that it \nprovided for this and other purposes. I believe that the American \npeople would want us to provide improved access to health care and a \ncomprehensive pharmacy benefit for military retirees--and that they \nwould want us to take similar action on behalf of other retirees.\n  Others may disagree, but we cannot have it both ways. We cannot say \nthat we support the strict spending limits in the congressional budget \nresolution and that we also support the new entitlement programs in \nthis conference report, which would violate those spending limits. The \ntwo are inconsistent, and we must make a choice. That is what this vote \nis about.\n  I commend Senator Kerrey for raising a point of order under the \nBudget Act. For the reasons that I have stated, I will vote to waive \nthe point of order and allow this conference report--and the new \nbenefits that it includes--to become law.\n  I again quote from the testimony of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff when he told us earlier this year:\n\n       For years our recruiters promised health care for life for \n     career members and their families. As we all know, that is \n     not what they receive. . . . Keeping our promise of ensuring \n     quality health care for military retirees is not only the \n     right thing to do, it also is a pragmatic decision because it \n     sends a strong signal to all those considering a career in \n     uniform.\n\n  Last year, we increased the retirement benefit to where it previously \nhad\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\nbeen 10 years before when we said it would be 50 percent of your base \npay when you retire, rather than the 40 percent which it had been \nreduced to 15 years ago. We did not make that subject to people's \nearnings. There is no earnings test. That was an entitlement. It was a \nretirement benefit. It was a recruiting aid. It was a retention aid. So \nis this.\n  Most important, it is keeping a commitment which has been made to the \npeople who joined the service. I know very well Senator Kerrey did not \njoin for that purpose. Indeed, many do not join for that purpose. But \nthe expert recruiters and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs tell us this \nis a very important recruiting and retention tool, No. 1. No. 2, it \nkeeps a commitment which has been made, and when the Government makes \nthat commitment, we should keep it. Whether or not the private company \nkeeps it or not, we may not have any control over it. Senator Kerrey \nraised the question of what happens if a private company breaks a \ncommitment. That is very different from when we, the people, make a \ncommitment to our men and women in the military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senator is right. Let's move forward \nand vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, all Senators recognize that we are drawing \nto a conclusion this session of Congress. We have had an excellent \ndebate. I urge Senators to support my motion to waive. Were this to \nfail and the Budget Act is not waived, the entire Defense authorization \nconference report will fail. Conferees will have to be appointed for a \nnew conference. The Senate will appoint conferees and send the bill \nback to the House. The House will appoint conferees and a new \nconference will have to be convened. A new conference report will then \nhave to be passed by both the House and the Senate. We will have \nopportunities next year to readdress this problem.\n  I close by saying, with all due respect to my dear friend from \nNebraska, this is the living proof which says for the rest of your \nlife, if you serve a minimum of 20 years active Federal service, you \nearn your retirement. That is a commitment that has been made by this \nNation since World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and continues to be made \ntoday. Now it is the obligation of the Senate to confirm the \ncredibility of this country and to give to these people what they have \nearned rightly.\n  I yield back my time. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

On this vote, the yeas are 84, the nays are 9. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n\n\n                              Navy HRSC's\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with \nSenator Olympia Snowe of Maine and Senator John Warner of Virginia, two \nof my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Armed Services, to clarify \na provision concerning a U.S. Navy Benefits Center as referenced in \nSenate Report 106-292 which accompanies S. 2549.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Department of the Navy's Human \nResources Service Centers, HRSCs, located in eight geographical \nlocations worldwide, serve as the regional Human Resources Management, \nHRM, processing centers for activities and Human Resources Offices in \nits service area. The HRSCs also provide various centralized HRM \nprograms and services.\n  S. 2549, the Fiscal Year 2001 National Defense Authorization Act, \nauthorizes $3.0 million for a contractor-supported national employee \nbenefits call center located in Cutler, Maine. According to Senate \nReport 106-292, this center is to provide a full range of benefit and \nentitlement information and assistance to civilian employees of the \nDepartment of the Navy. The report notes that the call center would \nreplace eight separate Human Resources Service Centers now in operation \nthroughout the country.\n  Based on conversations with the Department of the Navy, it is my \nunderstanding that these HRSCs are not to be replaced by the new center \nto be established in Cutler, Maine. Instead, the new Navy Benefits \nCenter will complement the services performed by the eight HRSCs.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senate understands these HRSCs are not to be replaced \nby the new benefits center to be established in Cutler, Maine. Instead, \nthe new Navy Benefits Center will complement the services performed by \nthe eight HRSCs. The conferences believe that the new U.S. Navy \nBenefits Center will add a new capability which supplements the \nresources inherent in the existing HRSCs. That is, the new center will \nnot replace the eight existing Navy HRSCs but will enhance efforts to \nprovide information to civilian employees of the Navy.\n  I also want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that there is \nan error in the Conference Report tables. Three million dollars for \nthis initiative should have been authorized to match the appropriations \nprovided in the fiscal year 2001 DoD Appropriations Conference Report. \nI have been in contact with the Chief of Naval Operations this \nafternoon. I have his assurance that the Navy will execute this program \nas we intended.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, for his support of \nthis initiative. I agree with him and my colleague, Senator Santorum, \nand they are correct in their understanding of the intent of this \nauthorization and the benefits center itself.\n  Cutler has a history of admirable and noteworthy support of the U.S. \nNavy. For nearly 40 years, the United States Navy's Computer and \nTelecommunications Station resided in Cutler and set standards for \nexcellence in performing its vital national security mission. The \ncivilian men and women of Cutler who contributed so much to this \nsuccess personify Maine's celebrated work ethic.\n  Now, the residents of Cutler eagerly await the establishment of the \nnew\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\nbenefits center and will once again showcase their loyalty, work ethic \nand stalwart support for the United States Navy.\n\n\n                            specified cancer\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to clarify \nthe definition of ``specified cancer'' as defined by this provision \nwith my colleague from Ohio. When we drafted this definition, we \nintended to cover cancers that were likely to be caused by exposure to \nradiation, isn't that correct?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, we did intend to cover radiogenic cancers. The \ndefinition of specified cancer includes those cancers covered by the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act and Bone cancer. According to the \nmedical text ``Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention'' by Doctors \nSchottenfeld and Fraumeni, cancers of the bone include cancers of the \ncartilage, including radiosensitive cancers that originate in cartilage \nsuch as chondrosarcoma.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would also like to add that both the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Government Affairs \nCommittee have heard testimony from the Department of Energy on worker \nexposure to ionizing radiation at the Portsmouth uranium enrichment \nplant in Portsmouth, Ohio, and we became aware that chondrosarcoma has \nafflicted some in the workforce. The chapter on bone cancer in the \nSchottenfeld and Fraumeni medical text should provide helpful guidance \nas the Administration implements this proposal. I ask for unanimous \nconsent to include a portion of that text for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention\n\n(Edited by David Schottenfeld, M.D., and Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.)\n\n                              Bone Cancer\n\n   (By Robert W. Miller, John D. Boice, Jr., and Rochelle E. Curtis)\n\n       Cancers that arise from bone or cartilage account for about \n     0.5% of all malignant neoplasms in the human. As with other \n     neoplasms, much more research has been devoted to diagnosis \n     and therapy than to causation. This chapter reviews the \n     epidemiologic observations on bone cancer that have provided \n     clues to its origins.\n\n\n                      demographic characteristics\n\n       Descriptive studies in the past have been handicapped by \n     the use of a single code number in the International \n     Classification of Diseases, which groups all cell types of \n     bone cancer. The three main subtypes are osteosarcoma, which \n     arises most often from the growing ends of long bones; \n     chondrosarcoma, which develops in cartilage; and Ewing's \n     sarcoma, which according to recent evidence may arise from \n     primitive nervous tissue (Cavazzana et al, 1987; Ewing's \n     Tumour Workshop, 1990; Horowitz et al, 1993), most commonly \n     in the shafts of the axial skeleton.\n       The cell types should be studied separately, because they \n     have marked demographic differences that are of etiologic \n     significance. Histologic diagnoses are thus required, as from \n     population-based cancer registries. Of particular value in \n     this regard are data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and \n     End-Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute \n     (Percy et al, 1995), which has covered about 10% of the U.S. \n     population since 1973. Ninety-five percent of bone cancers \n     were histologically confirmed. The geographic areas covered \n     and distribution by cell type are shown in Table 44-1.\n       Of the 1961 cases among whites and 163 among blacks \n     registered in the SEER Program from 1973 through 1985, \n     osteosarcoma was reported in 36%, chondrosarcoma in 26%, and \n     Ewing's sarcoma in 16%. Age-adjusted rates by histologic type \n     are presented in Figure 44-1 (charts are not reproducible in \n     the Record.)\n     Age, Sex, and Race-Specific Incidence\n       Osteosarcoma has a bimodal age distribution, with peaks in \n     adolescence and late in life (Fig. 44-2). It is rare early in \n     life, but the rate increases rapidly in late childhood. In \n     1950-1959, before improved therapy increased survival, \n     mortality and incidence rates were similar. There were enough \n     deaths in the United States during this ten-year interval to \n     allow study of the distribution by single year of age (Fig. \n     44-3). At age 13 the rate for males rose higher than that for \n     females, and remained elevated for a longer time, suggesting \n     that bone cancer is related to the adolescent growth spurt. \n     (Price, 1958; Fraumeni, 1967; Glass and Fraumeni, 1970).\n       Chondrosarcoma is rare in childhood and rises with \n     advancing age, for unknown reasons (Young et al, 1990). The \n     age distribution of Ewing's sarcoma resembles that of \n     osetosarcoma early in life, but rarely develops over 35 years \n     of age (Fig. 44-2). Apparently, malignant change of the \n     primitive tissue from which it arises does not occur later in \n     life.\n       There is a male predominance of each major form of bone \n     cancer among whites and blacks (Fig. 44-1). The two races \n     have similar incidence rates for childhood osteosarcoma, but \n     blacks have almost no cases of Ewing's sarcoma, either in the \n     United States (Figs. 44-1 and 44-1) or Africa (Parkin et al, \n     1988). Rates of Ewing's sarcoma are also low among Asians, \n     but less so than in blacks. A possible explanation for these \n     racial differences is that a gene for osteosarcoma is equally \n     mutable among the various races, but that for Ewing's sarcoma \n     resists mutation in blacks and Asians.\n       Table 44-1 shows an absence of chordoma, when about 10 \n     cases were expected if blacks had 12% of the total, as they \n     did for osteosarcoma. Among blacks there is also a rarity of \n     giant cell and blood-vessel tumors. These racial differences \n     have not previously been recognized, and need further \n     investigation.\n\n    TABLE 44-1.--NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BONE CANCER AMONG WHITES AND BLACKS ACCORDING TO HISTOLOGIC TYPE, SEER CANCER REGISTRIES a, 1973-85\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Number of Cases\n                                                             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Histology                                           Whites                                        Blacks\n                                                             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   M            F           Total          M            F          Total     Percent \\3\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOsteosarcoma................................................          379          287          666            51           42           93         12.3\nChondrosarcoma..............................................          295          248          543            18           14           32          5.6\nEwing's sarcoma.............................................          218          121          339             2            3            5          1.5\nChordoma....................................................           55           31           86             0            0            0  ...........\nFibrous histiocytoma b......................................           35           21           56             1            4            5          8.2\nFibrosarcoma................................................           27           26           53             2            5            7         11.7\nSarcoma, NOS................................................           26           19           45             3            1            4          8.2\nGiant cell tumor............................................           22           22           44             0            1            1          2.2\nBlood vessel tumors.........................................           15           19           34             0            1            1          2.9\nOdontogenic tumors b........................................           12           14           26             4            1            5         16.1\nOther types.................................................           11           16           27             2            2            4         12.9\nMalignant neoplasm, NOS.....................................           24           18           42             1            5            6         12.5\n                                                             -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.................................................        1,119          842        1,961            84           79          163        100.0\n                                                             ===========================================================================================\nPercent histologically confirmed............................  ...........  ...........           95   ...........           95  ...........  ...........\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na SEER areas include the states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah and the metropolitan areas of Detroit, Atlanta (1975-1985), Seattle (1974-\n  1985), and San Francisco-Oakland.\nb Includes morphology categories in use since only 1977.\nc For a given subtype, % that were Black; e.g., osteosarcoma = 93/(666+93) 100 =12.3%.\n\n       Table 44-2 summarizes SEER data concerning the distribution \n     of the seven main bone cancers among whites with respect to \n     age, sex, and anatomic site. It shows that osteosarcoma most \n     often arises from long bones of the lower limbs, whereas \n     chondrosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma most often arise from flat \n     bones. Chordoma, presumbly arising from remnants of the \n     embryologic notochord, is a tumor of the flat bones of the \n     trunk and head, and of the lower limbs. The lower limbs are \n     the principal sites for fibrosarcoma, giant cell tumors, and \n     malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which has recently gained \n     attention as a clinical entity, especially as a complication \n     of Paget's disease.\n     Geographic Variation\n       Little geographic variation is seen worldwide in the \n     incidence of bone cancer, all forms combined (Muir et al., \n     1987). Incidence rates that differ by more than 2-fold are \n     rare in the few populations of sufficient size to ensure \n     stable estimates. No clues to etiology are apparent from \n     international comparisons of age-adjusted rates. With few \n     exceptions, rates are higher among males than females, with \n     ranges of 0.8 to 1.6 and 0.6 to 1.2 per 100,000, \n     respectively.\n     Time Trends in Mortality and Incidence\n       Mortality rates for bone cancer, all forms combined, in the \n     United States (Fig. 44-5) and other countries have declined \n     steadily from the 1950s to the mid-1980s, largely \n     attributable to improved diagnosis and treatment (Pickle et \n     al, 1987; Miller and McKay, 1984; Decarli et al, 1987; La \n     Vecchia and\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\n     Decarli, 1988; Ericsson et al, 1978). Using SEER incidence \n     data, Hoover et al (1991) found that between 1973-1980 and \n     1981-1987 there was an unexplained increase in the annual \n     incidence rates of osteosarcoma in males under 20 years of \n     age, from 3.6 to 5.5 cases per million people. Among females \n     the corresponding annual rates were 3.8 and 3.7 cases per \n     million.\n       Figures 44-6 and 44-7 show survival rates for the three \n     main cell types for males and females, respectively (SEER \n     data, 1980-1989, all races combined). Survival was by far the \n     best for chondrosarcoma, and, for all 3 cell types, was \n     substantially better in females than in males.\n\n\n                         environmental factors\n\n     Radiation\n       Ionizing radiation is one of the few environmental agents \n     known to induce certain bone cancers, particularly \n     osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. In 1935, \n     Maryland linked bone cancer to occupational exposure to \n     radium. In subsequent studies (see Table 44-3) an excess risk \n     of bone cancer was found following brief exposure to high-\n     dose radiation therapy (Robinson et al, 1988) and following \n     continuous exposure to internally deposited radionuclides \n     injected to treat bone disease or to provide a contrast \n     medium in diagnostic radiography (Mays, 1988). Investigations \n     of radiogenic bone cancer have enabled researchers to develop \n     an elegant theory of the induction of osteosarcoma (Marshall \n     and Groer, 1977); models in which genetic-environmental \n     interactions can be evaluated (Knudson, 1985); and guidelines \n     for protecting against the effects of internally deposited \n     radionuclides, especially plutonium (Healy, 1975).\n\n\n                       secrecy and worker health\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Chairman and \nRanking Member to engage in a brief colloquy on section 1078 of the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Conference Report regarding secrecy \nand worker health. This originally passed the Senate as an amendment I \nsponsored that was agreed to by all parties. The amendment referred to \nworkers at former nuclear weapons facilities. The provision in the \nconference report was rewritten, and now defines these workers to be \n``employees and former employees of the Department of Defense'' at \ndefense nuclear weapons facilities. However, at least one such \nfacility, the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, is owned by the Defense \nDepartment but operated by a contractor. Thus virtually all employees \nat the facility were and are employees of the contractor and not \ndirectly of the Department of Defense. Is it the understanding of my \ncolleagues that this provision is intended to refer to all employees at \nsuch facilities, including those employed directly by the Department of \nDefense and indirectly through contractors?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, you are correct. As indicated in the report language, \nthe conferees are concerned about all employees affected by the defense \nDepartment policies, and we intended this provision to cover all \naffected employees at the Iowa facility and similar facilities. We will \njoin with you to make sure the Defense Department implements this \nprovision according to these intentions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with Senator Harkin and the distinguished ranking \nmember, and I too am committed to ensuring the Defense Department \nimplements this provision to protect all workers including those of \ncontractors.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have strong reservations about the \nfiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Conference Report that is before \nthe Senate today. The concerns I have are the same that led me to vote \nagainst the Defense Authorization bill when it was before the Senate \nearlier this year.\n  This conference report would increase Defense spending by more than \n$20 billion over last year's authorized level. It is $4.6 billion over \nthe President's request. I am particularly troubled that most of this \n$4.6 billion increase is for weapons systems that were not requested by \nthe Department of Defense.\n  While I support many provisions of this bill, including a 3.7 percent \npay raise for military personnel and additional pay for troops on food \nstamps, I strongly believe that military spending is increasing at a \nrate beyond what is necessary to meet our security needs.\n  Today, however, our military has been attacked--presumably by those \nwho believe that acts of terrorism might somehow deter the United \nStates from defending our interests of promoting peace and security \nthroughout the world.\n  At this time, it is important to vote for this bill to send a signal \nto the rest of the world that America stands united in the face of such \nthreats and supports the men and women who so bravely serve this \nNation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report \nfor the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 \nincludes a program that I championed in the Senate during its \nconsideration of this bill, along with Senator Thompson and others. \nThis program addresses occupational illnesses scientifically found to \nbe associated with the DOE weapons complex, that have occurred and are \nnow occurring because of activities during the Cold War.\n  This new program was a joint effort of a bipartisan group of Senators \nand House Members. I would like to knowledge the hard work by my staff \nand by the staff for Senator Fred Thompson, Senator George Voinovich, \nSenator Mike DeWine, Senator Mitch McConnell, and Senator Ted Kennedy. \nWe worked with the Administration, with worker groups, with \nmanufacturers, and with staff from the House of Representatives.\n  The workers in the DOE nuclear weapons complex, both at the \nproduction plants and the laboratories, helped us win the Cold War. But \nthat effort left a tragic environmental and human legacy. We are \nspending billions of dollars each year on the environmental part--\ncleaning up the physical infrastructure that was contaminated. But we \nalso need to focus on the human legacy.\n  This program is an attempt to put right a situation that should not \nhave occurred. But it proposes to do so in a way that is based on sound \nscience.\n  The amendment focuses federal help on three classes of injured \nworkers.\n  The first group is workers who were involved with beryllium. \nBeryllium is a non-radioactive metal that provokes, in some people, a \nhighly allergic lung reaction. The lungs become scarred, and no longer \nfunction.\n  The second group is workers who dug the tunnels for underground \nnuclear tests and are today suffering from chronic silicosis due to \ntheir occupational exposures to silica, which were not adequately \ncontrolled by DOE.\n  The third group of workers are those who had dangerous doses of \nradiation on the job.\n  Along with the workers who are covered by the compensation program \nbeing created by this legislation, we are reaching back to the uranium \nminers and millers who were compensated under the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act, or RECA, and providing them with a similar benefit of \na total of $150,000 and ongoing medical care. I think that this is only \na matter of simple justice, and I strongly supported its inclusion in \nthe current legislation. Early in this Congress, I introduced \nlegislation that would have provided $200,000 in compensation for the \nuranium miners and millers--the same financial payment that was \ninitially proposed for the DOE workers in this legislation. I am glad \nthat the final result is a better deal for the persons being \ncompensated under RECA, as well as the persons being compensated under \nthis new program.\n  For the workers who were employed at numerous current and former DOE \nfacilities, we have included a general definition of DOE and other type \nof facilities in the legislation, in lieu of including a list that \nmight be incomplete. For purposes of helping in the implementation of \nthis legislation, I would like to ask unanimous consent that a non-\nexclusive list of the DOE-related facilities intended to be covered \nunder this amendment be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  For beryllium workers, there are tests today that can detect the \nfirst signs of trouble, called beryllium sensitivity, and also the \nactual impairment, called chronic beryllium disease. If you have \nberyllium sensitivity, you are at a higher risk for developing chronic \nberyllium disease. You need annual check-ups with tests that are \nexpensive. If you develop chronic beryllium disease, you might be \ndisabled or die.\n  This amendment sets up a federal worker's compensation program to \nprovide medical benefits to workers who acquired beryllium sensitivity \nas a result of their work for DOE. It provides both medical benefits \nand a lump-sum payment of $150,000 for workers who suffer disability or \ndeath from chronic beryllium disease.\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\n  For radiation, the situation is more complex. Radiation is proven to \ncause cancer in high doses. But when you look at a cancer tumor, you \ncan't tell for sure whether it was caused by an alpha particle of \nradiation from the workplace, a molecule of a carcinogen in something \nyou ate, or even a stray cosmic ray from outer space. But scientists \ncan make a good estimate of the types of radiation doses that make it \nmore likely than not that your cancer was caused by a workplace \nexposure.\n  The original legislative proposal passed by the Senate put the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, in charge of making the \ncausal connection between specific workplace exposures to radiation and \ncancer. Within the HHS, it was envisioned that the National Institute \nfor Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, take the lead for the \ntasks assigned by this legislation. This assignment followed a decision \nmade in DOE during the Bush Administration, and ratified by the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, to give NIOSH \nthe lead in identifying levels of exposure at DOE sites that present \nemployees with significant health risks. While in the final legislative \ntext, the President was assigned these responsibilities, I think it is \nclearly the intent of the Senate proponents that he delegate these \nauthorities as laid out in the original Senate amendment.\n  HHS was also given a Congressional mandate, in the Orphan Drug Act, \nto develop and publish radioepidemiological tables that estimate ``the \nlikelihood that persons who have or have had any of the radiation \nrelated cancers and who have received specific doses prior to the onset \nof such disease developed cancer as a result of those doses.'' I would \nlike to ask unanimous consent that a more detailed discussion of how \nthe Senate proponents envision these guidelines being used be included \nas an exhibit at the end of my remarks.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Under guidelines that would be developed and used under this \nlegislation, if your radiation dose was high enough to make it at least \nas likely as not that your cancer was DOE-work-related, you would be \neligible for compensation for lost wages and medical benefits.\n\n  The HHS-based method will work for the many of the workers at DOE \nsites. But it won't work for a significant minority who were exposed to \nradiation, but for whom it would be infeasible to reconstruct their \ndose.\n  There are several reasons why reconstructing a dose might be this \ninfeasibility might exist. First, relevant records of dose may be \nlacking, or might not exist altogether. Second, there might be a way to \nreconstruct the dose, but it would be prohibitively expensive to do so. \nFinally, it might take so long to reconstruct a dose for a group of \nworkers that they will all be dead before we have an answer that can be \nused to determine their eligibility.\n  One of the workers who testified at my Los Alamos hearing might be an \nexample of a worker who could fall into the cracks of a system that \noperated solely on dose histories. He was a supervisor at what was \ncalled the ``hot dump'' at Los Alamos. All sorts of radioactive \nmaterials were taken there to be disposed of. It is hard to reconstruct \nwho handled what. And digging up the dump to see what was there would \nnot only be very expensive, it would expose new workers to radiation \nrisks that could be large.\n  There are a few groups of workers that we know, today, belong in this \ncategory. They are specifically mentioned in the definition of Special \nExposure Cohort. For other workers to be placed in this special \ncategory, the decision that it was infeasible to reconstruct their dose \nwould have to be made both by the President (or his designee) and by an \nindependent external advisory committee of radiation, health, and \nworkplace safety experts. We allow groups of workers to petition to be \nconsidered by the advisory committee for inclusion in this group. Once \na group of workers was placed in the category, it would be eligible for \ncompensation for a fixed list of radiation-related cancers.\n  The program in this amendment provides for a lump-sum payment, \ncombined with ongoing medical coverage under language identical to that \nused to provide medical coverage under the Federal Employee's \nCompensation Act, or FECA, in section 8103 of title 5, United States \nCode. Since Congress has consciously mirrored FECA for one important \npart of this new program, I hope that the Administration, in \nimplementing our legislation, looks to FECA as a precedent for \nestablishing other parameters for this program.\n  The legislation before us also invites the Administration to submit \nfurther legislative proposals to help implement this new program. In my \nview, it was not a good policy call for Congress to enact this program \nwithout more direction on the details of how it should operate, as was \nthe case in the original legislative proposal passed by the Senate. I \nbelieve that the flexibility that the Congress has provided to the \nExecutive Branch should be used to the fullest extent by the President \nto put the necessary implementing framework in place by Executive \nOrder. If there are changes needed to the law that we have passed, they \nshould be sent up by the President forthwith. But I do not have much \nconfidence that Congress will be able to enact additional legislation \non this program before the deadline date of July 31, 2001.\n  We have a duty to take care of sick workers from the nuclear weapons \ncomplex today. It is a doable task, and a good use of our national \nwealth at a time of budget surpluses. I congratulate my colleagues on \nhaving achieved a successful result from our initial bipartisan \namendment.\n\nExhibit 1.--Examples of DOE and Atomic Weapons Employer Facilities That \n       Would Be Included Under the Definitions in This Amendment\n\n                 (Not an Exclusive List of Facilities)\n\n       Atomic Weapons Employer Facility: The following facilities \n     that provided uranium conversion or manufacturing services \n     would be among those included under the definition in section \n     3503(a)(4):\n       Allied Signal Uranium Hexafluoride Facility, Metropolis, \n     Illinois.\n       Linde Air Products facilities, Tonowanda, New York.\n       Mallinckrodt Chemical Company facilities, St. Louis, \n     Missouri.\n       Nuclear Fuels Services facilities, Erwin, Tennessee.\n       Reactive Metals facilities, Ashtabula, Ohio.\n       Department of Energy Facility: The following facilities \n     (including any predecessor or successor facilities to such \n     facilities) would be among those included under the \n     definition in section 3503(a)(15):.\n       Amchitka Island Test Site, Amchitka, Alaska.\n       Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho and Illinois.\n       Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York.\n       Chupadera Mesa, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.\n       Fermi Nuclear Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois.\n       Fernald Feed Materials Production Center, Fernald, Ohio.\n       Hanford Works, Richland, Washington.\n       Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho.\n       Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, Burlington, Iowa.\n       Kansas City Plant, Kansas City, Missouri.\n       Latty Avenue Properties, Hazelwood, Missouri.\n       Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, \n     California.\n       Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, \n     California.\n       Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, \n     including related sites such as Acid/Pueblo Canyons and Bayo \n     Canyon.\n       Marshall Islands Nuclear Test Sites, but only for period \n     after December 31, 1958.\n       Maywood Site, Maywood, New Jersey.\n       Middlesex Sampling Plant, Middlesex, New Jersey.\n       Mound Facility, Miamisburg, Ohio.\n       Niagara Falls Storage Site, Lewiston, New York.\n       Nevada Test Site, Mercury, Nevada.\n       Oak Ridge Facility, Tennessee, including the K-25 Plant, \n     the Y-12 Plant, and the X-10 Plant.\n       Paducah Plant, Paducah, Kentucky.\n       Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Texas.\n       Pinellas Plant, St. Petersburg, Florida.\n       Portsmouth Plant, Piketon, Ohio.\n       Rocky Flats Plant, Golden, Colorado.\n       Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico.\n       Santa Susanna Facilities, Santa Susanna, California.\n       Savannah River Site, South Carolina.\n       Waste Isolation Pilot Project, Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n       Weldon Spring Plant, Weldon Spring, Missouri.\n\n     Exhibit 2.--Determining ``Causation'' for Radiation and Cancer\n\n       Different cancers have different relative sensitivities to \n     radiation.\n       In 1988, the White Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     endorsed the use by the Veterans Administration of the \n     concept of ``probability of causation'' (PC) in adjudicating \n     claims of injury due to exposure to\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n     ionizing radiation. Given that a radiogenic cancer cannot be \n     differentiated from a ``spontaneously'' occurring one or one \n     caused by other dietary, environmental and/or life-style \n     factors, the PC--that is, the ``likelihood'' that a diagnosed \n     cancer has been ``caused'' by a given radiation exposure or \n     dose--has to be determined indirectly.\n       To this end, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was \n     tasked to develop radioepidemiology tables. These tables, \n     which are currently being updated by the NIH, include data on \n     35 cancers compared to the 13 cancers in the original tables \n     from 1985. These tables account for the fact that different \n     cancers have different relative sensitivities to ionizing \n     radiation.\n       The determination of a PC takes into account the radiation \n     dose and dose rate, the types of radiation exposure \n     (external, internal), age at exposure, sex, duration of \n     exposure, and (for lung cancer only) smoking history. Because \n     a calculated PC is subject to a variety of statistical and \n     methodological uncertainties, a ``confidence interval'' \n     around the PC is also determined.\n       Thus, a PC is calculated as a single, ``point estimate'' \n     along with a 99% confidence interval which bounds the \n     uncertainty associated with that estimate. If you have 99% \n     certainty that the upper bound of a PC is greater than or \n     equal to 0.5 (i.e., a 50% likelihood of causality), then the \n     cancer is considered at least as likely as not to have been \n     caused by the radiation dose used to calculate the PC.\n       For example, for a given worker with a particular cancer \n     and radiation exposure history, the PC may by 0.38 with 99% \n     confidence interval of 0.21 to 0.55. This means that it is \n     38% likely that this worker's cancer was caused by this \n     radiation dose, and we can say with 99% confidence that this \n     estimate is between 21% and 55%. Since the upper bound, 55% \n     is greater than 50%, this person's cancer would be considered \n     to be at least as likely as not to have been caused by \n     exposure to radiation, and the person would be eligible for \n     benefits under the proposed program.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee I worked hard this year, along with Senator Max Cleland, \nour ranking member, to develop a defense authorization bill that is \nresponsive to the manpower readiness needs of the military services; \nsupports numerous quality of life improvements for our service men and \nwomen, their families and the retiree community; and addresses in a \ncomprehensive manner, the health care needs of military retirees.\n  The subcommittee focused on the challenges of recruiting and \nretention during each of our hearings this year, including the health \ncare hearing. The important legislation contained in this bill will \nhave a positive impact on both recruiting and retention as those who \nmight serve and those who are serving see our commitment to provide the \nhealth care benefits promised to those who serve a full military \ncareer. I am proud of this bill and I believe the initiatives it \ncontains will result in improved recruiting and retention within the \nmilitary services.\n  The most vigorously pursued and most prized provisions in our bill \nwill extend TRICARE, the military health care system, to all military \nretirees without regard to their age. We have eliminated the statutory \nlanguage that kicked military retirees out of the military medical \nsystem when they became eligible for Medicare--just at the time of \ntheir lives when these retirees need medical help the most and can \nafford it the least.\n  We were fortunate during conference to be able to include a permanent \nfunding mechanism for the retiree health care benefit. This funding \nmechanism will ensure that the important health care benefit will be \nfinanced in perpetuity rather than being subject to annual budget \nexigencies. I am delighted that we have stepped up to fulfill the \ncommitment to those who served our nation over a full career.\n  Of course, health care is not the only issue on which the Personnel \nSubcommittee focused this year. In the area of military personnel \npolicy, there are a number of recommendations intended to support \nrecruiting, retention and personnel management of the services.\n  Among the most noteworthy, is a provision that would, effective July \n1, 2002, require high schools to provide military recruiters the same \naccess to a high school campus, student lists and directory information \nas is provided to colleges, universities and private sector employers, \nunless the governing body--school board--decides by majority vote to \ndeny military recruiters access to the high school.\n  When I asked military recruiters what I could do to assist them in \nmeeting the challenges they face recruiting the best young men and \nwomen in America, they asked me to help them get access to high schools \non the same basis as the colleges and universities.\n  Other initiatives to support recruiting are: a pilot program in which \nthe Army could use motor sports to promote recruiting; implement a \nprogram of recruiting in conjunction with vocational schools and \ncommunity colleges; and a pilot program using contract personnel to \nsupplement active recruiters.\n  This conference report authorizes the expansion of Junior ROTC \nprograms. We have added $13.5 million to expand the JROTC programs. \nWhen combined with the funds in the budget request, this add will \nmaximize the services' ability to expand JROTC during fiscal year \n20001. I am proud to be able to support these important programs that \nteach responsibility, leadership, ethics and assist in military \nrecruiting.\n  In military compensation, our major recommendations include a 3.7 \npercent pay raise for military personnel and a revision of the Basic \nAllowance for Housing to permit the Secretary of Defense to pay 100 \npercent of the average local housing costs and to ensure that housing \nallowance rates are not reduced while permitting increases as local \nhousing costs dictate.\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Defense to implement the Thrift \nSavings Plan for active and reserve forces not later than 180 days \nafter enactment. The Thrift Savings Plan will be a very positive \nrecruiting and retention tool assisting the military services in \nattracting high-qualified personnel and encouraging them to remain \nuntil retirement.\n  We included a provision that will dramatically reduce the number of \nmilitary personnel eligible to receive food stamps. Under this \nprovision, military personnel determined by the Secretary of Defense to \nbe eligible for food stamps would receive an additional special pay \nsufficient to raise their income level to where they would no longer \nneed food stamps. This special pay will reduce the number of military \npersonnel eligible to receive food stamps from the current DOD estimate \nof about 5,000 to less than 2,000. No United States military personnel \nshould be forced to use food stamps to feed his or her family. When you \ncombine the food stamp assistance in this bill with the increased pay \nraises we have directed over the next 5 years, we should practically \neliminate the need for any service member to seek assistance from food \nstamps.\n  We also modified the basic pay tables for non-commissioned officers \neffective July 1, 20001 to give these deserving leaders a well deserved \npay raise. When we adjusted the basic pay tables for all military \npersonnel last year, we discovered that the non-commissioned officers--\nthe key element in our military units--did not receive an equitable pay \nraise with the officers. We were able to correct that situation this \nyear.\n  Other health care provisions include: the elimination of co-payments \nfor those active duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime; an \ninitiative that would provide recipients of the Medal of Honor, and \ntheir families, life-time military health care; and a provision that \nwould direct the Secretary of Defense to implement a patient care \nreporting and management system to reduce medical errors.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of this bill. It will provide the resources \nand authority the military services need to maximize their readiness \nand to improve the quality of life for active and retired military \npersonnel and their families.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the \nhardworking staff members of the Personnel Subcommittee: Charlie Abell, \nPatti Lewis, and Michele Traficante. I am proud of the work they have \ndone this year, and every man and women who wears our nation's uniform, \nand every military retiree, is better off today because of their \nefforts. I thank you.\n  I will vote for the bill and I urge my colleagues to support the bill \nas well.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will once again oppose the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, as I have done each year I have been a \nMember of this body.\n  As I stated earlier this year when the Senate passed the fiscal year \n2001 Department of Defense appropriations bill, my opposition to this \nconference\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\nreport should not be interpreted as a lack of support for our men and \nwomen in uniform. Rather, what I cannot support is the cold war \nmentality that continues to permeate the United States defense \nestablishment.\n  I strongly support our Armed Forces and the excellent work they are \ndoing to combat the new threats of the 21st century and beyond. \nHowever, I am concerned that we are not giving our forces the tools \nthey need to combat these emerging threats. Instead, this conference \nreport, like the corresponding defense appropriations bill that has \nalready been enacted, clings to the strategies and weapons that we used \nto fight--and win--the cold war.\n  The cold war is over. It is past time that we undertake a \ncomprehensive review of the threats currently facing the United States \nand formulate a strategy on how best to combat them before we continue \nto commit billions of dollars to programs that were created to fight an \nenemy that no longer exists.\n  As we reexamine our defense priorities, we should assess the changing \nroles and missions of both our active duty and our reserve components. \nThe National Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, \nwith recent and ongoing missions in places including Iraq and the \nBalkans. According to statements by Department of Defense officials, \nGuardsmen and Reservists will continue to play an increasingly \nimportant role in our national defense strategy as they are called upon \nto shoulder more of the burden of military operations both at home and \nabroad. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they \nneed to carry out their duties.\n  One crucial part of that support is providing adequate compensation \nto these dedicated men and women. I am pleased that this conference \nreport includes a modified version of an amendment I offered during \nSenate consideration of this bill which authorizes special duty \nassignment pay for members of the National Guard and Reserve not on \nactive duty. This provision will provide a measure of pay equity to \nNational Guard and Reserve personnel by making them eligible for \nspecial duty assignment pay for special duties performed during drill \nperiods.\n  The men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are \ncornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure, and \nthey deserve to be adequately and equitably compensated for their \ndedicated service to this country. This provision is a step in that \ndirection. I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee \non Armed Services for their cooperation and support on this important \nissue.\n  On another matter, I am also delighted that this bill permanently \nextends the authority of the General Services Administration, GSA, to \nconvey surplus property to local governments for law enforcement \npurposes. This provision builds on an amendment I offered when this \nmeasure was before the Senate, and I am pleased that the conferees have \nretained the language and expanded its scope. This section will help a \nnumber of communities across the country seeking to use surplus \nproperty to protect their citizens and provide safe, secure facilities \nfor their police departments. Without this amendment, the authority to \nconvey surplus property for law enforcement purposes would have expired \nthis year. Communities that want to use the GSA process, and have \ncounted upon doing so, to negotiate the use of property for law \nenforcement purposes at a reduced cost would have been shut out.\n  In fact, I have just such a situation in my own home State. The city \nof Kewaunee, WI wants to acquire the city's Army Reserve Center, which \nis a former Federal armory building. The city intends to use the \nproperty as a municipal building in which they would house their police \nforce and other municipal offices.\n  Congress has specified a number of public purpose uses for which \nproperty can be transferred to local governments at a reduced cost. The \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act, FPASA, allows \nproperty to be transferred to public agencies and institutions at \ndiscounts of up to 100 percent of fair market value for a number of \npurposes: public health or educational uses, public parks or \nrecreational areas, historic monuments, homeless assistance, \ncorrectional institutions, port facilities, public airports, wildlife \nconservation, and self-help housing. This type of transfer is called a \npublic interest conveyance.\n  I strongly believe that law enforcement is an important public \npurpose for which surplus property should be used. Moreover, in \nfairness to local communities with tight budgets, Congress today is \nacting to permanently preserve this option for communities that are \ncounting on being able to use this authority.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the bill's managers, the Senior Senator \nfrom Virginia [Mr. Warner] and the Senior Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nLevin], as well as the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for \nassisting me in ensuring this provision becomes law.\n  In closing, I reiterate my concern about the excessive spending \ncontained in this conference report, including millions in taxpayers' \ndollars for planes, ships, and other equipment that the President did \nnot request.\n  We should reexamine our defense priorities, and we should do it as \nsoon as possible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nDefense Authorization conference report and to thank the Chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and the Ranking Member, \nSenator Levin, for their assistance in ensuring that the conference \nreport includes a provision to provide compensation to Department of \nEnergy nuclear weapons workers whose health was harmed in the course of \ntheir service to our country.\n  Back in June, when the Senate first considered this measure, I \noffered an amendment along with Senator Bingaman, Senator Voinovich, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator DeWine and others to establish an occupational \nillness compensation program for these DOE workers who helped us win \nthe Cold War. We offered the amendment after my Committee and others \nheard testimony and reviewed evidence that showed that, for decades, \nthe federal government--and specifically the Department of Energy--\nfailed to adequately protect its workers or to properly inform them of \nhazards associated with the important work they were performing.\n  In some cases, we simply did not know then what we know now about the \nlinks between some of the materials used to make weapons and certain \nillnesses. But in some cases, the government did know--and yet it \ncovered up and kept people in the dark and failed to adequately protect \nthem. We cannot go back and right that wrong. I wish we could. But we \ncan face up to the mistakes that were made and begin to try to remedy \nthem. That is what the Senate is about to do today.\n  This conference report will establish a compensation program for \nDepartment of Energy and contractor employees who were exposed to \nberyllium, silica, or radiation in the course of their employment, and \nwho are now suffering from illnesses that can be linked to those \nexposures. The program will employ eligibility criteria based on expert \njudgement and sound science.\n  Under the compromise that was reached with the House, the President \nwill be required to send to Congress by March 15th of next year a \nspecific proposal detailing the level of compensation and benefits he \nbelieves should be paid. Congress will then have until July 31st to \nenact specific compensation levels. However, if Congress does not act \nby July 31st, a default benefit level of $150,000 plus medical benefits \nwill take effect. Therefore, covered employees are guaranteed to \nreceive at least that amount unless Congress enacts legislation stating \notherwise by next July.\n  I believe this is a good compromise, Mr. President. It is not \neverything that the Senate sponsors wanted, but it is a start. It will \nget a program in place, allow the Administration to begin to identify \nthose who are eligible, and guarantee a minimum benefit level without \nfurther action by Congress. Those are important victories for these \nCold War veterans to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. Today we \nacknowledge that debt of gratitude, as well as a responsibility to \nremedy mistakes we made.\n  So again I want to thank Chairman Warner for his support of this \nimportant provision. It would not have been\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nincluded without his efforts. I also want to thank Senators Bingaman, \nVoinovich, Kennedy, DeWine, McConnell, and Bunning for working with me \non this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference \nreport.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the fiscal \nyear 2001 National Defense Authorization Conference Report which we are \nconsidering today. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I enthusiastically endorse \nthis legislation, and further would like to particularly note its name \nas the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 2001 in recognition of the chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee's long and distinguished service.\n  I also want to acknowledge the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator \nJohn Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the \nsuperb leadership he has provided in support of the committee in the \ncontext of the entire authorization bill, and our ranking member, \nSenator Carl Levin, for all his work on this conference report and for \nhis contribution to the committee and its deliberations.\n  The Seapower Subcommittee addressed significant issues this year and \nwe did so with the bipartisan support of the members of our \nsubcommittee. I want to thank Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of \nthe Seapower subcommittee, and the other subcommittee members, Senators \nJohn McCain, Bob Smith, Jeff Sessions, Chuck Robb, and Jack Reed, for \ntheir contributions and their bipartisan support of not only this \nlegislation but also of the work by the subcommittee throughout this \nyear.\n  This conference report takes great strides toward modernizing our \narmed services, meeting their operational and maintenance funding \nrequirements, and improving the quality of service for our dedicated \nand valuable men and women of the military.\n  Because we recognize that the service members are our most valuable \nasset, this bill makes a solid investment in substantive healthcare \nprovisions which will improve the coverage and quality of healthcare \nfor our active duty military members, retirees, and their family \nmembers.\n  Significantly, this legislation initiates a permanent program to \nprovide ``healthcare for life'' to our military retirees age 65 and \nolder by supplementing Medicare with TRICARE, the military's healthcare \nprogram. It also includes a provision, originally the Kennedy-Snowe \namendment, which complements the ``healthcare for life'' legislation by \nexpanding prescription drug coverage for all our retirees--to provide a \ncomprehensive healthcare benefits program that our military retirees so \nrichly deserve.\n  This conference report also reflects the Seapower Subcommittee's hard \nlook at Navy and Marine Corps operations and the equipment our men and \nwomen require to carry out those operations. And, Mr. President, what \nwe have found in testimony from our operational commander is that our \nNavy and Marine Corps continues to be the nation's 9-1-1 force. Our \nsailors and marines are forward deployed, carrying out the national \nmilitary strategy, and they continue to function at a high level of \noperations.\n  In fact, between 1980 and 1989, the Navy/Marine Corps team alone \nresponded to 58 contingency missions. However, between 1990 and 1999 \nthat number had increased to 192 contingency missions--a remarkable \nthreefold increase in operations! What makes this figure even more \nastounding is that this increase in missions occurred while the number \nof ships was reduced from 500 in 1980 to the current fleet of 316 \nships.\n  The subcommittee recognizes the critical and unique role that the \nNavy and Marine Corps team filled in pursuing the national military \nstrategy, and worked to create a bill that would support these diverse \nmissions. To that end, I am pleased that this conference report \nauthorizes an increase of $749 million to the Seapower Subcommittee \nprocurement programs--on top of the President's budget request of $21.6 \nbillion.\n  Furthermore, this conference agreement includes all of the original \nSeapower Subcommittee legislative provisions I referenced during my \nJune discussion of these issues on the floor of the Senate, as well as \nseveral positive additions which will enhance both our national \nsecurity and the readiness of our naval forces.\n\n  I want to highlight several capabilities and programs that we \naddressed after receiving testimony from the service chiefs and \noperational commanders and after visiting and talking with our service \nmen and women.\n  The Seapower conference report aggressively addresses the future of \nour nation's Navy and the importance of recapitalization of our fleet \nby authorizing the construction of eight new ships. This includes $4 \nbillion for a Nimitz class aircraft carrier; $2.7 billion for three \nDDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers--the most advanced surface \ncombatant in the world; $1.5 billion for two LPD-17 San Antonio class \namphibious ships which will begin to reduce lifecycle costs in our \namphibious fleet; $339 million for one ADC(X) auxiliary supply ship; \nand $1.2 billion for one Virginia class attack submarine\n  It also authorizes the President's request of $357 million for the \nadvance procurement of seven DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers, \n$508 million for SSN-774 Virginia class attack submarines, and $22 \nmillion for one CVN(X) nuclear powered aircraft carrier.\n  The subcommittee recognized this need to modernize the fleet and, as \na result, invested in future ship research and development as the seed \ncorn of the future Navy by approving the budget request of $38 million \nfor CVN-77--the last aircraft carrier of the Nimitz class; $274 million \nfor CVN(X); $207 million for the SSN-774 Virginia class attack \nsubmarines; and $535 million for the revolutionary DD-21 land attack \ndestroyer.\n  This conference report also approves the President's request for $1.1 \nbillion for the procurement of sixteen MV-22 Osprey Marine Corps tilt-\nrotor aircraft, $2.2 billion to procure twelve C-17 aircraft, and \n$176.4 million for contained research, development, test, and \nevaluation of the C-17 strategic airlift program.\n  I am pleased that $560 million of the total procurement authorization \nincrease is for new ship construction and will assist the Navy in \nachieving potential savings of over $1 billion. This increase includes \n$460 million for advanced procurement of the LHD-8 amphibious assault \nship and an increase of $100 million for advance procurement of DDC-51 \nArleigh Burke class destroyers.\n  For the Navy and Marine Corps aviation communities the conference \nreport authorizes an increase of $52.4 million to re-manufacture two \nadditional SH-60 helicopters and a $41.8 million increase to procure \ntwo additional CH-60 Navy helicopters, an increase of $22 million for \nadditional P-3 Anti-Surface Warfare Improvement Program Kits, and an \nincrease of $17 million for modifications and night operations upgrades \nto the Marine Corps UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters.\n  The conference agreement authorizes a $179.5 million increase to the \nPresident's budget request of $4.5 billion for the research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force \nprograms under the jurisdiction of the Seapower Subcommittee to include \na $12.5 million increase for an additional Advanced Amphibious Assault \nVehicle prototype, a $20 million increase to develop advanced shipboard \nsimulators for Marines embarked on amphibious ships, a $15 million \nincrease for a multi-purpose acoustic processor for anti-submarine \nwarfare, a $10 million increase for development of command and decision \nsoftware to be used throughout the surface Navy to improve \ncommunication among commanders, and an $8.4 million increase for the \ndevelopment of a defense system to protect our surface ships from \ntorpedoes.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these increases were \nauthorized by the Seapower Subcommittee to begin to provide much needed \nrelief to the operational commanders who testified that they were being \n``stretched too thin.'' This added funding supports critical programs \nthat will provide commanders with the equipment and the modernized \nsystems they require to successfully and safely accomplish their \nmission.\n  I say to my colleagues, this entire defense bill takes a positive \nstep toward\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\nmodernizing our armed services, meeting their operational and \nmaintenance funding requirements, and improving the quality of service \nfor our committed men and women of the military. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of passage of the final version of the FY 2001 \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \nfor H.R. 4205, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001.\n  The conference report contains a provision on an issue that I have \nbeen working on--the concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA \ndisability compensation.\n  A law enacted in 1891 requires a disabled career military veteran to \nwaive the amount of his retired pay equal to his VA disability \ncompensation. Military retirees are the only group of federal retirees \nwho must waive retirement pay in order to receive VA disability \ncompensation. If a veteran refuses to give up his retired pay, he will \nlose his VA disability benefits. Our government is effectively \nrequiring career military retirees to fund their own disability \nbenefits. This inequitable offset affects over 437,000 military \nretirees.\n  Section 666 of the Senate version of this legislation would have \neliminated the current offset entirely. The provision was very similar \nof H.R. 303, which has 321 cosponsors in the House. The provision was \nsupported by numerous veterans' service organizations, including the \nMilitary Coalition, the National Military/Veterans Alliance, the \nAmerican Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Uniformed \nServices Disabled Retirees.\n  Some members were concerned that the provision was too expensive, and \nconsequently, many felt that we could not include a provision to \ncompletely eliminate the current offset in the conference report. In my \nopinion, no amount of money can equal the sacrifice our military men \nand women have made in service to their country. This is a small price \nto pay to show our appreciation to those who have sacrificed so much \nfor our great nation.\n  While I am extremely disappointed that we did not take advantage of \nthis opportunity to correct this long-standing inequity, I am pleased \nthat the conference report does contain language that will take us one \nstep closer to correcting this injustice once and for all.\n  The Fiscal Year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act included a \nprovision, to authorize a monthly allowance to military retirees with \nsevere service-connected disabilities rated by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs at 70 percent or greater. The provision authorized \npayments of $300 per month to retirees with 100 percent disability, \n$200 per month to retirees with 90 percent disability and $100 per \nmonth to retirees with 70 and 80 percent disability. To be eligible, \nretirees had to have at least 20 years of service and have their VA \ndisability rating within four years of their retirement. Only \nindividuals retired for longevity qualified for the monthly benefit.\n  The conference report for H.R. 4205 expands the eligibility for these \nspecial payments to those individuals retired for disability by their \nservice. These individuals are also known as ``Chapter 61'' retirees. \nThe payments will begin in fiscal year 2002.\n  I want to thank Senator Warner and Senator Levin for their assistance \nin including this provision in the conference report. I would also like \nto acknowledge Congressman Bilirakis, who assisted as an outside \nconferee on the conference report which made it possible for us to \ndebate concurrent receipt in this session of the 106th Congress. \nCongressman Bilirakis has been a vocal advocate for concurrent receipt \nin the House for over fifteen years.\n  The original law is 109 years old and discriminates against service \nmembers who decide to make the military their careers. Military \nretirees with service-connected disabilities should be able to receive \ncompensation for their injuries above their military retired pay. The \nelimination of this offset is long overdue, and I will continue to \npursue this issue in the 107th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report for H.R. 4205.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to serve on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee that developed the Senate version of \nthe National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. I am \nequally proud to have served as a Conferee to resolve differences \nbetween our bill and the one that passed the House of Representatives.\n  This bill is important to our men and women who serve this Nation \nevery day. As the explosion today in Yemen demonstrates, America's \ngreat military men and women put their lives on the line for us every \nday. That sacrifice demands our attention and our support.\n  This bill is another step to help us pull the U.S. military out of \nthe nosedive created by this Administration. The number of deployments \nthe Clinton/Gore administration committed us to has forced the military \nto use its limited funds for operations vice maintaining our forces. \nReadiness is at an all-time low. We are cannibalizing parts of our \nforces to keep the other parts running. That is wrong. Our men and \nwomen in uniform deserve better. This bill is a step in the right \ndirection, but we still need more. I will fight for more again next \nyear.\n  My colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have lauded the \nbenefits of this bill, so I will not repeat them all here. However, \nseveral points I feel are very important to note for the American \npeople.\n  This bill authorizes $309.9 billion in military spending, $4.6 \nbillion above the President's budget request. It authorizes $63.2 \nbillion for procurement, $2.6 billion above the President's budget \nrequest. It authorizes $38.9 billion for research and development, $1.1 \nbillion above the President's budget request.\n  This bill provides a decent pay raise--3.7 percent. It approves \npermanent comprehensive health care benefits for military retirees and \nbenefits for military families. It also provides pharmacy benefits. \nWhen our military men and women put their lives on the line for our \nfreedom, we owe them this commitment.\n  This bill is a start, but we must do better. We need to expand our \nmissile defense capabilities to fully leverage land, sea, air, and \nspace options. Our ship-building rate is below that needed to sustain \nour aging naval force in the long term. We also need to be investing in \nspace power programs. For 8 years, this Administration has ignored \nprograms like the Kinetic Energy Anti-Satellite system and the military \nspace plane.\n  I also want to mention two important items which I fought vigorously \nfor in this Bill that my colleagues have not mentioned.\n  First, this bill attempts to right a grievous wrong that was \ncommitted over 50 years ago when Captain Charles Butler McVay III was \ntried and convicted--unjustly I believe--for the sinking of his ship, \nthe U.S.S. Indianapolis, shortly before the end of the Second World \nWar. This remains the greatest sea disaster in the history of the U.S. \nNavy. 880 of the 1,197 men aboard perished. Many of those who survived \nthe actual sinking were left without lifeboats, food, or water and \nfaced shark attacks for 4 days and 5 nights.\n  This legislation recognizes Captain McVay's lack of culpability for \nthe tragic loss of the ship, urges a correction of his military record \nto reflect his exoneration, and prompts the Navy to award a Navy Unit \nCommendation to the U.S.S. Indianapolis and her final crew.\n  Captain McVay was not given intelligence reports about Japanese \nsubmarine activity in the ship's path; he was not granted an escort to \nhelp protect his ship; and he had taken prudent steps to protect the \nvessel. Not all of this information was made available to the court-\nmartial board. Several hundred U.S. ships were lost in combat to enemy \naction during World War II, yet only Captain McVay was subjected to a \ncourt-martial.\n  This language does not erase the conviction of Captain McVay from his \nrecord. We in Congress do not have the authority to do that. It must \nremain on his record as a stain upon the conscience of the Navy until \nthis or some future President sees fit to order that it be expunged. \nThis resolution does, however, represent acknowledgment from one branch \nof the Federal Government he served so capably that Captain\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\nMcVay's conviction was morally wrong and that he should no longer be \nviewed by the American people as responsible for the horrible tragedy \nwhich haunted him to the end of his life.\n  Second, this bill closes a loop hole in our national security \nregarding the granting of security clearances. Everyday, we entrust our \nnational secrets to individuals to develop weapon systems, intelligence \ncapabilities, war plans, and the like to defend this nation in war and \npeace. The American people demand these individuals be of the highest \nintegrity. Yet, it came to my attention that we have not been \nmaintaining that standard. Persons with criminal track records have \nbeen granted security clearances. We have even granted clearances to \nmurderers.\n  The addition I fought for in this bill is simple. It would prevent \nthe Department of Defense from granting security clearances to those \nwho have been convicted in a court of a crime punishable by \nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\n  As I have said, this bill will strengthen our military. It is a step \nin the right direction, but we are not finished. I urge my colleagues \nto approve the conference report.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss provisions \n(Section 934) in the fiscal year 2001 National Defense Authorization \nAct (H.R. 5408) aimed at supporting efforts within the Department of \nDefense to develop a set of operational concepts, sometimes referred to \nas `Network Centric Warfare', that seek to exploit the power of \ninformation and U.S. superiority in information technologies to \nmaintain dominance and improve interoperability on the battlefield. I \nam reiterating points here that I made in a longer and more detailed \nstatement this past summer on June 20 on this legislation. The concept \nof Network Centric Warfare calls for a military that links sensors, \ncommunications systems and weapons systems in an interconnected grid \nthat allows for a seamless information flow to warfighters, policy \nmakers, and support personnel. I am very pleased to see that our House \nand Senate Conferees have made a strong statement as to the importance \nof this emerging theory of warfare. They have joined a chorus of \nvoices, including experts from the Naval War College, Office of the \nDefense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to push for an acceleration of \nDoD efforts to analyze, understand, and implement the concepts of \nNetwork Centric Warfare. In fact, Joint Vision 2020 set the goal for \nthe Department of Defense to pursue information superiority in order \nthat joint forces may possess superior knowledge and attain decision \nsuperiority during operations across the spectrum of conflict.\n  After extensive discussions with a variety of Agency and Service \nofficials, I believe that although there are many innovative efforts \nunderway throughout the Department to develop network centric \ntechnologies and systems, as well as to develop mechanisms to integrate \ninformation systems, sensors, weapon systems and decision makers, these \nefforts are too often underfunded, low-priority, and not coordinated \nacross Services. In many cases, they will unfortunately continue the \nlegacy of interoperability problems that we all know exist today. To \nparaphrase one senior Air Force officer, we are not making the \nnecessary fundamental changes--we are still nibbling at the edges.\n  The legislation in Section 934 of H.R. 5408 explores many of the \nfacets of this novel Joint vision of a networked force and operations. \nSection 934 (b) clearly states the policy of the United States with \nrespect to Network Centric Warfare. The legislation makes it the goal \nof Department of Defense to fully coordinate various efforts being \npursued by the Joint Staff, the Defense Agencies, and the military \ndepartments as they develop the concepts of Network Centric Warfare. \nThe legislation then also calls for DoD to provide two reports to \nCongress detailing efforts in moving towards Network Centric forces and \noperations. The conference language reflects the fact that both the \nSenate and the House had compatible provisions on Network Centric \nWarfare in their respective bills. The final conference language \nessentially reflects the more detailed Senate version; it consolidates \nthe wording while retaining the intent and each key element of the \nSenate bill's proposals. Therefore the points I made in a more extended \nstatement this past summer remain applicable to the final provision, \nand what follows is merely a reiteration and elaboration from that \nstatement. At this point I also particularly want to note my \nappreciation for the strong support, cooperation, and contributions on \nthis provision from my friends and Committee colleagues, Senators \nRoberts and Bingaman.\n  Section 934(b) calls for a report focusing on the broad development \nand implementation of Network Centric Warfare concepts in the \nDepartment of Defense. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff are asked to report on their current and planned \nefforts to coordinate all Dod activities in Network Centric Warfare to \nshow how they are moving toward a truly Joint, networked force. The \nreport calls for the development of a set of metrics as discussed in \nSection 934(c)(J) to be used to monitor our progress towards a Joint, \nnetworked force and the attainment of fully integrated Joint command \nand control capabilities, both in technology and organizational \nstructure. These metrics should allow Congress and DoD to evaluate \ntechnology development and acquisition programs that are related to \nNetwork Centric concepts and enable policy makers to set priorities and \nto make difficult resource allocation decisions.\n  The legislation also requires the Department to report on how it is \nmoving toward Joint Requirements and Acquisition policies and \nincreasing Joint authority in this area to ensure that future forces \nwill be truly seamless, interoperable, and network-centric, as \ndescribed in Section 934(c)(G). These Joint activities are critically \nnecessary to achieving networked systems and operations. Unless we move \naway from a system designed to protect individual Service interests and \nprocurement programs, we will always be faced with solving \ninteroperability problems between systems. For example, strengthening \nthe Joint oversight of the requirements for and acquisition of all \nsystems directly involved in Joint Task Forces interoperability would \nprovide a sounder method for acquiring these systems. We need to move \naway from a cold war based, platform-centric acquisition system that is \nslow, cumbersome, and Service-centric. As part of this review, DoD \nshould examine the speed at which it can acquire new technologies and \nwhether the personnel making key decisions on information systems \nprocurement are technically training or at least supported by the \nfinest technical talent available. The report should, as part of this \nreview, evaluate how to ensure that Service acquisition systems are \nresponsive to the establishment of Joint interoperability standards in \nnetworking, computing, and communications, as well as best commercial \npractices.\n  As described in Section 934(c)(I), the report must also address the \nneed for coordination of Service and Agency Science and Technology \n(S) investments in the development of future Joint Network Central \nWarfare capabilities. In moving towards a more Joint, networked force \nwe must continue to ensure that we provide our nation's warfighters \nwith the best technologies. The review should evaluate where we must \nincrease our investments in areas such as sensors, networking \nprotocols, human-machine interfaces, training, and other technologies, \nespecially in the face of constrained S budgets. The Secretary of \nDefense should explain how S investments supporting network centric \noperations will be coordinated across the Agencies and Services to \neliminate redundancy and how and where investments will be made to \nbetter address critical warfighting technology needs. This is more \nimportant than ever as we develop our next generation of weapon \nsystems--better coordination and establishment of common standards in \nthe technology development stages can only help to alleviate future \ninteroperability problems.\n  Any investments in S for a network centric force must also address \nthe role of the operator in a network centric system. The report must \npay attention to the training of our combat and support personnel so \nthat they can make the best use of information technologies, as well as \ninvesting more in\n\n[[Page S10383]]\n\nresearch on learning and cognitive processes so that our training \nsystems and human-machine interfaces are optimized. The recommendations \non investments in the report should also accommodate the incredible \npace of change in information technologies that is currently driven by \nthe commercial sector. Dodd must analyze the commercially driven \nrevolutions in information technology and modify the investment \nstrategy to best leverage those developments through cooperative R \nand utilization of dual-use technologies.\n  Section 934(d) describes the second report, which requires an \nexamination of the use of the Joint Experimentation Program in \ndeveloping Network Centric Warfare concepts. Network Centric Warfare is \ninherently Joint, and the Commander in Chief of Joint Forces Command is \nin the best position to develop new operational concepts and test the \nnew technologies that support it. The report calls for a proposal on \nhow the Joint Experimentation Program and the results of its activities \nare to be used to develop these new operational concepts, especially \nwith regards to the design of optimal force structures for Joint \noperations.\n  The Joint Experimentation process should also be used to develop \nJoint Requirements, Doctrine, and Acquisition programs to support \nnetwork centric operations. It should serve to identify impediments to \nthe development of a joint information network, including the linking \nof Service intranets, as well as redesigning combat support functions \nto leverage new network centric operation concepts. The review should \nevaluate each of these issues. This of course does not detract from the \ncritical role that existing Service experimentation programs will play \nin developing new technologies and doctrine to make our fighting forces \nmore efficient and interoperable, which should be a part of this \nanalysis.\n  This legislation will help focus the Pentagon and Congress' attention \non the need to move our military into a more information savvy and \nnetworked force. We ask that these reports set forth the needed \norganizational, policy, and legislative changes necessary to achieve \nthis transformation for decision makers in the military, \nAdministration, and in Congress. The realities of the information \ntechnology revolution will force our future military operations to be \nnetwork centric. We must act now to ensure that we stay ahead of the \ncurve in technology and, more importantly, in thinking. I look forward \nto receiving plans and proposals to help get us there efficiently and \neffectively.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will vote \ntoday on the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization \nConference Report. This defense bill contains historic improvements in \nhealth care coverage for the approximately 12,600 military retirees, \ntheir families, and survivors currently living in South Dakota. In \naddition, the defense bill contains much-needed quality of life'' \nimprovements for men and women in active duty and several improvements \nto the TRICARE health care system for active duty personnel and their \nfamilies.\n  On the first day of this legislative session, I introduced the Keep \nOur Promises to America's Military Retirees Act to restore the broken \npromise of lifetime health care for military retirees and their \ndependents. Men and women were promised lifetime health care for \nthemselves and their families upon completion of 20 years in the \nmilitary. However, military retirees are currently kicked out of \nTRICARE once they become eligible for Medicare. The current situation \nbreaks a promise our country has made with its veterans and military \nretirees. The lack of adequate health care coverage for military \nretirees also impacts retention of qualified military personnel and \nsends a negative signal to young men and women considering a career in \nthe military.\n  My bipartisan legislation received the endorsement from military \nretiree and veterans organizations as well as from a grassroots \norganization of thousands of military retirees across the country. My \nlegislation called for military retirees to have the option of staying \nin their TRICARE military health care program or electing to \nparticipate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, FEHBP. The \nKeep Our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act would also allow \nmilitary retirees who entered the military prior to June 7, 1956 (the \ndate military health care for retirees was enacted into law) to enroll \nin FEHBP with the United States paying 100 percent of the costs.\n  I offered my legislation as an amendment during Senate consideration \nof the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization bill. Although the \namendment failed on a procedural motion, I was pleased that Senate \nArmed Services Committee Chairman John Warner agreed to include one \npart of my bill--the expansion of TRICARE to Medicare-eligible military \nretirees--in both the Senate defense bill and the final conference \nreport that will be sent to the President.\n  The conference report also extends full DoD pharmacy benefits for \nMedicare-eligible military retirees. Military retirees will now be able \nto use DoD retail and mail-order pharmacy programs. A 20 percent \ncopayment is required for retail, and a $8 copay is required for a 90-\nday supply of mail-ordered drugs. As you recall, this pharmacy \nprovision was included in the Senate defense bill after I was \nsuccessful in creating a special military retiree health care reserve \nfund'' in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Conference Report includes \na number of other health care and ``quality of life'' improvements for \nmen and women in active duty and their families. I am pleased this bill \neliminates TRICARE Prime copayments for active-duty family members as \nwell as increasing reimbursement rates for TRICARE providers. In my \nnumerous meetings in the state on TRICARE, low reimbursement rates have \nbeen of particular concern because the low rates make recruitment of \nTRICARE health care providers in rural areas difficult. With my \nsupport, the bill also includes efforts to improve TRICARE through good \nbusiness practices, increased technology, and reduced administrative \nwaste.\n  The conference report includes a much-deserved 3.7 percent pay raise \nfor active duty and reserve personnel. I am pleased the bill also \nbegins the process of eliminating the mandatory out-of-pocket housing \ncosts incurred by servicemembers. Recruitment and retention efforts \nwill be enhanced with incentives to join ROTC and increased enlistment \nbonuses, as well as a provision that allows VEAP conversion to the \nMontgomery GI Bill for servicemembers currently on active duty who had \npreviously contributed to VEAP.\n  While I am pleased that a number of health care issues have been \naddressed in this year's defense authorization bill, there is more work \nthat needs to be done. I will continue to work with cosponsors of my \nKeep Our Promises legislation to provide military retirees with the \noption of using FEHBP and to address the broken promise of free \nlifetime health care to those military personnel who entered the \nmilitary prior to June 7, 1956. I am also disappointed that the bill \nfailed to adequately address a rule that prohibits disabled vets from \nreceiving their retired pay and disability compensation concurrently. I \nam a cosponsor of legislation that would correct this injustice, and I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues to ensure its eventual \npassage. Finally, I will continue to fight for increased veterans \neducation benefits through a strengthened Montgomery GI Bill and \npassage of my Veterans Education Opportunities Act.\n  The health care improvements and ``quality of life'' improvements \nincluded in this year's defense authorization bill are a testament to \nthe hard work and grassroots organization of thousands of military \nretirees across the country. One particular military retiree, Fred \nAthans from Rapid City, recently completed his term as national \npresident of The Retired Enlisted Association. Fred and countless \nothers from South Dakota and around the country were essential in the \npassage of this legislation.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I would like to say that \nthe attack on the U.S.S. Cole is a tragedy for the nation. My thoughts \nare with the families and loved ones of the sailors who lost their \nlives, and I pray for the full recovery of those who were injured. I \nalso urge an immediate investigation of\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\nthis brutal terrorist act against our country in order to identify the \nterrorists and their backers and bring them to justice as soon as \npossible.\n  I support the conference report to the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense \nAuthorization Bill. It represents major progress in our commitment to \ndefending our country and caring for the dedicated men and women who \nserve so well in our armed forces.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their \nskillful work in producing this consensus and bipartisan conference \nreport. We have made worthwhile progress on many important issues \naffecting our armed forces.\n  The nation owes a special debt to the men and women of the armed \nforces for their unwavering commitment to our country and their \nexcellent performance in the challenges they faced in this past year. \nThey stand in harm's way. They have helped end the aggression in \nKosovo, enforced the peace in Iraq, and helped provide the foundation \nfor a free and independent nation in East Timor.\n  The contributions of our armed forces in those conflicts captured \nheadlines, but it is important to recognize that our service members \nare preparing for and responding to a variety of contingencies. From \ndefending the United States and our allies to participating in \npeacekeeping missions, to conducting counter-drug operations, to \nproviding humanitarian assistance, the members of our armed forces \ntoday are prepared to carry out a wide range of duties in an efficient \nand professional manner.\n  This conference report includes a number of important provisions that \ndemonstrate the commitment by Congress to improving the quality of life \nof those serving our country today as well as those who have completed \ntheir service in the past. For those currently serving, the conference \nreport includes a 3.7 percent pay raise, a full half-percent above the \nrate of inflation.\n  Our commitment is not only to the soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nMarines who defend our country but also to their families. The \nconference report authorizes the construction of new housing for 2,900 \nfamilies. For families who live off-base, we have taken steps to meet \nour goal of reducing out-of-pocket housing expenses to zero within five \nyears.\n  The conference report helps to make the armed forces a more \nattractive career by implementing a program to allow active and reserve \nservice members to enroll in the Thrift Savings Program, encouraging \nthem to plan and save for their retirement.\n  One of the most important accomplishments in this legislation is a \nprescription drug benefit for military retirees, their spouses and \nwidows. It is a long overdue step toward making good on the Nation's \npromise to provide career personnel with lifetime health benefits. And \nwe intend to continue the on-going effort to provide all retirees with \naffordable, comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicare.\n  When we first considered the DOD authorization bill earlier this \nyear, Senator Snowe and I drafted a proposal to create a comprehensive \ndrug benefit. We worked closely with Chairman Warner and others to make \ncoverage of prescription drugs a priority in this legislation. I am \npleased that our legislation prevailed and was expanded in the \nconference. It is now clear to all that Congress has heard and heeded \nthe needs of our military retirees, and addressed their number one \npriority--the cost of prescription drugs.\n  As a result of our efforts, nearly 1.4 million Medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees and their spouses and widows--including more than \n21,500 in Massachusetts--will have access to affordable prescription \ndrugs, effective upon enactment.\n  Under this legislation, military retirees will receive a retail and \nmail-order pharmacy benefit. Almost one-third of them--450,000--already \nhave this benefit under the base closing agreement. The bill provides a \n90-day supply of prescription drugs by mail for an $8 co-payment, or a \n30-day supply of prescription drugs from a retail pharmacy for a 20 \npercent co-payment. There are no deductibles, and no additional \npremiums. Military retirees and their spouses and widows will receive \nthe prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe. It is a generous \nbenefit for those who have given so generously to the country during \ntheir working years.\n  The legislation also assures comprehensive Medicare supplemental \ncoverage through TRICARE. Together, these new benefits assure health \nsecurity in retirement for those who have served in the armed forces.\n  These benefits send a strong message to all men and women in uniform \nthat we care about their service. It lets military retirees know that \nCongress listens, cares, and will act on their behalf.\n  Despite success here today for military retirees, we must not forget \nthe millions of other senior citizens who need help with prescription \ndrugs, too.\n  It's long past time for Congress to mend the broken promise of \nMedicare. Medicare is a compact between the government and America's \nsenior and disabled citizens. It says work hard and pay in during your \nworking years, and you will receive health coverage in your retirement \nyears. But every day that promise is broken, because Medicare does not \ncover prescription drugs. It is time for Congress to make good on that \npromise, too.\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1965, only three percent of private \ninsurance policies offered prescription drug coverage. Today, virtually \nall private health insurance policies provide prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Up to 20 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries--one-\nhalf of the total--have no prescription drug coverage throughout the \nyear. Almost 14 million have never had drug coverage.\n  Those who have coverage find that too often it is unreliable, \ninadequate or unaffordable. In fact, the only senior citizens who have \nstable, secure, affordable drug coverage today are the very poor, who \nare on Medicaid. The idea that only the impoverished elderly should \nqualify for needed hospital and doctor care was rejected when Medicare \nwas enacted.\n  Governor Bush and Congressional Republicans say they want to \nsubsidize prescription drugs for the poor. But senior citizens deserve \nMedicare, not welfare.\n  Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the \nmedicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses.\n  Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes--or \ndon't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs.\n  Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to \nMedicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or \ncannot afford to take them correctly.\n  Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures \nfor a host of dread diseases. In 1998 alone, private industry spent \nmore than $21 billion in research on new medicines and to bring them to \nthe public. Congress is well on its way to doubling the budget for the \nNational Institutes of Health. The miracle drugs developed by these \npublic and private sectors investments save lives--and they save \ndollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive \nsurgery. But millions of Medicare beneficiaries are left out and left \nbehind from the benefits of 21st century medicine because they cannot \nafford the price of admission.\n  Elderly Americans need and deserve prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their \nchildren and grandchildren. It is time to make the needs of all seniors \na priority as well.\n  As a party, Republicans have always disliked Medicare. It was one of \nthe first votes I cast when I came to the Senate, and it's still one of \nthe best votes I've ever cast.\n  Senator Bob Dole, however, once boasted that he voted against \nMedicare's enactment, and never liked it. According to historian Robert \nDallek, Ronald Reagan saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism \nthat would ``invade every area of freedom in this country.'' House \nMajority Leader Dick Armey has said that it's a program he would ``have \nno part of in a free world.'' Newt Gingrich wanted Medicare to ``wither \non the vine'' in the GOP effort he led to privatize Medicare and reduce \nits funding in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.\n  In contrast, under the leadership of the Clinton-Gore Administration,\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\nMedicare's financial outlook is the healthiest it has ever been. \nAccording to the most recent Trustee's Report, the Medicare Trust Fund \nwill remain solvent for the next quarter century.\n  Democrats want a universal, voluntary prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. All beneficiaries would be eligible for affordable coverage \nwithin one year of enactment. In contrast, George Bush passes the buck \nto the states and private insurance companies. His flawed two-part \nprogram would force seniors to wait too long and do too little for too \nfew.\n  Phase One of the Bush plan would be a state block grant program \nsimilar to one of the proposals by Senator Roth. Eligibility is limited \nto senior citizens whose incomes are below $14,600--which leaves 70 \npercent of all Medicare beneficiaries with no coverage. Senior citizens \nwant Medicare, not welfare. They have spent their working years \nbuilding our country, and they should not have to beg for prescription \ndrugs in their golden years.\n  It would take years to implement the Bush block grant program. Last \nFebruary, the National Governors Association unanimously rejected this \napproach in a resolution that said, ``If Congress decides to expand \nprescription drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that \nresponsibility . . . to the states.'' States should not be asked to \npick up the slack for Congress' failure to fill Medicare's biggest gap.\n  Phase Two of the Bush plan picks up where Newt Gingrich left off. \nUnder the guise of Medicare ``reform,'' the Bush proposal relies on \nprivate insurance companies to provide Medicare benefits. Prescription \ndrug coverage under phase two would not start until 2004. It is \ncontingent on passage by Congress of broad Medicare changes that would \ncreate a ``premium support'' program, which would eliminate the \ngovernment's obligation to contribute 75 percent of the premium for \nindividuals enrolling in Medicare. A similar plan was estimated to \nraise premiums for the elderly in traditional Medicare by up to 47 \npercent in the first year. Bush claims that the elderly could keep \ntheir current Medicare, but many would be forced to join HMOs, because \nconventional Medicare would quickly become unaffordable. The Bush plan \nwill turn many senior citizens over to the tender mercy of the private \ninsurance industry, and force them to give up their doctors and join \nHMOs to have access to an affordable drug benefit.\n\n  In addition, under Governor Bush's plan, the government would \nsubsidize only 25 percent of an undetermined premium that could vary \ndrastically from state to state. Never in the history of Medicare have \nsenior citizens been asked to pay such a high proportion of the cost of \nany benefit. According to CBO estimates for a similar plan, the Bush \nproposal costs so much and provides so little that it is unlikely to \nhelp even half of the senior citizens who are currently without drug \ncoverage.\n  The ongoing revolution in health care makes prescription drug \ncoverage more essential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs \nunder Medicare is as essential today as was coverage of hospital and \ndoctor care in 1965, when Medicare was enacted. Senior citizens need \nthat help--and they need it now.\n  So I say to my colleagues--while we are making good on broken \npromises, it's long past time to cover prescription drugs under \nMedicare for all elderly Americans. If we can cover military retirees, \nwe can cover other senior citizens too.\n  Another major achievement in this bill is the inclusion of the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Act, a gratifying \nbreakthrough for basic fairness. These workers deserve this \ncompensation, and it is decades overdue.\n  As we now know, the nuclear build-up in the Cold War years exposed \nmany hard-working, patriotic employees in the nation's defense plants \nto dangerous radioactive and chemical materials at far greater levels \nthan employers were willing to admit. Many of these workers now suffer \nfrom debilitating and fatal illnesses directly related to that \nexposure. For too long, the government shamefully ignored the plight of \nthese workers and failed to accept responsibility for it.\n  I commend Secretary of Energy Richardson for his leadership in \nbringing this issue to light and dealing so effectively with this \ntragic chapter in our recent history. I also commend Senators Thompson, \nBingaman, Voinovich, McConnell, DeWine, and Bunning for their \nleadership and persistence in achieving this bipartisan compromise.\n  This workers' compensation program is based on sound science and \ntraditional principles of workers' compensation. It is designed to make \nthe claimants whole by paying medical benefits and compensating them \nfor lost income due to death or disability that resulted from work for \nthe federal government or one of its contractors. I supported giving \nworkers the option of choosing to receive their actual lost wages, \ninstead of a lump sum payment, and I am disappointed that the House \nRepublicans refused to include this provision in the final bill. \nDespite this oversight, this new program is a substantial victory for \nthese energy workers. They made great sacrifices for our country during \nthe Cold War, and they have already waited too long for this relief.\n  Another important provision in the conference agreement is a new GAO \nstudy of the effectiveness of existing disability programs in the \nmilitary health system in meeting the needs of disabled dependents. Too \noften, active military personnel are forced to turn to Medicaid as the \nonly way they can get good health care for their disabled child--even \nthough there are programs authorized under the military health system \nto assist disabled dependents. In some cases, choosing Medicaid makes \nit impossible for active duty parents to accept a military promotion--\nbecause they would earn too much money for their child to qualify for \nMedicaid. It is time to overhaul these programs and make them more \neffective, so that no military personnel have to impoverish themselves \nand their family in order to obtain needed health care for their \ndisabled children.\n  I am pleased that this legislation also includes a provision that at \nlong last lifts the unfair stain placed on Admiral Husband E. Kimmel \nand General Walter C. Short in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the \nNavy and Army commanders at the time of that attack. Despite loyal and \ndistinguished service, they were unfairly scapegoated for the nation's \nlack of preparation for that attack and the catastrophe that took \nplace.\n  They were the only two officers eligible for advancement under the \n1947 Officer Personnel Act who did not receive advancement when they \nretired. The provision in this bill asks the President to advance them \nposthumously, so that now, at this late date, these two men will \nfinally be treated fairly like their peers. This provision moves us \nanother step forward on the path of justice and equality, and I am \ndelighted by its inclusion.\n  Although the conference report makes progress on many issues, I am \nvery disappointed that this legislation fails to take strong and needed \naction on the important issue of hate crimes.\n  Earlier this year, with the support of a broad group of law \nenforcement organizations, civil rights groups, and community and \nreligious organizations, strong, bipartisan majorities in both the \nSenate and the House voted to include a needed anti-hate crimes \nprovision in the defense authorization bill. By stripping the hate \ncrimes provision from the bill in the conference, the Republican \nleadership has callously ignored these votes and the clear will of \nCongress. On hate crimes, the Republican leadership has failed the \nleadership test and turned its back on the need to protect all our \ncitizens from bigotry and prejudice.\n\n  Hate crimes are a national disgrace--an attack on everything this \ncountry stands for. They send a poisonous message that some Americans \nare second class citizens who deserve to be victimized solely because \nof their race, their ethnic background, their religion, their sexual \norientation, their gender or their disability. For too long, the \nfederal government has been forced to stand on the sidelines in the \nfight against these senseless acts of hate and violence. If America is \nto live up to its founding ideals of liberty and justice for all, \ncombating hate crimes must be a national priority.\n  If the national outcry is loud enough, we still have a chance to act \non this issue in the remaining days of this Congress.\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\n  We also have a responsibility to address the problem of unexploded \nordinance on active and formerly live-fire training facilities. On the \nMassachusetts Military Reservation, UXO poses a contamination threat to \nthe soil and groundwater in the area. It is time to take action on this \nproblem now, before it causes tragic and irreparable harm to the \nenvironment and the people who live in the area.\n  The conference report authorizes $8 million to develop and test new \ntechnologies to detect UXO and map the presence of their contaminants. \nWhile this is a good step, it cannot be the last step. The Department \nof Defense should take on the task of removing UXO from current and \nformer training facilities. This step would ensure the continued \noperation of live-fire ranges and make former ranges safe for their \ncommunities and future reuse.\n  In addition, we must deal with the new generation of threats faced by \nour service members and the American public at large. As we enter the \n21st century, our country is faced with new challenges from the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the risk of terrorist \nattacks both at home and abroad, and cyber-warfare. This legislation \ntakes steps to protect us from each of these dangers.\n  The conference report authorizes the creation of five additional \nCivil Support Teams, comprised of National Guard personnel specially \ntrained to detect and respond to the suspected use of chemical, \nbiological, radiological, or other weapons of mass destruction against \ncities and people.\n  Strong support is given to threat reduction programs to continue work \nwith the nations of the former Soviet Union to reduce the dangers of \nproliferation. These steps include an additional $25 million above the \nPresident's request to eliminate strategic nuclear weapons in Russia.\n  The number of cyber-attacks against the Department of Defense \nincreased dramatically last year, totaling 22,000 raids on DOD computer \nsystems. With computers being an essential part of the command, \ncontrol, communications and intelligence functions of our armed \nservices, it is easy to see how disruptive these attacks, if \nsuccessful, could be. The conference report recognizes the seriousness \nof this threat and creates an Institute for Defense Computer Security \nand Information Protection to ensure our military can protect itself \nfrom this type of threat.\n  The Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of our distinguished \nchair, Senator Snowe, heard testimony over the past year on concerns \nabout the Navy's force structure, shipbuilding rate, and the readiness \nof our fleet. The conference report supports the Secretary of the \nNavy's decision to increase research and development on DD-21 to begin \nthe next generation of our destroyer fleet, and asks the Navy to report \non the feasibility of receiving delivery of this advanced ship by 2009. \nBut many of us are concerned about the delays that the program has \nalready faced, as well as the effects of the delays on the fire-support \nrequirements of the Marine Corps and on our country's shipbuilding \nindustrial base.\n  The conference report authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 multi-\nyear procurement through fiscal year 2005. The extension of this \nprocurement will ease the strain placed on many of our shipyards, and \ncould raise the Navy's overall shipbuilding rate to an acceptable level \nof nine ships for each of those years. This provision is good for the \ntaxpayer as well, as it can save the American public almost $600 \nmillion compared to building these ships at a slower rate.\n  In closing, this legislation makes progress on many of the serious \nchallenges facing our armed services, and makes important commitments \nto those in uniform and those who have retired from the services. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in voting to approve the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank my \ncolleagues who have worked very hard over the last several months on a \nproposal to compensate eligible workers in nuclear energy facilities \nwho have been exposed to hazardous materials. Without the extraordinary \neffort of so many members and their staffs, including Senators \nThompson, McConnell, Voinovich, Bingaman, and Kennedy, we would not \nhave been able to create this compensation program. I especially \nappreciate the patience of Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin for \nworking with us on the initiative and including it in the Defense \nAuthorization bill.\n  For more than 50 years, Ohio has been home to numerous facilities \nthat performed work for the Department of Energy's nuclear programs. \nDuring the Cold War, hundreds of Ohioans, as well as thousands of \nAmericans, were exposed to hazardous and radioactive materials as a \nresult of their employment. Often, workers were unknowingly exposed to \nthese materials, and if workers became ill, they had no relief. Our \nfederal government directed, and even paid for, contractors and \nsubcontractors to fight worker compensation cases. A worker had to \nprove his or her case on evidence that the government would not make \navailable.\n  A little over a year ago, things began to change. Stories started \nappearing in the press about what workers were exposed to and how the \ngovernment ignored evidence. Several Senate Committees, such as \nGovernment Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, have held hearings the issue of harmful \nexposure and proposed remedies. I believe that we have a good \nunderstanding of the problem now, as well as a solution.\n  However, Mr. President, we all fully understand that no level of \nbenefits can compensate these workers for what they have endured. But \nwe are trying to reimburse them for their financial loss. The agreement \nin the Defense Authorization bill provides eligible victims with a lump \nsum payment of $150,000, plus health care coverage.\n  This agreement also defines those workers who are eligible based on \nthe latest scientific evidence on beryllium disease, beryllium \nsensitivity, and radiogenic cancers. Mr. President, we have created \nstringent guidelines to determine eligibility. However, there are \ninstances when the administering agency will not be able to recreate an \nemployee's radiation dose exposure. We have reversed the burden of \nproof for exposure to employees at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in \nOhio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, because their radiation exposure doses \ncannot be assessed.\n  More than likely, there will be other instances of extremely poor \nrecord keeping, where it will be nearly impossible to determine \nemployees' radiation exposure levels. Therefore, the administering \nagency may propose additions to the definition of ``special cohort'' \nunder this agreement. Once a new cohort is proposed, Congress will have \none hundred eighty days to act to reverse the decision to add the \ncohort. If Congress fails to act within that time, the cohort will be \naccepted and eligible for benefits.\n  Eligible employees will have seven years from either the enactment of \nthis bill or from the date on which the employee learned that his or \nher illness was related to work in which to apply and collect the \nbenefits provided by this program. Like a traditional worker \ncompensation program, compensation under this program will be an \nexclusive remedy to an employee for claims against the United States, \nits contractors, and subcontractors--but not against beryllium vendors.\n  The benefits under this program are completely voluntary. Eligible \nindividuals with beryllium disease must decide whether to litigate a \nclaim or receive the benefits provided under this plan. Individuals who \ncurrently have pending lawsuits against beryllium vendors are eligible \nfor benefits under this plan. Those individuals have two-and-one-half \nyears from today to decide whether to dismiss their lawsuit and accept \nthe benefits under this plan or to continue with litigation. During \nthat two-and-one-half year window in which litigants must decide \nwhether or not to drop their litigation, plaintiffs may begin an \neligibility review with the agency administering this program, so the \nplaintiff knows whether he or she is eligible for compensation under \nthis program. Nothing in this agreement prohibits plaintiffs or the \nadministering agency from determining whether a plaintiff is eligible \nunder this new program, allowing them to make an informed decision \nwhether or not to pursue litigation.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable proposal. It will help people, \nlike Sam Ray, who worked at the Portsmouth\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nGaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio as an operator and instrument mechanic. \nIt was there that Sam was exposed to technetium, plutonium, neptunium, \nand heavy metals. He has consequently developed chondrosarcoma--a rare \ntype of bone cancer. As the medical text, Cancer Epidemiology and \nPrevention, by Doctors Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, points out, cancers \nof the bone include cancers of the cartilage, including radiosensitive \ncancers that originate in cartilage, such as chondrosarcoma.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking my colleagues once again \nfor supporting this program. I also want to thank the many, many \nworkers who came to Washington, DC, or to Columbus to testify on why a \ncompensation measure is needed. They worked tirelessly with my office \nand other offices to get us to where we are today. They deserve a great \ndeal of the credit for the program contained in this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4205, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The bill that \npassed today includes several amendments that significantly improve the \nlives of active duty and Reserve servicemembers, military retirees, \nveterans, and their families.\n  I am pleased that the conference agreement includes some key \nlegislative provisions that I had introduced in the Senate during the \ncourse of the normal legislative process. Some of these provisions \nincluded in the conference report will: remove servicemembers from food \nstamps; increase pay for mid-grade Petty Officers and Non-Commissioned \nOfficers; assist disabled veterans in claims processing; expand pay \nbenefits to some disabled military retirees; authorize a low cost life \ninsurance plan for spouses and their children; enhance benefits and \nretirement pay for Reservists and National Guardsmen; authorize back \npay for certain World War II Navy and Marine Corps Prisoners of War; \nand provide for significant acquisition reform by eliminating domestic \nsource restrictions on the procurement of shipyard cranes.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern to me, however, regarding \nmilitary retirees and their families is the broken promise of lifetime \nmedical care, especially for those over age 65. Last year, the Joint \nChiefs proclaimed that this would be the year for major health care \nreform for our military forces, especially our medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees who were promised lifetime military medical care. \nDespite the assurances of the Joint Chiefs, the President proposed a \nfiscal year 2001 defense budget without any major medical care reforms, \nand all but ignored those military retirees who are older and in \ngreatest need of health care.\n  The Republican Congress, however, responded to military retirees' \nneeds and provided several major military health care reforms as well \nas a plan in this year's bill to provide all Medicare-eligible military \nretirees, family members, and survivors with lifetime military health \ncare coverage, including full pharmacy benefits in military, retail, \nand mail order pharmacies. This conference report will establish \n``TRICARE-for-life'' as a permanent entitlement that will be funded \nthrough a ``Military Retirees Health Care Trust Fund,'' a legislative \nprovision adopted from S.2013, a military health care reform bill that \nI introduced earlier this year. This new, critical lifetime benefit \nwill mean huge savings for military retirees by eliminating the need \nfor them to buy expensive Medicare supplemental policies.\n  Separately, with severe recruitment and retention problems still \nlooming, we must also better compensate our mid-grade enlisted \nservicemembers who are critical to leading the junior enlisted force. \nWe have significantly underpaid enlisted servicemembers since the \nbeginning of the All Volunteer Force. The value of the mid-grade NCO \npay, compared to that of the most junior enlisted, has dropped 50 \npercent since the All Volunteer Force was put in place by Congress in \n1973. The provision for the mid-grade enlisted ranks, up to $700 per \nyear, plus the food stamp pay provision of up to an additional $500 per \nmonth for servicemembers, provides a significant increase in pay for \nenlisted servicemembers.\n  In addition, the National Guard and Reserves have become a larger \npercentage of the Total Force and are essential partners in a wide \nrange of military operations. Due to the higher deployment rates of the \nactive duty forces, the Reserve Components are being called upon more \nfrequently and for longer periods of time than ever before. We must \nstop treating them like a second class force. It is tremendously \nimportant that we enact meaningful improvements for both our active \nduty and Reserve service-members, their families, and their survivors. \nThey risk their lives to protect our freedom and preserve democracy. We \nshould compensate them adequately, improve the benefits to their \nfamilies and survivors, and enhance the quality of life for the \nReserves and National Guard in a manner similar to the active forces.\n  This bill goes far in correcting some of the inconsistencies, with \nregard to Reserve Component policies, that previously only benefited \nthe active duty components. Additionally, in order to ensure that \nreservists receive full credit for the time and effort they commit to \nattending drills, performing annual training, and completing \ncorrespondence courses, the conference report increased from 70 to 90 \nthe maximum number of days per year that reservists may accrue as \ncredit towards retirement benefits.\n  Each year the number of disabled veterans appealing their health care \ncases continues to increase. Furthermore, it takes an average of 275 \ndays to get some sort of reply from the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nregarding claims filing. Disabled veterans are forced to leave the \nservice because of their disabilities. It is Congress's duty to ensure \nthat the disability claims process is less complex, less burdensome, \nand much more efficient. I am pleased that the final conference \nagreement includes legislation necessary to fully restore the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' duty to ensure efficient and timely \nveterans claims processing and remove onerous court-imposed procedures.\n  I commend the conference leaders for including some minimal \nimprovements to the egregious regulations that strip retirement pay \nfrom military retirees who are also disabled, and cost them any \nrealistic opportunity for post-service earnings. We should do more to \nrestore retirement pay for those military retirees who are disabled. \nWith respect to concurrent receipt, clearly, retirees who have incurred \nsignificant disabilities over the course of a military career deserve \nbetter than how they are treated currently.\n  Many such servicemembers are compelled to forfeit their full-retired \npay under current rules. I have stated before on the Senate floor, and \nI am compelled to reiterate now, retirement pay and disability pay are \ntwo distinct types of pay. Retirement pay is for service rendered \nthrough 20 years of military service. Disability pay is for physical or \nmental pain or suffering that occurs during and as a result of military \nservice. In this case, members with decades of military service receive \nthe same compensation as similarly disabled members who served only a \nfew years--with no recognition at all for their extended, clearly more \ndemanding careers of service to our country. This is patently unfair \nand even more must be done to correct this problem.\n  I would also like to point out that this year's defense authorization \nbill contained over $2 billion in unrequested add-ons to the defense \nbudget that will rob our military of vital funding on priority issues. \nWhile this year's total is less than in previous years, and is far less \nthan the $7 billion in the defense appropriations bill, it is still $2 \nbillion too much. We need to, and can do, better. I ask that the \ndetailed list of pork on this bill be included in the Congressional \nRecord following my remarks.\n\n  I have to wonder, Mr. President, about the wisdom of permitting the \nNavy to potentially violate public law with respect to the status of \nthe last two battleships, the only current means of providing high-\nvolume gunfire support for land forces ashore, while simultaneously \ncontinuing to provide millions of dollars from the defense budget for \nthe recovery and preservation of Civil War vessels.\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n  Over the past six years, Congress has increased the President's \ndefense budgets by nearly $60 billion in order to address the military \nservices' most important unfunded priorities. Still, it is sufficient \nto say that the military needs less money spent on pork and more money \nspent wisely to redress the serious problems caused by a decade of \ndeclining defense budgets. Those of us who have been criticized for \nsounding alarm bells about military readiness now have the empty \nsatisfaction of seeing that there is more to maintaining a strong \ndefense than a politician's history of falsely promising to do so.\n  We also must reform the bureaucracy of the Pentagon. With the \nexception of minor changes, our defense establishment looks just as it \ndid 50 years ago. We must continue to incorporate practices from the \nprivate sector--like restructuring, reforming, and streamlining to \neliminate duplication and capitalize on cost savings.\n  More effort must be made to reduce the continuing growth of \nheadquarter staffs and to decentralize the Pentagon's labyrinth of \nbureaucratic fiefdoms. Although nearly every military analyst shares \nthese views, the conference agreement took great measures to increase \nthe size of headquarter staffs, thereby eliminating any incentive for \nthe Pentagon to change its way of doing business with its bloated \nstaffs and its outdated practices.\n  In addition, more must be done to eliminate unnecessary and \nduplicative military contracts and military installations. Every U.S. \nmilitary leader has testified regarding the critical need for further \nBRAC rounds. We can redirect at least $3 billion per year by \neliminating excess defense infrastructure. There is another $2 billion \nper year that we can put to better purposes by privatizing or \nconsolidating support and maintenance functions, and an additional $5 \nbillion can be saved per year by eliminating ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions that only undermine U.S. competitiveness overseas. Despite \nthese compelling facts, the conference agreement did not address any of \nthese critical issues. On the contrary, it includes several provisions \nthat move demonstratively in the opposite direction.\n  Sections designed to preserve Army depots and funnel work in their \ndirection irrespective of cost are examples of the old philosophy of \nprotecting home-town jobs at the expense of greater efficiencies. And \ncalling plants and depots ``Centers of Excellence'' does not, Mr. \nPresident, constitute an appropriate approach to depot maintenance and \nmanufacturing activities. Consequently, neither the Center of \nIndustrial and Technical Excellence nor the Center of Excellence in \nService Contracting provide adequate cloaks for the kind of \nprotectionist and parochial budgeting endemic to the legislating \nprocess. Similarly, whether the Centers of Academic Excellence in \nInformation Assurance Education is worthy of the $15 million earmarked \nin the budget is open to debate.\n  The Defense Appropriations bill, already signed into law, included a \nprovision statutorily renaming National Guard armories as ``Readiness \nCenters,'' a particularly Orwellian use of language. By statutorily \nrelabeling ``depot-level activities'' as ``operations at Centers of \nIndustrial and Technical Excellence,'' we further institutionalize this \ndubious practice, the implications of which are to deny the American \npublic the most cost-effective use of its tax dollars.\n  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my belief in the importance \nof enacting meaningful improvements for active duty and Reserve \nservicemembers. They risk their lives to defend our shores and preserve \ndemocracy, and we can not thank them enough for their service. But, we \ncan and should pay them more, improve the benefits for their families, \nand support the Reserve Components in a manner similar to the active \nforces. Our servicemembers past, present, and future need these \nimprovements. However, we can not continue with this ``business as \nusual\" mindset. We must reform the Department of Defense and we must \nnot fall prey to the special interest groups that attempt to warp our \nperspective and misdirect our spending. We owe so much more to our men \nand women in uniform who defend our country. They are our greatest \nresource, and I feel they are woefully under-represented. We must \ncontinue to do better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached list of \nitems added to the defense authorization bill by Congress be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   FY01 Defense Authorization Conference Report (H.R. 4205) Add-Ons, \n                         Increases and Earmarks\n\nTotal Add-ons, Increases and Earmarks....................$2,333,550,000\n\n\n                           Language Earmarks\n\n       Sec. 112 Increases the quantity of Bunker Defeat Munitions \n     the US.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \ndisappointment that the Conference Report to the Fiscal Year 2001 \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill does not contain language that \nwas in the Senate passed bill to expand Federal jurisdiction in \ninvestigating hate crimes.\n  The language in the Senate passed bill was adopted by the Senate on \nJune 20th by a vote of 57-42, and endorsed in the House on September \n13th by a vote of 232-190. This language would expand Federal \njurisdiction in investigating hate crimes by removing the requirement \nin Federal hate crime law that only allows federal prosecution if the \nperpetrator is interfering with a victim's federally protected right \nlike voting or attending school. It would also extend the protection of \ncurrent hate crime law to those who are victimized because of their \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n  Mr. President, any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by \nhate are especially harmful. Many states, including my state of \nVermont, have already passed strong hate crimes laws, and I applaud \nthem in this endeavor. An important principle of the amendment that was \nin the Senate-passed bill was that it allowed for Federal prosecution \nof hate crimes without impeding the rights of states to prosecute these \ncrimes.\n  The adoption of this amendment by the Senate was an important step \nforward in ensuring that the perpetrators of these harmful crimes are \nbrought to justice. The American public knows that Congress should pass \nthis legislation, and it is unfortunate that the conferees did not \nretain this important language.\n  Congress should pass this legislation, and I will continue to work to \nensure that this legislation is enacted into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate completes action on this \nimportant legislation, I want to again congratulate the chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator Warner, for his leadership and determination in \ncompleting this important bill.\n  I also want to thank and congratulate all of the members of the Armed \nServices Committee for their hard work on this bill over the past year. \nThe subcommittee chairpersons and ranking members carried the brunt of \nthe workload in conference, but the fact is that every member of the \ncommittee played an active and constructive role in this legislation, \nfrom the committee and subcommittee hearings in the spring to the \ncommittee markup, to floor action and finally in conference.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say a special word of thanks to the \nstaff of the Armed Services Committee. The majority staff under the \ncapable leadership of Les Brownlee works very cooperatively with the \nminority staff under David Lyles. The Committee's long tradition of \nbipartisanship among the members extends to the staff as well. They \ntruly work together as a single team for the benefit of the men and \nwomen of the armed forces and for the national security of our nation.\n  In addition to David Lyles, I want to thank all of the members of the \nArmed Services Committee minority staff for their efforts this year: \nPeter Levine, Rick DeBobes; Richard Fieldhouse;\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\nCreighton Greene; Mike McCord; Gary Leeling; Dan Cox; Chris Cowart; and \nJan Gordon. I also want to recognize the efforts of the associate staff \nmembers of all of the Democratic members of the committee for their \nefforts this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to \nChairman Warner and Senator Levin for bringing to the Senate a strong \nDefense Authorization conference report. While I have long had the \ngreatest respect for my friends from Virginia and Michigan, the task \nthey complete today is a testament to their legislative skill, \nmanagerial expertise and leadership. Over the last year--and for many \nyears--Senators Warner and Levin have listened to our troops needs, and \nthe needs of our troops' families. They have listened to our commanders \nand identified the equipment and modernization requirements needed to \ncarry out the missions we, as a nation, expect of our military. They \nhave listened to their colleagues, literally working through hundreds \nof amendments and incorporating many of them into this conference \nreport. And today we consider a conference report which reflects all \nthese influences and effectively balances the current national security \nrequirements of our country with an eye toward the future needs of our \nmilitary.\n  Broadly speaking, the Defense Authorization report we adopt today \nproperly places the fighting men and women of this country at the heart \nof our military priorities. It increases pay, extends special pay and \nbonus programs to facilitate troop retention and it begins to address \nthe housing, health care and educational needs of troops and their \nfamilies. In addition this report extends retirement benefits \nincluding, most notably, the TRICARE-for-life program which will \nprovide a prescription drug benefit and reduce out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses for our Medicare-eligible military retirees--making a lifetime \nhealth care commitment to our fighting men and women. Taken as a whole, \nthis report is a significant step in the right direction.\n  This conference agreement will ensure that the United States remains \nthe world's preeminent superpower well into the 21st century. The \nreport authorizes $38.9 billion for research, development, training and \nevaluation, including $4.8 billion for Ballistic Missile Defense, \nensuring that we remain the most technologically advanced fighting \nforce in the world and enabling our country to pursue a policy that \nwill provide the greatest level of security in an ever-changing global \nenvironment.\n  I am proud of the central role Connecticut has earned when it comes \nto providing the men and women of our armed forces with the cutting \nedge in military equipment. I feel this conference report reflects that \ncontinued preeminence.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, today is the 100th anniversary of \nthe commissioning of the U.S.S. Holland, the United States Navy's first \nsubmarine. Today we mark 100 years of submarine operations by the \nUnited States Navy. I feel it is altogether appropriate that the \nCongress christen the next 100 years of submarine operations with a \n21st century new attack submarine, the Virginia Class. It will be the \nmost capable and most cost effective submarine class ever built.\n  Therefore, I commend the conferees for recognizing the growing need \nfor, and expanding role of, our submarine force by authorizing the \nblock buy of five New Attack Submarines, including $1.7 billion in \nfiscal year 2001 for a new Virginia Class submarine. I am proud to have \nthe U.S.S. Virginia, the first of its class, taking shape in \nConnecticut today. The commitment we make here today will continue this \nessential program for years to come.\n  It is also encouraging that further planning and study for another \ninnovative program, the conversion of four Trident submarines into \nguided missile submarines, remains a national priority, having been \nauthorized for $37 million.\n  Further, in response to a force level requirement report produced \nearlier this year by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this conference report \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on how our \ncountry might maintain at least 55 fast attack submarines through 2015. \nI fully support this initiative.\n  The H-60 helicopter platform is once again recognized in this report \nfor its unique versatility and combat-proven track record of \nsurvivability and performance. The agreement authorizes $206 million \nfor 16 UH-60Ls and two UH-60Qs, and $280 million for 17 CH-60s. With \nrespect to the demonstrated need of our armed forces, this \nauthorization level represents an appropriate increase over the 21 \nhelicopters requested by the Administration.\n  The conference agreement also authorizes $310 million for F-15 engine \nupgrades and $305 million for F-16 engine upgrades. This will extend \nthe life and improve the performance of these vital air supremacy \nassets.\n  The New London Submarine Base is authorized to receive $3.1 million \nfor much needed dry-dock construction which will enhance the base's \nability to service and maintain our fighting force.\n  I might also mention a number of other authorizations which are \ncontained in this conference report, including for the C-17 cargo \naircraft program, the JPATS program, the Joint STARS ground \nsurveillance aircraft program, the Comanche helicopter development \nprogram, the F-22 fighter engineering and development program and the \nongoing, but slowed, Joint Strike Fighter development. All of these \nimportant national security priorities will draw upon the ingenuity and \nstrength of the citizens of Connecticut.\n  I would also like to note the language in this conference report that \nwill convey the national defense reserve fleet vessel Glacier to the \nGlacier Society of Bridgeport. The ship will be refurbished and docked \nin Bridgeport Harbor, becoming a museum to educate students and the \ngeneral public about military service and the exploration of the North \nand South Poles. One of only a few ships to have served under both the \nU.S. Navy and the Coast Guard, the icebreaker Glacier made 39 trips to \nthe North and South poles, including the deepest penetration of the of \nthe Antarctic by sea in 1961. The Glacier will become a valuable civic \nasset for Bridgeport, and I am pleased to see the inclusion of this \nprovision in the report.\n  And finally, I would like to take a moment to comment about one last \nprovision. Senator DeWine and I worked on the Firefighter Investment \nand Response Enhancement, FIRE, Act, which was designed to help reduce \ninjuries among firefighters across the country. The original House \nversion of the bill had previously been introduced by Congressman Bill \nPascrell, Jr. of New Jersey. Senator DeWine and I worked hard to move \nthe FIRE Act and we were pleased when Chairman Warner and Senator Levin \nagreed to accept the FIRE Act as an amendment to the DOD Authorization \nbill.\n  Our original amendment has been modified by the Conference Committee, \nbut the FIRE provision offered here today as part of this Conference \nReport authorizes more than $460 million dollars worth of federal \nassistance to local fire departments and for related research. This \nlegislation represents a major step in developing an effective \npartnership between the Federal government and the men and women who \nevery day put their lives on the line to protect Americans from all \nsorts of man-made and natural disasters.\n  The FIRE Act, is designed to provide local fire departments with the \nresources they need to keep firefighter safe and to protect the public. \nThe bill is modeled on the very successful ``COPS'' program, which has \nhelped towns and cities hire tens of thousands of police officers and \nto buy equipment to protect lives and property from crime. Now, under \nthe FIRE Act the federal government will make a similar commitment to \nhelp protect lives and property from the ravages of fire, chemical \nspills, accidents, and natural disasters.\n  Each day, a million U.S. firefighters put their lives on the line to \nprotect our families, our homes, and our businesses. Unfortunately, \nunder the current funding regime, these unselfish men and women aren't \nalways as well-equipped as they should be.\n  And in many ways the problems are getting worse. As our population \ngrows, as our buildings and infrastructure age, as our suburbs expand \nand our highways and waterways become more congested, our firefighters \nand emergency medical technicians are being\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\nasked to respond to an increasing number and variety of dangerous \nsituations.\n  There is a bright side, as well. Technology has kept pace with the \nincreasing demands. We now have high-tech equipment, like thermal-\nimaging devices, that allow firefighters to see inside a building \nwithout going into the blaze. And modern science has produced \nincredible materials that can be integrated into protective gear that \ncan shield firefighters from heat and falling debris. Unfortunately, \ntechnology is not cheap. And local governments are seldom able to fund \nthe purchase of all of the wonderful tools becoming available.\n  There is a gap--a widening gap--between the leading edge of modern \ntechnology and our ability to put that technology to work to protect \nthe public and our firefighters. I believe the Federal Government has \nan obligation to bridge the gap and help ensure that local firefighters \nhave the financial resources they need to protect the public.\n  We can't eliminate all of the dangers that confront firefighters, but \nwe can at least ensure that our local fire companies have up-to-date, \nsafe and reliable equipment and today we are doing something about the \nproblem.\n  By passing the FIRE Act today, Congress is saying to every \nfirefighter in America: ``We have taken you for granted for too long. \nWe won't ignore your needs any longer. We stand with you and we are \ncommitted to working together to ensure that America is as safe and as \nprepared for any catastrophe as it can be.''\n  Passage of the FIRE Act has been one of my highest legislative \npriorities this year. I want to thank Senator Warner, Senator Levin, \nand Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and, of course, Senator DeWine \nfor their vigilance and commitment on this most important issue. I also \nwant to thank the experts at the National Safe Kids Campaign, \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, International Association \nof Fire Chiefs, National Volunteer Fire Council, International \nAssociation of Arson Investigators, International Society of Fire \nService Instructors, the National Fire Protection Association, and The \nSafety Equipment Association for all of the assistance and insight they \nhave provided over the course of the last year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today's final passage of the Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report is a significant achievement. It \nfulfills past commitments, provides the necessary funds for our present \nobligations, and makes significant investments toward a secure future. \nI want to commend Senator Warner and Senator Levin for the tremendous \njob they have done providing for our national defense. This bill \nauthorizes $310 billion for the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy's defense related activities. This is $4.5 billion \nmore than requested by President Clinton, and represents the first real \nincrease in defense spending in 14 years.\n  One provision in the Defense Authorization bill of particular \nimportance to the people of Missouri is that of military retiree health \ncare. For generations, our military's career men and women have \ndedicated their lives to the protection of freedom and prosperity in \nAmerica. One of the promises this country made to these men and women \nwas a pledge that career members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, \nand dependents would have health care benefits on active duty and in \nretirement. While these benefits were not authorized by Congress, they \nwere promised by the United States government, specifically, by the \nDepartment of Defense and its recruiters. Promises made need to be \nkept. Career members of the Armed Forces acted in good faith and relied \non the statements of their government's representatives.\n  Mr. President, until recently, military retirees were provided with \nhealth care in military facilities here and abroad. However, due to \nmajor changes in the military health care program, multiple base \nclosings, and a risky downsizing of the military by the current \nAdministration, too many military retirees have been shut out of \nmilitary facilities. Many have sought Medicare coverage or private \ninsurance, or have been forced to do without access to care. In \nMissouri, where we have 76,439 military retirees, retiree family \nmembers, and survivors, this is a significant problem. Although we are \nfortunate to have Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base close \nat hand in Missouri, and Scott Air Force Base in Illinois and Fort \nLeavenworth, Kansas, both nearby, many military retirees in Missouri \nhave told me that it is virtually impossible to get an appointment at \nthese bases for a routine physical, let alone for critical care. It is \nclear that Washington is not keeping its promise to these patriotic men \nand women.\n  Through the strong and dedicated leadership of Senator Warner, \nAmerica's military retirees will again have access to quality health \ncare, as promised. This Defense authorization bill includes a provision \nto expand the popular TRICARE Senior Prime demonstration project. It \neliminates the current restrictions that require military retirees to \nlose their military health care benefits under the CHAMPUS and TRICARE \nprograms after they reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare. \nMilitary retirees will not be able to receive TRICARE Senior Prime, or \n``TRICARE-for-life''--an HMO-type coverage plan for retirees that \nincludes partial payment of the costs from Medicare. This program will \nfinally ensure that all military retirees have access to quality health \ncare throughout their life. This bill will also establish a military \nhealth care trust fund to ensure that retiree health care remains \nsolvent for years to come. This valuable retiree health care provision \nis endorsed by most of the major veteran and military retiree \norganizations, and I support its inclusion in this legislation.\n  In addition to ``TRICARE-for-life,'' the Defense Authorization bill \nalso extends to military retirees access to prescription drugs, by \nrestoring the full DoD Prescription drug benefit, including mail order \nand retail pharmacy, to all Medicare-eligible uniformed services \nbeneficiaries.\n  These break-through provisions for military retirees are not the only \nimportant provisions of the Defense Authorization bill. This bill \nincludes several critical active-duty provisions including measures to \nbring our military families off the food-stamp roles, provide a well-\ndeserved 3.7% pay increase, and eliminates the statutory requirement \nthat service-members incur out-of-pocket housing costs, thus permitting \nthe Deputy of Defense to increase housing allowances immediately. This \nwill eliminate out-of-pocket cost for housing by October 1, 2004.\n  This bill also makes significant progress towards ensuring a strong \ndefense for our country in the years to come. The legislation includes \nauthorizations for additional F-15s and a new Extended-Range Cruise \nMissiles, as well as provides $63 billion dollars for other new weapons \nprocurements. Furthermore, the bill provides an additional $1 billion \nin funding for key readiness accounts. These amounts are necessary to \nensure our military is not only ready to fight today, but will remain \nready for any challenges our country may face in the future.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Warner for his leadership in the area \nof national defense. I urge the Senate to support this bill, and to \nsupport our men and women in uniform, especially those who gave their \nlives in service today on the U.S.S. Cole, in far away Yemen. We extend \nour thoughts and prayers to their families and friends.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes at this time to \nspeak on the events occurring in the world today.\n  I stand here with the melancholy that any Senator would feel as a \nresult of the loss of lives of our U.S. military men and women due to a \ndespicable act of terrorism.\n  I say to the terrorists: You underestimate the United States. Right \nnow we are in an orderly constitutional process to begin the transition \nof the executive branch to a new leader. Do not think because we are \nbeginning a transition that we are weak.\n  I say to the terrorists anywhere in the world: When any American is \nunder attack, all Americans are under attack. We will check our party \nhats at the door. We will be united as one nation. I believe the \nCongress and the American people will stand as one behind President \nClinton to aggressively pursue and punish the terrorists who have \nengaged in this despicable act. You might have gotten away with this \none, but do not think again about the next hour, the next day, or the \nnext week. The United States of America is coming after you, and we are \nall together on this.\n  In addition, to our friends in the Middle East: We are deeply \ntroubled by the violence that is ongoing. A peace agreement was within \nreach. Indeed, it was fragile. We say now, please, take a timeout, end \nthe violence, let's step back to see if we cannot come forward under \nthe leadership of the United States as an honest broker to move ahead. \nWe are plunging into chaos. Chaos only means further retreat. It means \nthat maybe for years violence will continue.\n  We say: Please, Mr. Arafat, do not work behind the scenes; work on \nthe front lines; end your violence.\n  To the people of Israel: We know that the first act is the act of \nself-defense. We understand that. It is human. Please, we ask \nrestraint, and we ask all to come back to the bargaining table. Let's \nput down the stones. Let's put down the guns. Let's see if we can move \nforward.\n  I come back to what has occurred on the Senate floor today. I say to \npeople\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\naround the world: This is democracy. Good people who have been good \nfriends differ. We can conduct ourselves with civility. We can have \nintellectual arguments. We can quote our lawyers and our National \nAcademy of Sciences, and so on. Ultimately, the Congress will work its \nwill. This is democracy. We invite the whole world to participate in \nit. War only leads to more war. Violence only leads to more violence. \nBut democracy leads to more democracy, and democracy means ultimately \npeace and prosperity.\n  We invite the world: Please, constitutional governments, treaties, \nrules of law are what this 21st century should be all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for her \nvery eloquent statement. I know she and others and all of us extend our \ndeepest sympathies to the families, the loved ones of those sailors who \nwere killed in the cowardly act in the Gulf of Aden today. The cause of \npeace and international security is one that is worth a major effort, \nand it is not without sacrifices, as we saw today.\n  I share the concerns and I share the strong commitment that we shall \ndo everything in our power to identify the people behind this cowardly \ndeed and take appropriate responsive action. We do not intend as a \ndemocracy committed to freedom and human rights to be deterred from our \ncontinuing efforts by these acts of terrorism. These do nothing but \nbring sorrow and heartache to the families and loved ones left behind, \nand they strengthen the will of the rest of us to say that we will not \nbow to the terrorists acts. They will not deter us. They only \nstrengthen us not only in our prayers for those who have given the \nultimate sacrifice but in our commitment to ensure it does not deter \nour activities.\n\n\n              A Tragic Act of Terrorism on the U.s.s. Cole\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are all now aware of a terrible \ntragedy, an act of despicable terrorism has taken place on the U.S.S. \nCole and American lives have been lost.\n  All of us are appalled. On behalf of all of us, our thoughts and \nprayers go out to the family members of those on the U.S.S. Cole. We \nhope we can get all the information as quickly as possible.\n  The United States has the ability to find out who perpetrated this \noutrage. We will find those people. There will be a heavy price to pay. \nWe cannot allow these kinds of acts of terror to take place. I am \nconfident the President of the United States will ascertain who these \nindividuals and organizations are, and the heaviest price must be paid \nfor this outrage. In the meantime, our thoughts, hopes, and prayers go \nout to those who were injured, those missing in action, and those \nkilled in this tragedy.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, let me concur with the remarks of my \ncolleague, Senator McCain. I join him in expressing concern for those \nfamilies who have lost Americans in connection with the terrorist \nattack on the U.S.S. Cole.\n  I call upon my colleagues who are holding up my antiterrorism \nlegislation to stop holding up this important piece of legislation and \nallow us to get it passed this year and sent to the President for his \nsignature. The National Terrorism Commission made some very important \nrecommendations about how we should deal with terrorists attacks, and \nthe only response has been the legislation that Senator Feinstein and I \nhave proposed. I hope those who are holding this legislation as a \nresult of this attack will recognize we can't wait for the next \nterrorism attack. We need to act now.\n\n\n                          Middle East Tensions\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my heart is so heavy this morning as we \nlearn of the increasing tensions in the Middle East.\n  I join my friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, in expressing our \ncondolences to those American families who are grieving at the loss of \ntheir children by an unprovoked attack on one of our ships off the \ncoast of Yemen. We are not exactly sure who did this. We suspect that \nit was terrorism.\n  But, as Senator McCain said on one of the shows this morning as I \nlistened to him, we will find out, and we will respond. The world \nshould make no mistake about that.\n  This morning I also want to call on Yasser Arafat to take control of \nthe situation in the Middle East. There has been an incident where four \nIsraeli soldiers were in Ramallah--the Israelis say that they had taken \na wrong turn. They certainly weren't provoking anything. They were \ncaptured, and taken to the Palestinian authorities and to a detention \ncenter. Then a mob overtook the center and killed at least two of them. \nThe reports vary. One report I heard said there was a lynching. I don't \nknow that is accurate, but one report said that. You have now no rule \nof law. It is very difficult to negotiate a peace agreement when there \nis no rule of law on one side of the equation.\n  I had been closely following this. I was very hopeful yesterday. \nThings looked as if they were going in a better direction. The word was \nthat Yasser Arafat was, in fact, calming his people down. But it is \ntime for him to do this now publicly. It is one thing to quietly work \nbehind the scenes; it is another thing to come out publicly and say \nenough of mob rule.\n  As I say, I come here with a very heavy heart, but always hopeful \nthat the goodness in people will overcome everything else.\n  My heart is with the American families who will be grieving. My heart \nis with all the families in the Middle East who are suffering so much.\n  I believe Dwight Eisenhower once said--I may stand corrected--that \npeople want peace so much that one of these days governments had better \nget out of the way and let them have it. I think people want peace. The \nvast majority of people want peace. How tragic it is that we can't seem \nto grasp that.\n  I praise President Clinton and Vice President Gore for doing \neverything they can. I give them my best. I offer myself as someone who \nwill do what I can. I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. This is an \narea that we know is always a tinderbox. Yet we have faith that the \npeace process can get back on track.\n\n\n                Breakdown of Camp David Peace Proposals\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the news from the Middle East is deeply \npainful to all who pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Three months ago at \nCamp David the State of Israel offered the Palestine Authority \nunprecedented concessions in an effort to end the cycle of violence and \nhatred. The rejection of these proposals has tragically led to the loss \nof numerous lives and the resumption of the cycle of violence and \nhatred. Our Government must tell the Palestinian leadership that the \ndestruction of holy sites and mob violence have no place in civilized \nsociety.\n\n\n                       Events in the Middle East\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer my sincere condolences \nto the families of the U.S. Navy personnel killed in what appears to \nhave been a terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and to express my \noutrage at this cowardly act of murder. This deplorable incident is a \ntragic reminder of the risk and sacrifice assumed by all of our men and \nwomen in uniform, and by their families. I know that the administration \nwill be using all of the resources at its disposal to discern who is \nresponsible for the attack, and that the U.S. will resolutely take \nappropriate action in response to this incident.\n  My certainty about that last point is based on a simple and \nirrefutable truth. No country would stand by while its soldiers and \nsailors are targeted and killed. The U.S. will certainly not stand for \nit and will not be intimidated in the wake of the cowardly attack on \nthe Cole. By the same token, it should surprise no one that Israel \nretaliated in response to the brutal murder of Israeli soldiers at the \nhands of a mob in Ramallah.\n  But as difficult as it is, as raw as emotions are right now, we \ncannot afford to lose sight of one fundamental fact. All of us--we \nAmericans, the rest of the international community, the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians--know that there is no military solution to the \nterribly difficult issues that have made the Middle East a region of \ntension and violence for far too long. In recent days the promise of \npeace has been obscured by terrible violence in Jerusalem and \nelsewhere. Nearly 100 lives have been lost, including the lives of \nchildren. For the Israeli and Palestinian children who remain, in the \nname of providing them a future free from these horrors, I hope that \nthe Israeli and Palestinian people will find\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nthe courage and the strength to stop the violence, and that they will \nfind their way back on a path toward peace.\n\n\n                          situation in israel\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the United States commitment to Israel is \nstrong. It has stood the test of time, and has only strengthened. It is \nstrong because it is grounded in our shared principles of freedom and \ndemocracy. It is also strong because we respect and appreciate Israel's \ncommitment to preserve and protect those religious sites considered by \nall people of the world to be holy.\n  I am very disturbed over recent events in the Middle East. America's \nresponse to Israel must be clear and reflect our total support. What we \nare witnessing is not, as it is often called, an ``outbreak of \nviolence.'' What we are witnessing is a concerted attack against \nIsrael; and this is occurring on the heels of the Israeli government \ntaking the most conciliatory stance ever toward the Palestinians.\n  After the Camp David summit, President Clinton correctly blamed \nPalestinian Authority Chairman Yassir Arafat for rejecting the \ncompromises that Israel was willing to consider. Since Camp David, \nArafat has compounded his rejection of peace proposals with an embrace \nof violence. The United States must maintain its pressure on Arafat and \nthe Palestinian leadership, and avoid retreating into the moral swamp \nof ``evenhandedness.'' We must stand with Israel.\n  I am deeply disappointed in the shameful U.S. abstention on a UN \nSecurity Council resolution that our own ambassador called \n``unbalanced, biased, and really a lousy piece of work.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Jerusalem Post \neditorial of October 10, 2000 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Jerusalem Post News & Feature Service, Oct. 10, 2000]\n\n                          Betrayal At The U.N.\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       The United States made a grave mistake in failing to veto \n     what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called a ``one-\n     sided'' U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. \n     The U.S. abstention was a mistake, despite the three \n     seemingly cogent arguments used to explain it: that a worse \n     resolution was blocked, that Israel was consulted all along, \n     and that ``U.S. interests'' dictated the move.\n       The U.N. resolution deplored ``the provocation carried out \n     at al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem on 28 September 2000, and \n     the subsequent violence there and at other holy places, as \n     well as in other areas throughout the territories occupied by \n     Israel since 1967, resulting in over 80 Palestinian deaths \n     and many other casualties.'' The resolution, which passed 14 \n     to 0 with the U.S. abstaining, also condemned ``acts of \n     violence, especially the excessive use of force against \n     Palestinians.'' An innocent observer reading the resolution \n     might reasonably conclude the Palestinians were quietly \n     minding their own business when, out of the blue, Israeli \n     forces decided to throw seven years of talks out the window \n     and attack their negotiating partners. The opposite is the \n     case.\n       After weeks of official Palestinian broadcasts encouraging \n     violence and lionizing martyrs, and after attacks against \n     Israelis in which both soldiers and civilians were killed, \n     Yasser Arafat took advantage of Likud leader Ariel Sharon's \n     visit to the Temple Mount to turn the flames on full burner.\n       In any case, the twisted nature of the resolution is not at \n     issue--U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard \n     Holbrooke called it ``unbalanced, biased, and really a lousy \n     piece of work.'' This recognition begs the question, which \n     was leveled at Albright and Holbrooke repeatedly over the \n     weekend: If the resolution was so lousy, why did the U.S. not \n     exercise its right to veto?\n       Standard answer No. 1--that a worse resolution was \n     blocked--does not wash, because it is a truism. The Arab \n     lobby at the United Nations always asks for the moon, in the \n     hopes of passing a slightly less outrageous version after \n     negotiations. According to Holbrooke, the U.S. would have \n     vetoed an ``operational'' resolution, but it could oppose \n     what was watered down to ``just empty rhetoric.'' Far from \n     ``empty,'' the Security Council resolution was exactly what \n     Arafat needed: an international judgment saddling the blame \n     for his attack against Israel squarely on Israel's shoulders. \n     Now the international commission of inquiry that Arafat \n     fought for in Paris is redundant. The inquiry is over and the \n     verdict is in: Israel is guilty.\n       The next line of defense used by Albright and Holbrooke was \n     that Israel was closely consulted and ``understood'' the U.S. \n     position. That the Israeli government ``understood'' this \n     failure of American will and judgment is itself unfortunate, \n     but in no way excuses U.S. behavior.\n       Having taken every ``risk for peace'' expected by the U.S. \n     and more, Israel is now a victim of U.S. weakness, even \n     betrayal. As a tactical matter, Israel may have had to choose \n     its battles with the U.S., and therefore decided not to more \n     openly resist the U.S. position. But an Israel under siege \n     should not have been forced into giving the U.S. a pass in \n     the Security Council, one of the few arenas where the U.S. \n     has a decisive voice.\n       Albright argues that ``our role in the Middle East is to \n     try to be the negotiator, the mediator, the honest broker.'' \n     Could Albright mean that the U.S. must be an `honest broker' \n     in the face of a wholesale attack by the party that has \n     rejected their peace proposals on the party that accepted \n     them? An ``honest broker'' that cannot differentiate between \n     aggressor and victim is not doing the peace process any \n     favors. An ``honest broker'' role makes sense in the context \n     of negotiations, not when the negotiating track has been \n     unilaterally tossed out the window by one party.\n       Finally, Albright alludes to America's ``larger \n     responsibilities within the whole region''' in explaining the \n     U.S. abstention. This is veiled allusion to the risk of riots \n     against American embassies and relations with the Arab world, \n     but again the logic is backwards and dangerous.\n       A U.S. veto would have signaled to Arafat and the Arab \n     world that this round of blaming the victim is over. Now \n     Arafat, Hizbullah, Saddam Hussein (who just called again for \n     Israel's destruction), and anyone else who wants to jump on \n     the absurd bandwagon that Israel is threatening al-Aksa \n     Mosque can see that Israel's great ally, the United States, \n     is unwilling to come to her defense. This can only be bad for \n     Israel, bad for the United States, and bad for peace.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we must speak the truth and stand on \nprinciple, so that Arafat cannot continue blaming Israel for the \ncompletely unjustified attack that he initiated. There is a word for a \npolicy of rewarding violence, and that word is ``appeasement.''\n\n  Appeasement is not just wrong; it also does not work. Events of \nrecent days have led many Israelis to conclude that their government's \ngenerosity toward the Palestinians has--far from being reciprocated--\nbeen taken as weakness and invited the beating of war drums against \nIsrael throughout the Arab world.\n  As Israel begins to rethink its course, the United States must not \npush Israel towards appeasement. We must help Israel find the strength \nto stand up to aggression and continue the principled fight for \njustice.\n  As citizens of a democracy that desperately wants peace, Israelis are \nas pained as anyone by the heart-wrenching pictures of Palestinian \nchildren caught in the crossfire. Israel can be counted on to search \nits soul as to whether she could have defended herself and claimed \nfewer Palestinian casualties. The result of such an inquiry, however, \nwill not shift the overarching burden of responsibility from the party \nthat chose to abandon the negotiating table and open a shooting war--\nPalestinian leader Yassir Arafat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Natan \nSharansky in today's Washington Post appear in the Record immediately \nfollowing my statement.\n  Now is the time for us to publicly reaffirm our commitment to the \nfreedom-seeking people of Israel. During Israel's time of need, we know \nthat they will make the right choices--take the right actions for peace \nwith freedom. And we will stand with Israel.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 12, 2000]\n\n                          Afraid of the Truth\n\n                          (By Natan Sharansky)\n\n       Jerusalem.--Nearly 20 years ago, confined to an eight-by-\n     ten cell in a prison on the border of Siberia, I was granted \n     by my Soviet jailers the ``privilege'' of reading the latest \n     copy of Pravda, official mouthpiece of the Communist regime. \n     Splashed across the front page was a condemnation of Ronald \n     Reagan for having the temerity to call the Soviet Union an \n     ``evil empire.''\n       Tapping on walls and talking through toilets, prisoners \n     quickly spread the word of Reagan's ``provocation'' \n     throughout the prison. The dissidents were ecstatic. Finally, \n     the leader of the free world had spoken the truth--a truth \n     that burned inside the heart of each and every one of us.\n       For decades, with few exceptions, the moral authority of \n     the Soviet Union had rarely been challenged. Some, \n     particularly those who saw in communism's egalitarian ideals \n     the antidote to all the ills of capitalism and democracy, \n     were simply duped by a totalitarian society that could so \n     easily manipulate the picture it presented to the outside \n     world.\n       But sadly, most were not blind to the truth--they were just \n     frightened by it. They understood what the Soviet Union \n     represented but, knowing the price of confrontation, \n     preferred to close their eyes to it.\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\n     Rationalizing their cowardice with morally comforting words \n     such as ``peace'' and ``co-existence,'' they pursued the path \n     of appeasement.\n       Today the nations of the free world also prefer to close \n     their eyes to the truth in the Middle East in general and the \n     Arab-Israeli conflict in particular. While in practice the \n     Arab states do not pose the threat of a belligerent \n     superpower, the West's attitude toward these authoritarian \n     regimes is all too familiar. Some, who see Palestinian stone \n     throwers as David to Israel's Goliath, are again duped by the \n     manipulations of a brutal dictator who sends children to the \n     front lines to achieve through tragedy what he cannot achieve \n     through diplomacy.\n       But most people are not so easily duped. They simply choose \n     to blindfold themselves rather than confront a discomforting \n     truth. Instead of pressuring Arab tyrants to free their own \n     peoples from the yoke of oppression, the West prefers to view \n     them as a ``stabilizing'' force.\n       When the peace process began, Israel and the West had a \n     remarkable opportunity to use their influence to ensure that \n     the emerging Palestinian society could evolve into a liberal, \n     democratic state. Instead they spent the better part of 10 \n     years subsidizing tyranny.\n       The goal was to strengthen Yasser Arafat and his PLO, \n     supposedly a force for modernization and compromise. With his \n     40,000-man armed police force, Arafat was supposed to serve \n     as Israel's proxy in the war on terror, and would do it, as \n     the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin said, ``without a \n     Supreme Court, without human rights organizations and without \n     bleeding-heart liberals.''\n       This policy, support by the West, was not designed to solve \n     a genuine Palestinian human rights problem but to export it.\n       In the past two weeks we have seen the consequences of this \n     folly. The man who promised at Oslo to renounce the violent \n     struggle against the Jewish state once again uses violence as \n     an instrument of negotiation. His police have turned their \n     guns against the state that armed them, while his kangaroo \n     courts have released dozens of Hamas terrorists drenched with \n     the blood of his ``partner'' in peace.\n       Needing an external enemy to justify internal repression, \n     he continues to incite against Israel. With new textbooks \n     depicting a map of Palestine that stretches from the \n     Mediterranean to the Dead Sea but does not include a Jewish \n     state, he is educating the next generation of Palestinians \n     that they will soon take up arms in a holy jihad.\n       In response to all this, the world can summon sufficient \n     courage only to condemn a democratic Israel for defending \n     itself against enemies within and without who seek its \n     destruction. It is assailed for provoking the Palestinians by \n     visiting our people's holiest site, when the real provocation \n     is not our sovereignty over a Temple Mount that is the soul \n     of the Jewish people but our sovereignty, period.\n       No doubt a government that is prepared to make far-reaching \n     and dangerous concessions will soon be pressed to make more, \n     so that the free states can remain safely behind their \n     blindfolds. The only free state in this vast region to \n     tyranny will be asked to concede more in the name of \n     ``peace'' and ``coexistence'' to an Arab world that wants \n     nothing of the sort.\n       Thirty years ago, Democratic Sen. Henry Jackson of \n     Washington state courageously stood against the bipartisan \n     forces of appeasement and issued a moral challenge to an \n     immoral state. By speaking the same truth a decade later, \n     Republican President Ronald Reagan helped free hundreds of \n     millions of people around the world, and sparked a democratic \n     flame that continues to engulf and threaten tyrannies. Who \n     will speak the truth today and allow freedom to reach this \n     region where only one nation carries its torch?\n       The writer, a former Soviet dissident, is a member of the \n     Israeli parliament and formerly served as interior minister \n     in the Barak government.\n\n\n                      current situation in israel\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, over the past two weeks, the Middle East \nhas been in a state of grave turmoil and violence. With almost 100 \npeople reported dead, Israel is dangerously close to internal war \nbetween the Jews and Palestinians. Even this morning, two Israeli \nsoldiers were brutally murdered in Ramallah in connection with this \nongoing violence. Although there are some reports of a decrease in \nviolence, this conflict demonstrates how complex and difficult it will \nbe to have real peace for the people of the Middle East.\n  Throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and even Arab towns inside \nIsrael proper, Palestinians have taken to the streets. They are \ndemanding Israeli capitulation and withdrawal of Israel troops from \nArab regions. Although the Palestinian Authority has claimed that the \nflashpoint for the violence was a visit to the Temple Mount by Israeli \npolitical leader Ariel Sharon, the violence's widespread and intense \nnature of the violence, along with Palestinian reaction, indicates that \nthe violence may not be a simple and uncoordinated reaction.\n  Since the initial incident, the violence has rapidly spread with \nincredible fervor. According to published reports, ``The internal riots \nstunned Israeli police officials by their size and intensity.'' A \nsimple incident was radically and almost instantaneously transformed \ninto a dire situation that threatens the entire Middle East peace \nprocess. Although this outrageous reaction may appear isolated, Mr. \nArafat has threatened over the years to cross out the peace accords and \nunleash a new uprising against Israel. He has often described the peace \naccords as simply a temporary truce.\n  Mr. Arafat's response to the recent situation raises many concerns. \nIt appears he has done little to nothing to quell the violence. The \nPalestinian Authority's official media arm, the Palestinian \nBroadcasting Corporation, has consistently broadcast incitement against \nIsrael, including a children's program where martyrdom as ``suicide \nwarriors'' is glorified. Palestinian television is also running a story \nabout an alleged brutal killing of a Palestinian by Jewish settlers. \nThe audience is told that the 40-year-old man's skull was crushed, his \nbones broken and his body burned by the settlers. Pictures of a charred \nand mutilated body are being used continually to incite already \ncombative protesters and mourners. Although Israeli officials have \nstated that the man, Isam Hamad, 36, died in a car crash north of \nRamallah and that the Palestinians chose to exploit the terrible \ncondition of his body, Palestinian officials have refused to \ninvestigate the real cause of death and instead some have stated that \nthe killing justifies an ``open season on settlers.''\n  Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian cabinet minister, told the Reuters News \nService that, ``The settlers must now be a target by every Palestinian \nin order to stop their terrorism and they must be uprooted from our \nPalestinian occupied lands.'' These are not the words of a leadership \nthat wants peace.\n  Mr. President, we must continually remember that Israel is in one of \nthe most dangerous and unstable regions of the world. Since the \nbeginning of the Oslo process in 1993, Israel has lost more than 280 of \nits citizens to terrorist violence (a portion of the Israeli population \ncomparable to 15,000 Americans) in over 1,000 terrorist attacks. That \ndeath toll is worse than in the 15 years prior to Oslo. Rather than \neradicate terrorist infrastructure in Palestinian territory, the \nPalestinian Authority apparently has maintained its revolving door \npolicy in detaining terrorists. Over 20 prominent terrorists have been \nreleased since President Clinton's visit to Gaza in December 1998. \nIsraeli reaction to violence must be seen in this context.\n  During this current situation, President Clinton has failed to stand \nfirm with our long-time friend and ally, Israel. Although I appreciate \nthe President's interest in bringing about peace in the Middle East, \nhis desire to play the role of the ``honest broker'' is sadly \nmisguided. Until Mr. Arafat begins to demonstrate otherwise, it appears \nclear that the Palestinian Authority is simply not an ``honest \nplayer''.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stand with Israel in the effort to find \nreal and lasting peace. We must continue to work with our friends and \nallies around the world, including moderate Arab countries, to bring \nthe Palestinian Authority into line with appropriate international \nbehavior that will contribute to the process of peace, not to war. I \ncall on Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat to honestly work \ntowards an end to this latest violence and come back to the negotiating \ntable with the goal of reaching a workable and lasting peace.\n\n\n                          middle east tragedy\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, there is a tragedy ongoing in the \nMiddle East, and the first thing I want to do is express heartfelt \nsorrow for the families of those who have lost their lives.\n  The events of the last two weeks are deeply disturbing, and the clear \nfirst step is to find a way to calm the violence. The onus is on Yasser \nArafat and the Palestinian Authority to call a cease fire. If the \nPalestinian leadership and the Palestinian people are in the midst of a \nquest for a state, and are trying to prove they have the maturity to \nlead more than a terrorist organization, the moment of truth has come\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nand gone. What many have long suspected about the Palestinian \nleadership is being confirmed: They are not committed to peace, they \nare committed to victory.\n  Unfortunately, the reaction of the international community to the \nviolence in the Middle East has only emboldened Yasser Arafat. For \nproof we need look no further than the one-sided, dishonest U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution that passed last weekend. The resolution \nignores the role of the Palestinians in the violence now taking place. \nIt unfairly blames Israel for sparking the violence, forgetting that it \nis the right of any person of any religion to visit the Temple Mount. \nThe United States' failure to veto this resolution is an \nembarrassment--a sell-out of our friends, a sell-out of the peace \nprocess.\n  Arfat insists on an international inquiry into the violence before he \nwill call for its cessation. But is it any wonder that Prime Minister \nBarak is reluctant to accept such an inquiry when the international \ncommunity has ranged itself so clearly on one side. Condemn first and \nask questions later.\n  The actions of Arafat and the Palestinian Authority on the question \nof treatment of holy sites are equally troubling. First, the use of \nAriel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount and the use of that holy site \nto incite violence: How can we believe any commitment to allow access \nto all people of all faiths when the Palestinians believe it is their \nright to sow mayhem after one visit?\n  Second, the sacking of Joseph's Tomb. Palestinian police stood by as \na mob of Palestinians destroyed Joseph's tomb in Nablus--a location \nfrom which Israeli forces had retreated in an attempt to calm the \nsituation. They ripped apart Torah scrolls and desecrated a holy place. \nI have heard it said that the authenticity of the site has been \nquestioned. I can just picture the mob looking for that certificate of \nauthenticity before they went ahead and destroyed a holy book of the \nJews.\n  There is no excuse--no excuse--for the behavior of the Palestinians \nor their leadership. Prime Minister Barak has offered concessions \npreviously through taboo by most Israelis. Chairman Arafat has \nresponded by demanding yet more and using violence to get it when \nnegotiations failed. He has broken every agreement made in the past \nmonths and years, and has released dozens of notorious Hamas and \nIslamic Jihad terrorists in recent days. Perhaps Israel's intensified \nreaction following the mob killing of three Israeli soldiers will \nconvince Arafat that he cannot win with violence. But I wonder.\n  And for the United States, being an honest broker does not necesitate \nour staying neutral. It should mean embracing a policy of honesty and \ntelling one side when enough is enough. Instead, the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration has shied away from the kind of frankness needed from \nour nation, and has stood aside in the face of an international \npolitical assault on our most important friend in the Middle East.\n  That lack of resolve is noticed. It has been noticed by those who \ndefy sanctions on Iraq. It has been noticed by the Palestinians. And it \nwas surely noticed by those who attacked the U.S.S.Cole and murdered \nsix, maybe more American servicemen. When will this nation show the \nresolve needed to crush the cowards and criminals who threaten us and \nour allies?\n  I hope that the diplomatic efforts underway can lead to a calming of \nthe situation and that the future will see a lasting peace between \nIsrael and the Palestinians. However, for this peace to be truly \nlasting--and truly be peace--it must come when the parties are ready, \non a timetable agreed by them. More important, it can only come when \nthe Palestinians are ready to take upon themselves the mantle of \nnationhood and abandon their legacy of terrorism.

It takes about 100 chum salmon a \nyear to feed one sled dog.\n  As a result of the fish disaster, an alarming dilemma has confronted \nthe dog mushers. They watch their sled dogs starve or they shoot them. \nNow that is a terrible dilemma. Healthy Alaskan sled dogs ought not to \nlose their lives because of a shortage, but that is the situation that \nwe faced. The alternative to end their misery is not one that a dog \nmusher wants to face. It is totally unacceptable as far as I am \nconcerned. Working with my staff, I have tried to find a solution to \nthis problem.\n  Villages along the Yukon rely upon sled dogs for the transportation \nof goods. Use of sled dogs in rural Alaska is equivalent to the use of \na vehicle in most of our Nation. Today I am able to announce, thanks to \nthe generosity of Jim von der Heydt, executive vice president of \nRalston Purina, 22\\1/2\\ tons of dog food will be donated by that \ncompany to Alaska's Native people from Purina's Iowa plant. It is the \nplant in Clinton, IA.\n  That food is now going to be shipped to Alaska by Lynden Transport \nwith the assistance from the Totem Ocean Trailer Express, which we call \nTOTE, and the Alaska Railroad. I am extremely grateful to Jim Jansen of \nLynden, Robert McGee of TOTE, and our former Governor, Bill Sheffield, \nwho is now the head of the Alaska Railroad, for agreeing to deliver \nthis relief to the dog mushers.\n  The dog food will be distributed to the dog teams by the Alaska \nFederation of Natives. Julie Kitka, the head of the Alaska Federation \nof Natives, has agreed to take on this task. I am grateful for her \nsupport and cooperation.\n  Lastly, let me commend James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA, for his \npersonal assistance in this effort.\n  I think this is good news. I am happy to be here to talk about good \nSamaritans for a change.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10398-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10398-S10399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSPORTATION RECALL ENHANCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND DOCUMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate took an important \nand critical step forward to improve our Nation's motor vehicle safety \nlaws by passing H.R. 5164, the Transportation Recall Enhancement \nAccountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act. The bill is in response \nto the more than 100 deaths associated with defective Bridgestone/\nFirestone tires. During the debate, I intended to include a letter from \nCongressman Bliley, chairman of the House Commerce Committee clarifying \nthe intent of a provision of the bill relating to the ability of the \nDepartment of Transportation to request material from manufacturers. I \nask that the letter be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. The letter makes it clear that the provisions would not enable \nmanufacturers to conceal or destroy information requested by the \nSecretary.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                        Committee on Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: I am writing to clarify the intent of section \n     3(b) of H.R. 5164, the TREAD Act, as passed by the House last \n     night.\n       I understand that there are concerns about the Committee's \n     construction of the amendment to section 31066(m)(4)(B) of \n     title 49, United States Code, relating to the Secretary's \n     ability to request information not in possession of the \n     manufacturer. This provision provides, in relevant part, that \n     the Secretary may not ``require a manufacturer * * * to \n     maintain or submit records respecting information not in the \n     possession of the manufacturer.'' This restriction was not \n     intended to provide manufacturers with an easy way to \n     withhold information from the Secretary by destroying or \n     transferring the possession of records; rather, it is \n     intended to ensure that the Secretary does not promulgate \n     requirements that require the manufacturer to submit \n     information not reasonably within its possession or control.\n       Further, any orchestrated effort to withhold information \n     from the Secretary with the intent to mislead him, whether \n     through\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\n     an intentional ``transfer'' of possession or other method, is \n     precisely the kind of activity that could potentially subject \n     a manufacturer to the criminal penalties under section 4 of \n     the bill. The fundamental purpose of this legislation is to \n     ensure that the Secretary receives the information he needs \n     to identify defects related to motor vehicle safety at the \n     earliest possible opportunity.\n       I hope that you find this explanation helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Bliley,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10399-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10399-S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEED FOR ACTION ON DEBT RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the last days of this Congress, as we \nscramble to compete our work, I am worried that one of the most \nimportant issues before us may slip through the cracks.\n  Last week, I attended an extraordinary meeting at the White House, \nwhere President Clinton called together religious and political leaders \nto discuss the urgent need to provide debt relief for the poorest \ncountries of the world. Looking around the table, it was clear that \nthis was no ordinary issue, no ordinary meeting.\n  Just a partial list of the people in that room speaks volumes about \nthis issue. There were bishops of several denominations, and a rabbi. \nThe Reverend Pat Robertson was there, as was the Reverend Andrew Young. \nDemocratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters was at the table, not far from \nRepublican Congressman Spencer Bachus. A few seats from the President \nhimself sat near the rock star Bono, who has become one of the most \nprominent spokesmen for the cause of debt relief.\n  President Clinton called us together because the need for debt relief \nis great, the logic of debt relief is compelling, and time left for us \nto pass debt relief legislation is alarmingly short. Failure to act now \nwould be nothing less than a failure of the United States to lead what \ncould be the most important international effort to bring the poorest \nnations of the world into a more positive, constructive role in the \nworld economy.\n  Here are the facts, Mr. President. Around the world today, many poor \nnations actually pay more in interest payments to advanced industrial \nnations, and to international development banks, than they do on \nchildhood immunizations, primary education, and other essential \nservices.\n  Tragically, Mr. President, many of these countries are suffering \nthrough an AIDS epidemic that dwarfs any public health crisis the world \nhas ever seen. No responsible person can argue that we have no interest \nin helping such countries fight against communicable diseases that are \njust a jet flight away from our cities. No moral person can argue that \nwe should sit idly by while a continent loses a generation to disease.\n  The debts these countries owe are often the legacy of earlier \ngovernments, propped up by lending that suited the purposes of Cold War \ngeopolitics, but that did precious little for the poorest of the poor \nin those countries. Today, the prospects of repayment by these \ncountries is so small that the loans are now carried on our books at \njust a few cents on the dollar. A sensible business decision--made \nevery day in this country and around the world--is to simply write off \nbad debts, and let both borrower and lender move on.\n  Following that sound economic logic, with the leadership and \ncommitment of the United States, the major creditor nations of the \nworld agreed several years ago to forgive some of the debt owed by the \npoorest of these countries. That program, known as the HIPC \nInitiative--for the ``Highly Indebted Poor Countries''--requires \nsignificant commitments by the poor countries if they are to qualify. \nThey must commit to market-oriented economic reforms, reduce \ncorruption, and use the savings from debt relief for essential poverty \nreduction programs.\n  Already under way in several countries, the HIPC program has achieved \ntangible results--the kind of results we all want to see, and the kind \nof results that will be put at risk if we fail to fully fund our \nparticipation. In Uganda, money saved by debt relief under the HIPC \nprogram has allowed the government to end the fees for primary school \nstudents, fees that had kept enrollment down. Over the last four years, \nprimary school enrollment there virtually doubled. That is what a well-\ndesigned debt relief program can do.\n\n  Because those debts are such a large part of the poor countries' \nincome--often as high as thirty or forty percent--and because those \nsame debts are realistically worth so little to us, a relatively small \nfinancial commitment on our part buys important economic assistance \nmany times over. And because we are the leading economy in the world, \nMr. President, our leverage is even greater. Other nations are waiting \nfor us to act--the only prudent course for creditors working out this \nkind of deal--and that means that our relatively small contribution \nwill trigger a major international initiative.\n  But that leverage works both ways. Without us, the viability of the \nwhole initiative remains in doubt. Our inaction has stalled any further \naction on debt relief in Latin America, and will prevent all but a few \neligible African countries from participating.\n  Something more than sensible, effective foreign policy is at stake \nhere, Mr. President, which brings me back to that extraordinary meeting \nat the White House. The world's religious leaders, from the Pope to \nBilly Graham, in an interfaith, ecumenical unanimity rarely seen on any \nissue, have joined to challenge our nation's conscience. They have \nasked us to face the embarrassing fact that while we talk about \nproviding assistance to the poorest nations--while in fact we do send a \ntiny fraction of our own record income and wealth abroad--at the same \ntime we continue to collect interest payments on those nations' old \ndebts.\n  They have challenged us to follow the Biblical injunction to lift the \nburden of debt, in effect to put our money where we say our values are. \nThey call on us to deal with the least fortunate in the way all of the \nworld's great religions command. Now, when we are enjoying the best \neconomic times in our history, as we stand as the most fortunate of \nnations, surely we can underwrite less than four percent of the overall \ncost of debt relief. That's right, Mr. President: our share is less \nthan four percent of the total cost of the whole HIPC program.\n  For that contribution, we will assure the full implementation of \nnearly 30 billion dollars of debt relief for the poorest 33 countries \nof the world.\n  This program presents us with a powerful combination of economic \nlogic and moral imperative. Here, in the last days and hours of this \nsession of Congress, we must not let this opportunity slip away.\n  Earlier this year, the Foreign Relations Committee passed full \nauthorization of two key funding mechanisms for our participation in \nthe HIPC program. First, we authorized use of the balance of the funds \nmade available through a revaluation of the IMF's gold holdings, to \nprovide them with the resources to finance their share of the debt \nforgiveness--an action that will have no budgetary impact, that will \nnot cost us a dime.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee also authorized the appropriation of \n$600 million for our share, between 2000 and 2003, of the HIPC \ninitiative. Senator Helms, Senator Hagel, and Senator Sarbanes and I \nagreed on a set of conditions that would hold the Administration \naccountable for policies that will promote more focused, better \nmonitored international financial institutions. But we agreed, in the \nend, that the program was too important to impose unworkable conditions \nor to require the kind of delay that could be fatal. It took compromise \nand good faith to achieve that agreement, which was reported out of our \ncommittee unanimously.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to say that those principles must \nguide any final agreement. That means there must be no new, unworkable \ndemands for overhauling international financial institutions like the \nIMF and the World Bank before debt relief can go forward. That will \nrequire the spirit of bipartisan accommodation that we achieved in our \ncommittee.\n  So far the Senate has only appropriated $75 million for debt relief. \nThis is only a place holder for a final amount, now under negotiation. \nThe House has done somewhat better, but is still far short of the mark. \nOne of the problems is that full authorization has not reached the \nSenate floor, where I\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nam confident it would receive overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Right now, as I speak, there is still hope that we can reach an \naccommodation on authorizing language that the Appropriations Committee \nis seeking before it provides the full amount of debt relief needed to \nmake the HIPC program a reality.\n  But time is running out, Mr. President, and we are dangerously close \nto forfeiting our international leadership on this issue. That means \nforfeiting not just our leadership in international financial affairs, \nMr. President. If we fail to provide full funding for our participation \nin the international debt relief effort, we will forfeit something even \nmore valuable: our moral leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE HONORABLE SID YATES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, Sid Yates, former Congressman from Ohio \nand a long-time friend of Indian country passed away last week.\n  I am particularly saddened because in the last 2 years, we have lost \nMorris Thompson, the Alaska Native tribal leader and one of the \ninstrumental leaders in Alaska politics, Dr. Helen Peterson one of the \nfounders of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), and now \nour long-time friend Sid Yates.\n  Indian country is losing far too many friends and most unfortunate is \nthat we seem to be losing more friends than we are gaining.\n  As a Congressman from the State of Ohio with no federally-recognized \nIndian Tribes Sid Yates had no political reason to become the champion \nfor Indian causes that he was known for. His dedication was not part of \nconstituent service and he stood to lose more than he gained from his \nadvocacy. Nonetheless, Sid Yates' commitment and determination to do \nthe right thing never wavered.\n  I am saddened to be making this statement because all who knew or \ncame in contact with Sid Yates were awed by his generous heart and \nhumbled by the patience he showed with his colleagues and with the \npublic--even when they disagreed with him.\n  His patience and focus in the legislative realm were legendary. Sid \nYates started what I believe an appropriate protocol in the House \nSubcommittee by affording every Tribal Leader wishing to come before \nthe subcommittee the brief opportunity to describe the most pressing \nneeds of his or her Tribe.\n  When I came to the House of Representatives in 1986, I became deeply \ninvolved in issues that affect my State of Colorado, natural resource \nissues and of course issues that affect American Indians. In pursuing \nand working on these matters, I worked with Sid Yates time and again \nand benefitted from that association both as a legislator and as a man.\n  Sid Yates also knew when generosity of spirit and patience were not \nthe appropriate response. In the mid 1980's a series of newspaper \narticles appeared in the Arizona Republic that revealed a breathtaking \nlevel of corruption and waste in the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nMillions of dollars were being siphoned off or wasted and were not \ngetting to the Indian beneficiaries as Congress intended.\n  As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, Sid \nYates took bold steps to ensure that this would not happen again and \nlaunched the Tribal Self Governance Demonstration Project. I am proud \nto say that in August the President signed legislation that I sponsored \nin the Senate to make permanent Self Governance in Health Care.\n  The auditorium in the U.S. Department of Interior was appropriately \nnamed the ``Sid Yates Auditorium'' and his name will carry with it the \nkind of dedication and honesty that was his hallmark.\n  It is customary and protocol to add the prefix ``The Honorable'' when \ntalking of elected leaders and if there was ever a man who fulfilled \nthat moniker it was the Honorable Sid Yates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10400-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TAXPAYER PROTECTION AND CONTRACTOR INTEGRITY ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Taxpayer \nProtection and Contractor Integrity Act. This legislation, which was \nintroduced concurrently by Rep. Peter DeFazio in the House, is intended \nto crack down on fraud and abuse in government contracts. It would say \nto federal government contractors that have been convicted or had civil \njudgement rendered against them at least three times for procurement \nfraud and related offenses: you do not deserve further taxpayer \nsupport; you are suspended from new contracts for three years. Three \nstrikes and you're out.\n  A recent report by the General Accounting Office on procurement fraud \nby the 100 largest Department of Defense contractors during the years \n1995-1999 found: 8 criminal cases in which contractors pled guilty and \npaid fines totaling $66 million, and 95 civil cases, including 94 \nsettlements and one judgment, in which awards totaled $368 million. The \noffenses included overcharging, kickbacks, defective products, \nprocurement fraud, misuse/diversion of government furnished materials, \ncost/labor mischarging, and others. A number of companies, including \nsome of the largest DOD contractors, had several criminal convictions \nor civil judgments for similar offenses over a few years. This clearly \ndemonstrates a pattern of misconduct.\n  But the Department of Defense continued to conduct business with \ncontractors even after these companies had committed multiple frauds \nagainst the government. Not one of the top military contractors guilty \nof procurement fraud was barred from future contracts. According to a \nrecent Associated Press analysis, there are 1,020 contractors \ngovernment-wide that were sued or prosecuted for fraud in the past five \nyears. Of these, 737 remain eligible for future contracts.\n  It is disgraceful that the Pentagon and other agencies seem to hear \nand see no evil in the criminal fraud committed by contractors. Now \nit's up to Congress to step in and start cracking down on big \ncontractors who have been swindling the federal government out of \nbillions of dollars. I am hopeful that the bill we're introducing today \nwill force all contractors to play by the rules and stop ripping off \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Under current law, a contracting officer is required to make a \ndetermination regarding the integrity and responsibility of a potential \ncontractor prior to awarding a new contract. In making this \ndetermination, prior convictions can be taken into account, but even \nwith several convictions an individual or company may still be granted \na contract award.\n  The bill I introduced would require contractors to disclose the \nnumber of convictions or civil judgments, the nature of the offense, \nand whether any fines, penalties, or damages were assessed. Any \ncontractor who has three or more convictions or civil judgements for \nfraud and similar offenses related to government contracts would be \nprohibited from receiving future contracts. Existing contracts would \nnot be impacted. The prohibition on future contracts would last three \nyears. If, during that period, the contractor demonstrates a \nsatisfactory record of ethics and integrity by avoiding additional \ncriminal convictions, the contractor may become eligible for future \nfederal contracts. The bill also allows a waiver by the President in \nthe interest of national security or to prevent serious injury to the \ngovernment. Note that the bill does not prevent debarment under current \nprocedures for fewer than three violations or broader consideration of \nethics under the proposed OMB regulations. But recognizing that some \nagencies will not use these discretionary procedures, the bill sets a \nfirm limit.\n  The bill was crafted much like the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, which made life in prison mandatory for \ncriminals convicted of their third federal felony. That's why we \nsometimes call this the ``Three strikes and you're out'' bill. This \nbill, however, is much softer, as the suspension can be lifted after \nthree years. We've made a commitment in this country to be tough on \ncrime. That resolve should apply to federal contractors too. It is time \nto stop rewarding criminal contractors with American taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10400-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10400-S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                GAMBLING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks \ntodays regarding the recent proposals put\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nforth by the Nevada Gaming Commission yesterday that would place a $550 \ncap on all legalized gambling on college sports and prohibits all \ngambling on high school and the Olympic sporting events. I believe that \nthe proposed rule changes in Nevada are a significant first step in \nprotecting our student athletes and the integrity of college sports.\n  The Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission stated yesterday that \nthe changes proposed ``will provide protection for Nevada athletes and \nfor Nevada games. They will also protect athletes in the other 49 \nstates. The proposals are intended to discourage illegal bookmakers and \nfixers from attempting to use Nevada's legal sports books as a place to \nplace bets.''\n  It is obvious from these proposals that the Nevada Gaming Commission \nknows that gambling has an unseemly influence on our colleges and \nuniversities. Ironically, while Nevada is the only state where legal \ngambling on collegiate and Olympic sporting events occurs, Nevada's own \ngaming regulations currently prohibit gambling on any of Nevada's teams \nbecause of the potential to jeopardize the integrity of those sporting \nevents. The frequency of gambling scandals over the last decade is a \nclear indication that legal gambling on college sports stretches beyond \nthe borders of Nevada, impacting the integrity of other state's \nsporting events.\n  While I am encouraged by the proposed rule changes from the Nevada \nGaming Commission, I do not believe it goes far enough. I will continue \nto insist that the Senate take up and pass, The Amateur Sports \nIntegrity Act, which is in response to a recommendation made by the \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC), which last year \nconcluded a two-year study on the impact of legalized gambling on our \ncountry. The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling \non amateur sports and is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation (NCAA), coaches, teachers, athletic directors, \ncommissioners, university presidents, school principals and family \ngroups from across the country.\n  Banning all legalized gambling on amateur sports serves notice that \nbetting on college games or student athletes are not only inappropriate \nbut can result in significant social costs. The National Gambling \nImpact Study Commission Report recognized the potential harm of \nlegalized gambling by stating that sports gambling ``can serve as \ngateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can devastate individuals \nand careers.''\n  Some of its findings include: more than 5 million Americans suffer \nfrom pathological gambling; another 15 million are ``at risk'' for it; \nand about 1.1 million adolescents, ages 12 to 17, or 5% of America's 20 \nmillion teenager engage in severe pathological gambling each year.\n  According to the American Psychiatric Association: Pathological \ngambling is a chronic and progressive psychiatric disorder \ncharacterized by emotional dependence, loss of control and leads to \nadverse consequences at school and at home. Teens are more than twice \nas vulnerable to gambling addictions than adults because they are prone \nto high-risk behaviors during adolescence. Ninety percent of the \nnations compulsive gamblers start at an adolescent age. According to \nthe Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling, gambling on sporting \nevents is a favorite preference of teenage gamblers.\n  A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that most \nstudent athletes gamble. According to this study, ``72% of students \nathletes have gambled in some way since entering college (80% among \nmale student athletes).'' Many student athletes gamble on sports. This \nstudy found ``35% of all students athletes have gambled on sports while \nattending college (45% among male student athletes).'' This study found \nthat a considerable number of student athletes acted in ways that call \ninto question the integrity of their contests. ``Over 5% of male \nstudent athletes provided inside information for gambling purposes, bet \non a game in which they participated, or accepted money for performing \npoorly in a game.''\n  A study recently conducted by the University of Michigan found that \n``84% of college referees said they had participated in some form of \ngambling since beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40% also \nadmitted placing bets on sporting events and 20% said they gambled on \nthe NCAA basketball tournament. Two referees said they were aware of \nthe spread on a game and that it affected the way they officiated the \ncontest. Some reported being asked to fix games they were officiating \nand others were aware of referees who ``did not call a game fairly \nbecause of gambling reasons.''\n  Gambling on college kids is banned in 49 states. Prior to 1992 when \nany state could have allowed gambling on amateur sporting events, they \ndidn't. No states have asked to have this federal law repealed. Why do \nyou think that is? It is because it is inappropriate.\n  The bottom line--it is inappropriate to bet on college kids. This is \nabout protecting the integrity of amateur athletics, it is about the \neffect that legal, government sanctioned betting has on the games, it \nis about the gateway college sports betting provides youth gamblers, \nand most importantly, it is about the impropriety of betting on \nteenagers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10401-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to request that the \nprovisions of Title III of H.R. 701, the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct be included in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations conference \nreport. The Interior Appropriations conference report passed last week \nincluded increased funding for land, water and wildlife conservation \nprograms. While the bill is a positive first step towards providing \npermanent funding for these programs, I would have preferred to see \nenactment of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, CARA, especially \nthe wildlife conservation provisions in Title III of the bill. To this \nend, I am requesting that Title III of H.R. 701 be included in the \nconference report of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I \nwas a strong supporter of CARA when it was reported out of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a member. It is \nthe most important conservation and wildlife measure that Congress has \nwritten in the last 50 years.

Mr. President, I rise today to request that the \nprovisions of Title III of H.R. 701, the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct be included in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations conference \nreport. The Interior Appropriations conference report passed last week \nincluded increased funding for land, water and wildlife conservation \nprograms. While the bill is a positive first step towards providing \npermanent funding for these programs, I would have preferred to see \nenactment of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, CARA, especially \nthe wildlife conservation provisions in Title III of the bill. To this \nend, I am requesting that Title III of H.R. 701 be included in the \nconference report of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. I \nwas a strong supporter of CARA when it was reported out of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a member. It is \nthe most important conservation and wildlife measure that Congress has \nwritten in the last 50 years.

Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the \nColumbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on \nsensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of \nthose who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and \nwe will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following \nare the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year \nago today.\n  October 12, 1999:\n  Michael S. Chambers, 43, Seattle, WA;\n  Rueben M.

Mr. President, the final version of the fiscal year 2001 \nEnergy and Water Development appropriations provides $1 million for the \nBureau of Reclamation to initiate a comprehensive Hopi/Western Navajo \nwater development study. This funding was added to the bill at my \nrequest, and I would like to take this opportunity to detail the reason \nwhy I consider this to be a very important undertaking.\n  Efforts have been ongoing for several years to settle the various \nwater rights claims of the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes and other \nwater users in the Little Colorado River watershed of Northern Arizona. \nNumerous proposals have been advanced in an effort to settle these \nwater-rights claims, including identifying alternative sources of \nwater, means of delivery and points of usage to help provide a reliable \nsource of good-quality water to satisfy the present and future demands \nof Indian communities on those reservations. Cost estimates for the \nvarious existing proposals run into the hundreds of millions of \ndollars, the majority of which would likely be borne by the federal \ngovernment. This study is needed to identify the most cost-effective \nprojects that will serve to meet these objectives.\n  I have asked the Bureau to hire an outside contractor to complete \nthis study to ensure that a fresh and objective analysis of existing \nstudies and data is conducted. In addition, using a private contractor \nwill enable the Bureau to complete the study in a timely manner without \nrequiring the Bureau to divert personnel needed to accomplish other \nvital priorities. The study should be complete and submitted to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible, but no later than \nApril 1, 2002.\n  I also want to assure the parties that this study is intended to be \nused to facilitate this settlement, and cannot be used for any other \npurpose in any administrative or judicial proceeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10402-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10402-S10403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 1102, the Comprehensive Retirement Security and Pension Reform \nAct.\n  In my short time in the Senate, I have supported pension and savings \nreform and expansion, including cosponsoring S. 741, the Pension \nCoverage and Portability Act, and voting in favor of a pension and \nsavings amendment offered by Finance Committee Chairman Roth during \nconsideration of H.R. 8, the estate tax phase out bill. I strongly \nbelieve that enacting H.R. 1102 will benefit millions of Americans, \nhelp boost America's savings rate, and bolster long-term economic \ngrowth. Indeed, economists agree that the increased personal savings \nand investment that would result from expanding pensions hold the key \nto long-term economic growth, and would shore up the country's savings \ntendencies.\n  Currently, only half of all workers have a pension plan. That means \nabout 75 million Americans don't have access to one of the key \ncomponents to a comfortable retirement. Pension laws have become so \nconvoluted and the annual contribution limit so diminished that many \nsmall businesses simply do not bother setting them up.\n  In fact, the contribution limits to Individual Retirement Accounts \n(IRAs) have not changed since 1981. At that time, when the $2,000 limit \nwas set, according to the U.S. Census Bureau the U.S. means the U.S. \nmean household income was under $23,000. In 1998, mean household income \nwas almost $52,000, an increase of more than 130 percent. Still, the \nmaximum IRA contribution hasn't budged from $2,000.\n  Setting aside $5,000, rather than $2,000, will provide the retiree \nwith significant additional savings. For workers who don't have access \nto an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the IRA is their primary \nsavings vehicle. Increasing the contribution to $5,000 helps put these \npeople on a more equal footing with their fellow citizens covered by \nemployer-sponsored plans. Also, it is estimated that more than 61 \npercent of IRA participants with incomes under $50,000 contribute the \n$2,000 maximum; and 69 percent of all IRA participants contribute the \nmaximum. Workers are ready to invest more--if we in Congress will open \nthe door for them.\n  H.R. 1102 includes an income tax credit to help those who might not \nbe able to fund their retirement accounts without additional help, or \nwho need more incentive to save. Under this legislation, joint filers \nof tax returns earning under $50,000, heads of households earning under \n$37,500, and all other taxpayers earning less than $25,000 will receive \nnon-refundable tax credits for each of five years on a sliding scale \nfrom five to 50 percent for contributions to a broad range of existing \nretirement savings choices. In effect, the federal government will be \nmatching these savers contributions dollar for dollar--through the tax \ncredit--up to the maximum allowable based on their income and filing \nstatus.\n  Another provision will help workers approaching retirement age to \njump start, or catch up with, their retirement savings. Many of our \nyounger workers are limited in what they can invest toward retirement \ndue to the other priorities such as saving for a house, starting a \nfamily, or setting aside funds for their children's education. With \nretirement beginning to loom as they turn 50, the current limits on \ncontributions both to their IRAs and to their employer-sponsored \nretirement plans make catching up extremely difficult. H.R. 1102 allows \ntaxpayers 50 and older to contribute $7,500 annually to an IRA, or \n$5,000 to their employees' retirement plan when fully phased in.\n  Today, it is commonplace for workers to switch jobs frequently. But, \nunder current regulations, these workers often cannot carry the \nretirement benefits they have accumulated with one employer to a new \njob. Provisions in H.R. 1102 remove the final obstacles to full \nretirement portability, meaning that a worker easily can take his or \nher accumulated benefits to a new job. This component of the \nlegislation is particularly important to state and local government \nemployees who currently cannot roll over their qualified retirement \nsavings to a new employer when they move to private sector jobs.\n  In Rhode Island, small businesses are the heart of the economy. \nIndeed, 98 percent of Rhode Island businesses are small. And, they are \nimportant forces in developing two emerging segments of the state's \neconomy: service and technology. H.R. 1102 also will remove \ndisincentives which currently prevent many small business owners from \noffering retirement plans to their employees. In addition, it will make \nit easier\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nfor long-serving union members to collect the full pension benefits \nthey have earned.\n  Some provisions in the bill have stirred debate. One relates to cash \nbalance pension plans. I recognize and appreciate the hard work that \nthe Senate Finance Committee has done with respect to this issue, and \nunderstand that negotiations are still under way. I hope that the final \nproduct of these negotiations will help workers that are negatively \naffected by cash balance pension plan conversions.\n  The House approved H.R. 1102 by a vote of 401-25 on July 19th. I hope \nthat we in the Senate act soon to approve this bill and send it to the \nPresident so that millions of hard working Americans will accrue its \nbenefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10403-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncelebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month. As one of America's \nlargest ethnic groups, the Hispanic American community embodies the \ntrue spirit of our country as a land where people from all over the \nworld can come to for the chance to pursue their dreams.\n  For countless years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role \nin American society. This has been characterized by a strong work \nethic, deep sense of faith and unwavering commitment to both family and \ncommunity. Throughout the history of our country, the contributions of \nHispanic Americans in areas such as public service, business, \nentertainment, and the sciences have been lasting and have made America \na stronger nation.\n  Today, there are more than 31 million Hispanic Americans living in \nthe United States, and they represent nearly 12 percent of our total \npopulation. The Hispanic American community in New Jersey includes more \nthan 1 million residents, with roots from all over the world, including \nEurope, the Carribean, and both South and Central America.\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to represent a State with one of \nthe largest concentrations of Hispanic Americans in the entire country. \nThe vibrant Hispanic American communities across the State have given \nNew Jerseyans a window into their cultures and heritage. We have also \nbeen fortunate to have members of these communities take on important \nroles in our public life. In New Jersey, we have Hispanic Americans \nrepresenting some of our nation's most diverse communities in both the \nState legislature and the United States Congress, and dozens more hold \nelected office at the county and local levels.\n  As we begin a new century, it is projected that nearly 25 percent of \nAmerica will be of Hispanic origin by 2050. At the same time, the \nwidespread influence of Hispanic Americans is touching all of our \ncommunities, transcending racial and ethnic boundaries on a daily \nbasis. I have no doubt that as America's Hispanic American community \ngrows, it will maintain the legacy that it has built while also adding \na new chapter to its rich history as an important piece of the American \nmosaic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10403-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TIRE STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with Senator \nMcCain the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Yesterday, the \nSenate took an important step forward in improving our nation's motor \nvehicle safety laws. One of the most important aspects of that bill was \na provision to require Department of Transportation to upgrade the \nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for tires for the first time in \nnearly 30 years.\n  Because it has been so long since the standards have been revised, \nthey do not apply to tires used on sport utility vehicles (SUVs). In \nfact, SUVs weren't even around when these standards were last \ndeveloped. Given the relationship of tires to the rollover propensity \nof SUVs, I would expect that the Department should first upgrade the \nstandards for those tires used on SUVs. In addition, since the tire \nstandard was put in place technology for the construction and design of \ntires has improved dramatically. For example, nylon ply caps can \nsignificantly improve the performance of tires. The types vehicles on \nthe road has also changed as more and more people choose to drive sport \nutility vehicles. Chairman McCain would you agree that the Department \nshould consider new technologies that would improve tire safety as they \nestablish the new tire standard and that they should also consider the \ndifferent mix of vehicles on the road as they set their priorities for \nimplementing the new standard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I concur with the Senator from Missouri that a variety of \nnew technologies are available to improve the design and construction \nof tires. The improved federal motor vehicle safety standard for tires \nshould take into account all of these new technologies to ensure that \nconsumers are provided with safe tires. Additionally, the Department \nshould implement the rule in light of the changing mix of types of \nvehicles that consumers are driving.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, I thank the Chairman for taking the time to \nanswer my questions and the hard work he has done to get a bill passed \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10403-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10403-S10404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FREIGHT RAIL TRANSPORTATION\n\nMr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am addressing the Senate to \nexpress my view on a vital part of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure--the freight railroads.\n  I am aware of concerns that have been raised by some companies that \nship by rail about the service and rates available to them. Certainly, \nthe ability to safely, economically and efficiently transport raw \nmaterials to plants and finished products to both domestic and \ninternational consumers is as critical as the actual production of \nthese commodities and goods.\n  Since 1827 with the founding of the Nation's first commercial \nrailroad, the B, we have depended on the rails to perform this \nfunction. In its heyday, the iron horse dominated transportation of \ngoods and passengers. Today, after surviving nearly total collapse in \nthe 1970s, a streamlined, modernized rail industry continues to play a \nrole, albeit a considerably downsized one, in the transportation \nmarketplace. Our transportation infrastructure has evolved--now trucks \non the interstate highways are by far the predominant mode of \ntransportation, and inland barges carry coal and grain on our nation's \nwaterways.\n  As many of you know, I have always been interested in rail history. \nIndeed, Atlanta was originally known as Terminus because of the \nrailroads which were sited there. What history has taught us is that \nthe rails require a continuing, massive capital investment to operate \nsafely. In the late 1970s, Congress faced the dilemma of a severely \nunder-capitalized system with a dismal safety performance. The rails \nwould have to be supported by massive federal subsidy or freed to \ncompete in the marketplace in an effort to generate needed capital. \nCongress wisely chose the latter course, and the railroads have been \nable to generate the quarter trillion dollars needed since 1980 to \nsupport the infrastructure. In 1999 alone, the private investment was \n$16.2 billion, with $2.87 of assets needed for every dollar of revenue \nproduced. The industry's vastly improved safety record in large part is \na testament to the wisdom of that infrastructure investment. Let me add \nthat although progress in this area has been significant, nevertheless \nthis safety record can be further improved. It is my hope that \nmanagement and labor will work together toward that end.\n  The world is not perfect, of course, and in the intervening years \nissues have arisen which must be addressed--issues such as the need to \nhonor the hard earned collective bargaining agreements of railroad \nworkers. Many of these issues have been brought to the attention of \nCongress, the Interstate Commerce Commission and now its successor, the \nSurface Transportation Board, STB. Indeed, the Congress took a \ncomprehensive look at rail regulation in 1995 when it created the STB. \nI know some companies believe their rail rates are excessive. While \nrates have declined more than 50 percent since 1981, some customers \nhave benefitted more than others, reflecting the differential pricing \nput into place by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. This has led in part \nto complaints being heard from segments of the shipping\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\npublic. Many have suffered from service disruptions following recent \nmergers and consolidations. While I am very concerned about these \nsituations, I believe the STB has worked within its mandate to address \nthem.\n  I have an open mind on whether these matters need to be examined \nfurther. If that is the case, I urge that we move carefully. We should \nnot return to the very regulatory schemes that led to near disaster a \ngeneration ago. I would not favor policies that deprive the railroads \nof their ability to generate capital, resulting in the federal \ngovernment--rather than the private sector--having to assume the costs \nof maintaining and operating the freight rail network.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10404-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LT. BOB DOUGLAS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Kentuckian, Lt. Bob Douglas (ret).\n  For almost 30 years, Bob has crusaded against the scourge of drugs \nand served the people of Kentucky, helping to make the Commonwealth a \nsafer place to live.\n  Bob worked for 25 years as a member of the Erlanger, Kentucky Police \nDepartment. For the last nine of those years, he was the primary \ninstructor for the anti-drug program, D.A.R.E. When Bob retired from \nthe police force in 1998, he became the Executive Director of the \nKentucky Crime Prevention Coalition. He is also a new member of the \nsteering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council.\n  For his efforts, Bob was recently presented with a 2000 Mac Gray \nAward for his outstanding effort to promote the National Citizens' \nCrime Prevention Campaign. The award recognizes those who have made \nextraordinary contributions and pledged personal commitment to work \nwith the media to promote anti-drug public service announcements and \ncrime prevention education.\n  Some have kidded Bob about the Columbo-style overcoat he wears. But \nlike Peter Falk's character, Bob gets results. For years, he visited \nchildren in schools to teach them about the dangers of drugs and to \nurge them to stay out of trouble. With his partner, the canine \ncharacter, Officer McGruff, there is no doubt that Bob made an \nimpression and steered more than a few children in the right direction.\n  Too often we hear about our problems and the trouble-makers in \nsociety, and we don't hear enough about our heroes and the everyday \ncitizens who make a difference and improve our quality of life. Bob \nDouglas is one of those heroes, and he deserves our commendation.\n  I ask that an article on Lt. Douglas be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                    Douglas Takes Bite Out of Award\n\n                             (By Juli Hale)\n\n       With his Columbo-style overcoat, some might think Bob \n     Douglas' long-time partner needs to call the fashion police. \n     But one look at the partner's big brown eyes and black, wet \n     nose is usually all it takes to draw in a crowd of kids to \n     listen to the pair's message of drug resistance and crime \n     prevention.\n       Douglas and Officer McGruff, the tough-talking cartoon \n     canine, spent years visiting school classrooms trying to turn \n     at least one student away from a life of drug abuse and \n     crime, Douglas and others believe they did much more. Today, \n     the pair appears at community events and keeps spreading the \n     message.\n       For his efforts in drug and crime prevention and for \n     sharing the spotlight with McGruff, Douglas was presented \n     with a 2000 Mac Gray Award last week in Washington. The Mac \n     Gray Award honors outstanding efforts to promote the National \n     Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign. It memorializes Berkeley \n     McCabe ``Mac'' Gray II, the late executive deputy director of \n     the National Crime Prevention Council.\n       The award was one of only two presented in the nation this \n     year to officers who use McGruff as part of their message. \n     The award recognizes two winners each year--one at the \n     national/state level and one at the local/regional level--who \n     have made extraordinary contributions and personal \n     commitments to work with the media to secure donated \n     advertising for public service announcements as well as \n     promoting McGruff and crime prevention education. Douglas won \n     for the national/state level.\n       ``I personally see this as an Erlanger award and I wanted \n     to share it with you,'' Douglas said to City Council Tuesday \n     night after showing a short video presentation about the \n     award. Obviously touched by the video, which showed Douglas \n     working with students over the years, Douglas held the glass \n     award high for everyone to see. The video also highlighted \n     Douglas' other achievements, such as his having McGruff's \n     image painted on the side of a new police cruiser and pushing \n     for the McGruff message ``take a bite out of crime'' to be \n     placed on billboards.\n       Douglas worked for the Erlanger Police Department for 25 \n     years, the last nine as the primary DARE instructor.

Mr. President, I rise to speak of a special event \ntaking place in my home State on Saturday. After much hard work and \npreparation, the people of the City of Norwich and the State of \nConnecticut will proudly welcome the Ukrainian schooner, \nBat'Kivshchyna, and her dedicated crew to their winter port at The \nMarina at American Wharf in Norwich Harbor.\n  It is a great honor for the State of Connecticut to host the \nBat'Kivshchyna and her crew. This past summer, the Bat'Kivshchyna was a \npopular participant in Operation Sail 2000, a millennial event that \nshowcased numerous tall ships from around the globe in eight North \nAmerican ports from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Portland, Maine. I had \nthe opportunity to view these vessels when they visited New London, \nConnecticut, between July 12 and July 15. I was deeply impressed with \nthe immense and graceful design of these ships and enjoyed visiting \nwith the crews who hail from across the world.\n  The Bat'Kivshchyna hails from the Ukraine, a country which only ten \nyears ago shed Soviet domination and embraced the principles of \ndemocracy. Led by her captain and owner, Dmytro Birioukovych, the \nBat'Kivshchyna is on an ambitious multi-year mission called ``Discover \nUkraine.'' The goal of this mission is to arouse local awareness and \ninterest in Ukrainian culture and in the Ukrainian economy. Thus, the \nBat'Kivshchyna, which is Ukrainian for ``Fatherland,'' has become an \nimportant ambassador for her nation as she makes ports-of-call in \nEurope, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania.\n  Much of the Bat'Kivshchyna's success is owed to Captain Birioukovych. \nHaving purchased the Bat'Kivshchyna in 1988, he transformed an aging \nfishing vessel into a world-class tall ship. Encouraged by Ukrainian \nindependence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, Captain Birioukovych \nco-founded ``Discover Ukraine'' with his Canadian son-in-law, Roy \nKellogg, and decided to use his vessel to promote his nation's history \nand culture. When asked about his global expedition, Captain \nBirioukovych proudly calls himself, his crew and his ship ``folk \nambassadors of good will.''\n  The Bat'Kivshchyna had a difficult journey from her home port in \nKiev, Ukraine, to the Americas for the commencement of Operation Sail \n2000. Regional political tensions, rough seas, and numerous technical \ndifficulties threatened the Bat'Kivshchyna's mission in several \ninstances throughout the late spring and early summer. However, the \ndedicated crew persevered and overcame each hurdle to arrive for their \nfirst OpSail2000 event in Miami, Florida.\n  In July, Captain Birioukovych put forth an appeal for a North \nAmerican port in which to dock the Bat'Kivshchyna during the winter. \nWith plans to attend the 2001 Great Lakes Sailing Expedition, it was \neconomically unfeasible for the Bat'Kivshchyna to sail back to Kiev \nonly to return to the United States in the following spring. With \nnumerous offers from ports across the Northeast, I am proud to say that \nCaptain Birioukovych chose the great city of Norwich as his ``winter \nrefuge.''\n  Connecticut's honor of hosting the Bat'Kivshchyna in Norwich could \nnot have been possible without the tireless effort of those in the \nConstitution State dedicated to providing a winter home for the vessel. \nI would like to thank especially Mr. Michael Lamperelli of the \nConnecticut Friends of the Ukraine Expedition, Mr. Ron D.\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nAliano of The Marina at American Wharf in Norwich, and City Council \nPresident Mr. Richard Abele of Norwich. I would also like to thank all \nof those who are helping to prepare for Saturday's arrival of the \nBat'Kivshchyna in Norwich Harbor: the Norwich Fire Department, the \nNorwich Police Department, the American Ambulance Service, Inc., the \nUnited States Coast Guard Academy, the Integrated Charter School of \nNorwich, and the Norwich Adult Education Center.\n  I know that Saturday's event will be a great day for the people of \nthe City of Norwich and the State of Connecticut. The Bat'Kivshchyna's \nvisit to the city will provide for a rich cultural exchange between the \nUkraine and the State of Connecticut. I am proud that we, as a State, \ncould provide a winter refuge for the Bat'Kivshchyna as she continues \nher global expedition, and I wish her crew success in future \nvoyages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NINETY YEARS OF GIVING\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, next month a remarkable woman, \nwho is a constituent of mine, will celebrate her ninetieth birthday; \nalthough, if you ask her, she will tell you that she still feels like a \nsixteen year-old.\n  Alice B. Dwyer--known to family and close friends as ``Lally'' and to \nliterally thousands of Rhode Islanders, who learned in her classroom, \nas ``Miss Dwyer''--was born on November 12, 1910. She was the second of \nfour children of Matthew S. Dwyer and Alice Barry Dwyer of Providence. \nHer older sister, Matt, suffered from crippling polio at a time long \nbefore public accommodations for people with disabilities. \nNevertheless, they set off together for Manhattanville College in New \nYork City.\n  Alice Dwyer shies way from any words of recognition for her part in \nenabling her older sister, who had an insatiable lust for learning, to \nattend college. Alice simply was doing what has always come most \nnaturally to her, giving to others.\n  After college, Alice went on to receive a Masters Degree in English \nLiterature from Brown University, my own alma mater. With degrees in \nhand she began a lifetime of service to children in the Providence \nPublic School system. The majority of her years teaching were spent at \nClassical High School where she taught sophomore English.\n  Today's public opinion polls tell us that education is the number one \nissue on the minds of Americans. We hear and talk a lot about holding \nstudents to high academic standards. But Alice Dwyer never needed \npollsters and politicians to tell her about the importance of high \nstandards. The students who read Shakespeare in her classroom knew that \nshe expected each of them to do his or her best.\n  In addition to her love of teaching, Alice always has been an avid \nadmirer of acting. She was among the Rhode Islanders to answer the \ncasting call for ``The Great Gatsby,'' starring Robert Redford and Mia \nFarrow. At sunset each evening for weeks, she would cross the bridge to \nNewport, where she would don a glittering 1920s flapper gown and join \nthe guests at Hollywood's most recent rendition of Jay Gatsby's famed \nsummer parties.\n  After retiring from the Providence Public School system, Alice took \non various volunteer activities. She read to children and worked in the \nlibrary of the Fox Point Elementary School in Providence, and she was a \nregular in the phone bank on New London Avenue in Cranston, making \ncalls to turn out the vote for my father's 1982 Senate campaign. She \nworked relentlessly on the two unsuccessful campaigns of Fred Lippitt \nto be mayor of Providence.\n  In 1994 when my father ran for his fourth Senate term, difficulty \nwalking kept Alice away from campaign headquarters. However, as a woman \nwho cannot do enough for others, she found a way to help. Campaign \nworkers would drop off box loads of envelopes and lists of names and \naddresses with her. When one box was done, it would be picked up and \nanother delivered in its place.\n  Combining her love of reading with her natural tendency to help \nothers, Alice spent a great deal of time taping textbooks for blind and \nvisually impaired students.\n  Whether it's the young person working at the Newport Creamery on \nWayland Square where Alice is known for liking her coffee piping hot, \nor the students (now middle-aged men and women) who recall the lessons \nthey learned from her at Classical High School, or her own family \nmembers, all agree that Alice Dwyer has filled their lives with her own \ngiving spirit.\n  Alice Dwyer will celebrate her ninetieth year with her sister, Rita \nScotti, with her eleven nieces and nephews and their families, and with \ndozens of friends and neighbors. It is my great privilege to wish this \nwoman, who has warmed so many hearts with her unfailing kindness and \ngenerosity, a very Happy Birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10405-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10405-S10406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA SHEHEE\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, on the evening of Friday, November \n3, the people of Shreveport will gather to pay tribute to one of the \nmost exceptional people the State of Louisiana has ever produced, \nVirginia Shehee. The tribute to Virginia is organized by the Biomedical \nResearch Foundation of northwest Louisiana, whose establishment is but \none of the remarkable achievements in the life of this remarkable \nwoman.\n  It is my pleasure and honor to tell my colleagues in the United \nStates Senate about my friend Virginia Shehee. She is a superb model \nfor everything she has done: wife, mother, businesswoman, political \nleader, community activist and economic visionary. My former colleague, \nSenator Bennett Johnston, once said, ``In a state that is blessed with \nan abundance of natural resources, Virginia Shehee may be Louisiana's \nsingle greatest natural resource.'' I certainly know that is a view \nshared by many of those who know Virginia best and who have benefited \nfrom her lifetime of dedication to improve lives in Shreveport and \nnorthwest Louisiana.\n  Nothing better exemplifies her accomplishments than the creation of \nthe Biomedical Research Foundation, and the construction of the \nBiomedical Research Institute that today stands proudly adjacent to the \nLSU Medical Center in Shreveport. It is an understatement to say that \nnone of this would have been possible without the foresight, \ndetermination and hard work of Virginia, and other community leaders \nnearly 20 years ago.\n  Like so many advances in today's new economy, Shreveport's move into \nthe world of biomedicine and biotechnology emerged from the \ndifficulties caused by the decline of the old economy. In northwest \nLouisiana, where the steadily declining price in oil in the early \n1980's caused community leaders to conclude that efforts had to be \nundertaken quickly to produce other economic sustenance for the area, \nthey of course turned to Virginia Shehee.\n  In a matter of a few short years, Virginia had formed the Biomedical \nResearch Foundation and gathered several million dollars in local \nsupport. She leveraged local dollars into a much larger state support \nand then converted that into significant support by the Congress and \nthe Department of Energy. As a result, a 10-story, $40 million, state-\nof-the-art wet-lab research facility was built that today houses world-\nclass researchers and serves as a growing economic engine, producing \nknowledge-based jobs for northwest Louisiana.\n  Beyond the work taking place in its own facilities, Biomed can point \nwith great pride to the growing number of companies it has attracted to \nShreveport's own technology park, InterTech, with technologies ranging \nfrom manufacturing and diagnostics to telemedicine and orthopedic \ndevices. We in the Louisiana delegation often point to the success of \nBiomed as a textbook model of partnerships between Washington and local \ncommunities looking to build a better future for their citizens.\n  It is true, Mr. President, that Biomed has become a success because \nit has merit on its side. But all of us who have played some small part \nin this effort know that a big reason for the success is Virginia \nShehee is someone who long ago learned not to take no for an answer. \nHer efforts have led to a mighty legacy in science and economic \ndevelopment in Shreveport. It is fitting the facility is now the \n``Virginia K. Shehee Biomedical Research Institute,'' and it is fitting \nthe community\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\nis gathering next month to say thanks. It is my pleasure to join so \nmany in saying how blessed Louisiana is to have Virginia Shehee's \ngenerous service and how fortunate I am to have her friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10406-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF MR. DONALD W. JENSEN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nDonald W. Jensen, who is retiring on January 1, 2001, after 13 years of \nservice as a member of the Oakland County Board of Commissioners. Since \n1987, Commissioner Jensen has represented the citizens of District 15 \nto the best of his ability, which has been in an exemplary manner.\n  Commissioner Jensen graduated from the University of Detroit with a \ndegree in Business Administration. He spent much of his work career \nwith Burroughs Corporation, where he served as Director of Advertising \nand Public Relations. His primary responsibility was the design and \nproduction of promotional and technical literature, though he was also \nresponsible for media advertising, the public relations department, and \nthe operation of their international literature distribution facility. \nWhile at Burroughs, Mr. Jensen was a Board Member and President of the \nNational Trade Show Exhibitors Association.\n  Public service has always played an essential role in Commissioner \nJensen's life. Prior to being elected to his current position, he \nserved for nine years as a member of the Birmingham, Michigan, City \nCommission and then later as Mayor of Birmingham. He was a Founder and \nBoard Member of the Foundation for Birmingham Senior Residents, an \norganization which enables seniors to remain in their homes. He has \nalso served on the Board of numerous other organizations, including the \nAmerican Cancer Society and the Center for Independent Living.\n  As a County Commissioner representing the Cities of Berkley and \nBirmingham and a portion of the City of Royal Oak, Mr. Jensen has \nserved as Chairman of the General Government Committee from 1993-94, as \nVice Chairman of the Finance Committee, and has been a member of the \nOakland Livingston Human Service Agency, the Southeast Michigan Council \nof Governments, the Oakland County Board of Commissioners' Public \nServices Committee, and the Health and Human Services Committee. He has \nalso been a Trustee of the County Library Board for 12 years, and \nserved on the Taxation and Finance Committee of the National \nAssociation of Counties.\n  I would like to thank Commissioner Jensen for his dedication and many \nefforts throughout his career in public service. His leadership during \nthis time has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of \nthe entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Donald W. Jensen on \na wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10406-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO JIM HURD\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Jim Hurd, the founding CEO of Planar Systems, who passed \naway this summer after a year-long battle with leukemia. Jim was a \npioneering technical and business leader in the U.S. flat panel \nindustry, and led Planar Systems of Beaverton, Oregon to become one of \nthe largest flat panel display companies in the U.S. and Europe. Jim \nwas actively involved at the national level in helping to shape federal \npolicy on flat panel displays, and worked on the national flat panel \ninitiative and in the formation of consortia to address critical issues \nfor the flat panel display industry.\n  Mr. Hurd was a leader in Oregon's business community, serving as the \nChair of the Oregon Council of the American Electronics Association. \nDuring his term in 1992, he helped develop the Oregon technical \nbenchmark annual survey and conference. He was also active in \nsupporting technical education efforts in Oregon, and was a member of \nthe Board of Trustees of the Oregon Graduate Institute. For services to \nthe industry and community, the American Electronics Association \nawarded Jim Oregon's technology executive of the year award in 1993.\n  A native of the Pacific Northeast, Jim was born in 1948 in Spokane, \nand grew up in Kennewick, Washington. He received his bachelors's \ndegree in physics from Lewis & Clark College in Portland in 1970, where \nhe met his wife Alice. Jim joined Tektronics Corporation soon after \ngraduation. In 1983, Jim left Tektronics to co-found Planar Systems \nwith Chris King and John Laney. Today, Planer employs over 850 people \nin the United States. Jim also lent his wisdom to help other start-up \ncompanies achieve success by serving on the Board of the Oregon \nResource and Technology Development Fund, a state-sponsored venture \ncapital fund.\n  Jim had a rare ability to balance his successful professional life \nwith an active private life that included mountain climbing, running, \nbicycling, tennis, scuba diving and a love for auto racing. He was a \nwonderful husband to Alice and a terrific father to his sons, Owen and \nPeter.\n  Mr. Hurd will be missed by all of us who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10406-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF MR. GEORGE W. KUHN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nGeorge W. Kuhn, who is retiring this year after a 60-year career during \nwhich he split time between the United States Navy, the Ford Motor \nCompany, and being a public servant. Whatever the forum, he has been a \nleader and an inspiration to those around him.\n  Mr. Kuhn graduated from Central Michigan University, majoring in \nbusiness administration, economics, and political science. In 1943, he \nentered the Naval Service and served aboard the Tender U.S.S. Pelias as \na Finance Officer. He returned to active duty during the Korean War and \nserved at U.S. Naval Stations in New York and in the Panama Canal Zone. \nUltimately, he retired as a Navy Captain after completing 39 years of \nservice, both on active duty and in the Naval Reserves.\n  Following the Korean War, Mr. Kuhn completed Ford Motor Company's \nManagement Training Program. He served on the staff of the Vice \nPresident of Product Development for 20 years, coordinating the \ndevelopment phases of styling, engineering, purchasing and \nmanufacturing of future car programs.\n  Mr. Kuhn's passion has always been in public service, though. He has \nbeen a leader within the Oakland County Republican Party for nearly 50 \nyears, since his involvement in Eisenhower's first presidential \ncampaign. In 1959, he was elected Mayor of the City of Berkley, \nMichigan. He served as Mayor until being elected to serve as a State \nSenator in 1966. During his four year tenure in the Michigan State \nSenate, he served as Chairman of the Corporations and Banking \nCommittee, Chairman of the Senate Municipalities and Election \nCommittee, and as Senate Majority Whip in 1970. In November of 1972, he \nwas elected Oakland County Drain Commissioner, and he has served \nadmirably in this position for the past 28 years, making him the \nlongest active member of the Oakland County Parks and Recreation \nCommission.\n  Mr. Kuhn has often been recognized for his efforts. He has received \nthe Ford Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award, the Distinguished \nAlumni Award at the 75th Anniversary of Central Michigan University, he \nhas been honored by the Michigan Associated Underground Contractors, \nInc., in appreciation of his contributions to the underground \nconstruction industry, and is a recent recipient of the Oakland \nCounty's annual Quality People, Quality County (Q2) Award which \nrecognizes outstanding service to the community.\n  I applaud Mr. Kuhn on his extraordinary service to Oakland County, \nthe State of Michigan, and our Nation. His leadership in all phases of \nhis 60 year career has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On \nbehalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate and thank Mr. \nGeorge W.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding South Carolina native, Michael Tecklenburg, who has been \nnamed president of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf \nand Hard\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nof Hearing. I have had the privilege of knowing Michael and his family \nin Charleston for many years and I can't think of an individual more \ndeserving of this honor.\n  As a young child, Michael was initially diagnosed as being mentally \ndisabled, but his parents recognized their son's abilities and did not \ngive up until doctors discovered his true condition--deafness. Michael \nwent on to excel in his studies at St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf in \nSt. Louis and later at the University of South Carolina Honors College. \nIn 1989, he became the first deaf graduate of Columbia Law School.\n  Since 1999, Michael has been the Washington, D.C. director of the \nSouth Carolina Governor's Office. Prior to joining the Governor's \nstaff, Michael practiced law with the Washington firm of Verner, \nLiipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand. He has also served as \nlitigation counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-trust \ndivision and as assistant counsel in the Presidential Personnel Office.\n  At 37, Michael is the youngest person to serve as the Bell \nAssociation's president, a small fact that attests to his very large \ntalent. I have no doubt that he will guide the Association to many \nsuccesses during his two-year tenure.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nHonorable Gus Cifelli, who will retire later this year from a career \nwhich has included a Purple Heart, a world championship, and nearly 30 \nyears of exemplary service as a District Court Judge in the State of \nMichigan. Throughout each phase of this career, he has been a leader \nand an inspiration to those around him.\n  During World War II, Judge Cifelli served in the United States Marine \nCorps in the Pacific theater of operations, and was awarded the Purple \nHeart for bravery. Upon returning home, he attended school at the \nUniversity of Notre Dame, where he played tackle for four undefeated \nfootball teams. Following graduation, he played professional football, \nand was a member of the 1952 World Champion Detroit Lions, the Green \nBay Packers, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n  Following his professional football career, Judge Cifelli worked as a \ncasualty insurance agent and investigator and a labor relations \nrepresentative for the Ford Motor Company. In 1972, the citizens of the \nState of Michigan's 48th District elected him to serve as their \nDistrict Court Judge.\n  During his time on the bench, Mr. Cifelli has been credited with \ninitiating and implementing the Court's small claims mediation \nprocedures, staffed by volunteer attorneys. He has also created the \nVolunteer in Probation Program, which involves citizens as probation \nofficers, and been responsible for the establishment of many procedures \nand standards for the Court's operation. To say the least, he has \nindelibly left his mark upon the 48th Circuit Court.\n  Judge Cifelli is a member of the American and Michigan Bar \nAssociations, the American Judges' Association, the Justinian Society \nof Jurists and the American Judicature Society. He is also a member of \nthe Italian American Foundation, the Oakland County Association for \nRetarded Citizens, and is a former board member of Families in \nTransition and the Jewish Association for Residential Care.\n  Judge Cifelli has often been recognized for his efforts. In 1994, he \nwas named Italian American Man of the Year. In 1997, he was the \nrecipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award from the State of \nIsrael Bonds. And in 1998, he received the Law Enforcement Award.\n  I would like to thank Judge Cifelli for a lifetime of extraordinary \nachievement.

On behalf of \nthe entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Honorable Gus \nCifelli on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of \nluck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10407-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF BEN JOHNSON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nacknowledge a distinguished public servant and tireless advocate for \nour nation's cities, Ben Johnson. The people in my hometown of Detroit, \nMichigan, realize that ours is a nation of cities. Later this month, \nmany individuals will gather there to celebrate the career of this man \nwho devoted his life to ensuring that all Americans are able to share \nin our nation's wealth and prosperity.\n  Ben Johnson has dedicated his professional life to expanding \nopportunity for all Americans. For over two decades, he has tirelessly \nworked to assist communities, particularly minority communities, in \ntheir efforts to fully participate in the pursuit of the American \ndream.\n  Since 1993, Mr. Johnson has honorably served in the Clinton \nAdministration. During his tenure in this Administration, he worked in \nthe Office of Public Liaison, and served as both a Special and a Deputy \nAssistant to the President. Currently, Ben Johnson serves as the \nAssistant to the President and Director of The White House Office on \nthe President's One America Initiative. The One America Initiative \noffice he oversees is the first freestanding White House office \nestablished to close opportunity gaps that exist for minorities and the \nunderserved in this nation. In all of these capacities, he has shown a \nsteadfast commitment to ensure economic opportunities for all people.\n  Serving in the Clinton Administration was not Mr. Johnson's first job \nat 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

LEVEY MIDDLE SCHOOL NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are recognized because they are the finest public and private \nsecondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that \nset the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report \nthat nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. \nRiley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise \ntoday to recognize Glenn W. Levey Middle School in Southfield, \nMichigan, one of these nine schools.\n  Glenn W. Levey Middle School takes pride in its tradition of \naddressing the learning needs of the whole child at a crucial stage in \nhis or her development. The staff is firmly commited to educating all \nstudents through a challenging curriculum, a strong academic program, \nand a collaborative professional development program. This program \ntakes into account the multiple needs of a middle-school population, \nneeds which Levey has long worked to meet.\n  Levey was one of the first schools in the district to implement \ninterdisciplinary teaming, block scheduling, and to align its \ncurriculum with state and national standards. It is one of a select \ngroup of schools in the United States to successfully implement an \nIMAST (Integrated Mathematics, Science and Technology) Program. As a \nresult of its success in these areas, Levey was one of the first \nschools in its district to acquire North Central Accreditation, NCA, \nreceiving the highest scores in every NCA category.\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\n  The staff and students of Levey Middle School are proud of its \nhistory as a leading middle school, and the fact that it has been a \ncatalyst for change inside the district and beyond. The staff and the \ncommunity continue to set higher standards and hold greater \nexpectations. With supportive parents, hardworking students, and a \nskilled and dedicated staff, I am confident that Levey Middle School \nwill continue to set the precedent for years to come.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Glenn \nW. Levey Middle School, for I believe this is an award which speaks \nmore to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a \nfew individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize \nDr. Linda Paramore-Ford, the Principal of Glenn W. Levey Middle School, \nwhose dedication to making her school one of the finest in our Nation \nhas been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the \nentire United States Senate, I congratulate Glenn W. Levey Middle \nSchool on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the \nschool continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10408-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LAKE ORION HIGH SCHOOL NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

I am very proud to report \nthat nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. \nRiley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise \ntoday to recognize Lake Orion High School in Lake Orion, Michigan, one \nof these nine schools.\n  In fall of 1992, Lake Orion High School set about to create school \nimprovement that was purposeful to the lives of teachers and students. \nTheir goals included a desire to maintain high academic standards, \nengage the learner, relieve stress, facilitate networking, expand \ncurricular opportunities, curb attendance problems, and raise the \nresponsibility of the student for his or her own learning. Ultimately, \nthe mission was to reach the students of today and help them become the \nleaders of tomorrow.\n  All this required an enormous amount of time and extensive research. \nFirst, a staff committee devised a minimum restructuring of their \nnormal six period days by allotting three hours on Wednesday morning \nfor professional development, a program which was implemented in the \nfall of 1994. In February of 1994, the Vision of Hope staff committee \nwas formed to investigate the restructuring of the school day. \nExtensive research, visitations, debate and discussion followed and, in \nthe fall of 1996, a 4 by 4 block schedule was adopted. The block system \nhas resulted in better teacher cooperation, greater flexibility in \nscheduling, increased student choices and a more meaningful and \nrelevant curriculum for Lake Orion High School students.\n  Lake Orion High School moved into a new building in the fall of 1997, \na state of the art facility which has become an ideal setting for the \nmany innovative changes that have become a part of the curriculum. More \nimportantly, the new building stands as the perfect representation of \nthe overall growth that has occurred at Lake Orion High since the fall \nof 1992, growth which is a tribute to the shared goals and shared \nvision that administration and faculty together committed themselves to \neight years ago.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Lake \nOrion High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to \nthe effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few \nindividuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. \nJohn S. Kastran, the Principal of Lake Orion High School, whose \ndedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has \nbeen instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate Lake Orion High School on being \nnamed a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued \nsuccess in the future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10408-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n L'ANSE CREUSE MIDDLE SCHOOL--NORTH NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum.

I am very proud to report \nthat nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. \nRiley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise \ntoday to recognize L'Anse Creuse Middle School - North in Macomb, \nMichigan, one of these nine schools.\n  The mission of L'Anse Creuse Middle School--North, MSN, is for each \nstudent, with the support of staff, parents and the community, to \n``attain measurable growth intellectually, physically, and socially in \na safe, positive environment.'' Being recognized as a Blue Ribbon \nSchool is a tribute to the success that MSN has achieved in this \nregard.\n  Increased staffing, thoughtful scheduling and a dedicated staff have \nbeen the primary keys to this success. They have also been the keys to \nMSN completely ``teaming'' its students, the only school in its \ndistrict to have done so. Teachers also work as parts of instructional \nteams--most academic teachers have been teammates for at least three \nyears. This fact illustrates one of the greatest strengths of the \nschool, which is the high level of cooperation that exists between \nmembers of the faculty, cooperation which in turn facilitates student \nlearning.\n  The administration and faculty at MSN quickly realized the advantages \nthat technology offered to their new learning program and made a strong \ncommitment to improving the ability of their students to access \ncomputers. Indeed, this commitment to technology has revolutionized the \nteaching process and the management of the school. Two computer \nlaboratories are now available to staff and students. Students can also \nsign out laptop computers for overnight use to help them with their \nhomework. In addition, telephones have been placed in each classroom, \nwhich allow teachers to better communicate with parents and school \noffices, as well as with one another.\n  The administration and faculty of MSN recognize that a truly \nsuccessful middle school is one that takes elementary school students \nand prepares them to succeed in the adult world of high school. Their \nphilosophy is represented in this statement from the book The Middle \nSchool--and Beyond: ``High quality middle schools result from the \ncreative balance between elementary and secondary perspectives, between \nspecialization and generalization, between curriculum and community, \nbetween equity and excellence, between teaching the mind and touching \nthe heart.'' This is the core belief of all MSN faculty and \nadministration, and the programs they have adopted, which have been so \nsuccessful, reflect their commitment to this belief.\n  I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of MSN, \nfor I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a \nunited community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With \nthat having been said, I would like to recognize Mr. Erick Alsup, the \nPrincipal of MSN, whose dedication to making his school one of the \nfinest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. \nOn behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate L'Anse \nCreuse Middle School--North on being named a Blue Ribbon School for \n1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10408-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10408-S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF THE HONORABLE ROMAN S. GRIBBS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nHonorable\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nRoman S. Gribbs, who will retire this year after a long and successful \ncareer of service to the State of Michigan. As Sheriff of Wayne County, \nMayor of Detroit, and, for the last 18 years, a judge on the State of \nMichigan Court of Appeals, Judge Gribbs has been a statewide leader for \nover 30 years, and he has led with a strong and fair hand.\n  Judge Gribbs was born on December 29, 1925. After graduating from \nCapac High School in the Michigan Thumb area, he enlisted in the United \nStates Army, from which he received an honorable discharge in 1948, \nhaving attained the rank of Sergeant. In 1952, he graduated Magna Cum \nLaude from the University of Detroit with a degree in Economics and \nAccounting, and in 1954 he graduated from the University of Detroit Law \nSchool with a Juris Doctor degree.\n  Following graduation, Judge Gribbs remained at the University of \nDetroit Law School for two years as an instructor. He then spent two \nyears as Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor before moving into private \npractice with the firm of Shaheen, Gribbs and Shaheen. In 1966, he was \nnamed Presiding Traffic Court Referee for the City of Detroit, and in \nJune of 1968 he was appointed Sheriff of Wayne County.\n  In November of 1970, Judge Gribbs was elected Mayor of the City of \nDetroit. In his four years as Mayor, he became known not only as a \nsolid leader, but a solid man, who was willing to work with individuals \nfrom both sides of the aisle to get things done. He played a large role \nin helping the city put the unruliness of the late 1960's behind it, \nand once again begin to move in a forward direction. During this time, \nhe also served as President of the National League of Cities, a fact \nwhich illustrates that his leadership capabilities were well recognized \nby his colleagues.\n  Following his term as Mayor, Judge Gribbs briefly returned to private \npractice before being appointed to serve as a Judge for the Third \nJudicial Court in 1976. In 1982, he was elected to the State of \nMichigan Court of Appeals, and he has served in this position ever \nsince. Judge Gribbs brings to the bench a keen understanding of the \nlaw. More importantly, he carries with him an approach to its \napplication that is deeply rooted in common sense. He makes many \ndifficult decisions each year, and he makes these decisions with his \nfirst and foremost priority being to find a just solution to the \nproblem at hand. It is for this reason that he has become a well \nrespected Jurist.\n  Judge Gribbs is a member of numerous organizations, which will allow \nhim to remain an active member of society following his retirement. \nThese include the Michigan Judicial Institute, the Detroit Institute of \nArts, the Michigan Judges' Association, and the Friends of the \nArchbishop of Detroit. He has also been very active in the Boy Scouts \nof America, the American Judicature Society, the Family Conciliation \nCourt, the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, \nthe Michigan Youth Commission, the World Trade Club of Detroit and the \nSlavic American National Foundation. In addition, he is presently on \nthe Board of Directors of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School, the Public \nAdministration Foundation and the Northville Township Community \nFoundation.\n  Mr. President, Judge Gribbs' contributions to the City of Detroit and \nthe State of Michigan are truly immeasurable. I would like to thank him \nfor his dedication and his many efforts throughout his career. His \nleadership during this time has been exceptional, and it will be dearly \nmissed by the State of Michigan. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I congratulate the Honorable Roman S. Gribbs on a wonderful and \nsuccessful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10409-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10409-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4461) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration and Related Agencies programs for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n  At 12:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution; in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, \nto clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protection, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                      WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Federal \nServices Subcommittee, I am pleased to introduce legislation to amend \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, one of the cornerstone of our \nnation's good government laws. Enacted in 1989, the WPA is intended to \nprotect federal employees from workplace retaliation when disclosing \nwaste, fraud, or abuse. The law was passed unanimously in 1989, and \nstrengthened through amendments in 1994, again with unanimous support \nof both houses of Congress. I am joined today by Senator Levin, who was \na primary sponsor of the landmark 1989 Act and the 1994 amendments.\n  A key goal of the Whistleblower Protection Act was to close the \nloopholes that had developed under prior law. Back in 1978, Congress \npassed the Civil Service Reform Act, which included statutory \nwhistleblower rights that elevated certain disclosures to absolute \nprotection due to their public policy significance. The 1978 Act \nprotected ``a'' disclosure evidencing a reasonable belief of specified \nmisconduct, with certain listed statutory exceptions--classified or \nother information whose release was specifically barred by other \nstatutes. Despite statutory language, the Federal Court of Appeals, the \nMerit Systems Protection Board, and the Office of Special Counsel--all \ncreated in 1978 to investigate and adjudicate the WPA--appeared to \ninterpret the law as discretionary rather than absolute.\n  This removed the law's foundation. Congress, in 1978, had intended to \ncreate absolute categories of protection to end the inherent chilling \neffect in constitutional balancing tests that required employees to \nguess whether they were covered by the First Amendment. Congress sought \nto eliminate the confusion by resolving the balance in favor of free \nspeech rights for serious misconduct listed in the statute. \nUnfortunately, the Federal Circuit and administrative agencies did not \nrespect this mandate and created loopholes based on factors irrelevant \nto the public, such as whether an employee had selfless motives or was \nthe first to expose particular misconduct.\n  As a result, a cornerstone of the Whistleblower Protection Act was to \nclose these loopholes that arose under prior law by amending protection \nof ``a'' disclosure to ``any'' disclosure which meets the law's \nstandards. The purpose was to clearly prohibit any new exceptions to \nthe law's coverage. Only Congress has that authority. Again, however, \nin both formal and informal interpretations of the Act, loopholes \ncontinued to proliferate.\n  Congress responded to this reluctance to abide by congressional \nintent through the passage of the 1994 amendments. The Governmental \nAffairs Committee report on the amendments rebutted prior \ninterpretations by the Federal Circuit, the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, and the Office of Special Counsel that there were exceptions to \n``any.'' The Committee report concluded, ``The plain language of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for `any \ndisclosure,' regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of \nthe disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.''\n  I am pleased to note that since the enactment of the 1994 amendments, \nboth the Office of the Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard generally have honored congressional boundaries. However, the \nFederal Circuit continues to disregard clear statutory language that \nthe Act covers disclosures made to supervisors, to possible wrongdoers \n(Horton v. Dept. of Navy 66 F.3d 279, 1995), or as part of their job \nduties. (Willis v. Dept. of Agriculture, 141 F.3d 1139, 1998).\n  In order to protect the statute's cornerstone that ``any\" lawful \ndisclosure evidencing significant abuse is covered by the Whistleblower \nProtection Act, our bill would codify the repeated and unconditional \nstatements of congressional intent and legislative history. It would \namend sections 2302(b)(8)(A) and 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, U.S.C. to \nprotect any disclosure of information. This would be without \nrestriction to time, place, form, motive or context, made to any \naudience unless specifically excluded in section 2302(b)(8) by an \nemployee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary \ncourse of an employee's duties, which the employee or applicant \nreasonably believes evidences any violation of any law, rule, or \nregulation, or other misconduct specified in section 2302(b)(8). These \ninclude gross waste, gross mismanagement, abuse of authority, or a \nsubstantial and specific danger to public\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\nhealth or safety. Consistent with current law, if the disclosure \nevidences a prohibited personnel practice against the employee making \nthe disclosure, his or her remedy will continue to be available through \nsection 2302(b)(9), rather than section 2302(b)(8).\n  The exceptions resulting from the Federal Circuit's rulings defeat \nthe underlying good government goals of the Whistleblower Protection \nAct by removing protection where it counts the most: for federal \nemployees, who acting as public servants, are carrying out their \nresponsibilities to the public as employees of their agencies. By \nstripping protection from in-house disclosures, the Federal Circuit \nimposed loopholes that chill employees from working within their \nagencies to address potential waste, mismanagement, or abuse issues. If \nemployees seek to solve problems within the chain of command, they \ncould forfeit their rights to whistleblower protection from subsequent \nretaliation under the Court's rulings in Horton and Willis. To maintain \nprotection against reprisal, federal employees must now bypass normal \norganizational activities responsible for implementing the law. \nMoreover, the loophole created by Willis removes protection when \nemployees are performing their job duties. Because of the Court's \nrulings, the intent of the Act to create an environment where federal \nemployees can safely serve the public on the job has been compromised.\n  Secondly, the legislation would institutionalize a principle \ncurrently expressed by a ban on spending on enforcement of any \nnondisclosure agreement that does not contain language specifically \nprotecting an employee's rights under various open government statutes. \nThis includes the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Military \nWhistleblower Protection Act, and the Lloyd Lafollette Act, which \nprohibits discrimination against government employees who communicate \nwith Congress. This prohibition has been passed on an annual basis \nsince 1988 as part of the yearly appropriations process. Our bill would \nmake it a prohibited personnel practice to take a personnel action \nimplementing or enforcing nondisclosure rules without specific notice \nof the listed statutes and their supremacy in the event of a conflict.\n  The appropriations provision, known as the ``anti-gag statute,'' has \nproved effective against attempts by agencies to override the \nWhistleblower Protection Act through prior restraint. The law \noriginally passed as a spending control against abuses of national \nsecurity secrecy, in which as a procedural prerequisite for security \nclearances, employees had to waive their constitutional and statutory \nfree speech rights. Since its passage, however, it has been useful \nagainst gag orders in broad areas of specific and generic public \nconcerns, including gag orders imposed as a precondition for employment \nand resolution of disputes, as well as general agency policies barring \nemployees from communicating directly with Congress or the public. \nPrior restraint not only has a severe chilling effect, but strikes at \nthe heart of this body's ability to perform its oversight duties by \nnegating the repeatedly reaffirmed unequivocal congressional policy \nthat whistleblowers have the right to make protected disclosures \nanonymously as a way to prevent retaliation.\n  Disclosing classified information is prohibited by law except to \nspecific audiences listed in section 2302 and would not be a protected \ndisclosure under this legislation. Nor would this legislation require \nthe Merit System Protection Board to review security clearance \ndeterminations. The Supreme Court clearly spoke on this issue in Dept. \nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), which found that denial of a \nsecurity clearance is not . . . an ``adverse action.'' The Court upheld \nthe Board's jurisdiction over due process procedures underlying a \nclearance decision. Egan stands as a bright line test, and if an \nemployee requests review of the substantive judgments underlying a \nsecurity clearance, OSC examiners, administrative judges, and members \nof the MSPB would be justified in denying jurisdiction. However, the \nBoard could have jurisdiction if an employee complained that he or she \nsuffered a prohibited personnel practice, because he or she was forced \nto sign an illegal nondisclosure agreement or its terms were enforced, \nregardless of context.\n  Congress repeatedly has reaffirmed its intent that employees should \nnot be forced to sign agreements that supercede an employee's rights \nunder good government statutes. Moreover, Congress has unanimously \nsupported the concept that federal employees should not be subject to \nprior restraint from disclosing wrongdoing nor suffer retaliation for \nspeaking out.\n  Lastly, the bill provides the Special Counsel with authority to \nappear and represent the interests of the Office of Special Counsel in \ncivil actions brought in connection with the exercise of its authority \nto protect the merit system against prohibited personnel practices \nunder section 2302(b)(8) and violations of the Hatch Act. It also gives \nthe Special Counsel the right to seek review of decisions by the Merit \nSystems Protection Board before the Federal Circuit where the Special \nCounsel determines that the Board issued an erroneous decision in a \nwhistleblower retaliation case or in a case arising under the Hatch \nAct, or that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on the \nenforcement of those laws.\n  Under the bill, in Board cases in which the Special Counsel was not a \nparty, the Special Counsel must first petition the Board for \nreconsideration of its decision before seeking review. The Court of \nAppeals shall grant petitions for review by the Special Counsel at its \ndiscretion.\n  This additional authority would enable the Office of Special Counsel \nto fulfill its statutory missions more effectively to protect federal \nwhistleblowers against retaliation and to enforce the Hatch Act. While \nOSC, under current law, has a central role as public prosecutor in \ncases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, it in no way \nauthorizes OSC to seek judicial review of an MSPB decision that the \nSpecial Counsel considers erroneous. Our legislation recognizes that \nproviding the Special Counsel the authority to seek such review--in \nprecedential cases--is crucial to ensuring the promotion of the public \ninterests furthered by these statutes.\n  Moreover, under existing law, the Special Counsel cannot appear to \nrepresent himself or herself as a party, or even as an amicus curiae, \nwhere another party has invoked the jurisdiction of the Court of \nAppeals in a whistleblower retaliation or Hatch Act case. As a result, \nthe Special Counsel, who Congress intended would be a vigorous, \nindependent advocate for protection of the merit system, cannot \nparticipate at all in the arena in which the law is largely shaped: the \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This bill reflects our \nconviction that the public interests underlying the whistleblower \nretaliation laws and the Hatch Act are best served by ensuring that the \nSpecial Counsel's views are considered by the Court in important cases.\n  Mr. President, there is significant history that defines \ncongressional intent with respect to ensuring that federal \nwhistleblowers are protected from retaliatory measures. It is my \nintention that this bill will begin the needed dialogue to guarantee \nthat any disclosures within the boundaries of the statutory language \nare protected. As the ranking member of the Federal Services \nSubcommittee, I will seek hearings in the next Congress on the \nWhistleblower Protection Act and the amendments I am proposing today. \nIt is my intention to request a hearing that would be independent of \nany reauthorization hearing held for the MSPB and the OSC, both of \nwhose authority expires in 2002.\n  There is strong support for the legislation Senator Levin and I are \nintroducing today. I ask unanimous consent, in addition to the text of \nthe bill, that I be allowed to insert into the Record immediately \nfollowing my statement, a petition signed by the heads of 72 \norganizations urging Congress to restore the Whistleblower Protection \nAct to its 1994 boundaries. Among the 70-plus groups that support this \neffort are the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Government Employees, \nBlacks in Government, National Association of Treasury Agents, National \nTreasury Employees Union, Common Cause, and the Federation of American \nScientists. I also wish to extend my appreciation to the Special \nCounsel and the Acting Chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board for \nthe technical assistance they provided. Lastly, I would\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\nlike to commend the Government Accountability Project for its \ndedication and perseverance over the years. Since 1977, GAP has sought \nto protect the public interest and promote government accountability by \ndefending whistleblowers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort to ensure that \ncongressional intent embodied in the Whistleblower Protection Act is \ncodified to ensure that the law is not weakened further.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Government surveys have confirmed that some \n     half million employees annually witness serious government \n     misconduct but choose to do nothing; and\n       Whereas: The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a \n     monopoly of judicial review for the Act, has functionally \n     overturned the law since congressional approval of 1994 \n     amendments strengthening it; and\n       Whereas: The Court has created a series of loopholes in the \n     WPA removing the Act's coverage in the most common scenarios \n     where it is needed:\n       when employees blow the whistle to co-workers, superiors or \n     others in the chain of command, or to suspected wrongdoers;\n       when employees' disclosures challenge policies that are \n     illegal or otherwise improper, or\n       when employees make disclosures in the course of doing \n     their jobs.\n       These loopholes flatly contradict explicit 1989 statutory \n     language, which protects disclosures in ``any'' context, and \n     1994 legislative history warning the Federal Circuit that \n     ``any'' means ``any,'' without restrictions and defining it \n     to ban exceptions for ``time, place, motive or context;'' and\n       Whereas: In 1999 the Court made it practically impossible \n     or anyone to be recognized as deserving whistleblower \n     protection regardless of circumstances. Under the Act passed \n     by Congress, whistleblowers qualify for protection if they \n     make disclosures that they ``reasonably believe evidences'' \n     wrongdoing. However, without an explanation of the basis for \n     overturning some twenty years of prior precedent, the Court \n     ruled that an employee does not qualify for protection \n     without ``irrefragable proof'' of the alleged wrongdoing. \n     Webster's Dictionary defines ``irrefragable'' as \n     ``incontrovertible, undeniable, incapable of being \n     overthrown;'' and\n       Whereas: The practical impact of the decision is that if \n     there are two sides to a story about alleged misconduct, it \n     is not possible for a federal employee to be protected as a \n     whistleblower. In light of this decision, no organization can \n     responsibly advise whistleblowers that they have a realistic \n     chance of defending themselves; and\n       Whereas: In the same 1999 decision, the Court ordered that \n     every employee who exercise Whistleblower Protection Act \n     rights must be investigated to determine whether the employee \n     had a conflict of interest for raising the issue in the first \n     place. As a result, the Act actually subjects whistleblowers \n     to intimidation and harassment rather than protecting them \n     from it. This violates Congress' 1994 ban on retaliatory \n     investigations for engaging in protected activity such as \n     exercising appeal rights; and\n       Whereas: There has never been any expression of legislative \n     support either for the loopholes created by the Court or its \n     requirement that whistleblowers prove their charges \n     ``irrefragably.'' The court' extremist activism overturned \n     the repeatedly stated unanimous intent. Restoring the \n     congressional mandate does not require opening any new \n     debates on previously resolved issues; and\n       Whereas: A cornerstone of any free speech law is \n     prohibiting prior restraint, threats and pre-emptive strikes \n     that silence employees through mandatory nondisclosure \n     agreements and gag orders. For over 12 years Congress has \n     passed an annual spending ban on enforcing such gag orders. \n     The time has come to eliminate the uncertainty of annual \n     renewal for this free speech cornerstone.\n       Therefore: We, the undersigned organizations, petition \n     Congress to restore the Whistleblower Protection Act to its \n     1994 boundaries, prevent recurrence of judicial activism that \n     neutralizes the value of this good government law and \n     permanently pass the prohibition on gag orders. This can \n     occur by codifying current appropriations language and prior \n     WPA legislative history to cancel judicial decisions that \n     unraveled the law, and by restoring normal judicial review in \n     any U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals--the normal course under \n     the Administrative Procedures Act and the structure approved \n     by Congress when the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was \n     passed.\n       James K.

A bill to create a Federal drug court program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               federal drug courts foundation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Federal Drug Courts Foundation Act of 2000.'' This legislation will \nusher in an new era in the struggle against drug-related crime by \nestablishing a system of federal drug courts. These courts will help \nbring an end to the cycle of repeated and escalating crimes committed \nby small-time drug offenders. As General Barry McCaffrey has said: \n``The establishment of drug courts . . . constitutes one of the most \nmonumental changes in social justice in this country since World War \nII.''\n  Mr. President, I have long fought against the scourge of drug-related \ncrime that has plagued this nation. The legislation I introduce today \nwill continue that fight by creating a three-year pilot program \nestablishing federal drug courts in ten cities selected by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Drug courts are a response to the fact that more than fifty percent \nof state parole violators were under the influence of drugs, alcohol, \nor both when they committed their new offense. They represent a \ncreative new way to address this disturbing fact and are aimed at \ncleaning up first-time, small-time offenders through comprehensive \nsupervision, drug testing and treatment.\n  Drug court programs have been successfully implemented at the state \nlevel. Since 1989, more than 100,000 drug offenders have participated \nin drug court programs at the state level and there are now more than \n400 drug courts in existence. These drug courts have proven to be both \neffective and cost-efficient. A study in one New York drug court showed \nthat only 11% of offenders were rearrested as compared to 27% in the \ngeneral prison population. And while the incarceration of a drug \noffender costs between $20,000 and $50,000 annually, a drug court costs \nless than $2,500 per offender.\n  Drugs continue to be one of the greatest threats to our children and \nto the well-being of our communities. For this reason, we must continue \nto fight against the scourge of illegal drugs ravaging our communities. \nTo that end, I am introducing the ``Federal Drug Courts Foundations Act \nof 2000,'' legislation designed to sensibly combat the epidemic of \ndrug-related crime. I hope that this much-needed legislation will enjoy \nyour support and I look forward to working with each and every one of \nyou in order to get this legislation enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the legislation be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to law enforcement agencies to \npurchase firearms needed to perform law enforcement duties; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   police gun buyback assistance act\n\n  Mr. TORRECELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill reduce the number of firearms on the street and help guns out of \nthe hands of criminals. In the wake of the tragic shootings this year \nin Michigan and Pennsylvania, we are reminded of what happens when the \nwrong people have access to guns. These tragic shootings become even \nmore troubling when they involve a former police gun or firearms \npreviously involved in a crime.\n  It is vital that law enforcement agencies have the very best \nequipment available to ensure their safety and to protect America's \ncommunities, but purchasing new weapons can be expensive, particularly \nfor cash-strapped municipalities. To deal with this problem, for almost \ntwo decades law enforcement agencies have been reselling their\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\nold guns to dealers or auctioning them off to the public to offset the \ncost of purchasing new guns. However, this practice has led to an \nunintended result--increased risk that these guns would end up back on \nthe streets and in the hands of criminals.\n  In the past nine years, firearms once used by law enforcement \nagencies have been involved in more than 3,000 crimes, including 293 \nhomicides, 301 assaults and 279 drug-related crimes throughout the \nUnited States. Just last year, Bufford Furrow, a white supremacist, \nused a Glock pistol that was decommissioned and sold by a police agency \nin the State of Washington to terrorize and shoot children at a Jewish \ncommunity center in Los Angeles and then kill a postal worker. Members \nof the Latin Kings, a violent Chicago street gang, used guns formerly \nowned by the Miami-Dade Police Department in Florida to commit violent \ncrimes in Illinois. And a 1996 investigation by the New York State \ninspector general found that weapons used by New York law enforcement \nofficers had been used in crimes in at least two other states.\n  In is time that we help our law enforcement agencies do what they \nhave long tried to do--get out of the business of selling guns. Under \nthe bill I introduce today, law enforcement agencies will no longer be \nforced to resell their old guns or guns seized from criminals to help \nthem obtain the new weapons that are necessary to carry out their \nduties. Instead, this bill would provide grants to state or local law \nenforcement agencys to assist them in purchasing new firearms so that \nthey will no longer be forced to sell their decommissioned firearms to \nanyone. In order to receive these grants, the law enforcement agencies \nmust simply agree to either destroy their decommissioned guns or not \nsell them to the public.\n  A growing number of states and cities have already decided to ban the \npractice of pouring old police guns into the consumer market. They \nrecognize that the extra money gained from selling old police guns is \nnot worth the price of possible human suffering or loss of life. It is \nsimply bad policy for governments to be suppliers of guns and \npotentially add to the problem of gun violence in America. Regardless \nof where one stands on gun control, logic, and common sense and decency \ndemand that we also recognize this simple truth and unite behind moving \nthis bill to passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Police Gun Buyback \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Buford Furrow, a white supremacist, used a Glock pistol \n     decommissioned and sold by a law enforcement agency in the \n     State of Washington, to shoot children at a Jewish community \n     center in Los Angeles and kill a postal worker.\n       (2) Twelve firearms were recently stolen during shipment \n     from the Miami-Dade Police Department to Chicago, Illinois. \n     Four of these firearms have been traced to crimes in Chicago, \n     Illinois, including a shooting near a playground.\n       (3) In the past 9 years, decommissioned firearms once used \n     by law enforcement agencies have been involved in more than \n     3,000 crimes, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 \n     drug-related crimes.\n       (4) Many State and local law enforcement departments also \n     engage in the practice of reselling firearms involved in the \n     commission of a crime and confiscated. Often these firearms \n     are assault weapons that were in circulation prior to the \n     restrictions imposed by the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994.\n       (5) Law enforcement departments in the States of New York \n     and Georgia, the City of Chicago, and other localities have \n     adopted the practice of destroying decommissioned firearms.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the \n     number of firearms on the streets by assisting State and \n     local law enforcement agencies to eliminate the practice of \n     transferring decommissioned firearms to any person.\n\n      SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Grants.--The Attorney General may make grants to States \n     or units of local government--\n       (1) to assist States and units of local government in \n     purchasing new firearms without transferring decommissioned \n     firearms to any person; and\n       (2) to destroy decommissioned firearms.\n       (b) Eligibility.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), to be \n     eligible to receive a grant under this Act, a State or unit \n     of local government shall certify that it has in effect a law \n     or official policy that--\n       (A) eliminates the practice of transferring any \n     decommissioned firearm to any person; and\n       (B) provides for the destruction of a decommissioned \n     firearm.\n       (2) Exception.--A State or unit of local government may \n     transfer a decommissioned firearm to another law enforcement \n     agency.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--A State or unit of local government that \n     receives a grant under this Act shall use such grant only to \n     purchase new firearms.\n\n      SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS.\n\n       (a) State Applications.--To request a grant under this Act, \n     the chief executive of a State shall submit an application, \n     signed by the Attorney General of the State requesting the \n     grant, to the Attorney General in such form and containing \n     such information as the Attorney General may reasonably \n     require.\n       (b) Local Applications.--To request a grant under this Act, \n     the chief executive of a unit of local government shall \n     submit an application, signed by the chief law enforcement \n     officer in the unit of local government requesting the grant, \n     to the Attorney General in such form and containing such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require.\n\n     SEC. 5. REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations to \n     implement this Act, which shall specify the information that \n     must be included and the requirements that the States and \n     units of local government must meet in submitting \n     applications for grants under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORTING.\n\n       A State or unit of local government shall report to the \n     Attorney General not later than 2 years after funds are \n     received under this Act, regarding the implementation of this \n     Act. Such report shall include budget assurances that any \n     future purchase of a firearm by the law enforcement agency \n     will be possible without transferring a decommissioned \n     firearm.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``firearm'' has the same meaning given such \n     term in section 921(a)(3) of title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``decommissioned firearm'' means a firearm--\n       (A) no longer in service or use by a law enforcement \n     agency; or\n       (B) involved in the commission of a crime and confiscated \n     and no longer needed for evidentiary purposes; and\n        (3) the term ``person'' has the same meaning given such \n     term in section 1 of title 1 of the United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2001 through \n     2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 3193. A bill to amend section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to exempt State and local political committees from required \nnotification of section 527 status; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     finance disclosure legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in our desire to close the so-called \n527 loophole involving campaign financing earlier this year, I believe \nwe may have gone too far in the disclosure requirements.\n  In the bill ultimately creating P.L. 106-230, we essentially adopted \nthe House language without any amendments. When it became law on July \n1, 2000, one of the provisions required candidates for state and local \noffices to file Form 8871 by July 31, 2000.\n  The goal of the new law is to find out who is contributing to 527 \npolitical organizations that have proliferated in recent years. The \norganizations. including the Sierra Club's 527, were taking in large \nsize donations and yet not have and to reveal who the donors were.\n  Under the new law, contributions in excess of $200 by a single person \nmust be disclosed. Expenditures by a 527 organization in excess of $500 \nalso would have to be disclosed. However, these financial disclosures--\nthe heart and soul of the bill--do not apply to candidates for state \nand local elections. Clearly, the rules for state and local elections \nare to be regulated by the states, not the federal government.\n  Yet, under the new law, candidates for state and local offices must \nfile Form 8871 with the IRS. This form essentially notifies IRS that \nstate or local officeholder has established a 527\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\norganization. It must also list the name and address of the \norganization, the purpose of the organization; the names and addresses \nof its officers and highly compensated persons and identify a contact \nperson and custodian of records and its Board of Directors (if any).\n  Since we have exempted state and local candidates from having to file \nfinancial disclosure statements, I see no reason why they should be \nburdened with filing Form 8857. This requirement serves no purpose \nexcept to create needless paperwork for both the candidates and the \nIRS.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to exempt state and local \ncandidates from this burden just as the current law exempts 527 \nOrganizations that do not expect that they will raise $25,000 do not \nhave to file this information.\n  My bill is retroactive so that some candidates for local office who \nwere caught unaware of the filing requirement do not face any \npenalties.\n  It is my hope that after this election, when campaign finance reform \nwill be debated in a less political environment, that this common sense \ntechnical amendment will be included in reform legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Reid, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 3196. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Spark M. Matsunaga \nHydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n\n                george e. brown, jr. hyrodgen future act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Bingaman, Chairman and Ranking Member of Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, my colleague on the Committee, Senator \nBayh, my friend from Nevada, Senator Reid, and my senior colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Inouye, to introduce legislation that will accelerate \nthe ongoing efforts for the development of a fuel for the future--\nhydrogen. Hydrogen is an efficient and environmentally friendly energy \ncarrier that can be obtained using conventional or renewable resources. \nThere is strong evidence that hydrogen can be a solution for America's \nlong-term energy needs.\n  All indications suggest that America's summer of discontent is going \nto continue and become the winter of discontent with respect to energy \nprices. Americans have paid record-breaking prices at the pump this \nsummer. They will continue to suffer escalating prices this winter too. \nHigher energy prices hit most those Americans who can afford it the \nleast.\n  Our Nation is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. We rely on imports \nto meet our needs. Our dependence on imported oil has been increasing \nfor years. Oil imports have been rising for the past two decades. The \ncombination of lower domestic production and increased demand has led \nto imports making up a larger share of total oil consumed in the United \nStates. In 1992, crude oil imports accounted for approximately 45 \npercent of our domestic demand. Last year crude oil imports amounted \nfor 58 percent. The Energy Information Administration's Short-Term \nOutlook forecasts that oil imports will exceed 60 percent of total \ndemand this year. EIA's long-term forecasts have oil imports \nconstituting 66 percent of U.S. supply by 2010, and more than 71 \npercent by 2000.\n  Continued reliance on such large quantities of imported oil will \nfrustrate our efforts to develop a national energy policy and set the \nstage for energy emergencies in the future.\n  Mr. President, the way to improve our energy outlook is to adopt \nenergy conservation, encourage energy efficiency, and support renewable \nenergy programs. Above all, we must develop energy resources that \ndiversify our energy mix and strengthen our energy security.\n  Now is the time to increase our efforts to develop new sources of \nenergy. Growing evidence points to hydrogen as a fuel to resolve our \nenergy problems and satisfy a wide variety of the world's energy needs.\n  Hydrogen as a fuel is not a new concept. For more than two decades \nthere has been global interest in hydrogen as a renewable fuel. \nProgress is being made at an accelerating pace. Fuel cells for \ndistributed stationary power are being commercialized and installed in \nvarious locations in the United States and worldwide. Transit bus \ndemonstrations are underway in both the United States and Europe. Major \nautomobile companies are poised to deploy fuel cell passengers cars \nwithin the next few years. All these activities involve government and \nprivate sector cooperation.\n  But many problems and challenges remain. Hydrogen production costs \nfrom both fossil and renewable energy sources remain high. Attractive \nlow-cost storage technologies are not available. There is an inadequate \ninfrastructure.\n  We need to address these challenges and barriers if we are to enjoy \nthe fruits of an efficient and environmentally friendly energy source. \nThis Senator believes that an aggressive research and development \nprogram can help us overcome many of these challenges such as bringing \ndown the production costs from fossil and renewable sources, by \nadvancing storage technologies, and addressing safety concerns with \nefforts in establishing codes and standards.\n  Our Nation needs an active and focused research, development, and \ndemonstration program to make the breakthroughs necessary to make \nhydrogen a viable source of energy.\n  My predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga was one of the first to focus \nattention on hydrogen by sponsoring hydrogen research legislation. The \nMatsunaga Hydrogen Act, as this legislation has come to be known, was \ndesigned to accelerate development of domestic capability to produce an \neconomically renewable energy source in sufficient quantities to reduce \nthe Nation's dependence on conventional fuels. As a result of Senator \nMatsunaga's vision, the Department of Energy has been conducting \nresearch that will advance technologies for cost-effective production, \nstorage, and utilization of hydrogen. The Hydrogen Future Act of 1996 \nexpanded the research, and development, and demonstration program under \nthe Matsunaga Act. It authorized activities leading to production, \nstorage, transformation, and use of hydrogen for industrial, \nresidential, transportation, and utility applications.\n  My good friend and former colleague in the House, Representative \nGeorge E. Brown, Jr., was instrumental in the introduction and passage \nof the Hydrogen Future Act. Serving as the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the House Science Committee, Congressman Brown earned a reputation \nas a true champion and advocate for science. He was an early supporter \nof hydrogen as a source of energy. He was the principal sponsor of the \ncompanion legislation to Senator Matsunaga's bill in the House. \nCongressman Brown passed away on July 15, 1999.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today reauthorizes \nand amends the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. I propose that Congress \ndedicate this legislation to George Brown's memory and cite the Act as \nGeorge E. Brown, Jr. Hydrogen Future Act.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today is consistent with the \nthinking of experts who have looked at this issue. The President's \nCommittee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) issued a report \ntitled ``Federal Energy Research and Development for the Challenges of \nthe Twenty-First Century'' in response to a request from President \nClinton to review the national energy R portfolio and make \nrecommendations on how to ensure that the U.S. has a program that \naddresses its energy needs for the next century. In its report issued \nin November 1997, PCAST proposed a substantial increase in Federal \nspending for applied energy technology R, with the largest share \ngoing to energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. This was \na major change in focus. With this new R emphasis, the PCAST report \nacknowledges and supports advances in a wide range of both hydrogen-\nproducing and hydrogen-using technologies. The bill I am introducing \ntoday supports the recommendations of PCAST.\n  The Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel (HTAP) was established pursuant \nto the Spark Matsunaga Hydrogen Act. The panel's primary functions are \nto advise the Secretary of Energy on the\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nimplementation and conduct of the Department of Energy's Hydrogen \nProgram and to review and make recommendations on the economic, \ntechnical, and environmental consequences of deploying hydrogen energy \nsystems. The Hydrogen Future Act gave additional functions to HTAP. The \nAct requires HTAP to evaluate the effectiveness of the Department's \nHydrogen Program and make recommendations for improvements. HTAP is \nalso required to make recommendations for future legislation.\n  The panel, appointed by the Secretary of Energy, has broad \nrepresentation from industry, government, and academia. While some \nmembers of the panel represent the hydrogen community, others represent \nfossil energy, industrial gases, transportation, and environment \ngroups--areas affected by the development and deployment of hydrogen \nenergy systems. This mix provides the panel with a balanced perspective \nthat allows diversity of viewpoints. Members serve on a pro-bono basis.\n  HTAP, in its report to Congress has strongly endorsed reauthorizing \nthe Hydrogen Future Act. Today's bill reflects most of the \nrecommendations of this expert body.\n  The long-term vision for hydrogen energy is that sometime well into \n21st century, hydrogen will join electricity as one of our Nation's \nprimary energy carriers, and hydrogen will ultimately be produced from \nrenewable sources. But fossil fuels will be a significant long-term \ntransitional resource. In the next twenty years, increasing concerns \nabout global climate changes and energy security concerns will help \nbring about penetration of hydrogen in several niche markets. The \ngrowth of fuel cell technology will allow the introduction of hydrogen \nin both transportation and electricity sectors.\n  We are a long way from realizing this vision for hydrogen energy. But \nprogress is being made and many challenges and barriers remain. \nSustained effort is the only way to overcome these challenges and \nbarriers. We need to support a strategy that focuses on mid-term and \nlong-term goals. We must support development of technologies that \nenable distributed electric-generation fuel cell systems and hydrogen \nfuel cell vehicles for transportation applications. For the long-term, \nwe should look to hydrogen technologies that enhance renewable systems \nand offer society the promise of clean, abundant fuels.\n  Significant forces are coming together that may accelerate wider \nacceptance of hydrogen as an energy source. Industry is moving ahead \nwith fuel cell developments at a rapid pace. Many companies are forming \npartnerships to bring new technologies to the market place. Daimler-\nChrysler, Ford, and Ballard have formed a partnership and pledged $1.5 \nbillion for commercialization of automotive fuel cells. Edison \nDevelopment Company, General Electric, SoCal Gas, and Plug Power have \nagreement to commercialize residential fuel cells. There are other \ncompanies pursuing the same market sector and are developing high \nperformance fuel cell technology for automotive and electrical \ngeneration systems.\n  Initiatives for controls of emissions from automobiles such as \nCalifornia's zero emissions vehicle requirements favor early \nintroduction of hydrogen powered vehicles. There is significant \nindustry interest in bringing fuel cell technology to mining \noperations.\n  The Department of Energy administers the Hydrogen Program that \nsupports a broad range of research and development projects in the \nareas of hydrogen production, storage, and use in a safer and less \nexpensive manner in the near future. Progress in several research and \ndevelopment areas shows promise that some of these new technologies may \nbecome available for wider use in the next few years. Some of the \npromising technologies include advanced natural gas- and biomass-based \nhydrogen production technologies, high pressure gaseous and cryogas \nstorage systems, reversible PEM fuel cell systems. Others lay the \ngroundwork for long range opportunities.\n  The Hydrogen Program utilizes the talents of our national \nlaboratories and our universities. National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory, Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge, as \nwell as Jet Propulsion Laboratory are involved in the program. DOE \nField Office at Golden, Colorado, and Nevada Operations Office in \nNevada are also involved. University-led centers-of-excellence have \nbeen established at Florida Solar Energy Center at University of Miami \nand University of Hawaii. The U.S. participation in the International \nEnergy Agency contributes to the advancement of DOE hydrogen research \nthrough international cooperation.\n  The DOE Hydrogen Program is well managed and run by dedicated \nmanagers and capable and talented technologists. The program has also \nbuilt strong links with the industry. This has resulted in strong \nindustry participation and cost sharing. HTAP, in its review of the \nprogram reached similar conclusions.\n  The legislation I am introducing today reauthorizes the Hydrogen \nFuture Act and adds provisions for the demonstration of hydrogen \ntechnologies at government facilities. It highlights the potential of \nhydrogen as an efficient and environmentally friendly source of energy, \nthe need for a strong partnership between the Federal government, \nindustry, and academia, and the importance of continued support for \nhydrogen research. It fosters collaboration between Federal agencies, \nstate and local governments, universities, and industry. It encourages \nprivate sector investment and cost sharing in the development of \nhydrogen as an energy source.\n  The legislation authorizes $250 million over the next five years for \nresearch and development of technologies for hydrogen production, \nstorage and use. This will allow advancement of technologies such as \nsmaller-scale production systems that are applicable to distributed-\ngeneration and vehicle applications, advanced pressure vessels, \nphotobiological and photocatalytic production of hydrogen, and carbon \nnanotubes, graphite nanofibers, and fullerenes.\n  It also authorizes $50 million for conducting integrated \ndemonstrations of hydrogen technologies at government facilities. This \nwill help secure industry participation through competitive \nsolicitations for technology development and testing. It may encourage \nintegration of renewable energy resources with hydrogen storage in \ndistributed power scenarios. It will test the viability of hydrogen \nproduction, storage, and use. It will lead to development of hydrogen-\nbased operating experience acceptable to meet safety codes and \nstandards.\n  By supporting the development of hydrogen technologies, we will be \nushering in an era of a non-polluting source of energy that will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. The price we will pay for development of \nthis clean and renewable energy is minuscule compared to the benefits. \nAnd Mr. President, if we develop hydrogen technologies, we will be less \nlikely to be held hostage by our friends in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide each \nAmerican child with a KidSave Account, and for other purposes: to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                            kidsave accounts\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, many of the things we do in the Senate \ninvolve making investments in America's future. Investments in research \nthrough the National Science Foundation or investments in \ninfrastructure development through the Department of Transportation \nreap great rewards for the citizens of tomorrow.\n  Today, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Santorum, Moynihan, \nGrassley, and Breaux in introducing a piece of legislation that \nrepresents a remarkable new investment in the financial security of \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  This proposal, called KidSave, aims to give every American a stake in \nthe growth of the American economy, to help all Americans accumulate \nwealth and assets, and to teach all Americans firsthand the value of \nsavings and compounding interest. Not only will this legislation \npromote savings and investments across all income levels, but it will \nalso help to close the growing wealth gap.\n  One of the discoveries I have made in researching this idea is that \nthe most important variable in compounding interest rates is time. The \nearlier you start, the more wealth you build.\n  One of the poster children for understanding the value of compounding \ninterest is Osceola McCarty. Osceola was a Hattiesburg, Mississippi, \nwasherwoman, who after more than seven decades of low-wage work donated \n$150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi--wealth she had \nbuilt by saving a little bit of money over a long period of time.\n  Wealth has also empowered the Federal employees I talk to in the \nhalls of the Senate, who are excited about their ability to participate \nin their government Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, and who talk more \nknowledgeably than me about index funds and the difference between a \nstock and bond. These employees, and other workers across the country \nwho are able to participate in employer-sponsored pension plans and \nIRAs, feel more confident about their own futures and their own \nretirement security. They are confident that they won't face poverty in \ntheir final years.\n  Our KidSave proposal will gave that same sense of confidence and \npride in one's future to all future generations of Americans.\n  How does KidSave work? The KidSave program would use part of the \nsurplus to provide each newborn child with a $2,000 KidSave retirement \nsavings loan to jumpstart his or her retirement savings. Each KidSave \nloan will be deposited into a qualified KidSave account. The KidSave \nprogram will be administered by the Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, Board. \nFuture KidSave loans will be adjusted for inflation, CPI, beginning in \n2008.\n  Parents and grandparents will be able to add $500 per year to each \nKidSave account for each child under the age of 19.\n  A KidSave loan recipient--with no additional account contributions--\ncan expect to generate future retirement savings of $250,000 by the age \nof 67 (assuming an 8 percent rate of return). Furthermore, since \nKidSave accounts are personal property, they can be willed on to an \nheir as part of an estate.\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\n  How will these KidSave loans be financed? Our legislation uses Social \nSecurity surpluses to finance the loans in the early years of the \nprogram. But, as older KidSavers begin to repay their KidSave loans, \nthe program will virtually become self-funded, as the loan repayment \nrevenues are used to fund the KidSave loans of a new generation.\n  Since the $2,000 KidSave loan is--just that--a loan, KidSavers are \nexpected to pay back the loan amount at the CPI inflated rate starting \nat age 30. The KidSave loan repayment mechanism is designed in such a \nway to allow future KidSavers to pay back 20 percent of the loan each \nyear for five years, beginning at the age of 30. In the rare event that \nan individual's KidSave account may perform poorly, no individual will \nhave to pay more than 20 percent of his total account value back in any \ngiven year.\n  Building upon existing investment structures in the Federal \ngovernment, KidSave accounts will be managed and administered through \nthe Federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Investment options \nwill be determined by the TSP Board. KidSave account holders and \nguardians will have the same flexibility in changing their investment \ndistributions as current TSP participants.\n  As I noted earlier in my remarks, one goal of this proposal is to \nclose the growing wealth gap. Despite all of the glowing media reports \nabout the booming American economy, most of the economic gains of the \nlast decade have gone to families who have owned financial assets. Ed \nWolff, the wealth data guru, has reported that the wealthiest 10 \npercent of households enjoyed 85 percent of the stock market gains \nbetween 1989 and 1998. Since 1989, the share of wealth held by the top \n1 percent of households grew from 37 percent to 39 percent, while the \nnet worth of the bottom 40 percent of households dropped from .9 \npercent to .2 percent.\n  An editorial by the Progressive Policy Institute has called this \nproposal a democratization of the ownership of financial assets''. I \nthink they've hit the nail on the head. This proposal will create \nuniversal access to the tools of wealth creation and asset \naccumulation. It will make future workers less dependent on the Federal \ngovernment for their retirement income security.\n  This proposal is also aimed at improving the personal savings rate in \nthe United States. In fact, unlike other spending programs, KidSave \nloans will not only generate wealth, but also improve national and \npersonal savings rates.\n  It has been widely reported that the personal savings rate has been \nin a long and steady decline in the U.S.--according to the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis, it has dropped from 11 percent in 1981 to 2 percent \nin 1999. Many workers are spending beyond their means, accumulating \nmore and more consumer debt, while others simply can't afford to save \nbecause of high payroll tax rates and low wages. Many of these same \nworkers are relying on Social Security to be their sole or primary \nsource of income at retirement.\n  But the co-sponsors of this bill recognize that a Social Security \nretirement check isn't enough to live on. The average Social Security \ncheck in Nebraska is $766 a month. Nationwide, eighteen percent of \nbeneficiaries have no other source of income. Another 12 percent rely \non Social Security for more than 90 percent of their income, and nearly \ntwo-thirds overall derive more than half their income from that small \ncheck. For many of them, it's not enough. Our proposal is based on the \nidea that retirees need both income and wealth.\n  And Mr. President, that opportunity to hold assets and create wealth \nis an opportunity we can open today to every baby born in America. \nGuaranteed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 3202. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto biological weapons; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        Dangerous Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Dangerous \nBiological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000. Similar legislation was \noriginally submitted by the Administration in 1999 as part of a larger \nanti-crime proposal.\n  Today a terrorist attack in the United States using chemical or \nbiological weapons is one of the most significant terrorist threats we \nface. In recent years, through the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the enactment of the related implementing legislation, \nwe have provided several statutory safeguards designed to prevent and \ndeter against an attack using chemical weapons. But gaps remain in our \nlaws regulating biological pathogens. It is essential not only that \nAmerica be fully prepared to respond to such an attack, but also that \nwe take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place.\n  Currently, federal law bans only the development and possession of \nbiological agents for use as a weapon. But there are sensible things \nthat we can do in the near term to give federal law enforcement the \ntools that they need to protect our country from these threats--before \nthey materialize into unspeakable scenarios.\n  Earlier this year, the National Commission on Terrorism reported to \nCongress. Among its conclusions was that the federal laws regarding the \npossession of dangerous pathogens are currently insufficient. The \nCommission specifically recommended, among other things, that Congress \nmake it illegal for anyone not properly certified to possess certain \ncritical pathogens. And they were right.\n  The bill I introduce today fill several gaps in the law.\n  First, the bill will make it unlawful for anyone to possess \nbiological agent, toxin or delivery system of a type or in a quantity \nthat under the circumstances is not reasonably justified by a \nprophylactic, protective or other peaceful purpose. Second, the bill \nmakes it unlawful to handle a biological agent with conscious disregard \nof an unreasonable risk to public health and safety. Third, the \nlegislation makes it unlawful to knowingly communicate false, but \nbelievable information, concerning an activity which would constitute a \nviolation of this statute. Finally, the bill requires people to report \nto the federal government their possession of listed biological agents, \nprohibits the transfer of a listed biological agent to a person who is \nnot registered and makes possession by certain restricted persons--such \nas convicted felons--unlawful.\n  Closing these gaps in the law would be a modest but important step to \nprevent and deter a terrorist act involving biological agents. This \nshould not be a partisan issue. This is an issue of governance, not \npolitics. From Wilmington to Washington State, our constituents need \nprotection and expect and deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that the Congressional session is about to \nend, and therefore it is too late for the bill to be considered this \nyear. But I wanted to introduce the bill now so that it would be \navailable for review by my colleagues and other interested parties \ninside and outside of government. In particular, I invite comment by \ninterested parties in the scientific community, the business community, \nand the civil liberties community. I regard the bill I introduce today \nas an initial draft that is a work in progress, and I welcome \nconstructive comments and suggestions for improvement. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary early \nin the next session of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dangerous Biological Agent \n     and Toxin Control Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS STATUTE.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) certain biological agents and toxins have the potential \n     to pose a severe threat to the Nation's public health and \n     safety, and thereby affect interstate and foreign commerce;\n       (B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     published a list of biological agents and toxins that pose a \n     severe threat to the Nation's public health and safety as an \n     appendix to part 72 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations;\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\n       (C) biological agents and toxins can be used as weapons by \n     individuals or organizations for the purpose of domestic or \n     international terrorism or for other criminal purposes;\n       (D) terrorists and other criminals can also harm national \n     security, drain the limited resources of all levels of \n     government devoted to thwarting biological weapons, and \n     damage interstate and foreign commerce by threatening to use, \n     and by falsely reporting efforts to use, biological agents \n     and toxins as weapons;\n       (E) the Biological Weapons Convention obligates the United \n     States to take necessary measures within the United States to \n     prohibit and prevent the development, production, \n     stockpiling, acquisition, or retention of biological agents \n     and toxins of types and in quantities that have no \n     justification for prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful \n     purposes;\n       (F) the mere possession of biological agents and toxins is \n     a potential danger that affects the obligations of the United \n     States under the Biological Weapons Convention and affects \n     interstate and foreign commerce; and\n       (G) persons in possession of harmful biological agents and \n     toxins should handle them in a safe manner and, in the case \n     of agents and toxins listed by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services as posing a severe threat to the Nation's \n     public health and safety, report their possession and the \n     purpose for their possession to the appropriate Federal \n     agency in order to ensure that such possession is for \n     peaceful scientific research or development.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (A) strengthen the implementation by the United States of \n     the Biological Weapons Convention and to ensure that \n     biological agents and toxins are possessed for only \n     prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes;\n       (B) establish penalties for the false reporting of \n     violations of chapter 10 of title 18, United States Code \n     (relating to biological weapons); and\n       (C) improve the statutory definitions relating to \n     biological weapons.\n       (b) Additional Measures.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 175 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Additional Prohibitions Relating to Biological \n     Agents, Toxins, and Delivery Systems.--\n       ``(1) Unlawful possession.--Whoever knowingly possesses any \n     biological agent, toxin, or delivery system of a type or in a \n     quantity that, under the circumstances, is not reasonably \n     justified by a prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful \n     purpose, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more \n     than 10 years, or both. Knowledge of whether the type or \n     quantity of any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system \n     is reasonably justified by a prophylactic, protective, or \n     other peaceful purpose is not an element of the offense. For \n     purposes of this paragraph, the terms `biological agent' and \n     `toxin' do not encompass any biological agent or toxin that \n     is in its naturally occurring environment, if such agent or \n     toxin has not been cultivated, collected, or otherwise \n     extracted from its natural source.\n       ``(2) Unsafe handling.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Whoever, with conscious disregard of an \n     unreasonable risk to public health and safety, handles an \n     item knowing it to be a biological agent, toxin, or delivery \n     system in a manner that grossly deviates from accepted norms, \n     shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 1 \n     year, or both.\n       ``(B) Aggravated offense.--Whoever in the course of a \n     violation of subparagraph (A) causes bodily injury (as \n     defined in section 1365(g)(4) of this title) to any \n     individual (other than the perpetrator)--\n       ``(i) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more \n     than 10 years, or both; and\n       ``(ii) if death results from the offense, shall be fined \n     under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or both fined and imprisoned.\n       ``(d) False Information.--\n       ``(1) Criminal violation.--Whoever communicates \n     information, knowing the information to be false and under \n     circumstances in which such information may reasonably be \n     believed, concerning the existence of activity that would \n     constitute a violation of subsection (a) or (c) shall be \n     fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or \n     both.\n       ``(2) Civil penalty.--Whoever communicates information, \n     knowing the information to be false, concerning the existence \n     of activity that would constitute a violation of subsection \n     (a) or (c) is liable to the United States or any State for a \n     civil penalty of the greater of $10,000 or the amount of \n     money expended by the United States or the State in \n     responding to the false information.\n       ``(e) Reporting, Transfer, and Possession of Select \n     Agents.--\n       ``(1) Obligation to report.--Any person who possesses a \n     select agent shall report such possession to the designated \n     agency, in the manner prescribed by the designated agency, \n     within 72 hours of the effective date of the regulation \n     issued by that agency pursuant to this paragraph or within 72 \n     hours of subsequently obtaining possession of the agent or \n     toxin, except that, if such person is a registered entity, \n     the reporting, if any, shall be in the manner as otherwise \n     directed by regulation by the designated agency. If a person \n     complies with this paragraph, there is no obligation for any \n     employee of such person to file a separate report concerning \n     the employee's possession of a select agent in the workplace \n     of such person.\n       ``(2) Criminal penalty for willful failure to report.--Any \n     person who willfully fails to make the report required by \n     paragraph (1) within the prescribed period shall be fined \n     under this title, imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both. \n     In this paragraph, the term `willfully' means an intentional \n     violation of a known duty to report.\n       ``(3) Civil penalty for failure to report.--Any person who \n     fails to make the report required by paragraph (1) within the \n     prescribed period is liable to the United States for a civil \n     penalty of $5,000.\n       ``(4) Penalty for possession of unreported select agents.--\n     Any person who knowingly possesses a biological agent or \n     toxin that is a select agent for which a report required by \n     paragraph (1) has not been made shall be fined under this \n     title, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(5) Unauthorized transfer of select agents.--Whoever \n     knowingly transfers a select agent to any person who is not a \n     registered entity shall be fined under this title, imprisoned \n     not more than 5 years, or both.

Res. 375\n\n       Whereas the stability of democracy in Latin America and the \n     eradication of illegal narcotics from the Andean nations are \n     vital national security interests of the United States;\n       Whereas the democratically elected Government of Bolivia \n     has taken dramatic steps to eradicate illegal narcotics under \n     the Dignity Plan, resulting in the elimination of 80 percent \n     of the illegal coca crop in just two years, a record of \n     achievement unmatched worldwide;\n       Whereas the Government of Bolivia is now approaching the \n     completion of coca eradication in the Chapare and will begin \n     eradication operations in the Yungas regions in 2002;\n       Whereas there are indications that narcotics traffickers \n     from outside Bolivia are stepping up efforts to keep a \n     foothold in Bolivia by agitating among the rural poor and \n     indigenous populations, creating civil disturbances, \n     blockading roads, organizing strikes and protests, and taking \n     actions designed to force the Government of Bolivia to \n     abandon its aggressive counter narcotics campaign; and\n       Whereas the government of Bolivian President Hugo Banzer \n     Suarez has shown remarkable restraint in dealing with the \n     protesters through dialogue and openness while respecting \n     human rights: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate calls upon the Government of \n     Bolivia to continue its successful program of coca \n     eradication and looks forward to the Government of Bolivia \n     achieving its commitment to the total eradication of illegal \n     coca in Bolivia by the end of 2002.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States, as a full partner in Bolivia's \n     efforts to build democracy, to eradicate illegal narcotics, \n     and to reduce poverty through development and economic \n     growth, should fully support the democratically elected \n     Government of Bolivia;\n       (2) the release of emergency supplemental assistance \n     already approved by the United States for sustainable \n     development activities in Bolivia should be accelerated;\n       (3) on a priority basis, the President should look for \n     additional ways to provide increased tangible support to the \n     people and Government of Bolivia;\n       (4) the Government of Bolivia should continue to respect \n     the human rights of all of its citizens and to continue to \n     discuss legitimate concerns of Bolivia's rural population; \n     and\n       (5) Indigenous leaders should enter into serious \n     discussions with the government on issues of concern and \n     cease provocative acts that could lead to escalating \n     violence.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution in support \nof democracy and drug eradication in Bolivia. I'm pleased that I have \nbeen joined by several colleagues in a bipartisan initiative to applaud \nand support one of the most successful drug-eradication programs in the \nworld.\n  Our resolution recognizes that extraordinary achievements of \nBolivia's narcotics elimination program. It urges the Government of \nBolivia to continue its program of drug elimination while upholding the \nrule of law and safeguarding human rights. It also urges the indigenous \nleaders to cease provocative acts and begin discussions with the \nGovernment of Bolivia to resolve outstanding issues.\n  For nearly two weeks now, Bolivia has been confronting one of the \nworst social upheavals the country has endured in the past two decades. \nThe turmoil has been perpetrated by diverse forces in Bolivia, \nparticularly those who wish to reverse the drug eradication program in \nthe country.\n  A destabilization campaign, initiated by drug traffickers, has \nresulted in a number of protests that have virtually paralyzed the \ncountry. Roads that connect the major cities of the country were \ndestroyed and blockaded and the flow of food to the urban centers has \nbeen interrupted. Nearly a dozen people have died and more have been \ninjured by acts of violence. Economic losses are estimated at more than \n$160 million and growing.\n  The protesters, who are led by coca growers, were demanding the \nresignation of the President, the suspension of the anti-drug strategy, \nand the elimination of plans to build a U.S. funded military \ninstallation in the Chapare region--the region where most illegal coca \nhas been cultivated. They also demand that the Government allow \npeasants of the Chapare to replant about 6,000 hectares of coca, which, \nif that is allowed to happen, would yield roughly 42 tons of cocaine.\n  President Banzer has flatly rejected most demands to changes in the \nBolivian drug strategy, the Dignity Plan. He has, nevertheless, agreed \nto suspend plans for the construction of a new military installation in \nthe Chapare and proposed to refurbish the existing installation \ninstead.\n  Other groups in Bolivia have added a number of unrelated demands \nwhich appeared to be coordinated by or to be in concert with the coca \nleaders. Teachers, for example, have demanded pay raises, inmates have \nasked for better jail conditions, peasants demanded a modification of \nlaws on land ownership, doctors requested better pay, and agitators \nexploited the current state of affairs to amplify racial division. \nIsolated by themselves, these may be reasonable requests but when they \nare raised or orchestrated by drug traffickers, the goals become more \nmalevolent.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n  The protesters formed a coordinated block with the intent to make the \ngovernment deal with all the demands together, in the form of a \ncomprehensive package.\n  There is little doubt that the largest risk for the country lies with \nthe ``cocalero'' movement--the peasant coca growers--that is supported \nby regional drug trafficking interests. The drug traffickers are \nembarking on a desperate effort to reverse the anti-drug plan being \nwaged by the Bolivian Government and turn back the remarkable progress \nin drug eradication that has been accomplished in the past few years.\n  Coca leaders and the drug traffickers are aware that their leadership \nand the ill-gotten riches they derive from illegal narcotics will end \nif the final 1,800 hectares of coca in the Chapare are destroyed. This \nhelps explain the intransigence of its leaders. During this crisis, the \ngovernment has demonstrated a steady dedication to seek agreements \nthrough dialogue while retaining a respect for human rights.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the current turmoil in Bolivia \nis occurring at a time when Bolivia is set to complete its program of \ncoca eradication while simultaneously facing a serious economic crisis. \nOf the 40,000 hectares which have been used for the cultivation of \ncoca, only 1,800 hectares remain.\n  The Bolivian economy have taken a big hit from its effort to combat \ndrug trafficking. The fight against drug trafficking alone has resulted \nin the loss of 3% of Bolivia's GDP. The fight against contraband and \ncustoms reforms have absorbed another 3% of the GDP of Bolivia. This is \nall the more remarkable because this pan to eradicate drugs has taken \nplace in a country where 7 out of 10 Bolivians live on $2 a day, an \nincome which is very much below the poverty line.\n  For these and other reasons, the Government of Bolivia has called on \nthe international community to do everything possible to ensure that \nthe hard won efforts in the fight against drug trafficking are not \nturned back.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that our resolution \ncongratulates the Government of Bolivia for its successful drug \nelimination program and urges the government to continue its commitment \nto eradicate illegal coca by the end of 2002. It applauds the \ngovernment's efforts to pursue its anti-narcotics strategy and urges \nthe government to do what it can to uphold the rule of law and \ndemocratic practices, despite the strains the drug traffickers have \nimposed on the government. The resolution also stresses the view that \nhuman rights must continue to be safeguarded and urges the indigenous \nleaders to terminate provocative acts and negotiate the outstanding \nissues with the government of Bolivia.\n  I urge our colleagues to take note of the successful drug eradication \nprogram in Bolivia and encourage the democratically-elected government \nin La Paz to sustain its commitment for total coca eradication by the \nend of next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10428-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 376--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE MEN \nAND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT THE JASPER FIRE IN THE BLACK HILLS OF SOUTH DAKOTA \n              SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 376\n\n       Whereas the Jasper Fire started at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, \n     August 24, 2000, near Jasper Cave in the Black Hills National \n     Forest and was contained at 6:00 p.m. on September 8, 2000;\n       Whereas two days after it started, the Jasper Fire nearly \n     quadrupled in size in a matter of hours, burned as fast as \n     100 acres per second, and ultimately became the worst forest \n     fire in the history of the Black Hills, consuming 83,508 \n     acres;\n       Whereas the Jasper Fire threatened private homes in the \n     Black Hills, including the South Dakota communities of \n     Deerfield, Custer, and Hill City, Jewel Cave National \n     Monument, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial, and forced \n     the evacuation of many residents in northwestern Custer \n     County and southwestern Pennington County;\n       Whereas volunteers from 76 community fire departments from \n     across South Dakota made up a substantial part of the 1,160 \n     men and women who worked around the clock to contain the \n     Jasper Fire;\n       Whereas the Tatanka Hotshot crew, an elite 20-person \n     firefighting team based in the Black Hills, came from \n     fighting fires in western Wyoming to help fight the Jasper \n     Fire;\n       Whereas while the Tatanka Hotshot crew has fought several \n     fires throughout the country, the Jasper Fire was the first \n     major fire they fought in their home forest;\n       Whereas the outpouring of support for the firefighters by \n     local residents and communities, such as Hill City and \n     Custer, helped boost firefighter morale; and\n       Whereas, in spite of the rugged terrain and the intense \n     speed and size of the fire, the Jasper Fire was contained \n     successfully with only one home lost and with no injuries to \n     any firefighters or local citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Jasper Fire was the largest forest fire in the \n     history of the Black Hills National Forest, consuming 83,508 \n     acres;\n       (2) the volunteer firefighters from across South Dakota \n     played a crucial role in combating the Jasper Fire and \n     preventing it from destroying hundreds of homes;\n       (3) the Tatanka Hotshot crew was instrumental in providing \n     the effort, expertise and training necessary to establish a \n     fire line around the Jasper Fire; and\n       (4) the men and women who fought the Jasper Fire are \n     commended for their bravery, their extraordinary efforts to \n     contain the fire, and their commitment to protect lives, \n     property, and the surrounding communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10428-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10428-S10483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BOND (AND MIKULSKI) AMENDMENT NO. 4306\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, and Ms. Mikulski) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (H.R. 4635) making appropriations for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry independent \nagencies, boards, commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) President Theodore Roosevelt began the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System by establishing the first refuge at \n     Pelican Island, Florida, on March 14, 1903;\n       (2) the National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of \n     more than 93,000,000 acres of Federal land managed by the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service in more than 532 \n     individual refuges and thousands of waterfowl production \n     areas located in all 50 States and the territories of the \n     United States;\n       (3) the System is the only network of Federal land \n     dedicated singularly to wildlife conservation and where \n     wildlife-dependent recreation and environmental education are \n     priority public uses;\n       (4) the System serves a vital role in the conservation of \n     millions of migratory birds, dozens of endangered species and \n     threatened species, some of the premier fisheries of the \n     United States, marine mammals, and the habitats on which such \n     species of fish and wildlife depend;\n       (5) each year the System provides millions of Americans \n     with opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent \n     recreation, including hunting, fishing, and wildlife \n     observation;\n       (6)(A) public visitation to national wildlife refuges is \n     growing, with more than 35,000,000 visitors annually; and\n       (B) it is essential that visitor centers and public use \n     facilities be properly constructed, operated, and maintained;\n       (7) the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and \n     Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 742f \n     note; Public Law 105-242), and the amendments made by that \n     Act, significantly enhance the ability of the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to incorporate volunteers and \n     partnerships in refuge management;\n       (8) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the System has \n     an unacceptable backlog of critical operation and maintenance \n     needs; and\n       (9) the occasion of the centennial of the System, in 2003, \n     presents a historic opportunity to enhance natural resource \n     stewardship and expand public enjoyment of the national \n     wildlife refuges of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to establish a commission to promote awareness by the \n     public of the National Wildlife Refuge System as the System \n     celebrates its centennial in 2003;\n       (2) to develop a long-term plan to meet the priority \n     operation, maintenance, and construction needs of the System;\n       (3) to require an annual report on the needs of the System \n     prepared in the context of--\n       (A) the budget submission of the Department of the Interior \n     to the President; and\n       (B) the President's budget request to Congress; and\n       (4) to improve public use programs and facilities of the \n     System to meet the increasing needs of the public for \n     wildlife-dependent recreation in the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 303.

Mr. President, I will not speak but a minute, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Wyden. He and I come to the floor to \ncelebrate what Senator Craig will do later this evening by unanimous \nconsent, and that is passage of H.R. 4828. It has to do with the high \nSteens area of southeastern Oregon. It is a beautiful and pristine \narea.\n  What we have done is truly bipartisan and truly historic in that the \nSierra Club and the Oregon Cattlemen's Association enthusiastically \nsupport it. They support it because this has been a product of dialog \nand not Executive dictate. This has come about because people of good \nwill have said: How can we protect the environment and protect the \npeople as well? We have accomplished that in this bill. We are creating \n170,000 acres of wilderness and providing other places for people to \npursue their ranching lifestyles, and we are preserving the economy of \nHarney County.\n  I thank all of my colleagues--my colleague in the Senate, Senator \nWyden; Congressman Walden; all of the Oregon Congressmen, Republicans \nand Democrats alike; and the Governor of Oregon as well; and Secretary \nBruce Babbitt who worked with us in good faith to make this possible. I \nthank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, Senator Smith, has \nsaid it extremely well, and I know our colleague Senator Reed is \nwaiting to speak, so I, too, will be very brief.\n  My view is that this Steens legislation is a monumental wilderness \ntriumph. This legislation creates for the first time in statute cow-\nfree wilderness. In the past, wilderness designations allowed the \ncontinuation of historic grazing practices, but because the ranchers in \nthe Steens recognize the delicate nature of this ecosystem and because \nthey were willing to work with Democrats and Republicans in our \ncongressional delegation, Congressman Greg Walden, Congressman Peter \nDeFazio, and so many of our colleagues, we were able to build a \ncoalition for a truly historic approach to protecting our wilderness.\n  We were able to find acceptable alternative grazing sites. Almost \n100,000 acres of the total wilderness designation is now going to be by \nlaw cow free. In my view, this is just an example, a precedent of how \ncommunities can work together to protect our treasures.\n  All across this country when there are debates about national \nmonuments, the sides go into opposing and what amounts to warring \ncamps, the decibel level gets very high, and there is an awful lot of \nfinger pointing and accusations.\n  In Oregon, we did it differently. We came up with an Oregon solution. \nLike Senator Smith, I am very proud of\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\nwhat we have been able to achieve. This is a model that our delegation \nis going to use to tackle other critical natural resource questions \nand, frankly, we are especially proud tonight because we think that \nwith our Steens bill, we set a model for other communities across this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the issue \nof Liberians in the United States who, up until a few days ago, faced \nan imminent threat of deportation. Today, through Executive action, \nthat has been stayed at least for a year, but it is a community of \npeople residing here who are literally living on the edge, not knowing \nif next year at this time they will, in fact, be deported back to \nLiberia, which is a country in great turmoil and crisis as we speak.\n  For the last several years I have tried with diligence and \ndetermination to do justice for these people, to give them a chance to \nbecome permanent residents of this country and ultimately citizens of \nthis country. In my determination and my dedication, I have objected to \nthe consideration of other legislation regarding immigrant groups, not \nbecause this legislation lacked merit, but because, in my view, it was \nunfair not to consider in some way the plight of the Liberians who are \nin the United States today.\n  I hope at this point, given assurances by the White House that this \nissue of justice for Liberians in the United States is a paramount \nissue for the President in the final days of this Congress in his \nnegotiation with the congressional leadership, that the legislation I \nhave objected to can and will move forward promptly.\n  Let me try to explain briefly the status of Liberians in this \ncountry.\n  In 1989, Liberia, which historically is a country with close ties \nwith Africa and the United States--it was founded by freed American \nslaves; its capital is Monrovia, named after our President James \nMonroe--this country in 1989 was engulfed in a brutal civil war. This \ncivil war over the next 7 years would claim 150,000 lives; it would \ndisplace the population; it would destroy infrastructure. In 1991, \nrealizing the gravity of this crisis, the Attorney General of the \nUnited States granted temporary protective status to approximately \n14,000 Liberians. They were allowed to remain in the United States. \nThey could apply for work authorization, and they could work during \nthis temporary protective status.\n\n  This status was renewed annually because of the crisis in Liberia \nuntil 1999. In that year, it was determined that since there had been \nat least an election of democratic reform in Liberia, and since the \nsituation of armed conflict had subsided, temporary protective status \nwas no longer required. But rather than immediate deportation, the \nPresident decided to authorize something which is known as deferred \nenforced departure, or DED, essentially telling the Liberian community \nin the United States: You are subject to deportation today, but we are \nsimply deferring that for at least a year.\n  Just recently, again at the end of last month, we were able to get \nanother Executive extension, but essentially what we are doing to these \ngood people is putting their lives on hold one year at a time. They are \nunable to establish the same kind of permanency that we are seeking for \nother groups in this country.\n  They are good and decent people who have worked hard. They are a \nvital part of our community, and in the intervening almost 10 years, \nthey have established themselves; quite literally many of them have \nchildren born here who are American citizens.\n  Yet each year we force these people to worry, to be concerned, to \ncontemplate the very idea of leaving a home they have found and \nestablished here, taking with them children who know nothing of their \nnative land, taking with them their skills which are not particularly \nuseful, and going into a country that is violent.\n  Yesterday, the President of the United States and our Department of \nState declared the President of Liberia, Charles Taylor, persona non \ngrata in the United States. He cannot get a visa to come here because \nof his deportations within Liberia, because of his support of a \ncampaign of terror in Sierra Leone. We have all been horrified by the \npictures of mutilated children in Sierra Leone. This is all part of his \ninvolvement there--his trading guns for diamonds, his attempt to \ndestabilize the country, and defy international law.\n  That is the situation in Liberia, a situation, I might add, which we \nhave also recognized is a threat to Americans. Our State Department is \nadvising Americans they should not go to Liberia. We are withdrawing \nnonessential embassy personnel from Liberia. Yet we are unable to tell \nthese Liberians in America: You can stay here and become permanent \nresidents.\n  In fact, we are saying: We are prepared to deport you at the end of \nnext year because that is the message that DED gives. I think it is \nwrong. I think it is unjust.\n  So I objected to certain measures. I think it is important to point \nout these measures.\n  First, there was legislation, H.R. 4681, to provide an adjustment \nstatus for Syrian Jews. These individuals came to the United States in \n1992 through an arrangement between President Bush and President Assad \nof Syria. They were allowed to leave the country to seek refuge in the \nUnited States. But part of the negotiations, part of the fiction was \nthat they would leave Syria on tourist visas. So they came to the \nUnited States. They did not come as refugees. They came as asylees. \nThey sought asylum when they entered here.\n  Under our immigration law, there is a limit on the number of asylees \nthat can adjust to permanent status each year. But it is important to \npoint out, these individuals, these very good decent people, these \nSyrian Jews, are not in danger of being deported back to Syria.\n  Liberians are in grave danger of being deported back to Liberia. \nEssentially what this legislation would do--and I would support this \nlegislation--is it would jump in ahead of other asylees who are waiting \nto fulfill the yearly quota of the number of asylees who can become \npermanent residents.\n  So this is a situation of concern and importance, but not the level \nof criticality, I believe, with respect to the Liberian community. Yet \nthis legislation has moved through this House promptly, is on the verge \nof passage, while still the Liberian legislation languishes. I do not \nthink that is right. I do not think it is just. I don't care. I \ncertainly am pleased literally within a few days these Syrian Jews will \nhave a chance to adjust to permanent status. Again, what about the \nLiberians?\n  There is another piece of legislation, the religious worker visa \nextension bill, which is also known as the Mother Teresa Religious \nWorker Act. This bill will allow the religious to come to the United \nStates on a visa to do pastoral work.\n  It has been in effect for several years. It is a good program. About \n2,500 workers come in a year. Very importantly, once these individuals \nare here, they can also adjust to permanent residency status, unlike \nthe Liberians who now, under our DED, cannot do that. It is a worthy \nprogram, but it is a program, again, that I do not think has the same \nkind of compelling justice that the Liberians have in their case.\n\n  We again applaud the fact that this piece of legislation is likely to \nbecome law. But what about the Liberians?\n  There is also another piece of legislation that would grant immediate \ncitizenship to children adopted internationally by the American public. \nOnce again, these children are not in any danger of being returned to \ntheir homeland involuntarily. The Liberians are in such danger.\n  Each time now that a child is adopted, they come in on a visa. The \nadoptive parents can fill out an application for citizenship on behalf \nof the child and pay a $2,500 fee. The application is then considered \nwith all other applications for permanent residency. It takes a few \nyears, but these children are virtually assured of becoming American \ncitizens.\n  Let me try to suggest the incongruity of not dealing with the \nLiberian legislation in the same way we are dealing with this type of \nlegislation.\n  If we do not, next September, grant DED, we could be in the awkward \nposition of having legislation which would\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\nallow an American couple to adopt a Liberian child and automatically \nmake that child a citizen while at the same time we deport Liberian \nfamilies in which the children are already American citizens having \nbeen born here. Again, not fair, not just. Even though this adoption \nbill is quite worthy--it will likely become law; I will support it--\nwhat about the Liberians?\n  So what we have seen is that legislation that has been introduced \nafter legislation I introduced has already proceeded through the House \nand the Senate and will likely become law to the benefit of these good \npeople, but what about the Liberians?\n  I have tried all I can to get a fair hearing for the Liberians in \nthis country. I hope, in the last few days, we will get that hearing, \nthrough the intervention of the White House and through the \nconsideration of my colleagues.\n  There are about 10,000 people here who have become important parts of \nour communities, who have sunk roots deep in our communities, many of \nwhom have children who are Americans. It is not fair and it is not \nright that they are being ignored. I have tried to prevent at least \nthat from happening, of them being completely ignored and being \ndeported. They have suffered our indifference. I hope we can work this \nout in the next few days.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Congress has taken a historic step to \nadvance the process of self-determination of the American citizens of \nPuerto Rico by approving an appropriation of $2.5 million as requested \nby the President for a grant to the Elections Commission of Puerto Rico \nto be used for voter education and a choice among the island's future \nstatus options. As an advocate of that process and the need to resolve \nthe island's political status after 102 years, I am pleased that we \nhave acted.\n  This is historic because it represents the first authorization from \nCongress for the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to choose the \nultimate political status for their island. Presidents since Truman \nhave been seeking such an authorization and each house has passed \nsimilar language in the past, but the same language has never passed \nboth houses and been enacted into law. Our approval of this \nappropriation should be read as Congress' determination to resolve the \ncentury-long question of the island's ultimate status and let Puerto \nRican Americans choose a fully democratic governing arrangement if they \nwish to replace the current territorial status.\n  By adopting this provision as part of the unanticipated needs account \nof the Office of the President, it is Congress' intention that its \nsupport for a future vote in Puerto Rico be coordinated with the \nAdministration's efforts to provide realistic options to be included on \nthe ballot in the island's next referendum. In recent months the \nPresident has brought Puerto Rico's major political parties together in \nan unprecedented effort to define the available political status \noptions. Our approval of the $2.5 million request evidences our \nexpectation that the White House will provide realist options upon \nwhich to base a future status referendum. It can only responsibly \nallocate the funds for the consideration of options that are realistic.\n  Mr. President, the ultimate resolution of Puerto Rico's political \nstatus will require that Congress and the American citizens of Puerto \nRico work together to make a choice based on clearly defined status \noptions that are consistent with the U.S. Constitution. The action we \nhave taken is a major contribution towards that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10485-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10485-S10486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

We have looked at this issue extensively over the last \nseveral years, and through the eyes of the committee by a resolution, \nexpressed on the floor of the Senate, as it related to the Kyoto \nProtocol.\n  With all of that, the Vice President said one thing last night. \nGovernor Bush said he was not certain that climate change was a direct \nresult of fossil fuel use. In fact, he said, science would govern \nenvironmental decisionmaking in his administration, and he did not \nbelieve that science had yet fully resolved that fossil fuel use and \nthe creation of greenhouse gases was, in fact, creating climate change.\n  I happen to agree with the Vice President. I say that because the \nscientists we have had before us may generally agree that our globe is \ngaining some heat, with some temperature change, but they do not yet \nagree that fossil fuel usage and the aftereffects, the greenhouse \ngases, are in fact the sole cause or are they causing climate change?\n  Which opinion is more supported by the scientists themselves? On \nMonday, the Washington Post reported, in unusual detail, a new theory \nof global warming that is being advanced by scientists from Denmark to \nUCLA. It goes like this:\n  First of all, they say, charged particles from space, better known as \ncosmic rays, cause cloud formation by changing atmospheric molecules \nwith neutral charges into charged ions. The charged ions cluster, \nforming dense, low clouds.\n  Now, this may sound like a scientific lecture, but this was the kind \nof detail that the Washington Post was giving in this article.\n  They said, secondly, the Sun's magnetic field deflects much of the \ncosmic rays away from the Earth, reducing their ability to trigger \ncloud formation.\n  With less cloud cover to shade the Earth, the Earth gets warmer.\n  That seems like pretty reasonable logic, doesn't it?\n  It turns out that satellite data over the last 20 years reveal an \nuncanny correlation between changes in the Sun's magnetic field and \ncloud cover. Meanwhile, Greenland ice-cores show that cosmic rays have \ndeclined over the past century.\n  James Hensen of NASA, once a leading proponent of the human cause \ntheory that the Vice President embraces to the exclusion of all others, \nnow acknowledges in the Post that the Sun has probably been a \nsignificant contributor in past climate change. But Hensen would still \nlike to see some convincing evidence. Hensen, by the way, has also \npublished recent work suggesting that methane gases, many of which are \nemitted naturally, may be as large a contributor to climate change as \nCO2.\n  How can we find out what is right? Here is what the Post reports:\n  A consortium of more than fifty scientists have petitioned CERN, the \nEuropean particle physics facility in Geneva, to conduct an experiment \nthat could help settle this theory, this argument, this general issue, \nas reported by the Washington Post.\n\n       The researchers want to use one of CERN's particle beams as \n     a source of artificial cosmic rays that would strike a \n     ``cloud chamber'' containing the equivalent of air in the \n     lower atmosphere. If there is a clear link between cosmic \n     rays and cloud formation, the experience should reveal it.\n\n  The scientists proposing the experiment say:\n\n       If this link is confirmed, the consequent global warming \n     could be comparable to that presently attributed to \n     greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n  In other words, what the scientists are saying is, if this theory and \nthis test were proven accurate, then cosmic rays and their influence in \nthe atmosphere and the formation of clouds could have equal or greater \ninfluence over the Earth's atmosphere and climate change or global \nwarming.\n  How can we in the Senate use this information? If this experiment \nindicates that changes in solar magnetic fields account for all of the \ndetected warming, then burning fossil fuel might account for none of \nit. Interrupting our\n\n[[Page S10486]]\n\neconomic growth by arbitrarily curtailing energy use either by taxing \nit or regulating it could be a far costlier experiment than the one \nthese scientists have proposed at CERN. And because the human cause/\neffect is so weak and so few countries are likely to join our self-\ndestructive experiment, useful scientific results may never \nmaterialize.\n  Let's do the real science, and do it now. In other words, I believe \nGov. George Bush was right last night when he said, I believe there is \na field of science we ought to understand and err on before we send \nthis country down the road. He said his administration would make \ndecisions on climate change based on science, not the politics or the \npopularity of the politics of the day.\n  Let's make science drive the issue. Science has to drive public \npolicy in this area, not vice versa. We dare not let public policy \ndrive science.\n  Meanwhile, let us hold off on dangerous experiments such as Kyoto \nthat place our economy at risk in an attempt to prove one man right in \nthe face of so much doubt. Truly, the kind of taxation the Vice \nPresident proposes and proposed but wouldn't own up to last night could \ncertainly turn our economy into a recession and disadvantage our \nproducers against other producers around the world.\n  In other words, what the Washington Post reported in great detail in \nan article well over a half a page long, on Monday, was exactly what \nGovernor Bush was saying last night.\n  Mr. Vice President, the jury is still out. And the jury is scientists \nall over the world who have not yet confirmed, nor do they agree, that \nfossil fuels are the sole cause of a climate growing warmer.\n  Let's err on the side of science and not politics as we make these \ndecisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I share the concern expressed by my \ngood friend from the State of Idaho with regard to the issue of global \nwarming. Much of the rhetoric that has been used is not based on sound \nscience. The reality that we have the technology, if given an \nopportunity to apply that technology, particularly in the developing \nThird World nations, results in a meaningful decrease of the \nconcentrations of pollutants that we are all concerned about in \nassociation with clean air.\n  I commend my friend from Idaho for bringing this matter, again, to \nthe attention of this body with the recognition that, indeed, through \nscience and technology, we can make a significant difference in \nreducing overall the emissions, particularly from the emerging nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10486-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10486-S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE BREAKDOWN IN PEACE PROCESS IN MIDDLE EAST AND ITS EFFECT ON THE \n                             ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in coming before the Senate \nat this late hour is to bring to your attention a rather catastrophic \nsituation that is occurring in the world today.\n  We are all familiar with the devastation associated with the \nbreakdown of the peace process in the Mideast and the tensions \nassociated with the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. I \nthink it is important to recognize another significant factor that has \noccurred today; that is, the price of oil has increased about $3.40 a \nbarrel in one day. Currently oil closed at roughly $36.40. That is just \na few cents under the all-time high of 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago where oil \nclosed at $37 a barrel.\n  Clearly, our increased dependence on Mideast oil, where we import \nabout 58 percent of the total oil we consume, is a significant factor \nin recognizing that any conflict in the Mideast not only affects oil \nprices in the United States, because our supply is threatened, but it \naffects our stock market which has dropped rather dramatically today as \nwell.\n  Let me highlight a few things that I think represent an inconsistency \nin the administration's policies towards developing a sound energy \npolicy.\n  Perhaps you noticed, I am not wearing a dark shirt, a dark tie, the \nkind worn by Regis on ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'' As you know, \nthis is a TV show on ABC where contestants compete to win up to $1 \nmillion in prizes. It is my understanding that to win, contestants on \nthe TV show must answer some questions, just as the administration has \nhad to answer a series of questions regarding the lack of an energy \npolicy.\n  If contestants on the TV show get stumped by a question, they can use \na so-called lifeline. For example, they can phone a friend. Well, we \nhave seen when oil prices rose, this administration phoned their \nfriends. They phoned the Saudis and asked them for more crude oil, and \nthe Saudis obliged.\n  Now, contestants can ask the audience--in other words, consult the \npolls--to see who has the right answers. Doesn't that sound familiar? \nThe administration, of course, loves polls.\n  Finally, TV contestants can use a 50/50 where only two choices are \npresented, one of which is the right answer, helps them out a little \nbit, not unlike the two contrasting energy policies that were presented \nby the major Presidential candidates. Well, the administration has used \nabout all of its lifelines and still doesn't have an answer with regard \nto the energy policy. Now we find we are playing the game ``Who Wants \nto be a Millionaire'' with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the \nexpense of our national energy security.\n\n  Some of the lucky winners, speculators who bid on this crude oil \nreleased from SPR recently, stand to profit handsomely; there is no \nquestion about it. But we should reflect on what the purpose was. The \npurpose was to build up heating oil inventories in the Northeast. Well, \nit is pretty hard to make a case that anything realistic has been done \nas a consequence of the SPR sale to build up those reserves.\n  I recall that the Vice President called on the President a few weeks \nago to authorize the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the SPR. \nThat was on September 21. Interestingly enough, the President responded \nthe very next day. It is important to grasp that the aim of the \nemergency release, according to the administration, was to increase \nheating oil stocks in the Northeast and prevent high heating oil prices \nthis winter. But what has been the result, Mr. President? Heating oil \nstocks in the Northeast have actually declined. They have declined \n600,000 barrels since the President made his announcement. Those \nfigures, which we reviewed, came from the American Petroleum Institute. \nThat is a very disturbing trend because we are entering the winter \nseason. It is getting colder up there and the reserves, again, are \n600,000 barrels less than when the President made his announcement on \nSeptember 21.\n  One can question the motive. Was the motive to lower prices and \nprovide an excuse, cover, throughout the winter heating season, and \nperhaps throughout the elections, to ensure that the administration was \ndoing something about the energy problem, something about the price of \noil, something about our dependence on the Mideast, something about \nmeeting the obligation of having adequate heating oil reserves?\n  I think the administration's premise was flawed from the start. If \nyou consider these realistic facts, at the time of the SPR release, our \nrefineries were operating at between 95 and 96 percent of capacity. \nThat is a fact. Now, the oil in SPR is crude oil. In order to refine \nit, it has to go to a refinery. Furthermore, our pipelines for crude \nand finished product are already operating to capacity. We haven't had \na new refinery for nearly two decades. And 37 refineries have been \nclosed in this country in the last 10 years. So what we have is a \nsituation where we have a bottleneck at our refineries, regardless of \nhow much crude oil we have.\n  New heating oil resulting from SPR releases can't be delivered until \nlate November at the earliest because you have to take this oil out of \nthe SPR in the salt caverns of Louisiana on the gulf coast and you can \nonly recover about 4 million barrels a day maximum, and you have to \nmove it through a pipeline, put it on a tanker, and transport it to a \nrefinery that is already full. There would be no guarantee that the \ncrude oil released from SPR would have to be turned into heating oil \nfor use in the United States. In other words, when they made this sale, \nthey didn't make any requirement that\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\nwhoever was the successful bidder on the sale was prohibited from \nexporting it. As a matter of fact, they didn't even have to turn it \ninto heating oil. There is no provision in the contractual terms that \nmandates if you are the successful bidder for the SPR oil, you have to \neither turn it into heating oil and put it in a reserve in the United \nStates, or, for that matter, you can export the oil. You certainly \ndon't have to refine the oil.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last week that heating oil from the \nUnited States is now being exported to Europe. We checked on that and \nfound out that that is true. The heating oil market there is 50 percent \nlarger than the U.S. market. Stocks are tight and prices are a few \ncents a gallon higher. I mentioned this to some of the principals in \nthe Department of Energy and they said: We are letting the free market \nwork.\n  I said: It is certainly working because that is where it is going--to \nthe highest return, which is Europe.\n  So refiners are able to ship heating oil over to Europe because they \npay a premium price at a time when there is a real shortage here in the \nUnited States.\n  Another question is, Why didn't the administration, when it put up 30 \nmillion barrels, put in a prohibition on exporting that oil, a mandate \nthat it had to be refined, a mandate that it had to go into a reserve? \nWe took oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was designed \nto address our needs should there be a curtailment of supply from the \nMideast, and here we have a situation where no provision was even given \nto ensure that the action of taking 30 million barrels out of SPR \nresulted in any increase in our domestic heating oil supply for the \nNortheast part of the country.\n  And now the Department of Energy's Information Administration says \nthat nearly two-thirds of the oil released from SPR--or 20 million \nbarrels--will simply displace foreign imported oil. What that means is \nthat we don't have the capacity in our refineries to take 30 million \nbarrels; we are going to take 10. So instead of 30 million barrels, we \nwill only get 10 million barrels of new crude actually from the SPR \nbecause of the displacement that I just explained.\n  Now, the Department of Energy claims that these 10 million barrels \ncan still yield 3 million to 4 million barrels of heating oil. On the \nother hand, the industry tells us--and they are in the business because \nthey have to refine it--that roughly 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of \nheating oil is all we are going to get out of the 10 million barrels \nthat are refined. I don't know who is correct, but I suspect the \nindustry is. In any event, recognize that the United States uses \nroughly 1 million barrels of heating oil a day.\n  So this pulldown of the SPR has either resulted in a 3-day supply or \na 1-day supply. It sent a signal that we are so desperate that we are \nwilling to reduce our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the specific \npurpose of increasing the supply of heating oil, which we haven't \nachieved. One can question whether there was another motivation. Could \nthat motivation have been to manipulate prices because prices did fall \nfrom $37 to about $32 after the announcement was made by the President \nthat we were going to go in and sell 30 million barrels of SPR. But I \npoint out where the price is today; the price closed at roughly $36.40 \ntoday. We are right back where we started.\n  As a consequence, the SPR release will, as I have said, likely end up \nrepresenting less than 1 day's supply of heating oil. It is clear to me \nthat the release of oil from the SPR won't help at all in increasing \nheating oil supplies in the Northeast this winter. If this had been the \nreal concern of the administration, why would they turn away the \ninvitation offered by Venezuela's state oil company, PDV, to produce \nheating oil for direct delivery to the United States? Well, we have \nasked the Secretary this. We asked him in an extended letter.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This administration seems to have limited success in \nthe real goal and, as I have indicated, it appears to be manipulating \nprices in the world market for, one can only conclude, a political \neffect. Crude oil prices, as I said, were at a 10-year high, $37 a \nbarrel. After SPR, they hit $32. But today, as I have indicated, they \nare back up to $36.40. Along the way, they might be making some \nmillionaires out of the speculators who were lucky enough to win a bid \non SPR oil. We asked the Secretary to explain how those went out, who \ngot them, how were they offered because if it is true, how did the \nadministration, with this kind of an opportunity for speculators who \ndidn't have to put up any financial requirement, prove a capability to \nget their bid? It appears that anyone was eligible to play.\n\n  Let's look at some of the bidders. Without being specific, very \nlittle was required of anyone who wanted to bid on the SPR oil. They \ndid not have to show any financial capacity. The excuse was they were \ngoing to take care of that later. That was the official response from \nthe Department of Energy. You didn't have to have any previous \nexperience in the energy market; no track record. You didn't have to \nhave any agreements with refiners who refine the oil. You didn't have \nany guarantee of even access to refiners and no guarantee that heating \noil would be reserved specifically for the Northeast.\n  They made this bid proposal without any requirement that you could \nnot export it, without any requirement that it be held in the United \nStates for the Northeast reserve.\n  As a consequence, what have we really accomplished? All the winning \nbidders needed to do was promise to return more oil to SPR than the \nother bidders. You might have a pretty inexperienced bidder who wanted \nto get the bid and who didn't have to put up any financial \nresponsibility proof, bid high, and get an award. Once you get an \naward, you can turn around and market it. For the larger companies that \nhave the financial capacity, it is perhaps a little different.\n  I don't begrudge anyone for making a return on an investment. But it \nis a rather peculiar and I would suggest a poor way for government to \ndo business.\n  As I think back at government sales, for example, in the forests, the \nForest Service requires a participant who is putting up a bid to also \nshow financial responsibility. You have to put up a letter of guarantee \nin your bank to even bid.\n  What happened here is we had the letters go out from the Department \nof Energy to prospective bidders. They simply bid and got an award. \nThen they have to put up the financial responsibility under a letter of \ncredit after the fact.\n  In the meantime, if they are a broker, as a few of these folks were, \nwith no experience and no refinery capacity, they are simply going to \nbid on the oil, and hopefully the price of oil will increase. They can \nsell their position to somebody else and walk away with a couple of \nmillion dollars.\n  I guess that is part of what makes America great. But, by the same \ntoken, you wonder to whom that profit should belong. Should it belong \nto the taxpayer or the speculator who puts up nothing for the \nopportunity to get a position and then be fortunate enough to sell it \nso he can make a few bucks?\n  We will have to see either today or tomorrow, when the letters of \ncredit are due, whether some of these speculators have the financial \ncapacity to actually meet the conditions after the fact. But I can tell \nyou this. I have checked with several of the companies. These \nspeculators have been busy trying to resell their positions. We will \nsee how many are able to make good on their promises.\n  But it is important to recognize the winners. What do they get? I \ndon't want you to misunderstand. But they basically get to borrow the \ncrude from SPR. And, if the price goes up, they can sell it at a higher \nprice. They can take the money and buy back cheaper oil in 10 to 12 \nmonths to replace what they have borrowed from SPR with interest and, \nof course, keep any profits as a result. There is potentially millions \nof dollars--at whose expense? The taxpayer.\n  I have a little bit of background in banking and business. I can tell \nyou it is a poor way to do business, to put out a bid proposal without \nany financial requirement for performance. That is what the Department \nof Energy has done. I think it is totally inappropriate when other \nGovernment agencies such as the Forest Service have a proven list of \nbidders.\n\n  I want to make another observation.\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\n  Isn't it rather peculiar that we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwith about a 56-day supply of oil in case this country finds its oil \nsupplies in the Mideast, on which we are 58-percent dependent, cut off \nby some action and we don't have an approved list of bidders who have \nalready proven their financial capacity or the wherewithal to refine \nthe oil and get it to market so we can do this in a process of a very \nshort time? If the supply is disrupted, we are going to need to move it \nin a short period of time. It doesn't appear to be the case.\n  The Department of Energy evidently doesn't have a standing list of \nbidders who are willing to take the oil at a price, refine it, and get \nit out to the market. It appears that what we have done here is put \nthis out to the highest bidder, and some of these speculators say: I \ndidn't have to put up anything. I have nothing to lose. If I get a \nposition, I can turn around and try to sell my position hoping that the \nprice of oil has gone up, as it has today $3.50, and make a few bucks \nwithout any risk individually--because they haven't had to put up \nanything.\n  Let's get this straight. I think this was done at a considerable risk \nto our national security, and as a consequence, the release of oil from \nSPR by this administration has not contributed one identifiable barrel \nto the heating oil reserve for the Northeast part of this country.\n  Remember what we have achieved so far in the sale is identification \nthat perhaps we will get at least a day's worth of heating oil. But it \nis not going to arrive until sometime in November.\n  Further, most of the crude oil released from SPR appears to be going \ninto the foreign markets because they are paying a higher price in \nEurope than we are paying in the United States. There is no prohibition \nagainst the export. The only folks who appear to benefit will be \nperhaps a few of the speculators and a few of the oil companies that \nhit the jackpot. I can't imagine the Vice President is going to \ngenerate any expanded support from it. But the losers are really the \nfuel-starved consumers in the Northeast, the people this was designed \nto help.\n  I think that raises a number of questions regarding the \nadministration's ability to basically manage the SPR.\n  When I think of the situation, as I have seen it evolve, I think the \nSecretary and the administration owe us a few answers.\n  For example, who bid on crude oil from SPR and what did they offer?\n  Why were the winning bids selected?\n  Who didn't get selected and why?\n  Whom were the bids sent out to?\n  What assurances did the administration get that oil release from SPR \nwould be turned into heating oil in the Northeast?\n  How did the winning bidders plan to refine SPR oil?\n  How will they get it to market?\n  Why didn't the Department of Energy have a preapproved list of \nbidders that might be required in a real supply emergency?\n  Why wasn't financial responsibility part of the bidding process, \nsimilar to the way the Forest Service puts up timber for bid with \nfinancial requirements to be part of the bid submission?\n  I have asked these questions of the Secretary. I look forward to his \nresponse.\n  With regard to our national energy security, I think this \nadministration really needs to respond to this question. The question \nis: Is that your final answer? Because that is simply not good enough \nfor the American people.\n  In conclusion, it is my intention, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, to hold a hearing, which I intend to call \nfor next Thursday, on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to try to \ngenerate the factual information relative to just what has been \naccomplished and what assurances people of the Northeast have that this \naction will actually result in any increase in our reserves of heating \noil for the coming winter in view of the circumstances that exist \ntoday--the conflict in the Mideast, the tensions, and the realization \nthat, indeed, we are at a time when we have become so dependent on \nimported oil that our national energy security is dictated by the likes \nof Saddam Hussein, Iraq, and others who do not necessarily look for the \nbest interests of the United States when they sell their product to us.\n  I am always reflective on Saddam Hussein and the realization that now \nwe are importing about 750,000 barrels a day from Iraq. How quickly the \nAmerican people forget that we lost 147 lives in 1992 in the Persian \nGulf war; we had 437 wounded. The cost to the taxpayer was in the \nbillions of dollars.\n  Now we are looking to Saddam Hussein as a savior for our addiction to \noil. I think it is further interesting to note the action taken by \nSaddam Hussein in relationship to the demand on Iraq from the U.N. to \nbegin to pay Kuwait for reparations from the conflict there in the \ninvasion from Iraq into Kuwait. Saddam Hussein told the U.N., if you \nrequire payment now, I will reduce my oil production. It is my \nunderstanding that the U.N. said: We will talk about it next quarter.\n  If you look at where we are today, we find the world's production and \nthe world's consumption are almost equal. There is a little bit more \nproduction than there is consumption--just about 1 million barrels a \nday. But Saddam Hussein is producing 2.9 million barrels a day. His \nthreat to cut production could increase the price of oil from $36 today \nto $56 tomorrow.\n  I always recall the issue of Israel and our commitment to Israel's \nsecurity. He ends virtually every speech with ``Death to Israel.'' If \nthere ever is a threat to peace in the Middle East, it comes from Iraq. \nThey are building up their missile-delivery capability, their \nbiological capability, and as a consequence of what we are seeing today \nin the Middle East, the crisis is increasing by the hour, and as a \nconsequence the threat is increasing.\n  So this is all coupled with dependence, an increased growing \ndependence on imported oil and the inability of the administration to \nface up to appropriate relief associated with reducing our dependence \non imported oil by producing more oil at home in the overthrust belt in \nWyoming, Colorado, Utah--areas where the Federal Government is now \ntaking nearly 60 percent of the public land and putting it off limits.\n  In my State of Alaska, we are attempting to open up the small sliver \nof ANWR, roughly a footprint of 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres, a \npotential supply of 16 billion barrels that would replace what we \nimport from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year period. These are the actions \nthat could be taken as well as conservation and tax incentives to \naddress our energy security.\n  If we were to take these actions, there is no question in my mind we \nwould be sending a strong signal to the Middle East. We would see a \nvery significant drop in oil, much more so than occurred the other day \nwhen the President announced the sale of 30 million barrels from the \nSPR. I suggest we could expect at least a $10 to $15 a barrel drop in \nthe price of oil.\n  I was thinking about the remarks of the previous speaker relative to \nthe political season we are in. I was reminded in the debate last night \nof a statement by the Vice President that he always opposed energy \ntaxes. I guess perhaps the Vice President overlooked the fact that when \nthe administration came in in 1993 the first tax they proposed was the \nBtu tax, British thermal unit, a tax on energy. It was defeated in this \nbody.\n  However, shortly thereafter there was the effort by the Vice \nPresident, who was sitting in the chair of the Presiding Officer, and \nthere was a tie vote in the Senate. The issue was the gas tax, 4.5 \ncents a gallon. The Vice President broke that tie and that gas tax went \ninto effect.\n  In conclusion, I assume that the Vice President overlooked his record \non increasing energy taxes and perhaps he should revisit his record and \nhis memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10488-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10488-S10489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4828) to designate wilderness areas and a \n     cooperative management and protection area in the vicinity of \n     Steens Mountain in Harney County, Oregon, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statement relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4828) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, moments ago, by unanimous \nconsent, the Senate passed H.R. 4828, the Steens Mountain Cooperative \nManagement and Protection Act. This bill, supported by the entire \nOregon delegation, is a very unique piece of legislation to enhance the \nprotection of Steens Mountain in Southeastern Oregon, while preserving \nthe local ranching economy.\n  As the sponsor of the Senate companion bill, S. 3052, cosponsored by \nmy colleague, Senator Wyden, I am here to thank my colleagues for the \nswift consideration of the House-passed bill.This bill enjoys broad \nsupport, ranging from the local community officials and the Oregon \nCattlemen's Association, to Oregon Trout and the Sierra Club.\n  For those of my colleagues who have not had the good fortune to visit \nthis special place, the Steens Mountain area in southeastern Oregon is \na unique geologic formation that is home to a wide diversity of flora \nand fauna. The Steens Mountain fault block stretches sixty miles. It \nrises to an elevation of 9,700 feet and drops 5,500 feet in three miles \nto the historic lakebed of the Alvord Desert.\n  The federal lands on Steens Mountain are managed by the Bureau of \nLand Management. There is significant private ownership in the area, \nwith over 270 separate landowners controlling about one-third of the \nland. There are several large ranching operations that graze both \npublic and private lands in the Steens Mountain area.\n  Faced with multiple landowners, and a wide range of views on how best \nto protect the land, we finally crafted a great bill that enjoys local \nand national support, and that the President has indicated he will \nsign.\n  Through this bill, we are going to designate over one hundred and \nseventy thousand acres of wilderness. We are permanently removing \ncattle from over a hundred thousand acres in the High Steens. We will \npermanently withdraw over 1.1 million acres, including the Alvord \nDesert, from mining and geothermal development. We are also creating \ninnovative management tools, such as a Redband Trout reserve and a \nWildlands Juniper Management Area, to respond to the diverse \nstewardship needs of the Steens and the wildlife that finds its home \nthere.\n  Mr. President, it was no easy task to achieve such wide-ranging \nenvironmental protection in my state without decimating the way of life \nof an entire community, and without creating more distrust of federal \nland management policies. This solution, though, works for the land and \nthe people, rather than trying to make the land fit an existing \nmanagement classification.\n  The best way to preserve special places like Steens Mountain, with \nsignificant private ownership, is not to force people off the land or \nto buy them all out. It is to ensure that open spaces are preserved in \nprivate ownership, and to provide incentives for the preservation of \nthese open spaces. After all, it is the stewardship of this area by the \nprivate landowners over the last one hundred years that makes Steens \nMountain the special place that it is today.\n  For over a year now, the entire Oregon congressional delegation and \nthe Governor have worked closely with the Secretary of the Interior and \nstakeholders to achieve one primary goal: the preservation of Steens \nMountain for future generations of Americans while ensuring that the \nranchers can pass their ranches down to their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  At the risk of leaving someone out, I would like to take a moment to \nmention some of the people who have contributed to this landmark \nprocess. I want to thank all of the Members of the Oregon delegation, \nthe Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor, and all the dedicated \nstaff members who worked on this bill--especially Valerie West, my \nNatural Resources Director, as well as Kurt Pfotenhauer and Matt Hill \nof my staff; Lindsay Slater, and Troy Tidwell in Congressman Walden's \noffice; David Blair, Josh Kardon, and Sarah Bittleman in Senator \nWyden's office; Amelia Jenkins with Congressman DeFazio; Chris \nHuckleberry with Congresswoman Hooley; Michael Harrison with \nCongressman Blumenauer; and working on behalf of Governor Kitzhaber--\nKevin Smith and Peter Green. In the Secretary of the Interior's office, \nI want to extend thanks to Molly McUsic and Laurie Sedlmayr. I also \nwant to recognize the work of Mike Menge, David Dye, and David Brooks \nof the Senate Energy Committee, who helped bring this legislation \nbefore the Committee and to the floor of the Senate.\n  There are also many in Oregon that have been essential to this \nprocess. First and foremost, those who live in the shadow and beauty of \nSteens Mountain, and who will continue to act as its stewards: Stacy \nDavies, Fred Otley and Charlie Otley. There are also those who have \nrepresented the various environmental groups in Oregon: Bill Marlett, \nAndy Kerr, Sybil Ackerman, Jill Workman, and Jim Myron.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a historic achievement that will protect \na mountain and a way of life that are deeply intertwined in the spirit \nof the American west, and I thank my colleagues for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10489-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10489-S10490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LIBERTY MEMORIAL IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RELOCATING AND RENOVATING THE HAMILTON GRANGE, NEW YORK\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr President, I rise today in support of the Daschle-\nJohnson resolution that commends the men and women who valiantly fought \nthe Jasper fire in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The fire that raged \nthrough the Black Hills caused considerable damage to the forests in \nthese states. Almost 100,000 acres burned in the Black Hills alone. To \nthe great relief of all of us in South Dakota, the fire has been \nbrought under control. The firefighters in our state did a tremendous \njob in containing the fire. Their efforts have been nothing short of \nHerculean.\n  The fire started near Jasper Cave on the Black Hills National Forest \non August 24, 2000 and was contained by September 8, 2000. By the \nsecond day, the fire had quadrupled in size and was burning as fast as \n100 acres per second. The fire threatened private homes in the \ncommunities of Deerfield, Custer and Hill City, the Jewel Cave National \nMonument and the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. It also forced the \nevacuation of many residents on northwestern Custer County and \nsouthwestern Pennington County.\n  1,160 men and women worked around the clock, most of them volunteers \nwho literally risked their lives and made great sacrifices to contain \nthe fire. Special mention should be made of the Tatanka Hotshot crew, \nan elite 20-person firefighting team based in the Black Hills who came \nfrom fighting fires in western Wyoming the fight the Jasper fire. While \nthe Tatanka crew has fought several fires throughout the country, this \nwas the first major fire they fought in their home forest .\n  The firefighters were incredibly successful. In spite of the rugged \nterrain and the intense speed and size of the Jasper fire, it was \ncontained with only one home lost and with no injuries to any \nfirefighters or local citizens. This resolution commends the \nfirefighters for their bravery, their extraordinary efforts to contain \nthe fire, and their\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\ncommitment to protect lives, property and the surrounding communities. \nSenator Daschle, myself, and the entire Senate are proud of their \nefforts. We can't thank them enough.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action, and any statements relating thereto be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 376) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 376\n\n       Whereas the Jasper Fire started at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, \n     August 24, 2000, near Jasper Cave in the Black Hills National \n     Forest and was contained at 6:00 p.m. on September 8, 2000;\n       Whereas two days after it started, the Jasper Fire nearly \n     quadrupled in size in a matter of hours, burned as fast as \n     100 acres per second, and ultimately became the worst forest \n     fire in the history of the Black Hills, consuming 83,508 \n     acres;\n       Whereas the Jasper Fire threatened private homes in the \n     Black Hills, including the South Dakota communities of \n     Deerfield, Custer, and Hill City, Jewel Cave National \n     Monument, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial, and forced \n     the evacuation of many residents in northwestern Custer \n     County and southwestern Pennington County;\n       Whereas volunteers from 67 community fire departments from \n     across South Dakota made up a substantial part of the 1,160 \n     men and women who worked around the clock to contain the \n     Jasper Fire;\n       Whereas the Tatanka Hotshot crew, an elite 20-person \n     firefighting team based in the Black Hills, came from \n     fighting fires in western Wyoming to help fight the Jasper \n     Fire;\n       Whereas while the Tatanka Hotshot crew has fought several \n     fires throughout the country, the Jasper Fire was the first \n     major fire they fought in their home forest;\n       Whereas the outpouring of support for the firefighters by \n     local residents and communities, such as Hill City and \n     Custer, helped boost firefighter morale; and\n       Whereas, in spite of the rugged terrain and the intense \n     speed and size of the fire, the Jasper Fire was contained \n     successfully with only one home lost and with no injuries to \n     any firefighters or local citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Jasper Fire was the largest forest fire in the \n     history of the Black Hills National Forest, consuming 83,508 \n     acres;\n       (2) the volunteer firefighters from across South Dakota \n     played a crucial role in combating the Jasper Fire and \n     preventing it from destroying hundreds of homes;\n       (3) the Tatanka Hotshot crew was instrumental in providing \n     the effort, expertise and training necessary to establish a \n     fire line around the Jasper Fire; and\n       (4) the men and women who fought the Jasper Fire are \n     commended for their bravery, their extraordinary efforts to \n     contain the fire, and their commitment to protect lives, \n     property, and the surrounding communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10491-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNITED STATES GRAIN STANDARDS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, Senator Smith of New Hampshire has an \namendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for Mr. Smith of \n     New Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered 4312.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                            dog field trials\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, in a colloquy regarding the Federal Aid bill and \nconcerns that have been raised with respect to the use of Pittman-\nRobertson Act-acquired lands for dog field trials.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am delighted to accommodate my friend \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. As the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee knows, there is nothing that precludes the use Pittman-\nRobertson\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\nlands for dog field trials, and, that in fact, this is a legitimate use \nof these lands, provided that the field trials are consistent with the \nobjectives of the Pittman-Robertson Act.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I agree that Pittman-Robertson lands can \ncertainly be used for field trials in a way that is consistent with the \nact.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Concerns have been raised that Pittman-Robertson lands \nshould not be used for field trials. As the Senator from New Hampshire \nknows, the sportsmen who pay this excise tax have varied interests--\nthey are hunters, field trialers, and shooting enthusiasts. The primary \ngoal of the Pittman-Robertson Act is wildlife conservation, but it is \nalso important that these lands support multiple uses.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I agree with the chairman of the \nFisheries, Wildlife, and Water Subcommittee.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Multiple uses of public lands necessarily require the \nbalancing of occasionally competing interests and objectives. The most \nappropriate parties to make decisions regarding wildlife habitat \ndevelopment and other uses and activities are state wildlife managers \nwho are most familiar with site specific conditions, habitat needs, and \nthe impact of sporting activities.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator \nfrom Idaho. It is those closest to the land who can help determine on a \ncase-by-case basis how to balance wildlife needs with users who engage \nin various sporting activities, while remaining consistent with the \nobjectives of the Pittman-Robertson Act.\n\n\n                           assistant director\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to make a point about one provision \nof the amendment and ask the committee chairman, Senator Smith, whether \nhe agrees. Section 132 of the bill establishes a new position, in the \nFish and Wildlife Service, of Assistant Director for Wildlife and Sport \nFish Restoration Programs. The provision also specifies the Assistant \nDirector's responsibilities.\n  Although this provision is similar to section 302 of the version of \nthe bill that passed the House, it differs in one significant respect. \nThe House report said that ``individuals in the Regional offices who \nare responsible for administering the Wildlife and Sport Fish \nRestoration Programs will also report to the Assistant Director.'' We \nconsidered and rejected this approach. The Fish and Wildlife Service \noperates through a system of regional offices. Employees in the \nregional offices report to the regional directors, and the regional \ndirectors report to the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. In \nlight of this, it would be potentially disruptive to require that \nindividuals who are responsible for administering the federal aid \nprogram to report directly to the Assistant Director, in Washington, \nD.C., rather than to the regional director. We do not intend section \n132 to mandate such a change. Does the chairman agree?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. By approving section 132, we intend \nto elevate the role of the head of the Federal Aid program, as part of \nour overall effort, in this bill, to give the program the full \nattention that it deserves. We do not intend, however, to mandate a \nchange in the general Fish and Wildlife Service's administrative \nstructure. No case has been made for such a change, and it could \npotentially be counterproductive.\n\n\n          Firearm and Bow Hunter Education and Safety Program\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the manager's amendment amends the Firearm \nand Bow Hunter Education and Safety Program that was included in the \nbill as reported out of the Committee. It is my understanding that the \nmanager's amendment authorizes $7.5 million for fiscal year 2001 and \n2002, and $8 million for fiscal year 2003 and every year thereafter. \nThe authorized funds would be provided to the States in the form of \ndirect grants. Would you please briefly explain how this new grant \nprogram will impact the States, especially States like Montana and New \nHampshire that are spending a considerable amount on these type of \nprojects already?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As you know, under current law, States \nare authorized to use one half of the revenue collected from taxes on \nhandguns and archery equipment for hunter education and the development \nof target ranges. Under our provision, any State that is fully \nutilizing the authorized amount for these purposes can spend the grant \nmoney on any project that is authorized in the Pittman-Robertson Act. \nStates that are spending less than the authorized amount have to use \nthe grant funds for hunter education and range development until they \nutilize the amount authorized by the Pittman-Robertson Act for those \npurposes. The States can then spend any remaining funds above the \nauthorized level on hunter education, range development or any other \nproject that is authorized in Pittman-Robertson. For example, say New \nHampshire is authorized to use $270 thousand of Pittman-Robertson funds \non hunter education and range development but is only spending $266 \nthousand. New Hampshire would be then required to spend $4 thousand of \nits grant money on hunter education and range development. After that \nNew Hampshire could use any remaining amount on any project that is \nconsistent with the purposes of the Pittman-Robertson Act.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is very important for us to recognize that the \nvast majority of states spend a considerable sum of money, both \nPittman-Robertson and state funds, on hunter education and target range \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage \nmy colleagues to support final passage of H.R. 3671, the Fish and \nWildlife Programs Improvement Act. I believe that this bill will \nenhance State wildlife conservation programs across the country. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  The Pittman-Robertson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act created user-pay \nbenefit trust funds. Together, these programs are called the Sport Fish \nand Wildlife Restoration Programs and are known more generally as the \nFederal Aid Program. The States are primarily responsible for managing \nthe Federal Aid Program. They identify eligible projects and then pay \nfor the projects up front. The projects must be directly related to old \nand sport fish restoration efforts. Projects that are eligible for \nfunding through the Pittman-Robertson and Wallop Breaux Programs \ninclude: acquisition and improvement of wildlife habitat; hunter \neducation; wildlife population surveys; construction of facilities to \nimprove public access; management of wildlife areas fish stocking, \nboating and fishing access; and facility development and maintenance. \nStates are reimbursed for up to 75 percent of the total cost of each \nproject from the Federal Aid funds.\n  I am offering a manager's amendment in the nature of a substitute \nthat makes several important changes to the Federal Aid bill that \nreported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I believe \nthat in adopting these changes, we will not only improve the bill, but \nwill also ensure that this important legislation is signed into law \nthis year. In addition, the manager's package includes the National \nFish and Wildlife Refuge System Centennial bill, and reauthorized the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation. This package has been negotiated \nwith the House Committee on Natural Resources.\n  Earlier this year, the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on \nFisheries, Wildlife and Water held a hearing on the Fish and Wildlife \nService's Administration of the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson \nActs and what we discovered was shocking.\n  The Pittman-Robertson and Wallop-Breaux Restoration Funds were \ncreated over 50 years ago. Congress intended to allow sportsmen to \ncontribute to the preservation and enhancement of the fields, streams \nand great outdoors that they enjoy so much. These two programs together \nauthorize the collection of excise taxes from the manufacturers and \nimporters of hunting and fishing equipment. Congress entrusted the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, through the Federal Aid Division, with the \nresponsibility of managing these programs and distributing the funds to \nthe States. Unfortunately, a report issued by the General Accounting \nOffice indicates that the Fish and Wildlife Service has violated that \ntrust.\n  These are significant wildlife programs, with substantial resources \nto fund them. Last year alone, sportsmen contributed over $430 million \nto the\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\nprograms. Every time a hunter buys a gun, or an angler buys a rod, they \nknow a portion of the cost is supposed to be given to the States to \nfund conservation projects, such as fish stocking or habitat \nrestoration. I say ``supposed to'' because GAO recently found that not \nall of the money the States are entitled to is, in fact, being given to \nthem. Both the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson Acts allowed the \nFish and Wildlife Service to reserve a percentage of the mounts \nreceived from the excise tax. However, the Acts also require that any \nexcess amounts not needed for administration of the programs be \ndistributed among the States. Unfortunately, for years, the Fish and \nWildlife Service just ignored that requirement and shortchanged the \nStates.\n  The problems that plague these programs are numerous. The Service \ncreated several grant programs which they had, at best, questionable \nauthority to do. Initially, they failed to account for millions of \ndollars. They ignored their own established guidelines for approving \ntravel. This is unacceptable behavior.\n  I believe that the manager's amendment will put an end to the \nmismanagement that plagues the programs today. At the same time, it \nwill institute a more effective way in which to manage these programs \nin the future. We address the problems that were identified in the GAO \nreport and in the hearing by making four fundamental changes to the \nwildlife restoration and sport fish programs. These changes are \nintended to enhance accountability within the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwith respect to the administration of the Federal Aid Program; to \nprovide further clarity regarding the use of administrative funds; to \nencourage safe hunting through education; and to provide additional \nflexibility to the States for regional conservation projects.\n  First, the manager's amendment authorizes $18 million in fiscal years \n2001 and 2002, and $16.4 million in fiscal year 2003 and subsequent \nyears, with an increase relative to the Consumer Price Index for the \nSecretary of the Interior to administer both the Pittman-Robertson and \nWallop-Breaux Programs. I felt that it was extremely important for the \nSecretary to have enough resources to administer the program \neffectively, but not so much money that there would be an incentive to \nwaste it needlessly. Although I am confident that the program can run \neffectively on the authorized amount, it is extremely important to \nrevisit this issue in several years. This is particularly important \nbecause the administration was unable to justify many of its costs. The \nmanager's amendment requires a biennial audit that will give the \nCommittee additional information on whether or not the authorized \namount needs to be adjusted.\n  Second, the manager's amendment enumerates legitimate administrative \ncosts and limits the use of Federal Aid funds to those expenses. The \nGeneral Accounting Office investigation found that the Fish and \nWildlife Service, among other things, failed to maintain adequate \ncontrols over funds, expenditures, and grants, and used administrative \nfunds inconsistently among different FWS regional offices. By \nspecifically listing what constitutes appropriate administrative costs, \nthese problems should not arise in the future.\n  Third, the manager's amendment creates a new Firearm and Bow Hunter \nEducation and Safety Grant Program authorized at $7.5 million in fiscal \nyears 2001 and 2002, and $8 million in fiscal year 2003 and every year \nthereafter. The authorized funds would be provided to the States in the \nform of direct grants. Under current law, States are authorized to use \nhalf of the revenue collected from taxes on handguns and archery \nequipment for hunter education and the development of target ranges. \nThis new provision would allow any State that is fully utilizing the \nauthorized amount for these purposes to spend the grant money on any \nproject that is authorized in the Pittman-Robertson Act. States that \nare spending less than the authorized amount would be required to use \nthe grant funds for hunter education and range development until they \nutilize the amount authorized by the Pittman-Robertson Act for those \npurposes. At that point, the States can spend any remaining funds above \nthe authorized level on hunter education, range development or any \nother project that is authorized in Pittman-Robertson.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, for example, the Department of \nFish and Game is authorized to use $270 thousand of Pittman-Robertson \nfunds on hunter education and range development, but is currently only \nspending $266 thousand. Under this bill, New Hampshire would be \nrequired to spend $4 thousand of its grant money on hunter education \nand range development; after that, however, the State would have the \ndiscretion to spend the remaining amount on any project that is \nconsistent with the purposes of the Pittman-Robertson Act. This strikes \na good balance between the interests of the hunting community that \nwanted states to spend the 50 percent level authorized under the law, \nand the States who want discretion to spend Pittman-Robertson funds to \nmeet their priorities, both education and conservation programs.\n  Finally, the manager's amendment authorizes a new Multistate \nConservation Grant Program at $6 million to allow for Federal Aid funds \nto be used for regional projects. The Multistate Grant program requires \nthe International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies \nInternational to submit a list to the Secretary of the Interior \nrecommending projects that should receive funding. The bill as reported \nout of Committee prohibited the International from considering any \ngrant submitted by an organization that opposes hunting or fishing. \nShortly before the markup, we realized this approach raised First \nAmendment concerns, and I promised to work with interested parties to \nresolve this problem. The manager's amendment prohibits any grant funds \nfrom supporting, in whole or in part, any activity that promotes \nopposition to hunting and fishing. Any organization can apply for a \ngrant but it can't use these funds in any activity that targets the \nindividuals who pay the excise tax. This is a common sense solution \nthat protects the first amendment rights of all, without penalizing \nsportsmen who help fund the programs.\n  This manager's amendment also reauthorizes the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation Establishment Act of 1984. The manager's amendment \nmakes important changes in the Foundation's charter, changes that I \nbelieve will allow the Foundation to build on its fine record of \nproviding funding for the conservation of our nation's fish, wildlife \nand plant resources.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984 to \nbring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across \nAmerica and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the \nFoundation has made more than 3,400 grants totaling over $435 million. \nThis is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has \npioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing \nthe North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for \nneotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the \nTiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling \nForest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few.\n  The Foundation has funded these programs by raising private funds to \nmatch federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 basis. During this \ntime of fiscal constraint, this is an impressive record of leveraging \nfederal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's operating costs are \ncovered by separate private sources, which means that Federal and \nprivate dollars given for conservation are spent only on conservation \nprojects.\n\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the \nhopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to implement solutions to \nsome difficult natural resource problems and is becoming widely \nrecognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental \nproblems. For example, when Atlantic salmon neared extinction in the \nU.S. due to overharvest in Greenland, the Foundation and its partners \nbought Greenland Salmon quotas. I, like many others in Congress, want \nthe Foundation to continue its important conservation efforts.\n  This legislation is quite simple. The manager's amendment would \nexpand the Foundation's governing Board of Directors from 15 members to \n25 members. This will allow a greater number\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\nof individuals with a strong interest in conservation to actively \nparticipate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's activities. Also, \nit would authorize appropriations to the Fish and Wildlife Service and \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through 2003.\n  Finally, the manager's amendment would authorize the ``National \nWildlife Refuge System Centennial Commemoration Act of 2000.'' This \nlandmark provision commemorates the centennial of the first national \nwildlife refuge in the United States, established on March 14, 1903, by \na great man and conservationist, President Theodore Roosevelt. By \nsetting aside land at Indian River Lagoon on Pelican Island, Florida as \na haven for birds, President Roosevelt began a conservation legacy \nknown as the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System has evolved into the most \ncomprehensive system of lands devoted to wildlife protection and \nmanagement in the world--spanning nearly 93 million acres across the \nUnited States and its territories. By placing special emphasis on \nconservation, our nation's network of refuges ensures the continued \nprotection of our wildlife resources, including threatened and \nendangered species, and land areas with significant wildlife-oriented \nrecreational, historical and cultural value.\n  Currently, there are more than 500 refuges in the United States and \nits territories, providing important habitat for 700 bird species, 220 \nmammal species, 250 species of amphibians and reptiles, and over 200 \nfish species. The Refuge System also hosts some of our country's \npremiere fisheries, and serves a vital role in the protection of \nthreatened and endangered species by preserving their critical \nhabitats.\n  Approximately 98 percent of the Refuge System land is open to the \npublic. Each year, the System attracts more than 34 million visitors to \nparticipate in a variety of recreational activities that include \nobserving and photographing wildlife, fishing, hunting and taking part \nin system-sponsored educational programs. By providing the public with \nan opportunity to participate in these activities, refuges promote a \nsense of appreciation for the natural wonders of this nation and \nemphasize our important role as stewards of these lands.\n  The manager's amendment commemorates the Refuge System by creating a \nCommission that will oversee the Centennial anniversary and promote \npublic awareness and understanding of the importance of refuges to our \nnation. Additionally, the manger's amendment directs the Fish and \nWildlife Service to prepare a long-term plan for the Refuge System that \nwill enable the Service to look ahead and determine the future needs \nand priorities of the system network.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support adoption of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3671, the \nWildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000. \nThe bill we have before us today is the culmination of a bi-partisan, \nbi-cameral effort. I want to thank Chairman Bob Smith, Ranking Member \nBaucus, and Senator Boxer for their hard work and recognition of how \nimportant it was to pass this bill this year. I also thank \nRepresentative Don Young, Chairman of the House Resources Committee, \nfor his efforts and investigation into the program.\n  I think we have a bill that everyone can support. It will reduce \nGovernment waste and prevent misuse of funds, while enhancing the \nprogram. The federal aid program has been a conservation success story. \nThis bill will ensure that this success continues by restoring \naccountability and responsibility to the program. Ultimately, this \nlegislation will restore trust in the program, without affecting the \neffectiveness of the program.\n  Senator Craig and I introduced the Senate version of this bill \nbecause there was a problem and America's hunters and fishermen needed \ntrust returned to the administration of the Wildlife and Sport Fish \nRestoration Programs. The bill we have before us today restricts the \namount of money that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can spend on \nadministrative expenses, while clearly identifying authorized expenses. \nThe bill also improves the program by funding a multi-state grant \nprogram, and ensuring that hunter education and shooting range programs \nare funded at the level hunters and shooting enthusiasts expect and \ndeserve. These changes are good for the program, good for hunters, \nfishermen, and shooting enthusiasts, and are simply good government.\n  Congressional investigations and a General Accounting Office audit of \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service revealed that, contrary to existing \nlaw, money had been routinely diverted to administrative slush funds, \nwithheld from states, and generally misused for purposes unrelated to \neither fisheries or wildlife conservation. In addition, the GAO called \nthe Division of Federal Aid, ``if not the worst, one of the worst-\nmanaged programs we have encountered.'' As an avid outsdoorsman, I was \nparticularly disturbed by this abuse. As a legislator, I am pleased to \nhave an opportunity to prevent such abuses in the future.\n  This bill reestablishes the trust between the hunters and anglers who \npay the excise taxes and the Federal Government. It is an opportunity \nto repair a system that has been lauded as one of the nation's most \nsuccessful conservation efforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in \npassing this bipartisan effort to restore accountability and \nresponsibility to the Federal Aid programs and the Fish and Wildlife \nService.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support H.R. 3671, the Wildlife Sport \nFish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000, and the substitute \namendment proposed by the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Smith.\n  The Federal aid program, embodied in the Pittman-Robertson Act and \nthe Wallop-Breaux Act, uses the revenue derived from the excise taxes \non firearms and fishing equipment to support state efforts to promote \nwildlife conservation, sport fish conservation, hunter education, and \nrelated activities. It's a good program. It has provided more than $7 \nbillion to support state wildlife conservation and sport fish projects. \nTo give you a more specific idea about the benefits of the program, in \n1999 Montana received almost $5 million dollars under these programs, \nfor activities ranging from our hunter education program, to improving \nhabitat for white tail deer, waterfowl, and upland birds, to \nacquisition of access rights to private land, to our program to reduce \nconflicts between grizzly bears and people. A few years ago, the \nprogram helped us complete the Gallatin land exchange.\n  Over the years, problems developed in the administration of the \nprogram. In particular, the General Accounting Office and others found \nthat money that was set aside, by statute, for administration of the \nprogram was being used for unrelated activities. There also were \nconsiderable problems with budgeting and overall management.\n  The bill is designed to address these problems. It makes several \nreforms. Among other things, it reduces the amount available for \nadministrative expenses, clarifies what constitutes a proper \nadministrative expense, and establishes a new multistate grant program, \nin part, codifying a previous practice.\n  These reforms are important. They will assure that taxpayers' money \nis well spent and that states receive the funds that they are entitled \nto. In addition, both the bill reported by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the substitute amendment improve on the version of \nthe bill that passed the House. The bill and amendment provide a level \nof funding for administration that, while significantly lower than the \nprevious level, will fully fund the current activities of the federal \naid office of the Fish and Wildlife Service. They also provide the \nService with some limited flexibility in determining what is an \nappropriate administrative expense and avoid prescribing the Service's \nactivities in such detail that we risk ``micromanaging.'' These changes \nmake a good bill even better.\n  I am pleased that the bill also includes two other important \nprovisions, one reauthorizing the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation \nand another establishing a program to recognize the upcoming centennial \nof the National Wildlife Refuge System. Both have previously passed the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and passage of the bill.\n\n\n                 multi-state conservation grant program\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as you know H.R. 3671 establishes a new \nMulti-State Conservation Grant program. This program requires the \nInternational Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, representing \nState fish and wildlife agencies, to submit a list to the Secretary of \nthe Interior of recommendation projects eligible for funding under this \nprogram prior to October 1 of each year. It is my understanding that \nthe International submitted a list to the Secretary of the Interior \nprior to October 1 of this year for consideration. Senator Smith, is it \nyour understanding that the list should be considered submitted in \naccordance with the provisions of this bill?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, it is. I do not believe that the \ngrant recipients, many of whom are States, should be penalized because \nwe were unable to pass a bill prior to October 1.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The multi-state grant program also requires the \nInternational to consult with the various non-governmental \norganizations and interests involved in this program in preparing this \nlist. It is my understanding that this provision should ensure that \nthese groups are involved both in preparing the request for grant \nproposals and in evaluating them. Is this also the view of the \nChairman?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, it is. This bill requires that the \nvarious interests involved in the Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration \nprograms be fully and meaningfully consulted in the process, as \nindicated by the Senator. This should be carefully adhered to in the \ndevelopment of future recommendations.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the title \namendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4312) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3671), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       An Act to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \n     Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act to \n     enhance the funds available for grants to States for fish and \n     wildlife conservation projects, to reauthorize and amend the \n     National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, to \n     commemorate the centennial of the establishment of the first \n     national wildlife refuge in the United States on March 14, \n     1903, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/12/senate-section/article/S10498-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10498-S10499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MAKING CERTAIN CORRECTIONS IN COPYRIGHT LAW\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5107, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5107) to make certain corrections in copyright \n     law.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with the imminent passage of the work made \nfor hire legislation today, I believe a few comments are in order. Last \nyear a technical amendment was included in the Intellectual Property \nand Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999 which added sound \nrecordings to the list of works eligible for, or considered as having, \nthe status of works made for hire under the Copyright Act. Works made \nwithin the scope of employment or large collaborative works such as \nmotion pictures are most often accorded the status of works made for \nhire, and the copyright for those works resides in the employer or the \ncorporation doing the hiring, such as the movie studio. The status of \nsound recordings had been in some doubt because sound recordings did \nnot obtain the status of copyrighted works until relatively recently, \nand, when added to the list of copyrightable works was not added to the \nlist of works made for hire.\n  When the technical amendment was raised for consideration in the \nconference, our research indicated that the practice of the Copyright \nOffice has uniformly been to register sound recordings as works made \nfor hire. The technical amendment therefore seemed a reasonable \ncodification of the ongoing practice at the Copyright Office, and was \nadopted.\n  Soon thereafter, however, it became clear that while the technical \namendment aligned the code with long-time Copyright Office practice, it \nwas not uncontroversial. Indeed many recording artists had believed \nthat the work-for-hire clauses of their contracts were unenforceable \nbecause contrary to the copyright code: i.e., sound recordings are not \nlisted as works made for hire. They view their contracts as operating \nas assignments or transfers of copyright. This distinction is important \nbecause under work-for-hire, the copyright is owned by the record \ncompany for the life of the copyright and the artists' rights are \nextinguished; under a transfer or assignment, the artist may recapture \nhis or her copyright after 35 years and then either renegotiate more \nfavorable terms with the same company or sell the remaining copyright \nto another label on more favorable terms. The basic premise of this \nrecapture is that the initial assignment of copyright might not fully \nreward the unproven artist who is an unknown quantity in a risky \nbusiness. Once the artist's commercial value is better proven an \nopportunity is given the artist to reap the rewards of his or her \ncreations that have stood the test of time. That the assumptions of the \nartists and labels about the status of these works have been \ndiametrically opposed might not have appeared until 35 years after the \n1978 effective act of the current Copyright Act, but for this technical \namendment.\n  What ought the status of sound recordings be then? Sound recordings \ncan be something of a hybrid art form lying on a continuum between the \nindividual author writing a song or book and the motion picture where \npossibly hundreds of employees collaborate on the final work. Sound \nrecordings can be more like the former or the latter, depending on the \ncircumstances. Because the facts can vary so widely--some albums are \nprimarily the product of the producer, some of one artist, some of a \ngroup, many have hired musicians or technicians who contribute but do \nso as part of their normal employment, some recordings are compilations \nof smaller recordings--it is not clear what general rule would be \neither most fair to all concerned or would most encourage the continued \ncreativity of recording artists. Since it may take some time, and will \nrequire the input of all the affected parties, it seems reasonable at \nthis time to undo last years' technical amendment without prejudice to \neither side in case litigation should arise later, while we explore \nwhether a more comprehensive rule can be crafted. That is why we have \nmade this change today, containing in the legislative language the \ncongressional intent that neither enactment prejudice any future \nlitigation.\n\n  It is my hope that the dialogue on this issue is beginning, rather \nthen ending, with this legislation. I think it is important to avoid \ncostly litigation if possible. And I believe it of paramount importance \nthat artists are fairly compensated for the work they do. Without the \ncreativity of the artist, the record companies would have nothing to \nmarket, and the audience would have nothing to enjoy. For the sake of \nthe future of music, I hope that using new technologies, artists and \naudience can begin having a closer relationship, where artists are \nencourage to stretch themselves creatively and fans are enabled to \nenjoy artists' work more fully. I think a focused conversation on the \nrelative roles of artists and label, as well as the artist's role in \ncontrolling their work in traditional and new media, can hasten that \nday. If the legislative roundabout on the work-for-hire issue concluded \ntoday can serve as such a beginning, then it has served a useful \npurpose.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues. At this time I also wish \nto thank my colleagues in the House and Senate who have supported this \nlegislation, and the recording artists and labels who have worked \ntogether on this legislation and who will begin the task\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\nof exploring what more comprehensive settlement we might reach with \nregard to the status of sound recordings under the copyright law, which \nwill allow them to continue their creative works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than a week ago I came to the floor to \nbe sure the record was clear that all Democrats had cleared for final \npassage H.R. 5107, the Work for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of \n2000. I urged the Senate to take up H.R. 5107 without further \nunnecessary delay. I am glad that the majority has finally decided that \naction on this consensus bill is appropriate. I still do not know what \ncaused the unexplained 2-week delay on the Republican side.\n  Representatives Berman and Coble deserve credit, along with the \ninterested parties, for working out a consensus solution in this \nlegislation. The purpose of this bill is to restore the status quo \nante, as it existed before November 29, 1999 regarding whether a sound \nrecording can qualify as a ``work made for hire'' under the second part \nof the definition of that term in section 101 of the Copyright Act, and \nto do so in a manner that does not prejudice any person or entity that \nmight have interests concerning this question. The House held an \noversight hearing to explore this matter earlier this year and \noriginated this legislation. This bill restores the law to the same \nplace it was before the enactment of section 1101(d) of the \nIntellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as \nenacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law Number 106-113, so that \nneither side is prejudiced by what was enacted at the end of 1999 or by \nwhat is being enacted now. This bill does not express or imply any view \nas to the proper interpretation of the work made for hire definition \nbefore November 29, 1999. Thus, neither the enactment of section \n1101(d) nor this bill's deletion of that language are to be considered \nin any way or otherwise given any effect by a court or the Copyright \nOffice when interpreting the work made for hire definition.\n  I congratulate Congressmen Berman and Coble on final passage of this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

The report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Convention is also transmitted \nfor the information of the Senate.\n  In recent years, the United States has increasingly focused world \nattention on the importance of combating terrorist financing as a means \nof choking off the resources that fuel international terrorism. While \ninternational terrorists do not generally seek financial gain as an \nend, they actively solicit and raise money and other resources to \nattract and retain adherents and to support their presence and \nactivities both in the United States and abroad. The present Convention \nis aimed at cutting off the sustenance that these groups need to \noperate. This Convention provides, for the first time, an obligation \nthat States Parties criminalize such conduct and establishes an \ninternational legal framework for cooperation among States Parties \ndirected toward prevention of such financing and ensuring the \nprosecution and punishment of offenders, wherever found.\n  Article 2 of the Convention states that any person commits an offense \nwithin the meaning of the Convention ``if that person by any means, \ndirectly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects \nfunds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge \nthat they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out''\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\neither of two categories of terrorist acts defined in the Convention. \nThe first category includes any act that constitutes an offense within \nthe scope of and as defined in one of the counter terrorism treaties \nlisted in the Annex to the Convention. The second category encompasses \nany other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a \ncivilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in \nhostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of the \nact, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to \ncompel a government or an international organization to do or to \nabstain from doing any act.\n  The Convention imposes binding legal obligations upon States Parties \neither to submit for prosecution or to extradite any person within \ntheir jurisdiction who commits an offense as defined in Article 2 of \nthe Convention, attempts to commit such an act, participates as an \naccomplice, organizes or directs others to commit such an offense, or \nin any other way contributes to the commission of an offense by a group \nof persons acting with a common purpose. A State Party is subject to \nthese obligations without regard to the place where the alleged act \ncovered by Article 2 took place.\n  States Parties to the Convention will also be obligated to provide \none another legal assistance in investigations or criminal or \nextradition proceedings brought in respect of the offenses set forth in \nArticle 2.\n  Legislation necessary to implement the Convention will be submitted \nto the Congress separately.\n  This Convention is a critical new weapon in the campaign against the \nscourge of international terrorism. I hope that all countries will \nbecome Parties to this Convention at the earliest possible time. I \nrecommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to this Convention, subject to the understanding, \ndeclaration and reservation that are described in the accompanying \nreport of the Department of State.\n                                                  William J.

Section 3015 establishes the base amount of \n     such educational assistance at the monthly rate of $528 for a \n     3-year period of service and $429 for a 2-year period of \n     service. These amounts increased to $552 per month and $449 \n     per month, respectively, on October 1, 2000.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would increase \n     the current monthly rate of basic education benefits to $600 \n     per month effective October 1, 2000, and to $720 per month on \n     October 1, 2002, for full-time students. The monthly rate for \n     2-year enlistees would increase to $487 per month effective \n     October 1, 2000, and to $585 per month on October 1, 2002. \n     This section provides parallel increases for part-time \n     students and similar adjustments to the rates paid for \n     correspondence and other types of training. No cost-of-living \n     increases would be made in fiscal years 2001 and 2003.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 4 of S. 1402 would increase the monthly rate of \n     basic education benefits to $600 per month for 3-year \n     enlistees and $488 per month for 2-year enlistees.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Under section 101 of the compromise agreement, effective \n     November 1, 2000, the basic education benefit would be \n     increased from $552 per month (effective October 1, 2000) to \n     $650 per month for a 3-year period of service, and $528 per \n     month for a 2-year period of service.\n\n\n   uniform requirement for high school diploma or equivalency before \n              application for montgomery gi bill benefits\n\n     Current Law\n       To be eligible to receive educational assistance, section \n     3011(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires that a \n     servicemember complete the requirements of a secondary school \n     diploma (or equivalent certificate) before the end of the \n     individual's initial obligated period of active duty. Section \n     3012(a)(2) contains a similar requirement for servicemembers \n     who serve 2 years of active duty as part of a 6-year Selected \n     Reserve commitment.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 111 of S. 1810 would create a single, uniform \n     secondary school diploma requirement as a prerequisite for \n     eligibility for education benefits--a requirement that, prior \n     to applying for benefits, the applicant will have received a \n     high school diploma or equivalency certificate, or will have \n     completed the equivalent of 12 semester hours in a program of \n     education leading to a standard college degree.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 102 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language, modified to reflect a new 10-year eligibility \n     period for individuals affected by this provision, which \n     would begin tolling on such individual's last discharge (or \n     release from active duty) or the effective date of this Act, \n     whichever is later.\n\n\n repeal of requirement for initial obligated period of active duty as \n        condition of eligibility for montgomery gi bill benefits\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 3011(a)(1)(A)(i) and 3012(a)(1)(A)(i) of title 38, \n     United States Code, set forth initial-period-of-active-duty \n     requirements to earn basic educational assistance entitlement \n     under the Montgomery GI Bill. The period within which a \n     servicemember's eligibility for educational assistance can be \n     established is currently restricted to the initial period of \n     active duty service.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 112 of S. 1810 would strike the requirement that \n     MGIB benefit entitlement be predicated on serving an \n     ``initial'' period of obligated service and substitute in its \n     place a requirement that an obligated period of active duty \n     be served.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 103 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language with a clarifying amendment that for an obligated \n     period of service of at least 3 years, the servicemember \n     would have to complete at least 30 months of continuous \n     active duty under that period of obligated service. In \n     addition, the compromise agreement contains a modification to \n     reflect a new 10-year eligibility period for individuals \n     affected by this provision, which would begin tolling on such \n     individual's last discharge (or release from active duty) or \n     the effective date of this Act, whichever is later.\n\n\nadditional opportunity for certain veap participants to enroll in basic \n            educational assistance under montgomery gi bill\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3018C of title 38, United States Code, furnishes an \n     opportunity for certain post-Vietnam-era Veterans' \n     Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) participants to convert \n     to the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) if the individual was a \n     participant in VEAP on October 9, 1996, was serving on active \n     duty on that date, meets high school diploma or equivalency \n     requirements before applying for MGIB benefits, is discharged \n     from active duty after the individual makes the election to \n     convert, and during the 1-year period beginning on October 9, \n     1996, makes an irrevocable election to receive benefits under \n     the MGIB in lieu of VEAP, and also elects a $1,200 pay \n     reduction.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would furnish \n     individuals who have served continuously on active duty since \n     October 9, 1996, through at least April 1, 2000, and who \n     either turned down a previous opportunity to convert to the \n     MGIB or had a zero balance in their VEAP account, the option \n     to pay $2,700 to convert to the MGIB program; individuals \n     would have 12 months to elect to convert and 18 months to \n     make payment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 104 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n increased active duty educational assistance benefit for contributing \n                                members\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3011(b) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     servicemembers who elect to participate in the Montgomery GI \n     Bill program to participate in a voluntary pay reduction of \n     $100 per month for the first 12 months of active service to \n     establish entitlement to basic educational assistance.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 6 of S. 1810 would allow servicemembers who have \n     not opted out of MGIB participation to increase the monthly \n     rate of educational benefits they will receive after service \n     by making contributions, at any time prior to leaving \n     service, over and above the $1,200 basic pay reduction \n     necessary to establish MGIB eligibility. Under section 6, a \n     servicemember could contribute up to an additional $600 in \n     multiples of $4. The monthly rate of basic educational \n     assistance would be increased by $1 per month for each $4 so \n     contributed. Thus, MGIB participants who ``use up'' their \n     full 36 months of MGIB benefits would receive a 9-to-1 return \n     on their additional contribution investment. A maximum in-\n     service contribution of $600 would yield an additional $5,400 \n     of entitlement to the 36-month MGIB benefit.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 105 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language with amendments to make this provision effective May \n     1, 2001, and to make eligible any servicemember who was on \n     active duty on the date of enactment and subsequently \n     discharged between date of enactment and May 1, 2001 to have \n     until July 31, 2001. These individuals would have until July \n     31, 2001, to make an election to ``buy up'' additional \n     benefits.\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\n     Subtitle B--Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance\n\n\n increase in rates of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3532 of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     survivors' and dependents' educational assistance (DEA) \n     allowances of $485 per month for full-time school attendance, \n     with lesser amounts for part-time training. Generally, \n     eligible survivors and dependents include unremarried spouses \n     of veterans who died or are permanently or totally disabled \n     or servicemembers who are missing in action or captured for \n     more than 90 days by a hostile force or detained or interned \n     for more than 90 days by a foreign government. Under section \n     3534, such benefits are also available for correspondence \n     courses, special restorative training, and apprenticeship \n     training.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would increase \n     DEA benefits for full-time classroom training students to \n     $600 per month effective October 1, 2000, and $720 per month \n     effective October 1, 2002, with parallel increases for part-\n     time students and similar adjustments to the rates paid for \n     correspondence and other types of training. Apprenticeship \n     training would increase from $353 to $437 per month effective \n     October 1, 2000, and $524 per month effective October 1, \n     2002. This provision also requires annual cost-of-living \n     allowances for DEA benefits.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 5 of S. 1402 would increase the full-time rate of \n     DEA benefits by 13.6 percent to $550 per month, and make \n     parallel increases in the benefit rates afforded to three-\n     quarter time and half-time students. Increases of 13.6 \n     percent in the amounts for correspondence courses, special \n     restorative training, and apprenticeship training would also \n     be afforded.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Under section 111 of the compromise agreement, effective \n     November 1, 2000, the basic education benefit for survivors \n     and dependents would increase from $485 per month to $588 per \n     month, with future annual cost-of-living increases effective \n     October 1, 2001.\n\n\nelection of certain recipients of commencement of period of eligibility \n         for survivors' and dependents' educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3512(a)(3) of title 38, United States Code, \n     provides that if the Secretary first finds that the parent \n     from whom eligibility for DEA benefits is derived has a total \n     and permanent service-connected disability, or if the death \n     of the parent from whom eligibility is derived occurs between \n     an eligible child's 18th and 26th birthdays, then such \n     eligibility period shall end 8 years after whichever date \n     last occurs: (1) the date on which the Secretary first finds \n     that the parent from whom eligibility is derived has a total \n     and permanent service-connected disability, or (2) the date \n     of death of the parent from whom eligibility is derived. \n     ``First finds'' is defined in this section as either the date \n     the Secretary notifies an eligible parent of total and \n     permanent service-connected disability or the effective date \n     of such disability award.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 114 of S. 1810 would allow a child to elect the \n     beginning date of eligibility for DEA benefits that is \n     between (1) in the case of a child whose eligibility is based \n     on a parent who has a total and permanent service-connected \n     disability, the effective date of the rating determination \n     and the date of notification by the Secretary for such \n     disability, (2) in the case of a child whose eligibility is \n     based on the death of a parent, the date of the parent's \n     death and the date of the Secretary's decision that the death \n     was service-connected.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 112 of the compromise agreement contains the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n    adjusted effective date for award of survivors' and dependents' \n                         educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5113 of title 38, United States Code, states that \n     except for the effective date of adjusted benefits, dates \n     relating to awards under chapters 30, 31, 32, 34, and 35, or \n     chapter 1606 of title 10 shall, to the extent feasible, \n     correspond to effective dates relating to awards of \n     disability compensation.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would permit \n     the award of DEA benefits to be retroactive to the date of \n     the entitling event, that is, service-connected death or \n     award of a total and permanent service-connected disability. \n     This provision would be limited to eligible persons who \n     submit an original claim for DEA benefits within 1 year after \n     the date of the rating decision first establishing the \n     person's entitlement.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 115 of S. 1810 would tie the effective date of \n     award for DEA benefits to the date of the entitling event, \n     i.e., the date of a veteran's service-connected death or \n     award of a permanent and total disability rating. This \n     provision would be limited to eligible persons who submit an \n     original claim for DEA benefits within 1 year after the date \n     of the rating decision first establishing the person's \n     entitlement.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 113 of the compromise agreement contains the Senate \n     language.\n\n\navailability under survivors' and dependents' educational assistance of \n    preparatory courses for college and graduate school requirements\n\n       Current Law\n       Sections 3002(3) and 3501(a)(5) of title 38, United States \n     Code, define the ``program of education'' for which veterans \n     and surviving spouses and children, receive educational \n     assistance benefits. Section 701 of Public Law 106-118 \n     modified section 3002(3) of title 38, United States Code, to \n     permit a veteran to use benefits for preparatory courses. \n     Examples of preparatory courses include courses for \n     standardized tests used for admission to college or graduate \n     school.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 113 of S. 1810 would allow survivors'' and \n     dependents' educational assistance benefits to be provided \n     for use on preparatory courses.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 114 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language with an amendment clarifying that qualifying persons \n     may pursue preparatory courses prior to the person's 18th \n     birthday.\n\n               Subtitle C--General Educational Assistance\n\n\n    revision of educational assistance interval payment requirements\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3680(a)(C) of title 38, United States Code, allows \n     VA to pay educational assistance for periods between a term, \n     semester, or quarter if the interval between these periods \n     does not exceed one calendar month.\n     House Bill\n       Section 6 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would allow \n     monthly educational assistance benefits to be paid between \n     term, quarter, or semester intervals of up to 8 weeks.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 121 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n    availability of education benefits for payment for licensing or \n                          certification tests\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapters 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, and 36 of title 38, United \n     States Code, do not currently authorize use of VA educational \n     assistance benefits for occupational licensing or \n     certification tests.\n     House Bill\n       Section 7 of the House amendments to S. 1402 would allow \n     veterans' and DEA benefits to be used for up to $2,000 in \n     fees for civilian occupational licensing or certification \n     examinations that are necessary to enter, maintain, or \n     advance into employment in a vocation or profession. This \n     section would establish various requirements regarding the \n     use of such entitlement and requirements for organizations \n     or entities offering licensing or certification tests. \n     This section also establishes minimum approval \n     requirements of a licensing or certification body, \n     requirements for tests, requirements for organizations or \n     entities offering these tests, VA administrative authority \n     (including a requirement to develop the computer systems \n     and procedures to make payments to beneficiaries for these \n     tests), and a seven-member, organization-specific VA \n     Professional Certification and Licensing Advisory \n     Committee.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 122 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language with an amendment that the Secretary shall name \n     seven individuals to the VA Professional Certification and \n     Licensing Advisory Committee, an amendment that deletes \n     specific names of organizations from which members shall be \n     named, and an amendment that deletes the requirement that \n     members shall serve without compensation.\n\n\n  increase for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 in aggregate annual amount \n   available for state approving agencies for administrative expenses\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3674(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, makes \n     available amounts not exceeding $13 million in each fiscal \n     year for duties carried out by State Approving Agencies.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 123 of the compromise agreement amends the amount \n     available for State Approving Agencies to $14 million for \n     fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002.\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\n                      TITLE II--HEALTH PROVISIONS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Personnel Matters\n\n\nannual national pay comparability adjustment for nurses employed by the \n                     department of veterans affairs\n\n     Current Law\n       The rate of pay for VA nurses is determined using a \n     mechanism contained in Subchapter IV of Chapter 74, title 38, \n     United States Code. The law links changes in total pay to \n     nurse compensation trends in local health care labor markets. \n     This locality pay feature has not always produced the results \n     envisioned by Congress. For example, even though many VA \n     nurses received very substantial one-time increases as a \n     consequence of the 1990 restructuring of basic pay, some VA \n     nurses have not received any additional pay raises since that \n     time.\n     House Bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 5109 would reform the local labor \n     market survey process and replace it with a discretionary \n     survey technique. The bill would provide more flexibility to \n     VA medical center directors to obtain the data needed to \n     complete necessary surveys and also restrict their authority \n     to withhold indicated rate increases. Directors would be \n     prohibited from reducing nurse pay. In addition, the House \n     bill would also guarantee VA nurses a national comparability \n     increase equivalent to the amount provided to other federal \n     employees. The bill also would require Veterans Health \n     Administration network directors to consult with nurses on \n     questions of policy affecting the work of VA nurses, and \n     would provide for registered nurses' participation on medical \n     center committees considering clinical care, budget matters, \n     or resource allocation involving the care and treatment of \n     veteran patients.\n     Senate Bill\n       Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 201 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n                        special pay for dentists\n\n     Current Law\n       Subchapter III of Chapter 74, title 38, United States Code, \n     authorizes special pay to physicians and dentists employed in \n     the Veterans Health Administration. This authority is \n     intended to improve recruitment and retention of dentists and \n     physicians.\n     House Bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 5109 would revise and increase the \n     rates of special pay for VA dentists. This is the first \n     proposed change in these rates since 1991.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language. The Committees urge medical center directors to \n     utilize the full range of pay increases authorized, including \n     increases in the higher range, to optimize dentist \n     recruitment and retention efforts.\n\n\n     EXEMPTION FOR PHARMACISTS FROM CEILING ON SPECIAL SALARY RATES\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 7455 of title 38, United States Code, VA has \n     authority to increase rates of basic pay for certain health \n     care personnel--either nationally, locally or on another \n     geographic basis--when deemed necessary for successful \n     recruiting and retention. Special rates may be granted in \n     response to salaries in local labor markets, but may not \n     enable VA to be a pay leader. With limited exceptions, the \n     law restricts such ``special salary rates'' to a maximum pay \n     rate, but exempts two categories of health care personnel \n     from that statutory ceiling: nurse anesthetists and physical \n     therapists.\n     House Bill\n       Section 103 of H.R. 5109 adds VA pharmacists to the \n     existing categories of VA personnel exempted from such \n     statutory pay ceilings. This amendment would enable VA to \n     improve retention of the most senior members of the current \n     pharmacy workforce and would improve its competitiveness in \n     recruiting new pharmacists.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n     TEMPORARY FULL-TIME APPOINTMENTS OF CERTAIN MEDICAL PERSONNEL\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7405 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA \n     to provide temporary appointments of individuals in certain \n     professions, including nursing, pharmacy, and respiratory, \n     physical, and occupational therapy, who have successfully \n     completed a full course of study but who are pending \n     registration, licensure, or certification. Upon obtaining the \n     required credentials, these professionals may be converted to \n     career appointments. This temporary appointment authority \n     provides VA a means of recruiting new health professionals \n     still in the process of meeting the technical qualification \n     standards pertinent to their fields.\n       However, VA must now limit physician assistants (PAs) \n     waiting to take the PA certification examination to a general \n     1 year, nonrenewable appointment. Since the national \n     certification examination is only offered once a year, this \n     1-year appointment limits VA's efforts to provide a smooth \n     transition from a training appointment to a permanent \n     appointment for such graduates.\n     House Bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 5109 would amend section 7405(c)(2) of \n     title 38, United States Code, to add the position of \n     physician assistant to the existing group of professional and \n     technical occupations for which VA may make temporary \n     graduate technician appointments, provided these individuals \n     have completed training programs acceptable to the Secretary. \n     Under this appointment authority, graduate physician \n     assistants would have up to 2 years to obtain professional \n     certification or licensure.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 203 of S. 1810 would accomplish the same ends as \n     the above-described language with respect to physician \n     assistant temporary graduate technician appointments.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204(a) of the compromise agreement contains the \n     House language.\n\n\n                       MEDICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7405 of title 38, United States Code, permits the \n     temporary appointment of certain medical support personnel \n     who work primarily in the laboratories and other facilities \n     of VA principal investigators who have been awarded VA \n     research and development funds through VA's scientific merit \n     review process. These technicians are appointed for a maximum \n     term of 2 years. The normal VA cycle of 3-year research \n     awards conflicts with the 2-year maximum term for \n     appointments of these key personnel in VA's research and \n     development program.\n     House Bill\n       Section 105 of H.R. 5109 would amend section 7405(c)(3) of \n     title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary to \n     make and to renew temporary full time appointments for \n     periods not to exceed 3 years.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204(b) of the compromise agreement contains the \n     House language.\n\n\n                    QUALIFICATIONS OF SOCIAL WORKERS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7402(b)(9) of title 38, United States Code, \n     requires that a VA social worker become licensed, certified, \n     or registered in the state in which he or she works within 3 \n     years of initial appointment in this capacity by the VA. \n     Certain states, such as California, impose prerequisites to \n     the licensure examination that routinely require more than 3 \n     years to satisfy. Many states do not provide reciprocity in \n     social work licensure, and thus will not grant a license in \n     the absence of a new state licensing examination. At present, \n     VA social workers are the only VA health care practitioners \n     who cannot use their state licenses to gain credentials in \n     other states' VA medical centers.\n     House Bill\n       Section 106 of H.R. 5109 would allow the Secretary, on the \n     recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, to waive \n     the 3-year requirement in order to provide sufficient time to \n     newly graduated or transferred VA social workers to prepare \n     for their state licensure examinations.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 205 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n     PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT ADVISOR TO THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR HEALTH\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7306 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     the Office of the Under Secretary for Health and requires \n     that the office include representatives of certain health \n     care professions. VA is the nation's largest single employer \n     of physician assistants (PAs), with over 1,100 physician \n     assistants on VA's employment rolls. Nevertheless, PAs are \n     not represented by a member of their field in the office of \n     the Under Secretary for Health.\n     House Bill\n       Section 104 of H.R. 5109 would establish a PA consultant \n     position which would be filled by a VHA physician assistant \n     designated by the Under Secretary for Health. This individual \n     could be assigned to the field with occasional official \n     visits as needed to VHA headquarters or elsewhere as required \n     to fulfill assigned duties of the position. The PA consultant \n     would advise the Under Secretary on all matters relating to \n     the utilization and employment of physician assistants in the \n     Veterans Health Administration.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 of S. 1810 would add an Advisor on Physician \n     Assistants to the immediate Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Health, would require this individual to serve in an advisory \n     capacity and would require that the PA advisor shall advise \n     the Under Secretary on matters regarding general and expanded \n     utilization, clinical privileges, and employment (including \n     various specific matters associated therewith) of physician \n     assistants in the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 206 of the compromise agreement incorporates \n     portions of both the House and Senate language. The \n     Committees call upon VA to provide the individual selected as \n     Advisor on Physician Assistants with necessary support and \n     resources to enable this consultant to fulfill the assigned \n     responsibilities of the position.\n\n\n          EXTENSION OF VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 106-117, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and \n     Benefits Act of 1999, authorized a temporary program of \n     voluntary separation incentive payments to assist VA in \n     restructuring its workforce. This program limited VA to a 15-\n     month authorization period for such ``buyouts'' of VA \n     employees, limited to 4,700 the number of staff who could \n     participate, and required VA to make a contribution of 26 \n     percent of the average salary of participating employees to \n     the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. This \n     provision also requires a one-for-one employee replacement \n     for each such buyout approved under this policy.\n     House Bill\n       Section 107 of H.R. 5109 would amend title XI of Public Law \n     106-117 to increase the number of VA positions subject to \n     buyouts to 8,110. The House measure would also adjust the \n     contribution made by VA to the retirement fund to 15 percent, \n     an amount equivalent to the amount that most other Federal \n     agencies must contribute to the fund for their buyout \n     participants. The measure extends VA's buyout authority \n     from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2002.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 207 of the compromise agreement follows the House \n     language, but limits the number of VA positions subject to \n     buyouts to 7,734 and allocates the positions for activities \n     of the Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits \n     Administration, National Cemetery Administration, and VA \n     staff offices.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Military Service Issues\n\n\n                        MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 301 of H.R. 5109 would require VA to take and \n     maintain a thorough history of each veteran's health, \n     including a military medical history. Ascertaining that a \n     veteran was a prisoner of war, participated directly in \n     combat, or was exposed to sustained subfreezing conditions, \n     toxic substances, environmental hazards, or nuclear ionizing \n     radiation often facilitates diagnosis and treatment of \n     veterans. The House bill would provide veterans assurance \n     that such a policy becomes a matter of routine clinical \n     practice in VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 211 of the compromise agreement adopts the intent \n     of the House proposal, but in the form of a Sense of the \n     Congress Resolution to express the sense of Congress that VA \n     proceed to implement a system of record keeping to record \n     veterans' military history.\n\n\n   STUDY OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IN VIETNAM VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 98-160 directed VA to conduct a large-scale \n     survey on the prevalence and incidence of PTSD and other \n     psychological problems in Vietnam veterans. The study found \n     that 15 percent of male and 8.5 percent of female Vietnam \n     veterans suffered from PTSD. Among those exposed to high \n     levels of war zone stress, however, PTSD rates were \n     dramatically higher. Also, the study found that nearly one-\n     third of Vietnam veterans had suffered from PTSD at some \n     point after military service.\n     House Bill\n       Section 302 of HR 5109 would direct the VA to enter into a \n     contract with an ``appropriate entity'' to carry out a \n     follow-up study to the study conducted under Public Law 98-\n     160.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 212 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language. The Committees agree the new study should be kept \n     distinct and independent from VA, as in the original. The \n     compromise agreement is not intended to pre-judge the entity \n     that will win this award.\n\n                   Subtitle C--Medical Administration\n\n\n              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FISHER HOUSES\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law does not explicitly provide VA with authority \n     to house veterans overnight to expedite outpatient care or \n     next-day hospital admissions. Nor does current law provide \n     explicit authority for VA to accept, maintain, or operate \n     facilities for housing families or others who accompany \n     veterans to VA facilities. However, most VA medical centers \n     offer veterans who live some distance from a medical facility \n     from which they are receiving care or services help with some \n     form of lodging to facilitate scheduled visits or admissions. \n     Indeed, more than 115 facilities offer lodging of some kind \n     on VA grounds, and services are available in non-VA \n     facilities at a number of other locations. Also, over the \n     years, many VA medical centers have converted unused wards \n     and other available space to establish temporary lodging \n     facilities for use by patients. The Under Secretary for \n     Health has encouraged medical centers to establish such \n     facilities to avert the need for hospitalizing patients when \n     outpatient treatment is more appropriate. This guidance to VA \n     facilities suggested that facilities could provide lodging \n     without charge to outpatients and their family members and \n     others accompanying veterans when ``medically necessary.'' \n     The guidance also sanctioned the use of a revocable license \n     for family members under which an individual could be \n     required to pay VA a fee equal to the fair- market value \n     of the services being furnished.\n     House Bill\n       Section 404 of H.R. 5109 would clarify VA's authority to \n     provide temporary overnight accommodations in ``Fisher \n     Houses,'' built with funds donated by the Zachary and \n     Elizabeth M. Fisher Foundation. Four such facilities are now \n     being operated in conjunction with VA medical centers and \n     other similar facilities located at or near a VA facility. \n     These accommodations are available to veterans who have \n     business at a VA medical facility and must travel a \n     significant distance to receive Department services, and to \n     other individuals accompanying veterans. Section 404 would \n     also give VA clear authority to charge veterans (and those \n     accompanying them) for overnight accommodations and apply \n     fees collected to support continuation of these services. The \n     measure would require VA to promulgate regulations to address \n     matters such as the appropriate limitations on the use of the \n     facilities and the length of time individuals may stay in the \n     facilities.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 221 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n                    EXCEPTION TO THE RECAPTURE RULE\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8136 of title 38, United States Code, requires VA \n     to ``recapture'' the amount of a grant to a state home for \n     purposes of building or renovating a state veterans home, if, \n     within 20 years, the state home ceases to be used for \n     providing domiciliary, nursing home, or hospital care for \n     veterans. This provision could be interpreted to require \n     recapture of the grant if the state home allows VA to \n     establish an outpatient clinic in the home.\n     House Bill\n       Section 406 of H.R. 5109 would clarify that establishment \n     of an outpatient clinic in a state home would not constitute \n     grounds entitling the United States to recover its grant.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 222 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n  SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF \n VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN THE PROCUREMENT OF \n                             MEDICAL ITEMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and \n     Department of Defense (DOD) Health Resources Sharing and \n     Emergency Operations Act, Public Law 97-174, VA and DOD have \n     the authority to share medical resources. In 1999, VA and DOD \n     entered into sharing agreements amounting to $60 million \n     dollars out of combined budgets of approximately $35 billion. \n     This is resource sharing of less than two-tenths of one \n     percent. On May 25, 2000, the General Accounting Office \n     reported that greater joint pharmaceutical procurements alone \n     could lead to as much as $345 million in annual recurring \n     savings.\n     House Bill\n       H. Con. Res. 413 would encourage expanded joint procurement \n     of medical items, to include prescription drugs.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 223 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n                 Subtitle D--Construction Authorization\n\n\n            AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8104 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     no funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year, and VA may \n     not obligate or expend funds (other than for planning and \n     design) for any medical construction project involving a \n     total expenditure of more than $4 million unless funds for \n     that project have been specifically authorized by law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201 of H.R. 5109 would authorize the construction \n     of a gero-psychiatric care building at the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Palo Alto, California ($26.6 \n     million); the construction of a utility plant and \n     electrical vault at the Department\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\n     of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, Florida ($23.6 \n     million); and, seismic corrections, clinical consolidation \n     and other improvements at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, California ($51.7 \n     million). Also, the House bill would authorize the \n     renovation of psychiatric nursing units at the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Murfreesboro, \n     Tennessee, using funds previously appropriated for this \n     specific purpose ($14 million).\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 301 of S. 1810 would authorize construction of a \n     120-bed gero-psychiatric facility at the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Menlo Park \n     Division, California ($26.6 million); and, construction of a \n     nursing home at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center, Beckley, West Virginia ($9.5 million). In section 302 \n     of S. 1810, the Senate would amend section 401 of the \n     Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999, \n     Public Law 106-117, to add as a seventh project authorized by \n     that act for fiscal year 2000-2001 the Murfreesboro \n     construction project ($14 million).\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 231 of the compromise agreement incorporates each \n     of the projects authorized by either body and includes \n     specific authorization for the Murfreesboro project. Also, \n     the compromise agreement provides that the authorizations for \n     Palo Alto, Long Beach, and Beckley will be for 2 years, \n     covering fiscal years 2001 and 2002, while the authorization \n     for the Miami project will be only for fiscal year 2001. The \n     compromise agreement also renews and extends the prior \n     authorization of a project at the Lebanon, Pennsylvania VA \n     Medical Center through the end of fiscal year 2002.\n       The Miami electrical plant and utility vault project is \n     authorized only for fiscal year 2001. While the compromise \n     agreement authorizes the project to proceed, we note that the \n     current estimate to replace these facilities is $32 million. \n     Given this level of anticipated expenditure, the Committees \n     urge the Secretary to examine innovative ways to reduce VA's \n     outlay, at least on an initial basis. For example, the \n     Committees note that the Miami facility is located in the \n     midst of a very densely developed community of health and \n     public safety-related institutions, including the Jackson \n     Memorial Hospital and Metro-Dade police headquarters, among \n     others. Given the need for such crucial institutions, \n     including the VA medical center, to have dependable, stable, \n     weather-proof and even fail-safe electrical sources, the \n     Committees urge the Secretary to consider a ``performance-\n     based contract'' for these services through the local utility \n     (Florida Power and Light), or by consortium with multiple \n     partners in need of similar improvements, assurances and \n     security of utilities. At a minimum, the Secretary must \n     carefully examine the reported cost of this project to ensure \n     that it is being planned to meet known needs, rather than \n     planned for the ``highest possible use.''\n\n\n                    AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n     House Bill\n       The House bill (H.R. 5109, section 202) would authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 of $101.9 \n     million for construction of the facilities authorized in \n     section 201 thereof.\n     Senate Bill\n       S. 1810, section 303, would authorize appropriations for \n     fiscal years 2001 and 2002 of $36.1 million for construction \n     of the facilities authorized in section 301. Also, section \n     303 alters the authorization funding level of projects \n     authorized in Public Law 106-117 by including the \n     Murfreesboro project discussed above.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 232 of the compromise agreement authorizes \n     appropriations for the amounts indicated in each measure for \n     these projects, affecting both fiscal year 2001 and fiscal \n     year 2002, as follows:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\n                                                                 Amount\n        Authorizations                                       authorized\nBeckley............................................................$9.5\nLebanon \\1\\........................................................14.5\nLong Beach.........................................................51.7\nMiami \\2\\..........................................................23.6\nMurfreesboro.......................................................14.0\nPalo Alto..........................................................26.6\n\n\\1\\ Indicates authorization of appropriation in fiscal year 2002 only.\n\\2\\ Indicates authorization of appropriation in fiscal year 2001 only.\n\n\nEXTENSION OF CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION AT THE LEBANON, PENNSYLVANIA VA \n                             MEDICAL CENTER\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 401 of Public Law 106-117 (113 Stat. 1572) \n     authorized a major construction project at the Lebanon, \n     Pennsylvania, VA Medical Center.

In the Veterans' Millennium \n     Health Care Act, Public Law 106-117, Congress eased limits in \n     law on leasing underused VA property based on a finding that \n     long-term leasing could be used more extensively to enhance \n     health care delivery to veterans.\n     House Bill\n       Section 407 of H.R. 5109 would amend the waiting period for \n     VA notifications to Congress from 60 ``legislative'' days, to \n     90 ``calendar'' days. This change would shorten the length of \n     time VA must wait before entering into an enhanced-use lease.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 241 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n RELEASE OF REVERSIONARY INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES IN CERTAIN REAL \n         PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY CONVEYED TO THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n     Current Law\n       In 1953, by Act of Congress (67 Stat. 54), the federal \n     government transferred certain property of the Veterans \n     Administration (now Department of Veterans Affairs) in \n     Johnson City (now Mountain Home), Tennessee, to the State of \n     Tennessee, for use by the Army National Guard of the State of \n     Tennessee. The act of transfer retained a reversionary \n     interest in the land on the part of the government in the \n     event that the State of Tennessee ceased to use the land as a \n     training area for the guard and for ``other military \n     purposes.'' The land is no longer being used by the Tennessee \n     National Guard and has no practical use by the government. \n     Local municipal officials desire the land as a site for a \n     public park and recreation area, and the State of Tennessee \n     has made a commitment to transfer the land for these purposes \n     but may not do so absent a recision of the federal \n     government's reversionary interest in the property.\n     House Bill\n       Section 407 of H.R. 5109 would rescind the government's \n     reversionary interest in the Tennessee property.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 242 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n TRANSFER OF THE ALLEN PARK, MICHIGAN, VA MEDICAL CENTER TO FORD MOTOR \n                      LAND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION\n\n     Current Law\n       In 1937, the Henry Ford family donated a 39-acre plot to VA \n     expressly for the establishment of the Allen Park, Michigan \n     VA Hospital. The conveyance provided that VA must return the \n     land, in the same condition as it was received, if VA ceased \n     to utilize it for veterans' health care. In 1996, VA \n     activated a new VA Medical Center in Detroit.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 5346 would transfer the land, the site of the former \n     Allen Park, Michigan VA Medical Center, and all improvements \n     thereon, to the Ford Motor Land Development Corporation, a \n     subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Having been replaced in \n     1996 by a new VA Medical Center in Detroit, the facility now \n     is in disrepair. The bill would require up to 7 years of \n     cooperation between VA and Ford in demolition, environmental \n     cleanup (including remediation of hazardous material and \n     environmental contaminants found on the site), and \n     restoration of the property to its prior state. VA \n     contributions would be limited to $2 million per year over \n     the period, and Ford would be responsible for any amount over \n     VA's total contribution ($14 million) required to complete \n     the restoration. At the conclusion of restorative work, the \n     Secretary would formally abandon the property, which would \n     then revert to Ford Motor Land Development Corporation, in \n     accordance with the reversionary clause contained in the \n     original 1937 gift.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 243 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n transfer of land at the carl vinson va medical center, dublin, georgia\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 5139 would convey to the Board of Regents of the State \n     of Georgia two tracts of real property, including \n     improvements, consisting of 39 acres at the Carl Vinson \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center,\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n     Dublin, Georgia. The bill also conveys to the Community \n     Service Board of Middle Georgia three tracts of property \n     consisting of 58 acres, including improvements, at the Carl \n     Vinson facility. The bill requires these properties be used \n     in perpetuity for education or health care.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 244 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\nland conveyance of miles city, montana veterans affairs medical center \n                       to custer county, montana\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 312 of S. 1810 would transfer VA medical center \n     facilities in Miles City, Montana, to Custer County, Montana, \n     while authorizing VA to lease space in which VA would operate \n     an outpatient clinic. Custer County would devote the \n     transferred land to assisted living apartments for the \n     elderly and to a number of other economic enhancement and \n     community activity uses, including education and training \n     courses through Miles Community College, a technology center, \n     local fire department training, and use by the Montana Area \n     Food Bank. VA, in turn, is relieved of the requirement to \n     spend over $500,000 per year maintaining a facility that is \n     poorly suited to provide health care to the veterans of \n     eastern Montana. VA would devote the saved funds to expanding \n     Montana veterans' access to care by activating additional \n     community based outpatient clinics in Montana.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 245 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate \n     language. The compromise agreement anticipates that VA will \n     work with the civic leadership of Custer County, Montana in \n     order to identify potential improvements that may be \n     reasonably necessary to effectuate the transfer of the Miles \n     City property to Custer County. Also, the compromise \n     agreement calls for the Secretary to determine to what extent \n     it may be necessary to stipulate any conditions about the \n     transfer, or conditions for VA's future use of this property, \n     prior to the transfer of ownership of this property to Custer \n     County. The compromise agreement further envisions funds \n     appropriated to VA for non-recurring maintenance may be used, \n     as authorized by law, to facilitate the transfer of VA's \n     interest in the Miles City VA Medical Center to Custer \n     County.\n\n\ntransfer of the fort lyon, colorado, va medical center to the state of \n                                colorado\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Sections 313 and 314 of S. 1810 would transfer the VA \n     Medical Center, Ft. Lyon, Colorado to the State of Colorado \n     for use by the State as a corrections facility. Under the \n     terms of the bill, the conveyance would take place only when \n     arrangements are made to protect the interests of affected \n     patients and employees of the facility. With respect to \n     patients, the bill would require VA to make alternate \n     arrangements to ensure that appropriate medical care and \n     nursing home care services continue to be provided, on the \n     same basis that care had been provided at Ft. Lyon, to all \n     veterans receiving such services at the medical center. Under \n     the bill, the VA would be authorized to provide care in \n     community facilities at VA expense, notwithstanding other \n     statutory limitations--e.g., title 38, United States Code, \n     section 1720, which limits to 6 months the duration for which \n     such care might be provided to veterans for nonservice-\n     connected disabilities--or by state homes where VA would pay \n     full costs and reimburse the veterans' share of copayments. \n     Further, VA would be authorized to offer voluntary separation \n     incentive payments to eligible employees of the Ft. Lyon VA \n     medical center. In addition, the State would be required \n     to allow public access to the Kit Carson Chapel located on \n     the grounds of the VA medical center. And, finally, the VA \n     would report on the status of the VA health care system in \n     southern Colorado, not later than 1 year after the \n     conveyance.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Sections 246 and 247 of the compromise agreement follow the \n     Senate language, except for the provision extending VA's \n     authority to offer voluntary separation incentive payments \n     [subsection (c) of section 314 of S. 1810].\n       The inclusion of this language in this legislation should \n     not be misconstrued as an erosion of, or acquiescence in, the \n     requirement enacted in Public Law 106-117, the Veterans \n     Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999, for VA to \n     maintain VA-provided long-term care capacity at the 1998 \n     level. VA continues to be obligated by law to ensure that the \n     cumulative effect of its actions does not result in a \n     reduction in VA's ability to provide institutional long-term \n     care.\n       It should be noted that section 207 of this bill provides a \n     2-year extension of VA-wide authority to offer voluntary \n     separation incentive payments to VA employees. The Committees \n     find that the provision specifically granting the Fort Lyon \n     facility a 1-year authority to offer voluntary separation \n     incentive payments is redundant. Further, the Committees were \n     concerned that retaining the Fort Lyon-specific provision in \n     final legislation could have the unintended effect of \n     limiting the 2-year, VA-wide buyout authority, granted in \n     section 207, to 1 year when applied in the case of Fort Lyon. \n     The Committees expect VA to use the authority granted in \n     section 207, as an important human resources management tool, \n     in its conveyance of the Fort Lyon facility.\n\n TITLE III--COMPENSATION, INSURANCE, HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, AND MEMORIAL \n                           AFFAIRS PROVISIONS\n\n                Subtitle A--Compensation Program Changes\n\n\n PRESUMPTION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR HEART ATTACK OR STROKE SUFFERED \n  BY A MEMBER OF A RESERVE COMPONENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DUTY WHILE \n                   PERFORMING INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 101(24) of title 38, United States Code, \n     guardsmen and reservists who sustain an ``injury'' during \n     inactive duty training are eligible for certain veterans' \n     benefits, but are not eligible to receive disability \n     compensation for a condition characterized as a ``disease'' \n     that is incurred or aggravated during such training.\n     House Bill\n       Section 201(a) of H.R. 4850 would amend section 101(24) to \n     include an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or \n     a cerebrovascular accident resulting in disability or death \n     and occurring during any period of inactive duty training for \n     the purposes of service-connected benefits administered by \n     VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 301 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     provision.\n\n\nSPECIAL MONTHLY COMPENSATION FOR WOMEN VETERANS WHO LOSE A BREAST AS A \n                RESULT OF A SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITY\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1114(k) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     a special rate of compensation if a veteran, as the result of \n     a service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical \n     loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs, or one \n     foot, or one hand, or both buttocks, or blindness of one eye, \n     having only light perception, or has suffered complete loss \n     of the ability to speak, or deafness of both ears. The \n     special monthly compensation is payable in addition to the \n     compensation payable by reason of ratings assigned under the \n     rating schedule.\n     House Bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 4850 would amend section 1114(k) by \n     making veterans eligible for special monthly compensation due \n     to the service-connected loss of one or both breasts due to a \n     radical mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 103 of S. 1810 would amend section 1114(k) by \n     making female veterans eligible for special monthly \n     compensation due to the loss of one or both breasts, \n     including loss by mastectomy.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 302 of the compromise agreement contains the Senate \n     provision.\n\n\n  BENEFITS FOR PERSONS DISABLED BY PARTICIPATION IN COMPENSATED WORK \n                            THERAPY PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1151 of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     compensation, under certain circumstances, to veterans who \n     are injured as a result of VA health care or participation in \n     VA vocational rehabilitation. Section 1718 of title 38, \n     United States Code, authorizes the ``Compensated Work Therapy \n     Program (CWT),'' which pays veterans to work in a variety of \n     positions on contracts with governmental and industrial \n     entities. CWT work is intended to be therapeutic by helping \n     veterans re-enter the work force, enabling them to increase \n     self-confidence and by improving their ability to adjust to \n     the work setting. However, current law provides no mechanism \n     to compensate CWT participants who may be injured as a result \n     of participation.\n     House Bill\n       Section 402 of H.R. 5109 would allow VA to provide \n     disability benefits under section 1151 to CWT participants \n     injured while participating in this program.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 303 of the compromise agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n     REVISION TO LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS OF BENEFITS TO INCOMPETENT \n                       INSTITUTIONALIZED VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 5503 of title 38, United States Code, VA is \n     prohibited from paying compensation and pension benefits to \n     an incompetent veteran who has assets of $1,500 or more if \n     the veteran is being provided institutional care with or \n     without charge by VA (or another governmental provider) and \n     he or\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\n     she has no dependents. Such payments are restored if the \n     veteran's assets drop to $500 in value. If VA later \n     determines that the veteran is competent for at least 6 \n     months, the withheld payments are made in a lump sum.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 205 of S. 1076 would repeal the limitation on \n     benefit payments imposed by section 5503 of title 38, United \n     States Code.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Under section 304 of the compromise agreement, the amount \n     of resources that an incompetent veteran may retain and still \n     qualify for payments is increased from $1,500 to five times \n     the benefit amount payable to a service-connected disabled \n     veteran rated at 100 percent. If payments are withheld, they \n     may be restored if the veteran's assets drop to one-half of \n     that amount. The Committees expect that in notifying veterans \n     and fiduciaries of the applicability of this requirement, VA \n     will briefly indicate the assets that are counted or excluded \n     in determining net worth.

NAS would review whether DOD's \n     reconstruction of sampled doses is accurate, whether DOD \n     assumptions regarding exposure based upon sampled doses are \n     credible, and whether data from nuclear testing used by DOD \n     in its reconstructions are accurate.

No particular form of ownership is specified in \n     current law. Under regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, co-ownership of the \n     property by the veteran and another person is not relevant \n     to the amount of the grant if the co-owner is the \n     veteran's spouse. If, however, the co-owner is a person \n     other than the veteran's spouse, the maximum grant amount \n     is reduced by regulation to reflect the veteran's partial \n     ownership of the property interest, e.g., if the veteran \n     jointly owns the property with one other person such as a \n     sibling, the maximum grant is $21,500.

VA may, pursuant to \n     Public Law 104-204, provide benefits to children of Vietnam \n     veterans born with ``all forms and manifestations'' of spina \n     bifida except spina bifida occulta. Children with spina \n     bifida born of Vietnam veterans currently are eligible for \n     (1) a monthly allowance, varying by degree of disability of \n     the person with spina bifida, (2) health care for any \n     disability associated with that person's spina bifida, and \n     (3) vocational training, job placement, and post-job \n     placement services.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 162 of S. 1810 would extend (with a single \n     variation) to the children born with birth defects to women \n     Vietnam veterans the same benefits as those now afforded to \n     Vietnam veterans' children born with spina bifida under \n     chapter 18 of title 38, United States Code.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the compromise agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language. The former chapter 18 has been \n     redesignated as subchapter I, the compromise agreement from \n     section 401 of S. 1810 has been designated as subchapter II \n     of chapter 18 and certain general definitional and \n     administrative provisions applicable to both subchapters I \n     and II of chapter 18 have been placed in a new subchapter \n     III.\n       The definition of ``child'' in the Senate bill has been \n     moved to a general definitions section (new section 1821) \n     contained in subchapter III. A separate definition of \n     ``eligible child'' (for purposes of subchapter II) has been \n     provided in a new section 1811. The definition of ``female \n     Vietnam veteran'' contained in S. 1810 has been removed from \n     subchapter II and replaced by general definitions of Vietnam \n     veteran and Vietnam era in new section 1821.\n       S. 1810 would have excluded spina bifida from the \n     definition of a covered birth defect in subchapter II. Thus, \n     the Senate bill could have been interpreted so as to require \n     a child to choose to receive a monthly monetary allowance and \n     health care based only on spina bifida or based only on non-\n     spina bifida disabilities, but not both. Because the \n     Committees wish to include spina bifida with all other \n     covered disabilities for purposes of rating the disabilities \n     from which an eligible child may suffer, the prohibition in \n     proposed section 1812(b)(2) has been deleted from the \n     compromise bill. The compromise agreement is intended to \n     ensure that children of women Vietnam veterans who suffer \n     both from spina bifida and any other covered birth defect \n     will have all of their disabilities considered in determining \n     the appropriate disability rating and the amount of monetary \n     benefits to be paid under subchapter II of chapter 18. If the \n     only covered birth defect present is spina bifida, the \n     eligible child would be compensated under the spina bifida \n     provisions of subchapter I of chapter 18.\n       The requirement in S. 1810 that birth defects identified by \n     the Secretary be listed in regulations has been omitted. In \n     drafting this legislation, the Committees considered the \n     report of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health \n     Administration, Environmental Epidemiology Service, entitled \n     ``Women Vietnam Veterans Reproductive Outcomes Health Study'' \n     (October, 1998). Because this report identifies a wide \n     variety of birth defects identified in the children of women \n     Vietnam veterans, the Committees concluded that it was not \n     necessary to provide a rating for each separate defect. Thus, \n     the Committees intend that, in addition to whatever specific \n     defects the Secretary may identify, the Secretary may also \n     describe defects in generic terms, such as ``a congenital \n     muscular impairment resulting in the inability to stand or \n     walk without assistive devices.'' Language authorizing the \n     Secretary to take into account functional limitations when \n     formulating a schedule for rating disabilities under the new \n     subchapter was added to specifically allow for ratings based \n     upon generic descriptions of functional limitations imposed \n     by the disabilities.\n       The limitation contained in the Senate bill which barred \n     assistance under the new authority to an individual who \n     qualified for spina bifida benefits has been deleted to \n     assure that children who suffer from spina bifida and any \n     other covered defect may receive a monetary allowance under \n     subchapter II and health care which takes into account the \n     disabilities imposed by spina bifida and any other condition.\n\n\n               EXTENSION OF CERTAIN EXPIRING AUTHORITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       The following authorities expire on September 30, 2002: (1) \n     VA's authority to verify the eligibility of recipients of, or \n     applicants for, VA needs-based benefits and VA means-tested \n     medical care by gaining access to income records of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services/Social Security \n     Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, (2) the \n     reduction to $90 per month for VA pension and death pension \n     benefits to veterans or other beneficiaries without \n     dependents who are receiving Medicaid-covered nursing home \n     care, (3) the Secretary's authority to charge borrowers who \n     obtain VA-guaranteed, insured or direct home loans a ``home \n     loan'' fee, and (4) procedures applicable to liquidation \n     sales of defaulted home loans guaranteed by VA.

The audit would commence not earlier \n     than January 1, 2001, and would be completed not later than 1 \n     year after enactment of this provision. Its purpose would be \n     to provide a basis for future evaluations of the \n     effectiveness of the Service in meeting its mission. The \n     audit would review the requirements applicable to the Service \n     under law, evaluate the organizational structure of the \n     Service, and any other matters related to the Service that \n     the Comptroller General considers appropriate.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n          accelerated payments of basic educational assistance\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law does not provide for accelerated educational \n     assistance payments in VA-administered education programs.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 9 of S. 1402 would authorize VA to make accelerated \n     payments under the terms of regulations that VA would \n     promulgate to allow MGIB participants to receive a \n     semester's, a quarter's, or a term's worth of benefits at the \n     beginning of the semester, quarter, or term.

Any such election \n     shall be made at the time the individual initially enters \n     active duty. For servicemembers who elect to sign up for the \n     Montgomery GI Bill, section 3011(b) requires a pay reduction \n     of $100 per month for the first 12 months of active service.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 8 of S. 1402 would authorize servicemembers who had \n     ``opted out'' of MGIB participation (by electing not to \n     receive MGIB benefits and whose basic pay during the first 12 \n     months of service, therefore, had not been reduced by $100 \n     per month for 12 months) to regain eligibility for MGIB \n     benefits by making a $1,500 lump sum payment.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n codification of recurring provisions in annual department of veterans \n                      affairs appropriations acts\n\n     Current Law\n       Each year the Congress appropriates funds to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs as part of the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act (VA-HUD appropriations bill). \n     Although the amount of the appropriations varies from year to \n     year, the purposes for which appropriations are made are \n     generally fixed, and change little, if any, from year to \n     year. Because the style of appropriations language \n     discourages normal punctuation or sentence structure, some of \n     the ``sentences'' making appropriations exceed a page in \n     length.

The most recent information on the Boston \n     integration indicates that a new review--by the Capital \n     Assets Restructuring For Enhanced Services (CARES) contractor \n     for New England--will begin soon. The Committees expect VA to \n     complete the Boston integration plan in an expedited manner. \n     Further, the Committees expect the VA to submit a proposal, \n     or a major construction authorization request, to address \n     these infrastructure needs following completion of the CARES \n     validation of bed need in the area. The Committees support \n     this process and look forward to the results of the analysis \n     and any proposal VA consequently may make.\n\n\n          PILOT PROGRAM FOR COORDINATION OF HOSPITAL BENEFITS\n\n     Current Law\n       No provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 401 of H.R. 5109 would authorize a four-site VA \n     pilot program. Under the program, veterans with Medicare or \n     private health coverage (and a number of indigent veterans), \n     who rely on a VA community-based clinic, could voluntarily \n     choose nearby community hospital care for brief episodes of \n     medical-surgical inpatient care. The VA clinic would \n     coordinate care and cover required copayments.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n                  UNIFICATION OF MEDICATION COPAYMENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under Section 1710(a)(2)(G) of title 38, United States \n     Code, VA provides medical care, without imposing an \n     obligation to make copayments for such care, to veterans who \n     are ``unable to defray the expenses of necessary care. . . \n     .'' This is determined by comparing the veteran's annual \n     income against an income threshold that is adjusted annually. \n     A separate provision of law, section 1722A of title 38, \n     United States Code, mandates that VA charge a copayment for \n     each 30-day supply of prescription medications provided to a \n     veteran on an outpatient basis if that medication is for the \n     treatment of a nonservice-connected condition.\n       Two categories of veterans are exempt from the copayment \n     obligation: veterans who have service-connected disability \n     ratings of 50 percent or higher, and veterans whose annual \n     income does not exceed the maximum amount of ``means tested'' \n     VA pension that would be payable if such veterans were to \n     qualify for pension. Eligibility for pension is also \n     determined by calculating countable income against an income \n     threshold. This pension level is lower than the health care \n     eligibility income threshold. As a consequence, veterans who \n     are given priority access to VA health care and are exempted \n     from making copayments for that health care under one \n     measurement of their means are required to make copayments \n     for medications under a different measurement of their means.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 1810 would unify the copayment exemption \n     thresholds at the health care eligibility income threshold.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n\n    EXTENSION OF MAXIMUM TERM OF VA LEASES TO PROVIDERS OF HOMELESS \n                           VETERANS SERVICES\n\n     Current Law\n       VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program assists veterans by \n     facilitating their purchase, construction, and improvement of \n     homes. VA does so by encouraging private lenders to extend \n     favorable credit terms to veterans by guaranteeing repayment \n     of a portion of the lender-provided home loan.\n       In some circumstances, veterans default on mortgage loans \n     guaranteed by VA. In such cases, the lender will foreclose, \n     and VA, as a guarantor, may come into possession of the \n     property. Such properties, typically, are sold to the public \n     by VA. VA, however, has the option of leasing such properties \n     to public and nonprofit private providers of services to \n     homeless veterans so that such service-providers may offer \n     shelter and other services to homeless veterans and their \n     families. However, such leases to the providers of services \n     to homeless veterans may not exceed 3 years in term.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 311 of S. 1810 would extend the maximum term of VA \n     leases to providers of services to homeless veterans from 3 \n     to 20 years.\n     House Bill\n       The House bills contain no comparable provision.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to support this \ncomprehensive bill which would make changes to a wide range of \nveterans's benefits and services. The bill represents compromise on \nboth sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress, and many, many \nhours of staff and Members' work. For that, I thank everyone involved.\n  The bill covers a wide spectrum of issues--from new educational \nbenefits for service members to improvement in VA nurses' and dentists' \npay. I would like to address some of the major provisions.\n  Mr. President, S. 1402, as amended, represents a comprehensive effort \nto address the shortfall in the amount provided for veterans' \neducation. The current basic GI Bill benefit is $536 per month, which, \naccording to College Board data, pays for less than 60 percent of the \ncosts of a public four-year university. The cost of tuition and fees \nfor public and private educational institutions rose approximately 90 \npercent from 1980-1995, while the MGIB benefit rates only increased 42 \npercent from 1985 to 1995. S. 1402 will provide an increase for fiscal \nyear 2001 of 22 percent, raising the basic rate to $650 per month.\n  Additionally, this compromise bill adopts a Senate ``buy up'' \nprovision that will allow servicemembers to elect to contribute up to \nan additional $600 (above the $1,200 that they contribute over their \nfirst year of service), in exchange for receiving four times their \ncontribution. This additional contribution can be made at any time \nprior to the servicemember leaving service. Thus, it is targeted at \nthose who definitely plan to pursue additional education when they \nleave service.\n  Although these increases fall short of the full tuition recommended \nlast year by the Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition \nAssistance, they will nevertheless provide a substantial improvement in \nassistance to veterans. The basic monthly benefit increase to $650, \nwhen combined with the maximum ``buy up'' contribution, would yield a \nmonthly benefit of $800 per month, an increase of 49 percent over the \ncurrent benefit.\n  I believe that education is the key to success in today's high tech, \nfast-paced economy. We must ensure that our nation's veterans do not \nwind up on the wrong side of the ``digital divide.'' It should be our \npolicy to always encourage servicemembers and veterans to strive for \ngreater achievement. Aside from the benefits that accrue to the \nindividual veteran, we cannot overlook the benefits that accrue to our \nNation when we provide a substantial educational benefit to veterans, \nincluding increased tax dollars from better salaries, greater stability \nthrough higher levels of home ownership rates, and a stronger \nrecruiting tool for future servicemembers.\n  We also must remember our commitment to take care of the families of \nservicemembers killed on duty and families of veterans who are totally \ndisabled due to their service. S. 1402 provides a corresponding \nincrease in the monthly educational benefit, Dependents' Educational \nAssistance (DEA), provided to survivors and dependents of these \nveterans. Part of the reason that DEA is so low when compared to MGIB \nis that the MGIB rate has been indexed to the inflation rate, while the \nDEA has not. That is why it was so important to me that we index DEA, \nas section 111 of S. 1402 provides. This will ensure that the education \nbenefit to eligible dependents and survivors will keep pace with the \ncost of education and MGIB benefits.\n  Last year, we expanded VA's authority to provide education benefits \nto veterans by including payment for pre-admission exam preparatory \ncourses (SATs, GREs, etc). This year, through section 114, we are \nextending this valuable benefit to the eligible survivors and \ndependents of veterans through DEA. At some of the nation's top \nschools, scores on entrance exams can count for half of the total \napplication, creating enormous pressure to score well. Studies by \nnational consulting companies have shown improvement of over 100 points \non the SAT exam scores for students who take exam preparatory courses. \nHowever, many of\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\nthese exam preparatory course are quite costly. One national provider \ncharges as much as $750 for a two-month, part-time, SAT preparatory \ncourse. Fairtest, an educational advocacy group, argues that ``[t]he \nSAT has always favored students who can afford coaching over those who \ncannot. . . .'' To be able to compete, it is critical that veterans' \nsurvivors and dependents have access to such courses.\n  Last year, along with Senator Murray and Senator Daschle, I \nintroduced legislation that will provide much needed benefits to the \nchildren born with birth defects to female Vietnam veterans. I am \nenormously pleased that this legislation has been incorporated in S. \n1402.\n  Section 401 will provide health care and compensation to children \nborn with permanently disabling birth defects to women Vietnam \nveterans. The legislation had its inception in a comprehensive study \nthe VA conducted of long-term reproductive health outcomes of women \nVietnam-era veterans. After analyzing the records of over 4,000 women \nVietnam veterans compared with 4,000 women Vietnam-era veterans, the \nstudy found a ``statistically significant increase in birth defects,'' \nparticularly moderate to severe birth defects, in the children of the \nwomen Vietnam veterans. According to the study, the risk to a woman \nVietnam veteran of having a child with birth defects was significantly \nelevated, even after adjusting for age, demographic variables, military \ncharacteristics, and smoking and alcohol consumption of the mothers.\n\n  As VA does not have the authority under current law to provide health \ncare or their benefits to the children of women Vietnam veterans \ndisabled from birth defects other than spinal bifida, I worked with VA \nto craft legislation modeled after that groundbreaking spina bifida \nlegislation to address this issue.\n  It is only fitting that we assist these children. Their mothers \nserved our Nation with honor and courage, volunteering to be placed in \nharm's way, without knowledge of what effects their service may bring \nlater. They were the nurses, mapmakers, air traffic controllers, \nclerical staff, Red Cross and USO workers, and others who supported our \ntroops in the field. Unfortunately, some of their children have \nsuffered because of their mothers' service, and it is time for them to \nbegin to be repaid for that suffering.\n  Under the provisions of S. 1402, VA would be authorized to provide \nreimbursement for health care of the disabled children for their birth \ndefect and associated conditions, vocational rehabilitation services, \nand a monthly allowance that is not countable as income for the purpose \nof other federal programs.\n  Women Vietnam veterans have waited 25 years for this acknowledgment \nof the special risks they faced. Helping their children born with birth \ndefects is the logical extension of our policy to provide benefits for \ndisabilities that result from service. It's the compassionate and the \nright thing to do, and I am enormously gratified that we are finally \ndoing it.\n  S. 1402 contains a number of benefits provisions that will aid \nveterans.\n  Section 301 extends compensation to be paid to reservists on inactive \nduty for training who were disabled or died from heart attack or stroke \nduring training or travel to/from training. Currently, guards members \nand reservists who sustain an injury during inactive duty for training \nare eligible for veterans benefits. However, they are not eligible to \nreceive compensation for diseases incurred or aggravated during such \ntraining, while active duty servicemembers would be eligible for the \nsame condition. This provision recognizes the special nature of strokes \nand heart attacks and how they may be triggered by the additional \nphysical stress during inactive duty for training, and ensures that \nthese servicemembers and their families will be taken care of.\n  Section 302 will provide special monthly compensation to female \nveterans who have lost a breast due to service-connected conditions. \nSpecial monthly compensation is an additional monthly monetary benefit \nprovided above regular compensation for loss, or loss of use of a part \nof a veterans' body, that yields an additional disability that another \nloss would not, such as loss of sight or hearing, loss of use of the \nveterans' legs, or loss of a creative organ. The loss of a breast to a \nwoman veteran is consistent with the other disabilities where special \nmonthly compensation is provided.\n  I am very pleased that S. 1402 closes the final chapter on a 55-year-\nold injustice--the cause of Filipino veterans who fought under U.S. \nCommand during World War II. When the decision to extend benefits to \nthis group was initially made, the law authorized payments to Filipino \nveterans at the rate of 50 cents on the dollar of the amounts that \nAmerican veterans receive. It is my understanding that the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill will contain a provision that will provide full \ncompensation benefits and extend health care to these Filipino \nveterans. Section 332 of S. 1402 will extend full burial benefits to \nthe dependents of Filipino veterans, while section 331 will provide \nthat Filipino veterans who are American citizens and in the U.S. at the \ntime of their death can be buried in National Cemeteries. This is a \nlong overdue correction of an old injustice.\n  I am enormously proud of the fact that S. 1402 includes a small \nprovision that I introduced which removes the limit on adaptive housing \ngrants to disabled veterans who own their home with someone other than \na spouse.\n  I became aware that there was a problem with the adaptive housing \nregulations when I was contacted by the family of Darren Frederick, a \nWest Virginia Gulf War veteran who lost his ability to walk when he \ndeveloped ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Darren owned a house \nwith his brother and applied for a grant from VA to adapt his home for \nhis wheelchair. But because he owned the house with someone other than \na spouse, VA regulations required that the grant be reduced by half. \nStill, this young, disabled veteran needed a whole ramp, not half a \nramp, into his home.\n  The regulation VA was applying was written in 1947 to protect \nveterans from unscrupulous people who might take advantage of them. \nHowever, I am certain that this provision has hurt far more people than \nit has helped. That is why I pushed to eliminate it, and am pleased to \nsay that it is no longer going to be the law. Unfortunately, I am sad \nto say that this change came too late to help young Darren Frederick. \nDarren passed away while he was still dealing with the red tape caused \nby this provision.\n  I am very disappointed that last year we were unable to move the \nSenate provision overturning the ``$1,500 rule.'' Since 1933, the law \nhas required VA to suspend the compensation or pension benefits of \nincompetent veterans who have no dependents and are hospitalized at \ngovernment expense. This suspension is triggered when the veteran's \nestate (basically, his bank account) exceeds $1,500, and continues \nuntil the estate is spent down to $500. At that time, VA reinstates the \nveteran's compensation until the veteran is hospitalized again and the \nestate exceeds $1,500, when the benefits are cut off again. No similar \nsuspension is made for competent veterans or for incompetent veterans \nwho are not hospitalized or who have dependents.\n  The rationale for cutting off benefits was that these veterans might \nhave been institutionalized for years, and that it was not good policy \nto allow their estates to build up when they have no dependents to \ninherit them. There was also a fear of fraud on the part of the \nveteran's guardian or fiduciary.\n  Today, veterans are generally being hospitalized for shorter periods \nof time, but even so, the rule often applies quickly because of the \noutdated low dollar limit. It takes VA an average of 66 days to restore \nthe benefits to incompetent veterans once their estates have been spent \ndown. The result is that a veteran may have been released from the \nhospital for quite some time before the benefit is restored, creating \ngreat hardships in paying for the expenses of daily living.\n  The dollar amounts of the limit have not changed since 1933, when \n$1,500 equaled almost three years' worth of VA benefits at a 100 \npercent rating level. In today's dollars, this is less than one month's \nbenefit at a 100 percent rating level. Although I truly believe that \nthis is an outdated and indefensible policy that discriminates against \nincompetent veterans--veterans who are least likely to be able to\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\nfight for themselves--we remain unable to fully eliminate the \nrestriction, as I wish we could. However, we are doing the next best \nthing--raising the limits to a more realistic dollar amount and \nindexing it to account for future increases in compensation. Section \n304 provides that the $1,500 will be replaced with the dollar value \nrepresented by five times the 100-percent service-connected \ncompensation rate, and that amount will be indexed to include future \ncost-of-living adjustments. If we can't eliminate this type of \ndiscrimination, I am gratified that we could at least reduce its \napplication and impact.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes authorization \nfor the construction of a $9.5 million nursing home in Beckley, West \nVirginia. With the World War II and Korean War veteran population \naging, there is a increased demand for an alternative to private long-\nterm care, which is often costly and beyond the reach of many veterans \nand their families. I fought so hard for this federally funded facility \nbecause it will be available to all veterans in need of care, \nregardless of income. It will also contain a 20-bed Alzheimer's unit, \nto meet the special needs of those suffering from this horrible \ndisease. Long-term care for Alzheimer's patients is very limited in \nsouthern West Virginia, and the Beckley VA Medical Center must often \nsend veterans outside the state for this specialized care. Quality \nlong-term care for West Virginia veterans is long overdue.\n  Currently, the Senate is deliberating on a bill that would \nappropriate $1 million in design funds for this project. I am hopeful \nthat we will get the full amount needed for completion of the facility \nin the near future.\n  I am very proud of the nurses' pay provision in section 201 of S. \n1402, which finally gives a very valued segment of VA's health care \nstaff their due. Since the inception of the locality pay system in \n1990, which determined the rate of pay for nurses according to trends \nin local health care labor markets, only some nurses in the VA system \nnationwide have actually seen pay increases. This was an unjust \nconsequence of implementing the locality pay system that I am very glad \nwe can now rectify.\n  This bill prohibits directors from reducing nurses' pay, and \nguarantees VA nurses a national comparability increase equivalent to \nthat provided to other federal employees. Additionally, it reforms the \nlocal labor market survey process currently used to determine wages. \nFinally, I am pleased that this provision also requires Veterans Health \nAdministration network directors to consult directly with nurses on \npolicy issues that involve the work of VA nurses, and allows registered \nnurses to participate on medical center committees considering clinical \ncare, budget matters, or resource allocation involving the care and \ntreatment of veteran patients.\n  Section 202, the dentists' pay provision of S. 1402, is one that I am \nvery satisfied with as it seeks to improve the recruitment and \nretention of dentists within the VA, and, therefore, the level of \ndental care our veterans receive as well. The basic pay rates of \ndentists employed in the VHA are supplemented by special pay and \nincentive pay scales that were originally enacted with the intent of \nhelping recruitment and retention rates. However, they were not \nsufficient enough to keep this vital sector of veterans' care secured. \nThis bill will build on what was already started nearly 10 years ago by \nfinally revising and increasing the rates of special pay for VA \ndentists.\n  Another important provision in this legislation that I am very proud \nof is the creation of a physician assistant advisory position within \nthe Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This position will finally \ngive voice to a very essential segment of the VA health care system.\n  Current law requires that the office of Under Secretary for Health in \nthe VA include representatives of a variety of health care professions. \nHowever, despite the fact that the VA is the nation's largest single \nemployer of physician assistants, physician assistants have not had any \nrepresentation within this office.\n  That is why I am pleased to be able to provide these often underrated \nhealth care workers with their own representative advisor. The VA Under \nSecretary for Health will designate a VHA physician assistant to fill \nthis position and charge that person with advising on all matters \nregarding the employment and use of physician assistants within the \nVeterans Health Administration. The advisor may be assigned out in the \nfield with periodical visits as necessary to VHA headquarters for \nreports, so that they are able to keep in touch both with physician \nassistants working all over the country and the VA Under Secretary for \nHealth in VA Headquarters. The language associated with this section \nspecifically calls upon VA to provide this individual with the \nnecessary support and resources to enable this consultant to fulfill \nthe assigned responsibilities of this position.\n  Just over 15 years ago, the VA conducted a large-scale survey on the \noccurrence of PTSD and other psychological problems in Vietnam \nveterans. The study found that 15 percent of male veterans and 8.5 \npercent of female veterans suffered from PTSD. However, among those \nveterans exposed to higher levels of war zone stress, PTSD rates were \nsignificantly higher. In addition, the study found that nearly one-\nthird of both male and female Vietnam veterans had suffered from PTSD \nat some point following military service.\n  Therefore, I am very gratified that this bill provides for a followup \nstudy to be conducted to monitor the effectivness of the PTSD programs \nand other psychiatric services the VA has provided over the years to \nhelp veterans cope with the symptoms of this debilitating disorder. The \nstudy is to be conducted by an independent contractor, but the VA is \nbeing encouraged to design the study protocol itself in order to secure \nhigh quality responses to the survey.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to acknowledge the work of our \nCommittee's Chairman, Senator Specter, in developing this comprehensive \nlegislation. Through his efforts, and that of his staff--Bill Turek, \nStaff Director; Chris Yoder, Assistant Staff Director; and Legislative \nAssistants Jon Tower and William Cahill, we are moving this significant \npiece of legislation today.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, especially Chairman Bob Stump and Ranking Member Lane Evans, \nto work together to reach compromise on so many vital issues.\n  And I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the efforts of my own \nstaff: Jim Gottlieb, Minority Staff Director; Kim Lipsky, Professional \nStaff Member; and Mary Schoelen, Counsel. I am enormously grateful for \ntheir diligence, and for their commitment to the work we do in this \nCommittee on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
