This morning the Senate will resume consideration of S.J. \nRes. 20, with a brief statement by Senator McCain. Following Senator \nMcCain, the majority leader will be recognized to make a motion to \ntable S.J. Res. 20. Before I speak, however, and make that motion, I \nbelieve Senator Daschle will use leader time to make some remarks, too. \nSo Senator McCain will speak, Senator Daschle, and I will speak and \nmake a motion to table S.J.

Res. 20 is tabled, the Senate will immediately begin debate \non S. 900, the financial services modernization bill, under the \nprovisions agreed to last night by unanimous consent. It is hoped that \nsignificant progress will be made on the banking bill, and therefore \nSenators can expect further rollcall votes today.\n  We do have one complicating factor. We have also had another natural \ndisaster to strike our country, this time in Oklahoma. The Senators \nfrom Oklahoma feel the necessity, understandably, to go to Oklahoma, \nand we will have to take that into consideration in how we schedule \nvotes. I will consult with the Democratic leader about that timing.\n  The Senate will be in recess for the weekly party caucus luncheons \nfrom 12:30 to 2:15. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Res. 20\n\n       Whereas the United States and its allies in the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization are conducting large-scale \n     military operations against the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); and\n       Whereas the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) has refused to comply with NATO demands that it \n     withdraw its military, paramilitary and security forces from \n     the province of Kosovo, allow the return of ethnic Albanian \n     refugees to their homes, and permit the establishment of a \n     NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,  That the \n     President is authorized to use all necessary force and other \n     means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish \n     United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Lott and Daschle for \nallowing the Senate more time for this debate than was their original \nintention. I think it has been a good debate. It was not as long as I \nwould have liked but better than I had expected yesterday morning. Many \nMembers on both sides, or should I say on all the multiple sides of the \nquestion, have had the opportunity to express themselves\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nand most have done so with distinction. I also thank the cosponsors of \nthe resolution for having the courage of their convictions, Senators \nHagel, Biden, Lugar, Kerry, Dodd, Robb, and all the other cosponsors. \nYou have made the case for the resolution far more persuasively than \nhave I, and I commend you for fighting this good fight.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to speak plainly in the few minutes \nremaining to me. What I say now may offend some people, even some of my \nfriends who support this resolution. I am sorry for that, but I say it \nbecause I believe it is the truth, the important truth, and it should \nbe said.\n  The President of the United States is prepared to lose a war rather \nthan do the hard work, the politically risky work, of fighting as the \nleader of the greatest nation on Earth should fight when our interests \nand our values are imperiled.\n  We all know why in a few minutes this resolution is going to lose. It \nis going to lose because the President and members of his Cabinet have \njoined with the opponents to the war and lobbied hard for the \nresolution's defeat. Do not believe administration officials when they \ntell you that the resolution would have been defeated even without \ntheir active opposition. Had they worked half as hard in support of it \nas they did to defeat it, the result would have been different today.\n  No, it is not that they could not win; it is because they did not \nwant to win that we are facing defeat this morning. That is a shame, a \nreal shame.\n  I have said repeatedly that the President does not need this \nresolution to use all the force he deems necessary to achieve victory \nin Kosovo. I stand by that contention. And I have the good company of \nthe Constitution behind me.\n\n  I had wanted this resolution considered in the now forlorn hope that \nthe President would take courage from it and find the resolve to do his \nduty, his duty by us, the American people, by the alliance he leads, \nand by the suffering people of Kosovo who now look to America and NATO \nfor their very lives.\n  I was wrong, and I must accept the blame for that. The President does \nnot want the power he possesses by law because the risks inherent in \nits exercise have paralyzed him.\n  Let me identify for my colleagues the price paid by Kosovars for the \nPresident's repeated and indefensible ruling out of ground troops. Mr. \nMilosevic was so certain of the limits to our commitment that he felt \nsafe enough to widely disperse his forces. Instead of massing his \nforces to meet a possible ground attack, he has deployed them in small \nunits to reach more towns and villages in less time than if the \nPresident had remained silent on the question of ground troops. In \nother words, he has been able to displace, rape, and murder more \nKosovars more quickly than he could have if he feared he might face the \nmightiest army on Earth. That is a fact of this war that is undeniable. \nAnd shame on the President for creating it.\n  Now what is left to us, as our war on the cheap fails to achieve the \nobjectives for which we went to war? Well, bombing pauses seem to be an \nidea in vogue. They were popular once before in another war. And I \npersonally witnessed how effective they were. No, Mr. President, I do \nnot have much regard for the diplomatic or military efficacy of bombing \npauses. As a matter of fact, it was only when bombing pauses were \nfinally abandoned in favor of sustained strategic bombing that almost \n600 of my comrades and I received our freedom. I daresay some of the \nyears that we had lost were attributable to bombing pauses. I will not \nsupport a bombing pause until Milosevic surrenders and not a moment \nbefore.\n  My father gave the order to send B-52s--planes that did not have the \nprecision-guided munitions that so impress us all today--he gave the \norder to send them to bomb the city where his oldest son was held a \nprisoner of war. That is a pretty hard thing for a father to do, Mr. \nPresident, but he did it because it was his duty, and he would not \nshrink from it. He did it because he didn't believe America should lose \na war, or settle for a draw or some lesser goal than it had sacrificed \nits young to achieve. He knew that leaders were expected to make hard \nchoices in war. Would that the President had half that regard for the \nresponsibilities of his office.\n  Give peace a chance. Yes, peace is a wonderful condition. Sweeter \nthan many here will ever fully appreciate. The Kosovars appreciate it. \nThey are living in its absence, and it is a horrible experience. But \nthe absence of freedom is worse. They know that too. They know it well. \nAnd if the price of peace is that we abandon them to the cruelty of \ntheir oppressors, then the price is too high.\n  Some have suggested that we can drop our demand that NATO keep the \npeace in Kosovo. Let the U.N. command any future peacekeeping force \ninstead. But a U.N. peacekeeping force led directly to the Srebrinica \nmassacre in Bosnia. I think the Kosovars would rather they not have \nthat kind of peace, Mr. President. And we should not impose it on them.\n  Give peace a chance. If we cannot keep our word to prevail over this \ninferior power that threatens our interests and our most cherished \nideals, then it is unlikely that we will long know a real peace. We may \nenjoy a false peace for a brief time, but that will pass. Whatever your \nviews about whether we were right or wrong to get involved in this war, \nwhy would you think that losing will recover what we have risked in the \nBalkans. If we fail to win this war, our allies and our enemies will \nlose their respect for our resolve and our power. You may count on it, \nMr. President. And we will soon face far greater threats than we face \ntoday. We will know a much more dangerous absence of peace than we are \nexperiencing today.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, in this late hour, to put aside \nour reservations, our past animosities, and encourage, implore, cajole, \nbeg, shame this administration into doing its duty. Shame on the \nPresident if he persists in abdicating his responsibilities. But shame \non us if we let him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leadership time to conclude \nthis debate with a few comments of my own.\n  Let me begin by commending the authors of this resolution, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Biden, and others. I support their intent, and I \nappreciate the effort of all the authors in making this resolution the \nfocus of our attention this morning.\n  There ought to be three rules this country should always adhere to in \nan addressing an international conflict. The first rule is that every \neffort should be made to resolve the matter diplomatically. I believe \nthis is being done in the case of the conflict in Kosovo. In this \nstruggle, there is no end to the lengths the United States and NATO \nhave gone in an effort to resolve this matter diplomatically. As we \nspeak, diplomatic efforts are underway. There will continue to be \nnegotiations, discussions, and communications to resolve this matter \ndiplomatically. Up to now all these efforts have failed.\n  Secondly, should diplomacy fail and U.S. forces be needed, we must \nnot tie the hands of the Commander-in-Chief. We must provide whatever \nsupport is requested. That is what this resolution says: that the \nPresident is authorized to use all necessary force. I understand and \nsupport that concept.\n  Thirdly, we must support our troops when they come home--something we \nhaven't always done. We didn't in Vietnam when they were suffering from \nthe effects of exposure to Agent Orange; we didn't in the Persian Gulf \nwhen they were hit by Persian Gulf Syndrome. We have not always \nsupported our troops when they come home. Veterans and the Veterans' \nAdministration oftentimes are neglected in times of peace.\n  There is a caveat, an obvious caveat, to these three rules. When \ndeploying force, there must be a clear indication of need. Only in the \nrarest of circumstances when it comes to executing a war, a military \neffort, should the Congress get ahead of the Commander in Chief and his \nmilitary advisers. That is especially true when the United States is \ninvolved, as it is today in Yugoslavia, with other nations. They are \nthe ones--the military, the Commander in Chief--who must decide\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nwhat kind of forces are to be used, what kind of war is to be waged, \nwhat facts must be considered in waging it successfully.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona made some comments about the \nPresident's unwillingness to use ground troops. It isn't just the \nPresident. It is all of his Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is everybody in \nthe Pentagon who advises the President who has said, This is not the \ntime; we do not want to commit ground troops at this point, Mr. \nPresident; don't request them. And he has not.\n  It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I reluctantly join in \ntabling this resolution today. I do so for three reasons. First, as I \nhave just noted, the President has not asked for this authority, nor \nhave his military advisers. They have indicated they don't support the \ninclusion of ground troops at this time. Why? Because the air campaign \nis working. That is not what some of the media want you to hear, but it \nis the case that the air campaign is working. The resolve on the part \nof Yugoslavia is being tested. And, I must say, there is increasing \nevidence that their resolve is weakening. There is increasing evidence \nthat, regardless of what criteria one uses to evaluate the success of \nthe air campaign, it is working.\n  Until we have given every opportunity for the air campaign to work, \nmoving to a new strategy is premature. The time involved, the logistics \ninvolved, the questions involved in moving forces into Yugoslavia all \nhave to be considered, but not now. This is not the time. Will there \ncome a time? Perhaps. But it is not now. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \nunanimously endorse that position--not now. What is the Commander in \nChief supposed to do? He listens to his military advisers and they say, \n``Not now.'' He listens to his national security people and they say, \n``Not now.''\n\n  This isn't a matter of courage, this isn't a matter of a lack of \nresolve on the part of the President. Instead, it is a matter of the \nPresident working with all the people in this administration to pick \nthe best course of action. I believe he has done so.\n  Secondly, we must keep one thing in mind about this effort. This is \nnot unilateral. We are involved with 18 other nations, most of whom \noppose changing NATO's current air campaign strategy. If all necessary \nforce implies using ground troops, they oppose taking a different \ncourse of action. This is a test for NATO. We should all recognize \nthat. If we truly want NATO to succeed, we have no choice, no choice \nbut to make all decisions involving strategy in concert with our NATO \nallies.\n  For Members today to say we are going to assert that our position \ncalls for a change in strategy, that the air war alone is not working, \nsends a clear message to all the other NATO countries that we are the \nones in charge, we are the only ones making this decision; we don't \ncare what you think, we are not going to resolve this matter in concert \nwith you; it is going to be us; we will call the shots.\n  We are not prepared to do that today, Mr. President.\n  Thirdly, because this authority has not been requested either by the \nPresident or his military advisers or by NATO, we have no clear idea \nwhat it is we are authorizing with this resolution. Because the \nPresident hasn't made a specific proposal, are we voting to use \ntactical nuclear weapons? Are we committing 500,000 troops for 5 years? \nAre we committing ourselves to an invasion of neighboring countries, \nshould that be necessary? The answer to these questions, of course, is \nno. They are extreme options which no one would dare suggest. But what \nare we authorizing with this resolution? Without a specific proposal \nfrom the President, we can only guess. By guessing, we do a disservice \nto our mission. By guessing, we relegate too much discretion to others.\n  Mr. President, an up-or-down vote on this resolution is premature. \nThere may be a time when it will be required. That time must be \ndetermined by the Commander in Chief and our NATO allies. If or when \nthat time comes, it is the responsibility of the Congress to do what we \nmust do and what we have done on many occasions in the past: We must \ndebate it and we must vote on a resolution of approval. Until then, the \nSenate has spoken on this conflict. On a bipartisan vote, we have given \nour approval to the air campaign. We have no need to do so again.\n  So I ask my colleagues, let us be patient. Let us support our \nmilitary as they fight so valiantly and successfully in the air \nmission. Let us send a clear message to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and \nto NATO: We will not terminate the air war until we are successful.\n  I might note another bit of evidence of our success occurred just \nthis morning. There are reports that a NATO F-16 fighter jet shot down \na Serb Mig29. The air war is working. We will keep the pressure on. We \nwill not look the other way when victims of ethnic cleansing look to \nus.\n  A vote on this motion to table this resolution is a vote to postpone \nthe decision to alter our military course in Yugoslavia. It is a vote \nto support our military in their efforts to bring peace to this region. \nI urge our colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, there are few people in the United States \nCongress who are as familiar with war as is the sponsor of this joint \nresolution, my esteemed colleague from Arizona, Senator John McCain. I \nagree with the principles behind his resolution; that this Nation \nshould not fight wars to a stalemate, it should fight them to win or \nnot fight them at all.\n  Mr. President, for the past 6 weeks, American military forces have \nbeen participating in a NATO-led aerial campaign in the Balkans. In \nMarch, I voted to support the use of air power in this operation. It \nwas my view then that the administration had already committed our \nforces to action. A vote against the President, when bombing was \nimminent, would have undercut our troops at the front. However, that is \nnot the case with the resolution before us today. As a nation we have a \nchoice to make. The choice should be an informed one. Our intentions in \nthis operation have been noble and just. However, the boundaries of \nthis conflict are not apparent to many in this body nor it seems to a \nmajority of the American people. Before we give a blank check to the \nadministration, I believe that the President should clearly articulate \nto both Congress and the American people the objectives and the \nnational interest which require a resolution authorizing full scale \nwar. To date he has not done so.\n  As have many of my colleagues, I have traveled to the region. I have \nbeen briefed by General Clark, spoken to troops in the field and \nvisited refugee camps in Albania. There is no question that our \nmilitary personnel are the best in the world and are doing an \noutstanding job under extremely difficult circumstances. However, I \nhave grave concerns over NATO's ability to salvage the humanitarian \nsituation through aerial bombardment and its policy of war by \ncommittee. I know that Senator McCain shares this latter concern. The \nUnited States led a coalition force during the Persian Gulf war. Yet in \nthat war it was our military leaders and not politicians in Brussels \nwho called the shots. Mr. President, we won the Persian Gulf war; we \nare not winning this war. My fear is that if we adopt this resolution \nnow, it will be viewed as tacit approval of an overly bureaucratic and \nineffective NATO command structure. The Senate can pass this resolution \nand authorize the President's ``. . . use of all necessary force and \nother means . . .'' but I fear the effect will be mitigated by the \ncurrent command structure. It is a prerequisite that prior to any \nescalation of our involvement in this conflict, that NATO streamline \nits command structure and put professional soldiers back in charge.\n\n  A greater concern to me is the effect that this operation is having \non the readiness of our military forces worldwide. Can we adequately \ndefend South Korea, Taiwan, and Kuwait while waging a full scale war \nagainst Serbia? Some of the facts are alarming. We have no carrier \nbattle group in the Western Pacific. The Air Force has committed one-\nthird of its combat aircraft to the Balkans. The President has \nauthorized the activation of over 33,000 reservists, including many Air \nNational Guard tanker pilots from Birmingham, Alabama. The United \nStates is still involved in an undeclared shooting war with Iraq. Last \nweek, the administration informed the Appropriations Committee that the \nNation's stated ability to simultaneously fight\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nand win two major regional conflicts is tenuous at best. And finally, \nour intelligence resources are being stretched thin due to this crisis. \nIn short, we are pushing the envelope of our military capabilities. It \nbegs the question: Is there a vital national interest in the Balkans \nwhich necessitates a commitment of the bulk of our limited military \nassets and endangers longstanding strategic interests? I don't have the \nanswer to that question. The answer must come from the President. He \nmust make his case for war to the Congress and American people prior to \nthe passage of any resolution authorizing full scale war. I urge him to \ndo so. It is his duty as the Commander in Chief. The stakes are very \nhigh.\n  I close with a reaffirmation of my support for our military forces \nthroughout the world, especially those personnel fighting in the \nBalkans. Like their predecessors throughout history, the Americans who \ntoday go in harm's way wearing the uniform of their country lead a \nnoble pursuit. Their service is not just another job as some would have \nus believe. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I pledge my \ncontinued support to those soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and \nCoast Guardsmen who are in the field as I speak today.\n  This resolution authorizes the President to, ``. . . use all \nnecessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies, \nto accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nobjectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' I have no doubt \nthat Senator McCain knows what it takes to succeed in a military \ncampaign. I am confident that our military leaders know what it takes \nto succeed in a military campaign. However, as of today, this \nadministration has demonstrated neither the vital necessity for, nor \nthe capacity to successfully prosecute, a full scale war in the \nBalkans. I urge the Commander in Chief to execute the duties of his \noffice and make that case before Congress and the American people. \nUntil he does so, I cannot in good conscience vote to support Joint \nResolution 20.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Winston Churchill observed that the \n``Balkans have produced more history than we can absorb locally.'' With \nthat in mind, let's realize certain history necessary to judgment.\n  This was a civil war in a sovereign country. Last Spring it was \nescalating. The shooting of a Serb policeman on the corner and the \nresulting burning of Albanian homes on the block had mushroomed to \nthree thousand KLA fighting for independence versus ten thousand \nSerbian troops massing on the Kosovo border. By Fall it had grown to \nten thousand KLA versus forty thousand Serbs.\n  In walks Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Rambouillet, \nannouncing to Milosevic and the Kosovars that killing would have to \nstop; that there be a cooling off period for three years, then one man \none vote. The intent was noble--to defend human rights. The dreadful \nmassacre at the hands of the Serbs was met with equally savage conduct \nby the Albanians. The agreement instrument was intentionally vague to \nbe interpreted by the Kosovars as a vote for independence. The \nimportant thing to remember is that Serbia-Montenegro is a sovereign \ncountry. Milosevic was selected as its head by its Parliament. In this \ncivil war there was no good side. Today in total war there is no good \nside.\n  Another important point is that the proposed agreement was a non-\nstarter--Milosevic could not agree any more to relinquishing Kosovo \nthan Lincoln could the South--a so called free election in three years \nwas a given in an area ninety percent Albanian and ten percent Serb.\n  According to the Carter Center in Atlanta there are twenty-two wars \nthe world around--all civil. And over half more violent than Kosovo. \nThe United States is a world power. To continue as a world power with \nsufficient credibility to extend our influence for freedom and \nindividual rights we cannot venture into every human rights conflict. \nThe American people will not support it--as evidenced by the vote in \nthe Congress. And living in the real world we need to husband our \nintegrity for the world concerns of Russia and its missiles, North \nKorea, peace in the Middle East and the like.\n  There is no national security threat to the United States in Kosovo. \nWe have yet to have a national debate to determine that GIs are to be \nsacrificed for human rights.\n  The demand that Milosevic agree or be bombed into agreement was \ndiplomacy at its worst. The Congress, the country and most of all the \nmilitary were totally unprepared to pursue this threat. More \nimportantly, as I learned in the artillery no matter how good the aim \nif the recoil is going to kill the gun crew, don't fire!\n  The following is the recoil: (A) A civil war has turned into one of \nnational defense for Milosevic. When the U.S. went to national defense \nupon the attack on Pearl Harbor, the first order of business was to \nclear the west coast of all who were thought to be the enemy or \nsympathetic to the enemy. Over 110,000 Nisei, sixty-four percent of \nwhom were U.S. citizens, were forced from their homes into internment \ncamps. When NATO attacked, Milosevic's ethnic cleansing became enemy \ncleansing; 700,000 in three weeks. Milosevic never would have attempted \nthis on his own save the NATO attack on his country. We have made \nMilosevic popular in his country.\n  (B) Unprepared to pursue a ground war, NATO has strengthened \nMilosevic's military control of Kosovo.\n  (C) In contrast, the KLA assumes NATO has taken its side in the civil \nwar and now will want revenge no matter what happens. We have ignited \nfurther the historic flames of enmity.\n  (D) With no national security interest at stake, the overwhelming air \ninvasion of the U.S. into a small European country appears arrogant and \nthreatening to much of Europe. Russia, no longer a strategic threat in \nEurope, is now being revitalized into a strategic threat.\n  (E) A country half the size of South Carolina with half the \npopulation is being hit with forty bombardments a day. Like Viet Nam, \nwe are destroying it in order to save it.\n  It appears to me the recoil is killing the gun crew. Once again we \nare told that bombing will soon cause the people of Serbia-Montenegro \nto arise and throw the rascals out. In 1944 while preparing to cross \nthe Rhine I heard this about Hitler; then in Viet Nam about Ho Chi Min; \nthen for the past seven years about Saddam. When will the State \nDepartment learn? When will we all learn that there is no ``win'' in \nKosovo? At the moment we are not only losing the war, we are losing our \nintegrity as a world power. This mistake must be brought to a close. \nWhile under orders, we all support our troops. But this is not the \nissue before us. Unfortunately, the policy in Kosovo is a split \ndecision between the House and the Senate. We still debate to determine \nthat policy. This is sad, but it's the reality. Under no circumstance \nshould we sacrifice a single GI for this mistake and indecision.\n  I shall vote to table.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to \ntable the resolution authorizing the President to use whatever force \nand means necessary to carry the military campaign against Yugoslavia \nto a successful conclusion. As written, this resolution would provide \nthe President with blanket authority to wage this war, including the \nright to deploy ground troops in the Balkans. There are too many \nunanswered, if not ignored questions about this war. If the Senate were \nto give the President this blanket authorization, we would abrogate our \nresponsibility to our troops and to the American people to get real \nanswers to these questions.\n  First of all, what would constitute a ``successful conclusion'' to \nthis war? Would it be the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic and his \ngovernment? Perhaps the removal of all Serbian troops from Kosovo and \nthe subsequent return of all refugees to their homeland? Or would a \nsuccessful conclusion to the war simply be forcing Milosevic to agree \nto the terms of the peace agreement which failed at Rambouillet? I, for \none, do not feel this question has been sufficiently addressed, and I \nhave a hunch that most, if not all of my colleagues would agree with \nthis assessment.\n  Mr. President, even if we can agree to what would constitute a \n``successful conclusion'' to the war, what else are we agreeing to? \nSurely the use of ground troops. But how many are we talking? 50,000? \n100,000? 200,000? more? We have already committed our pilots to the \nconflict. But as to ground\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\ntroops--I think this is an issue which mandates a separate Senate \ndebate specifically on this issue. We owe it to the American people, \nand we surely owe this to the troops whose lives lay in the balance of \nthis decision.\n  What about the costs of this operation? I do not think we have a clue \nwhat this will cost--in lives or in dollars. We know that the President \nhas requested somewhere in the realm of $6 billion, but the actual \nfloor debate hasn't even begun and the figure is already fluctuating \nbetween $8 and 13 billion.\n  There is another matter about this resolution, and about this war, \nwhich troubles me greatly. When the military completed its Quadrennial \nDefense Review (QDR), we were assured that our readiness state would \nallow us to successfully respond to two full scale wars at the same \ntime. This would mean that although we are engaged in the air, and \nperhaps on the ground, in Kosovo, we would be ready to fight a full \nscale operation at the same time in another theater--the Korean \nPeninsula and Iraq come to mind as real possibilities.\n  Prior to the Kosovo operation, the Department of Defense assessed the \nrisks associated with responding to a second major theater war as \n``high.'' But now, because of our large commitment in the Balkans, and \nthe fact that we are running dangerously low on cruise missiles and \nother munitions, our same military planners have changed this \nassessment to ``very high.'' If I understand this correctly, and I \nthink I do, some of our own military strategists are concerned that our \nreadiness is insufficient at this time to take on Milosevic and Saddam \nHussein (Iraq) or Kim Jung-il (North Korea) at the same time.\n  Given this Administration's track record in dealing with Iraq and \nNorth Korea, I think we have a real problem on our hands. This is a \ncatastrophe of virtually untellable proportions waiting to happen.\n  President Clinton has not asked the Congress for this blanket \nauthorization on this war--and he continues to oppose the use of ground \ntroops. While I strongly believe that it would be wrong for him to \ndeploy ground troops absent clear Congressional authorization, I also \ndo not believe that we should grant him this authority before he makes \nthe request and the case for this authority.\n  On a final note, I want to congratulate Reverend Jesse Jackson for \nhis efforts this past weekend, and convey my deep relief and pleasure \nthat the three American soldiers were released and are now reunited \nwith their families.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to table, and urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to state my strong opposition \nto the McCain-Biden resolution currently pending before the Senate. I \nintend to vote to table this resolution.\n  I continue to have concerns about both the failure of diplomacy that \nled to the use of force in Kosovo and the current military strategy \nbeing employed. But now that U.S. Armed Forces are engaged, we should \nsend a strong message of unity and determination to see the mission \nthrough. President Milosevic should know both the U.S. Senate and the \nAmerican people remain committed to achieving our objectives.\n  I will vote to table S.J. Res. 20 for three reasons. First, the \nlanguage contained in the resolution is too broad. I respect what \nSenators McCain and Biden are trying to accomplish with this \nresolution; they are trying to increase the chance of success of our \nmilitary operation. However, I do not support giving the President of \nthe United States the authority to ``use all necessary force'' to \naccomplish our goals in Kosovo. I find it disturbing that the United \nStates Senate is considering a resolution that would give the President \nmore authority to exercise military force than he has requested. \nPassage of this resolution would be the equivalent of giving the \nPresident a blank check to operate militarily in Yugoslavia.\n  Secondly, passage of the resolution would abrogate Congressional \nresponsibility for the conduct of this war. The Constitution provides \nthe Congress with a clear role in the use of military force. While the \nPresident has consistently stated his belief that ground forces will \nnot be used in a non-permissive environment, passage of this resolution \nwould allow the President to reverse his position without prior \nCongressional authorization. To be clear, Mr. President, if this \nresolution were to pass, the President would be able to commit the full \nmight of the U.S. military in Kosovo without first coming to the \nCongress and explaining the mission, without explaining the military \nobjectives, without explaining the exit strategy, and without \nexplaining how such a deployment would affect our military commitments \naround the world. Mr. President, the American people should expect more \nfrom their elected representatives; Congress should not surrender its \nConstitutional responsibilities in this matter.\n  Finally, I oppose the McCain-Biden resolution because it is the wrong \nlegislative statement at the wrong time. While I recognize S.J. Res. 20 \nis before the Senate due to the parliamentary intricacies of the War \nPowers Act, it does not provide an appropriate starting point for a \nSenate debate. The truth is, the Senate is long-overdue in conducting a \nreal debate over our role in Kosovo. What are our objectives? What are \nour long-term strategic interests in the Balkans? How do our military \nactions Kosovo affect our commitments to peace and stability throughout \nthe world? These are the sort of fundamental questions we should be \ndebating on the floor today. Rather than providing a starting point for \ndiscussing our policy options, the McCain-Biden resolution merely \nprovides the final answer: the President knows best. This is not the \nstatement I want to provide to the people of Nebraska.\n  I remain hopeful that the current air campaign will bring about a \nreturn to diplomacy. President Milosevic must realize that NATO's \nobjectives--to stop the humanitarian tragedy in Kosovo, return the \nKosovar people to their homes, and re-establish Kosovar autonomy--will \nbe achieved. The only hope for the Serbian people is a negotiated \nsettlement. In the mean time, the United States and our NATO allies \nshould continue to apply pressure on the Serbian government while \nworking with nations like Russia to establish the basis for a \nsettlement. In the long-run, the United States and Europe are going to \nhave to address the issues of peace and stability in the Balkans in a \nlarger context of economic development and ethnic security.\n  Mr. President, Congress does have a role to play, both in the short-\nterm discussion of our current military actions and in the long-term \ndiscussion of our broader policy in the Balkans. We must begin to talk \nabout these issues in a serious manner or continue to face the prospect \nof having our decisions made for us as events pass us by. Mr. \nPresident, let's table the McCain-Biden resolution and begin a real \ndebate on Kosovo and our national security interests.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Douglas MacArthur, one of this country's \ngreatest military minds, stated ``it is fatal to enter any war without \nthe will to win it.'' I believe that we are faced with that question \ntoday. Does this country have the will to win the war in Kosovo, or \nwill the Atlantic Alliance become another fatality of Serbian \naggression? We must pose this question to the Senate now because of a \nmistake. As NATO policy in Kosovo evolved, we made the mistake of \ntaking a critical capability off the table. From the very start, the \nPresident and NATO leadership stated that this would be an air \ncampaign, and an air campaign only. They went to great lengths to make \nthis point to the press and to the public. Unfortunately, other ears \nwere also listening. Slobodan Milosevic heard loud and clear that this \nwould be a limited NATO effort. By doing so, we gave Milosevic every \nreason to doubt that NATO had the will to win.\n  Furthermore, we gave Mr. Milosevic a vital piece of intelligence on \nhow we would fight this war. In doing so, we have inadvertently given \nhim an advantage more valuable than divisions of soldiers, or batteries \nof antiaircraft guns. This information has allowed Milosevic to \ndisperse his forces and dig in. He knows he has only to wait out the \nair campaign to win this war.\n  It is axiomatic that you cannot win a war by air power alone. We \ntried in Vietnam. We tried in Iraq, but when meeting an enemy \ndetermined to resist, airpower can only succeed with\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\nthe use of ground troops. However, at the start of this war, we told \nMilosevic that he did not have to worry about ground troops. That is \nwhy he is so certain that this country and NATO do not have the will to \nwin. Ask yourselves, how much more accommodating to NATO demands would \nSerbia be, if they knew we were preparing an invasion? Yesterday, \nMilosevic announced that he has over 100,000 troops in Kosovo. This is \nmost likely a lie, but nevertheless, could Milosevic afford to have so \nmany troops rounding up Kosovars if he knew NATO might invade? Of \ncourse not. One of the reasons that this man has been able to continue \nto perpetrate war crimes in Kosovo, is precisely because he has always \nknown that he need not fear a ground war.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is high time that we rectify our mistake. \nMr. Milosevic has underestimated the resolve of the United States and \nthe resolve of NATO. We will see this war through to victory. The first \nstep to victory is a very simple one. Mr. Milosevic must understand \nthat this country will use all of its resources to prevail. No one \ndoubts that we have the means to win the war in Kosovo, this resolution \nwill also demonstrate that we have the will. It does not commit the \nUnited States to a ground war, but it does state that if a ground war \nis necessary for NATO to meet its objectives, we will fight a ground \nwar. In short, we will fight anywhere and anytime to accomplish this \nmission.\n  This country has faced dark days in Europe before. I think few people \nexpressed the significance of that time better than Winston Churchill. \nWhen asked what were his goals for the war with Germany he said simply \n``victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however \nlong and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no \nsurvival.''\n  I believe that if this Nation has learned any lesson from the \ntwentieth century, it is that you do not win wars by half measures. \nWinston Churchill understood this. So do the American people. I hope \nthat the Senate will demonstrate that it too understands this lesson, \nand will oppose tabling the McCain resolution today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized to move to \ntable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to use my leader time to make a brief \nstatement also.\n  Mr. President, I should begin by saying I understand the feeling of \nthe sponsors of this resolution and I commend them for their dedication \nand their untiring efforts. But I would today, in dealing with this \nresolution, quote an ancient Greek historian who once said, ``Observe \ndue measure, for right timing is in all things the most important \nfactor.''\n  This resolution is out of sync with current events. There is no \nrequest for this action. NATO is not seeking additional authority. The \nPresident is not seeking additional authority. The Senate has already \nacted and expressed its support for the bombing campaign.\n  I have had my reservations about the President's policy from the \nbeginning and I so voted; but it appears that perhaps the \nAdministration has stopped deciding on targets by committee and that \nthey are actually attacking targets that have greater value. We should \nallow that campaign to continue to work. This is the wrong language and \nit is at the wrong time. Currently, there seem to be some effort to \nfind a negotiated settlement. We should encourage that.\n  But this language would go too far, beyond what I think the Senate is \nprepared to do and what is necessary and what has been requested. It \nauthorizes the use of all necessary force and other means to prosecute \nthis fight. That does include ground troops. I think the Senate would \nwant to have a longer debate and want to discuss other options. For \ninstance, when we were considering the timing of this resolution last \nweek, we were exchanging language between the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader, to see if we could find language that would have \nbroad, bipartisan support. That was interrupted by this resolution.\n\n  Let me review how we got here. This resolution was introduced weeks \nago. And under the War Powers Act, it was the pending business as of \nlast Friday. We cannot go to another matter, under the War Powers Act, \nonce the Parliamentarian ruled that this language kicked into action \nthe War Powers Act. So we had to either act on it or get an agreement \nto postpone it. I agreed and urged that we postpone it for a week or 10 \ndays until we had some bipartisan language we could agree on. Senator \nMcCain agreed to that postponement. Senator Daschle indicated that he \nthought he could support that.\n  But, along the way, as Senators are entitled to do, there were \nobjections to postponing it by unanimous consent. So we had to deal \nwith this issue. My suggestion at that time was that we not get into a \nsubstantive debate, that we offer a procedural motion to set it aside \nuntil another time when we can better determine what is needed--if \nsomething different is required than what is already on the books, if \nsomething more is asked for by the President, or if we are ready to go \nforward with the War Powers Act or even a declaration of war. But I \ndon't think we are there at this moment.\n  So we are forced to have this vote today. I would like to describe it \nas a procedural vote because I think it is. It is to table this \nresolution and to reserve the opportunity at some future date to have a \nvote on whether or not we want to give the President authority to \nprosecute this matter with all necessary force. I do not think that is \nwhere we are today. But I do want to say emphatically that I think the \nlanguage is substantively excessive, not necessary, and uncalled for.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to support the motion to \ntable and I so move to table the resolution. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Does the Senator from New Mexico wish to say something \nbefore we start?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to Senator Domenici \nand to reclaim my time when he is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 951 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to outline the procedure that we \nhave agreed to by unanimous consent as we begin the debate on financial \nservices modernization. We have agreed to have opening statements. I \nguess we will assume that the rest of the morning will be used up in \nthose opening statements. I will make an opening statement, the ranking \nmember of the committee, Senator Sarbanes, will make an opening \nstatement, and then all those who would like to make an opening \nstatement are encouraged to come to the floor and do those statements \nthis morning.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator Sarbanes would then \noffer a comprehensive substitute for the committee mark. That would be \ndebated for the remainder of the morning--if there is any morning left \nwhen it is introduced--and this afternoon. When debate on that is \ncompleted, a vote would be set. It is my assumption, since we have \ncolleagues from two States who have had a terrible natural disaster and \nhave gone home this morning to assist in making the evaluations that \nwill help us respond to that through our Federal emergency programs, my \nassumption is that we will set aside the vote until some time tomorrow \nwhen they can come back.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, at the end of the Sarbanes \namendment, I, or my designee, would be recognized to offer two \namendments. Those amendments will be offered and debated. And then, \ndepending on where we are in terms of our colleagues coming back from \ntheir States that have had the natural disasters, we would begin the \nvoting process.\n  The final part of the unanimous consent agreement would be a fourth \namendment that Senator Sarbanes, or his designee, would offer, and that \nwould be an amendment that would strike the CRA provisions of the \ncommittee bill and insert the provisions related to CRA, which are in \nthe Sarbanes substitute. That would get us four amendments into the \nprocess, and we would then begin the normal debate process where the \nfloor would be open to those who seek recognition.\n  I know that it is the hope of our leadership that we would finish the \nbill this week. I don't see any reason that we can't do that. Let me \nsay, as we begin this debate, I am willing to stay here late at night, \nthrough the night, if we need to in order to have a full debate on \nthese issues. I think we all recognize that under the Senate rules \neverybody gets to have their say. Everybody gets an opportunity to \noffer amendments. I am hopeful that we can complete this process by \nThursday. We have a long trail to follow to complete the bill.\n  As many people in the Senate are aware, the House has a divided \njurisdiction. The House committee has acted on the bill, the Banking \nCommittee; but the Commerce Committee, which has joint jurisdiction, is \nnow in the process, on a bipartisan basis, of writing a bill that is \nvery different. So I am hopeful that by this Thursday we can complete \nthis bill and start moving toward conference and toward all the work \nthat still lies before us.\n  I would be happy to yield to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just want to underscore a couple of \nthe things that the able chairman of the committee just stated. This is \na partial agreement that was worked out and was an effort to get the \nSenate into its consideration of the bill in an orderly and prompt \nmanner. I think it will accomplish that.\n  A number of colleagues asked me during the last vote about making \nopening statements. I indicated that the chairman would be making an \nopening statement, and I would make one, and then the floor would be \nopen for opening statements. We hope we can complete those, I assume, \nthis morning before we take a break for the conference luncheons, and \nthen we would be able to move on to the substitute amendment in the \nafternoon.\n  So we hope Members will try to keep this schedule in mind and come \nover sometime during the morning here. I know a number have left to go \nto committee meetings, but they said they wanted to come back in order \nto make an opening statement. We want to try to accommodate our \ncolleagues in that regard.\n\n  On the vote schedule, I think we will have to work that out on the \nbasis of the people who are away, so that we can accommodate everyone \nin terms of being able to vote, which I assume will be sometime \ntomorrow, as I understand it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think that is right. Some time between \nnoon and 4 o'clock is the word that I received.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We will have to discuss that, because I think we may \nhave a little problem with that. We may need to extend that a little \nbit.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't see any reason why we can't accommodate each \nother. We want to have a full debate. Much of the essence of the \ndifferences that exist are embodied in the first and fourth amendments. \nI think having a full debate is what we should do. I think it is \nimportant that people understand the issues, and I can certainly say, \nfrom my point of view, I think the better people understand these \nissues, the better off we are.\n  We are here to debate the most important banking bill in 60 years \ntoday. This bill would dramatically change the American financial \nsystem. It would knock down existing barriers that separate insurance \nand banking and separate securities and banking. It would create a new \nfinancial institution in America, which would still be a bank or a bank \nholding company, would still have the same structure, but it would be a \nvery different institution, and it would be basically a supermarket for \nfinancial services.\n  Let me say, in going into the process, that my goal is to put \ntogether a bill that will provide greater diversity and financial \nservices at a lower price to American consumers. If this bill does not \nmeet the test of providing benefit in terms of a greater diversity and \navailability of product, if it doesn't meet the test of providing a \nlower cost for those products, for the people who do the work and pay \nthe taxes and pull the wagon in America, then it would be my view that \nwe have failed in this bill. That, I think, is the test that we need to \nuse in order to judge our success or lack thereof on this bill.\n  In terms of barriers erected between insurance and banking and \nbetween securities and banking, most of these barriers erected in the \n1920s and 1930s, what has happened that has really brought us to this \npoint in terms of legislating this dramatic change in the American \nfinancial system is that, over time, these barriers have stopped \nlooking like barriers, and now they look like little slices of Swiss \ncheese. They have large and small holes in them, some created by \ninnovative regulators, some created by the growth of practice and \nconvention. But the net result is that after fighting each other for 50 \nyears to try to keep other industries out of their individual portion \nof the financial services industry, these three great economic forces \nin the American economy--the insurance industry, the banking industry, \nand the securities industry--have basically concluded that they would \nbe better off in terms of an open field of competition and greater able \nto meet the needs of their consumers if we simply took down these \nbarriers.\n\n  Also students of this problem--no matter what their persuasion within \nlimits at the beginning of the debate--have concluded that the \ninstability that exists in allowing these walls that divide these three \nmajor financial industries to continue to stand, knowing that these \nwalls have, because of the holes in them, produced this instability and \nproduced an unstable structure in many cases--the basic conclusion has \nbeen reached by virtually everyone engaged in the debate that we would \nbe better off to take down these barriers than to leave them standing \nas they are. The debate today is not about the changes that we make in \nthe name of financial services modernization.\n  That is why I believe and hope that in the end we can reach a \nconsensus where at least 51 Members of the Senate--hopefully more--will \nvote for the final product of this deliberation.\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n  What we are debating is not about what changes are to be made, but \nhow to make those changes. That really involves basically two areas, \nand they will be the focal point of this debate.\n  The first area is the question of where these new financial services \nshould be provided. Should these new financial services be provided \nwithin the bank itself, within the legal structure of the bank, and \nwhat capital that is invested in these new parts of the financial \nservices industry will count as the capital of the bank itself? Or \nshould these new financial services be provided by affiliates of \nholding companies outside the bank?\n  This is a fundamentally important question. It is a question where we \nhave great differences of opinion. It is a question that the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, believes is so important \nthat he has said in testimony before the House Commerce Committee that \nif we had a bill that allowed banks to provide these expanded services \nwithin the bank itself, that bill would be so dangerous in terms of \nproviding an unlevel playing surface--in terms of encouraging \nartificially the concentration of securities products being sold and \nserviced inside the bank--and the safety and soundness dangers with the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation would be so great, that he and \nevery member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board \nhave taken a position that it would be better to pass no financial \nservices modernization than to undertake to allow banks to provide \nthese new services within the bank itself.\n  The White House and the Treasury have taken exactly the opposite \nposition--they favor a bill where banks can provide these services \nwithin the legal structure of the bank.\n  It is my understanding--I have not seen it, but it is my \nunderstanding--that we have another veto threat from the President. The \nnumber of items the President is threatening to veto has grown, and now \nwe have gone from four items in his first letter to six items, some of \nwhich, it is my understanding, would also apply to the Sarbanes \nsubstitute and to the House bill, further raising some question about \nthe administration's degree of seriousness about this bill.\n  That is our first issue. Should banks provide the new expanded \nfinancial services within the structure of the bank itself, or should \nthey be forced to take capital out of the bank and invest it through \ntheir holding company in these separate and independent entities that, \nwhile affiliated with the bank holding company, will be independent of \nthe bank?\n\n  That is probably the most important issue that we will vote on. I \nwill say more about it later in my opening statement. You will hear a \nlot more about it as we get further into the debate.\n  Inevitably in a big bill like this, subsidiary issues take on great \nimportance. One issue that has taken on very great importance in this \nbill is community reinvestment. I will talk more about this later when \nwe turn to these two areas of dispute.\n  But let me say the real question here boils down to this simple \nquestion: Should we have a massive expansion in CRA and CRA enforcement \nand with it a massive expansion in regulatory burden, or should we \nreform the existing program to try to eliminate the growing abuse that \nis occurring in that program and the growing regulatory burden that \nexists in that program?\n  That will be the second major issue that we will deal with as part of \nthis bill.\n  Before I turn to a discussion about what the underlying committee \nbill does, I just want to say a few words of thanks to people that have \nbeen important in putting this bill together.\n  I first want to thank Senator Bryan and Senator Johnson for their \nhelp in committee in making many elements of this bill a bipartisan \nbill.\n  I joined with Senator Bryan to adopt a provision related to how banks \nwould sell insurance.\n  I thank Senator Johnson from South Dakota, who joined with Senator \nShelby in supporting an amendment to exempt very small rural banks from \nthe regulatory burden of CRA.\n  I think the action by these two Senators really set a standard that \nwe ought to work to meet in the rest of this bill.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues who sat through many long seminars \non financial services modernization, for lack of a better term. I thank \nthem for doing this with a minimum of complaint. I think the net result \nis that by and large the Republican members of the Banking Committee \nunderstand this issue better than we did when this issue was discussed \nlast year. I think the net result is that we have a better bill.\n  I would like to thank all of my staff on the majority side of the \ncommittee. But I especially want to thank our staff director, Wayne \nAbernathy, our chief counsel, Linda Lord, and our financial economist, \nSteve McMillin, for all the work they have done on this bill and the \nwork that they have done to make the bill better.\n  Finally, let me just express a regret. I regret that I have not done \na better job in working with Senator Sarbanes. We have had a difficult \ntime in working together to forge a bipartisan bill. Some of this is \ninevitable, I think. Some of it is not. I just want to say that my \ninability to work with Senator Sarbanes on this bill is something that \nI regret. I have the highest regard for his intellect and his sincerity \non these issues. And while he and I do not agree on many of these \nissues, I don't doubt for a moment that he understands the issues and \nhe is sincere about the position he has taken.\n  I think that is one of the reasons it is very hard to work out some \nof these issues, because, as Thomas Jefferson observed long ago, good \nmen with good intentions in a free society often reach different \nconclusions. When that happens, the best we can do is to simply plow \nahead. And that is what we are doing here.\n  Let me try to run through very quickly what I believe are the major \nelements in the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 as \nreported by the Senate Banking Committee. First, this bill repeals \nGlass-Steagall. It knocks down the barriers between insurance and \nbanking and between securities and banking. It chooses to do this for \nthe vast majority of the capital in the banking industry through \naffiliates of bank holding companies. This bill makes the decision that \nit is unwise and dangerous to allow large banks to provide these \nexpanded services within the structure of the bank itself.\n  The majority of the members of the committee concluded that Chairman \nGreenspan is right, that there are strong safety and soundness \narguments against allowing banks to provide these expanded services \nwithin the structure of the bank itself and that this endangers the \ntaxpayer through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n  Additionally, the majority of the members of the committee were \nconvinced that to give banks the ability to sell these financial \nproducts within the structure of the bank, and therefore to give them \nthe ability to internalize the inherent subsidies that are built into \nFDIC insurance, plus the ability of banks to borrow from the Fed window \nat the lowest interest rates in the country and use the Fed wire, that \nthese implicit subsidies--which the Federal Reserve Board has estimated \nto be as high as 12 basis points--would be big enough to assure over \ntime to virtually guarantee a massive degree of economic concentration, \nconcentration whereby banks would end up dominating these markets--not \nbecause they are more inherently efficient but because they would have \nthe advantage of the subsidies that come from undertaking these \nprovisions within the bank.\n  This view was very broadly held last year. Senator Sarbanes, in the \nbill he supported, supported this position last year. This was the \nposition of the House bill last year. Now we have a debate as to \nwhether or not the Congress, the Senate committee and the House itself, \nshould reverse its position. This is not a partisan issue. I don't know \nhow the votes are going to fall, and I know partisanship has really \nentered into this area. Historically, on issues like this there has \nbeen a great division on a bipartisan basis.\n  Congressman John Dingell, who is the ranking Democrat on the House \nCommerce Committee that has joint jurisdiction on this issue, has taken \na very strong position that he will oppose the bill if banks are \nallowed to\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nprovide these services within the structure of the bank itself. It is \nclear that the House Commerce Committee is going to take the position \nof the Senate bill. This is clearly a very important issue.\n  An effort was made in the Senate Banking Committee to try to reach a \ncompromise on this issue, to let very small banks that in general are \nnot big enough to operate holding companies efficiently, yet might in a \nvery small way want to get into other financial services such as \nsecurities and insurance--we set out a dividing line of $1 billion of \nassets and below for smaller banks that together when added up comprise \nabout 18 percent of the capital of our banking system, that we would \nallow them to use operating subsidiaries, but with special accounting \nrules so they could expand services and not be precluded from the \nactivity based on their size. However, we require any bank with assets \nover $1 billion or that has a holding company to use subsidiaries of \nholding companies so that these services are provided outside the bank.\n  We allow banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. We follow \nfunctional regulations so that whatever industry you are in, no matter \nwhat name is on your marquee, and no matter what business it is \nassociated with, you will be regulated by the regulators who regulate \nthat particular type of activity. We make a strong effort to reduce \nregulatory burden and streamline the process by giving the Federal \nReserve Board the umbrella supervisory ability but requiring them in \nmost instances to use the audits of other agencies.\n\n  The committee bill takes a very strong position in reaffirming the \nState regulation of the insurance business. We reaffirm that McCarran-\nFerguson is the law of the land, and we require that any institution \nthat is selling insurance in any State comply with the licensing \nrequirements of that State. Our requirement on the State is simply that \nthey have nondiscriminatory requirements.\n  We expand the resolution process, knowing that in the future there \nwill be debate about what products are insurance products or banking \nproducts or securities products. We have a resolution process. Then we \ngive equal standing to the contesting regulators before the court. We \ngo to extra lengths to protect small banks and their trust departments.\n  Between 15 percent and 20 percent of the income of many small banks \ncomes from trust departments. There is a very real concern that banks \nwhich are providing trust functions that might never get into financial \nservices modernization, that might never open up a securities affiliate \nor op-sub could find themselves regulated by the Securities and \nExchange Commission and have a dual regulatory burden, are being forced \nto set up an op-sub or set up a subsidiary simply to continue to do the \nsame things in their trust department that they have always done.\n  We have a very strong provision to protect these small banks, and \nbasically have the preemptive provision that if a bank is providing the \nservice in a trust department today that they cannot be required to set \nup a separate entity to conduct those same services.\n  We have two CRA provisions in the bill. The first provision has to do \nwith integrity. It is a very simple provision. Unfortunately, in this \ndebate one of my great frustrations is that many people don't want to \ndebate the issue before the Senate. As almost always happens in these \ncases, especially when you have an emotionally charged issue, people \nchange the subject; they set up straw men and knock them down.\n  Let me make it clear that nothing in this bill in any way repeals \nCRA. This bill, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee, does two \nthings in CRA. First, it has an integrity provision which says if banks \nhave historically been in compliance with CRA, if in their annual \nevaluations they have been found to be in compliance not once, not \ntwice, but three times in a row, if they are currently in compliance, \nthen if protest groups or objectors want to come in and object to a \nbank action, then objector or protester has to present some substantial \nevidence to suggest that the bank--which has been in compliance 3 years \nin a row and is currently deemed to be in compliance--is out of \ncompliance.\n  As I will discuss in just a moment, we have a long history of case \nlaw as it relates to what ``substantial evidence'' means. But that is \nthe first requirement. It is simply an integrity requirement. It says \nthat if you are in compliance with CRA and you have a long history of \nbeing in compliance, someone can't rush in at the last minute on a \nmajor bank merger, where hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, \nand say they want to undertake a merger and file a protest saying that \nthese two banks are racist or these two banks are loan sharks. These \nare words that have been used by people who filed these protests--\nwithout presenting one scintilla of evidence. In fact, one of the \ndefinitions of substantial evidence is ``more than a single scintilla \nof evidence.''\n\n  So this amendment simply says, if you are going to try to prevent a \nbank from doing something that it has been certified historically on a \ncontinuing basis as being in compliance to do, you have to present some \nsubstantial evidence to suggest that all these evaluations have been \nwrong or that something has happened since the last evaluation.\n  I do not understand, personally, why anyone would object to that \namendment. We already require in case law that the decisions of \nadministrators at the Federal level be based on substantial evidence. \nSo we are really requiring by statute what is already required under \ncase law, and I will talk about that a little more in just a moment.\n  Our second amendment exempts very small, rural banks from CRA. These \nare banks that have less than $100 million of assets. These are banks \nthat often have between 6 and 10 employees. And these are banks that \nare outside standard metropolitan areas. I will talk more in a minute \nabout the regulatory burden that is imposed by CRA on these very small \nbanks, but since many figures have been used by people who have been \ncritical of this proposal, let me say that while 38 percent of the \nbanks and S in America are very small, rural institutions, together \nthey have only 2.7 percent of the capital that is contained in our \nbanking system nationwide. The basic argument here, which has strong \nroots in existing banking law and which is supported, to some degree on \na bipartisan basis, is that these very small, very rural banks that do \nnot have a city to serve, in most cases, much less an inner city, \nshould not have massive regulatory burden imposed on them through CRA.\n  The next provision of the bill is that we eliminate the SAIF special \nreserve fund, allowing that money to go into the SAIF itself.\n  We cut off the unitary thrift holding company provision. This is a \ncontroversial issue. It will be debated. Let me just give a brief \nsummary of the thinking of the majority of the members of the Banking \nCommittee on this issue. Current law permits commercial companies to \nown an S This is called a unitary thrift, and a decision was made in \nour bill to end this provision.\n  So, then the question is what are you going to do about commercial \nentities that already own S? The decision we made was to cut off, \neffective as of the date that we introduced the committee mark, any \nfurther applications for a commercial company to own an S, so that \nall of those applications which were filed prior to that date can be \nevaluated by the Federal regulator, but no new applications would be \nallowed.\n  There is a second question as to whether we should go so far as to \nlimit the ability of commercial entities that already have thrifts to \nsell their thrift to another commercial interest. The majority of the \nmembers of the Banking Committee concluded that we could go as far as \nnot allowing any new entities to come into existence. But an ex post \nfacto law that goes back and changes the rules that thrifts operate on, \nafter people have already invested their money--many of these entities \ncame in and made investments of hard money during the S crisis; many \nof these commercial entities were encouraged to invest this money and \nin doing so they saved the taxpayer literally billions of dollars--and \nto come in now and say not only are we not going to allow any more \nunitary thrifts to come into existence, something that this bill \nsupports, but we are going to limit what you can do with the thrift you \nalready have, we believe that runs afoul of the takings provision of \nthe fifth amendment of the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\n  We think it is very important to be aware of that conflict with the \nConstitution because recently savings and loans have filed suit against \nthe Federal Government based on another bill, FIRREA, where Congress, \non an ex post facto basis, went back and took back provisions when \nthese companies entered into a contract with the Federal Government. \nAnd we are now told, based on a ruling by the Supreme Court, that we \ncan expect billions of dollars of payments to these S because the \nFederal Government has breached its contract. We have set out a line \nthat we are not willing to go over, and that line is we are not willing \nto violate the Constitution.\n\n  We have provisions that allow community banks of less than $500 \nmillion to be members of and to use the Federal Home Loan Bank. We also \nallow them to use small business, small farm and small agriculture \nlending as collateral for loans, and we believe this will improve the \nliquidity of small banks and their ability to serve their communities.\n  We have a 3-year freeze on existing FICO assessment. We are \ndiscussing this issue at great length, but basically when we made a \ndecision to move the two insurance rates to the same level, there was \nalso a discussion about merging the two insurance funds. But Congress \nnever acted on that issue. The majority of the members of the committee \nin our underlying bill believed there ought to be a discussion about \nthat issue and that we ought to make a decision on that issue.\n  Finally, in terms of the bill itself, we mandate a major GAO study of \nsubchapter S corporations that are engaged in the banking business as a \nfirst step toward changing the way we tax very small banks. Many of our \ncolleagues will remember that last year we were able to allow small \nbanks with fewer than 75 shareholders to be taxed as individuals under \nsubchapter S. We are now trying to expand that out to 150 shareholders. \nThis is a very important provision for small banks.\n  Let me review briefly the two major issues of contention in the bill. \nOperating subs versus affiliates; Chairman Greenspan and all former \nliving Chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board and most former \nSecretaries of the Treasury have argued that it is unwise and dangerous \nto let banks provide these broad financial services within the \nstructure of the bank itself; that they should be required to separate \nsecurities, separate insurance, separate these other industries from \nthe capital of the bank itself because the bank is insured by the \nAmerican taxpayer. So the first argument is a safety and soundness \nargument. The second argument is that the implicit subsidies to banks \nwill give them an unfair advantage in providing these services if they \nare allowed to do them within the bank.\n  I just want to read a couple of quotes from Alan Greenspan. This is \nAlan Greenspan in his April 28 testimony before the House Commerce \nCommittee. ``I and my colleagues''--and by ``colleagues'' he means \nevery member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. I \nwant to remind our colleagues, meaning Senators, that most of those \nmembers of the Federal Reserve Board were appointed by Bill Clinton, by \nthis President. Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       I and my colleagues accordingly are firmly of the view that \n     the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the \n     interest of the American taxpayer would be better served by \n     no financial services modernization bill, rather than one \n     that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted by \n     the bank as proposed in H.R. 10.\n\n  And I would say in the Sarbanes-Daschle substitute.\n  In other words, every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve Board says that for the safety of the taxpayer in FDIC \ninsurance, and for the general competitiveness of the economy, if we \nhad a choice between letting banks provide these broad services within \nthe bank or having no bill at all, they unanimously would prefer having \nno bill rather than doing it the wrong way, as they concluded.\n  Greenspan goes on to say that allowing these services to be provided \nwithin the bank ``leads to greater risks for the deposit insurance \nfunds and for the taxpayer.''\n  Secondly, John Dingell, long-time chairman of the House Commerce \nCommittee and, in the minds of many, the most influential Democrat in \nthe House of Representatives, has said that, ``absent significant \nchanges in H.R. 10''--that is, the House bill, and the same provisions \nare in the Sarbanes substitute--``that I will be compelled to oppose \nthis bill with every bit of strength I have.''\n  So this is a very important issue and an issue which we will vote on \nas part of the general substitute that will be voted on first, and then \nperhaps we will vote on again.\n  Let me turn to a discussion of CRA. Most people think of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act as being a very small program. And it was a \nvery small program until 1992.\n  In 1977, Senator Proxmire put a little provision in a housing bill \nthat nominally required banks to make loans in the communities where \nthey collected deposits. A North Carolina Democrat objected to the \nprovision. There was a vote to strip it out of the bill, and the vote \nfailed on a 7-7 tie. This so-called CRA provision went on to become the \nlaw of the country and became far more important than the bill to which \nit was attached.\n  Prior to 1992, if you added up all the CRA agreements and all the \nbank capital allocated by the CRA requirements, these provisions had \nallocated only about $42 billion worth of capital.\n  Today, 6 years later, CRA is allocating $694 billion in 1 year. That \nis loans, that is commitments to lend, and that is hard cash payments. \nTo put this in perspective, that is bigger than the gross domestic \nproduct of Canada. It is bigger than the combined assets of General \nMotors, Ford, and Chrysler. It is bigger than the total discretionary \nFederal budget of the U.S. Government.\n  Especially troubling is the $9 billion of cash payments which have \nbeen made as part of CRA agreements.\n  In 1977, nobody ever contemplated that under a requirement of law \nwhich required banks to meet credit needs of the communities where they \ncollected deposits that someday banks would pay out and commit $9 \nbillion of cash payments as part of this process.\n  Let me explain these cash payments: As part of every CRA agreement we \nhave been able to obtain, there is a requirement that the banks pay \ncash to individual protesters and protest groups, in return for which \nthey generally sign an agreement that they will withdraw their \nobjection to the banks taking the activity which they objected to.\n  Our provisions relating to CRA are very simple. Let me begin with the \nintegrity provision.\n  Under current law--or under current practice, because the law is a \nvery general law--it is possible for a protest group, say, in Boston to \nprotest a bank merger in Illinois and, in essence, not go away until \nits ``expenses'' in a cash payment to it are made.\n  It has now become fairly common for protest groups from one State or \nregion to protest bank actions in another State or region, entering \ninto the process to file a complaint or to threaten a complaint. But \noften official complaints are not filed. You are going to hear figures \nabout there being complaints in only 1 percent of the bank \napplications. Remember, most applications are only to close or open a \nbranch. The big applications are merger applications, and one of the \nreasons we have had an explosion in CRA and the cash payments in the \nlast 6 years is from these mergers.\n\n  None of these agreements is public--every agreement we have seen, and \nwe now have three that I have read, and we are getting more every day--\nevery one of them requires the bank to keep the agreement private, so \nno one knows what percentage of the face value of the loan goes to the \ncommunity group in a cash payment. No one knows how much in direct \npayments occurs. No one knows how much the community group collects in \nclasses, say, that it makes the borrowers go to and then pay it cash \nmoney.\n  But basically our first amendment tries to deal with the following \nproblem: The last-minute protest, or where the protester does not file \nwith the Comptroller of the Currency but simply goes to the bank in \nquestion and says, ``Look, I'm going to file this complaint. Here is a \nletter that I'm going to send to the Comptroller of the Currency \ncalling you a racist and calling you a loan shark. And these are the \nprotests that I'm going to hold in these\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nvarious locations. And I wanted to see, before I did all this stuff, if \nyou were willing to `comply' with the law.''\n  Basically what is happening in these cases is, there is immense \npressure on the bank to make a cash payment or to enter into some kind \nof agreement in order to be able to move forward on their merger.\n  Here is what our amendment says. If a bank has been in compliance \nwith CRA--the bank has been evaluated by any of the Federal regulators \nwho have jurisdiction to come to the bank, evaluate it, review its \nrecords, and determine that it is complying with CRA--if the bank has \ncomplied 3 years in a row, and if it is currently in compliance, then a \nprotester is not precluded from protesting. You are going to hear some \npeople say this is a safe harbor. It is not a safe harbor. Legally, it \nis a rebuttable presumption. The bank is assumed to be in compliance if \nit has been in compliance three times in a row and is deemed by its \nregulators in compliance now, unless the protester or protest group can \npresent substantial evidence of noncompliance.\n\n  Now, what does ``substantial evidence'' mean and where does the term \ncome from? Substantial evidence is referenced 900 times in the United \nStates Code. It is probably the best defined legal term in the American \nsystem of jurisprudence. There have been 400 major cases defining what \nsubstantial evidence means.\n  Title 5 of the United States Code relating to administrative law--\nthat is, how agencies function--already requires that agency action be \nbased upon substantial evidence, not on arbitrary or capricious action. \nSo the reality is, it is already the law that bank regulators should be \nusing this standard right now for evaluating CRA. In fact, all banking \nlaws and procedures and the judicial review of all banking laws and all \nbanking procedures use one standard--substantial evidence.\n  Now, what does substantial evidence mean? I have a good counsel, and \nshe has gone back and researched all these 900 laws and all of these \ncourt rulings. Here is what substantial evidence means. In order for a \nprotester to stop a bank merger or have its protest become a formal \npart of the consideration for a bank application, the protester must \npresent substantial evidence that the bank is either not in compliance \nor won't be in compliance after its action.\n  Now, what does substantial evidence mean? It means ``more than a mere \nscintilla.'' In other words, you have a bank that is engaged in a \ntransaction where it could literally lose $100 million a day by being \nunable to consummate its agreement, and the standard that we require \nfor you as an individual to come in and throw a rock in the gear and \npotentially stop this whole process is that you have to present more \nthan a mere scintilla of evidence that this bank, with a long history \nof compliance, where the regulators say it is in compliance right now, \nall you have to do is present more than a mere scintilla of evidence \nthat in fact the bank is not in compliance.\n  Now, what is onerous about that? In fact, should we have a procedure \nin a free society where professional protesters, without presenting a \nmere scintilla of evidence, can literally hold up institutions and \npotentially impose hundreds of millions of dollars of costs on them and \ntheir customers without presenting a scintilla of evidence? Who could \nbe against that proposal?\n  A second definition defined in case law and in statute is, such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might--it doesn't say ``has \nto''--accept as adequate to support a claim; real, material, not \nseeming or imaginary; considerable in amount, value, and worth.\n  So I ask my colleagues and anybody who might be interested in this \ndebate, is it unreasonable for a bank which has historically been in \ncompliance with the CRA law, has been meeting the requirements as \njudged by the regulators who have responsibility for judging, having \nbeen in compliance 3 years in a row, being in compliance now, if \nsomebody wants to come in and prevent them from doing things which the \nregulator has already judged in their last evaluation that at least as \nof that point they were in compliance with the law to allow them to do \nthat, is it unreasonable to ask that they present at least one \nscintilla of evidence, that they present evidence that a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a claim, that their evidence \nbe real, material and not seeming or imaginary, or that it be \nconsiderable in amount, value, and worth? How could anyone think that \nstandard is too high?\n  The second issue related to CRA has to do with small banks. Small \nbanks in rural areas have a very small percentage of the capital that \nis available in the American banking system--about 2.7 percent. But I \nthink of greater importance is the following figure, and I think it \nproves one thing conclusively: Small banks in communities that are \noutside metropolitan areas--that is, generally don't even have a city \nmuch less an inner city--are doing an excellent job of serving their \ncommunities.\n\n  Since 1990, there have been 16,380 CRA exams on small, rural banks. \nMany of the small bankers from all over America who have written the \nBanking Committee have estimated that CRA compliance costs them about \n$60- to $80,000 a year. They have to name a CRA compliance officer. \nMany of these banks have between 6 and 10 employees. By the time they \ndo all the paperwork and comply with all of the regulations, by the \ntime they name a CRA compliance officer--normally that is the president \nof the bank--they are having to pay between $60- and $80,000 a year to \ncomply. Sixteen thousand, three hundred and eighty of them have been \nexamined for CRA compliance since 1990, and only three small rural \nbanks and S have been deemed to be out of compliance. That is, 3/100 \nof 1 percent of the evaluations have turned up just three small banks \nand small S in rural areas that are out of compliance.\n  In return for having turned up 3 supposed bad actors, you have had \n16,380 evaluations, 40 percent of the entire enforcement mechanism for \nCRA. What I do not understand is why CRA advocates don't want to take \nthat enforcement and put it where the money is, in the urban areas and \nin the big banks.\n  I have numerous letters--and I will read some of them--from small \nbankers, several of whom have been Federal regulators enforcing these \nvery laws in the past, outlining how hard it is for them to comply with \nthese regulations and that they are already lending to everybody in \ntown just to stay in business. These are very small communities, and \nthey have a very small lending base.\n  Now, I have spent a lot of time going through these issues, but I \nthink they are important issues. I look forward to debating this issue. \nI hope we can pass a good bill. I agree with Alan Greenspan and I agree \nwith every one of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, \nhowever, on one point: It is better to have no bill than to have a bad \nbill.\n  I want a bill that is going to promote competition, not reduce it. I \nwant a bill that is going to reduce regulation and redtape and cost, \nnot increase it. I want a bill that is going to expand financial \nservices, not reduce them. I want a bill that is going to lower the \ncosts of financial services, not increase them. I believe we have such \na bill before the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen very carefully to the debate. I hope \nthey will enter it with open, not necessarily empty, minds. I think if \nthey listen to the two major issues we are going to debate--and those \nissues are: Should banks provide these expanded services within a bank, \nor should they have to provide it outside the bank structure?--and as \nthey listen to the issue about whether or not we want integrity and \nrelevance in CRA, which has become, now, the largest program undertaken \nby the Federal Government, if measured against direct government \nspending.\n  It seems to me that the conclusions they will reach are obvious, and \nin reaching those conclusions we will have the additional benefit of \npassing a bill that will expand financial services and reduce costs. I \nthank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for the fourth time in 11 years, the \nSenate is debating legislation to modernize the structure of the \nfinancial services industry. We are addressing this issue\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nbecause we want our financial services statutes to keep pace with \nforces that are changing the financial marketplace, forces such as \nglobalization, technological change, and the development of new \nproducts.\n  Many experts agree that the time has come to allow affiliations \nbetween banks, securities firms, and insurance companies; in other \nwords, those actors within the financial services industry that \nheretofore have been kept separate by existing statutes--although those \nstatutes have, to some extent, been eroded either by regulatory \ndecisions or by court decisions. It is, therefore, felt that financial \nservices modernization legislation would be useful in helping to set \nthe structure within which financial institutions are to operate, to \nprovide a certainty and a stability that is now missing under the \nexisting arrangements, and which is not altogether clear along the \nborderline of what activities are permitted and what activities are not \npermitted.\n  Now, we have not only no objection, we are supportive of the effort \nto allow these affiliations to take place within the financial services \nindustry. Therefore, we are anxious to obtain the enactment of \nfinancial services modernization legislation. However, it is important, \nin the course of doing that, that we achieve or preserve certain \nimportant goals: obviously, the safety and soundness of the financial \nsystem; the continuing access to credit for all communities in our \ncountry; protecting consumers, who, after all, are Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica. We are concerned that in this effort to create a new structure \nwe don't lose sight of the very specific problems that relate to the \nordinary American with respect to credit; and finally, maintaining the \nseparation of banking and commerce. There are some who would like to \ncross that line as well, but we think that would be a great mistake to \ndo that.\n  Now, just a little bit of history here. Last year, every Democratic \nmember of the Senate Banking Committee voted for financial services \nmodernization in the form of what was then referred to as H.R. 10, the \nFinancial Services Act of 1998. That bill was reported by the Senate \nBanking Committee on a bipartisan vote of 16-2. So there was a joint \nbipartisan effort last year, to try to obtain enactment of financial \nservices modernization legislation, which didn't prove out--\nunfortunately, in my view.\n  Now, this year, unfortunately, the bill brought out of the Committee \nwas on a vote of 11-9, a straight party vote, which I regret. I \nparticularly regret that, since last year we were able to bring a bill \nout on a 16-2 vote, which, in effect, was a very strong bipartisan \nstatement. That obviously raises the question: Why this dramatic change \nfrom last year to this year? I think, very simply, it is because the \nbill brought to the Senate now, S. 900, does not meet the important \ngoals that I set out earlier of continuing access to credit for all \ncommunities in our country, protecting consumers, and maintaining the \nseparation of banking and commerce.\n  Before this year, the efforts of the Banking Committee to modernize \nfinancial services,--in other words, taking earlier efforts to which I \nreferred, in which we moved legislation out and, on occasion, even \nmoved it through the Senate, but weren't able to get it passed in the \nHouse--those efforts were, in each instance, bipartisan efforts. We \nreported legislation with support from both sides of the aisle. That \neffort, of course, earlier on, and certainly last year, reflected \ncompromises among Committee members and among industry groups on a wide \nrange of issues and, in fact, last year's bill was not opposed by a \nsingle major financial services industry association.\n\n  Now, this year, the consensus so carefully developed last year has \nbeen abandoned. That decision, of course, has made this bill a \ncontroversial one and has led to opposition to it. As I indicated, all \nof the Members on this side of the aisle in the Committee opposed the \nCommittee bill. Some financial industry groups oppose aspects of the \nCommittee bill. Civil rights groups, community groups, consumer \norganizations, and local government officials also strongly oppose the \nCommittee bill, especially with respect to the Community Reinvestment \nAct provision, which is an extremely important issue, as Members are \nwell aware.\n  Lastly, let me note, because it is highly relevant to the process in \nwhich we find ourselves, that the White House--the President himself--\nstrongly opposes this legislation. The President sent a letter to the \nCommittee at the time of the markup, saying:\n\n       This administration has been a strong proponent of \n     financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase \n     access to financial services for consumers, businesses and \n     communities. Nevertheless, we cannot support the Financial \n     Services Modernization Act of 1999, as currently proposed by \n     Chairman Gramm, now pending before the Senate Banking \n     Committee.\n\n  They then go on to indicate their difficulties with the Community \nReinvestment Act provisions, noting that:\n\n       It is a law that has helped to build homes, create jobs and \n     restore hopes in communities across America.\n\n  They reference that:\n\n       The bill would deny financial services firms the freedom to \n     organize themselves in the way that best serves their \n     customers, prohibits a structure with proven advantages for \n     safety and soundness, which is the op-sub affiliate issue.\n       The bill would provide inadequate consumer protections and, \n     finally, the bill could expand the ability of depository \n     institutions and non-financial firms to affiliate at a time \n     when experience around the world suggests the need for \n     caution in this area.\n\n  The President concludes that letter by saying:\n\n       I agree that reform of the laws governing our Nation's \n     financial services industry would promote the public \n     interest. However, I will veto the financial services \n     modernization act if it is presented to me in its current \n     form.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the administration has also just \nsubmitted a Statement of Administration Policy, which starts out:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 900, which would \n     revise laws governing the financial services industry. This \n     Administration has been a strong proponent of financial \n     modernization legislation that would best serve the interests \n     of consumers, businesses, and communities, while protecting \n     the safety and soundness of our financial system. \n     Consequently, it supports the bill's repeal of the Glass-\n     Steagall Act's prohibition on banks affiliating with \n     securities firms and of the Bank Holding Company Act's \n     prohibitions on insurance underwriting. Nevertheless, because \n     of crucial flaws in the bill, the President has stated that, \n     if the bill were presented to him in its current form, he \n     would veto it.\n\n  And then it enumerates their concerns with the bill, most of which \nrepeat the points made in the President's letter to the Committee of \nMarch 2.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this Statement of \nAdministration Policy be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, and following the letter from the President to the Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, my colleague from Texas, the chairman of \nthe Committee, indicated in his remarks that he had doubts about the \nadministration's seriousness about the bill. I don't quite know where \nthose doubts come from. But let me simply say that I don't think they \ncould be more serious about it than they have indicated, and I know the \nvery strong feeling that the Secretary of Treasury and indeed the \nPresident hold on a number of these issues that we are debating here \nand seeking to try to resolve on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  We have this situation where it is clear that unless these concerns \nenumerated and expressed by the President are resolved in a favorable \nway we are heading down a path towards a veto. That doesn't seem to me \nto be the most constructive or productive path on which to proceed in \nterms of trying to enact legislation.\n  The Democratic Members of the Banking Committee have joined with \nSenator Daschle in introducing Senate bill 753, the Financial Services \nAct of 1999. That bill largely encompasses the compromises that were \ndeveloped last year in the bipartisan legislation.\n  It differs in one important respect, and that is with respect to the \nbank operating subsidiary provisions. I will discuss those in a little \nmore detail\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\nshortly. But that alternative which reflects essentially last year's \nbipartisan agreement will be offered as an amendment in a the nature of \na substitute to S. 900.\n  That in fact will be the first amendment that will be offered. And \nobviously we expect to do that at the conclusion of opening statements \nwhen Members have had an opportunity to make their opening statements. \nWe expect them to go to the alternative, and we will discuss it \nobviously in some detail. It is I think a very important proposal.\n  If in fact the alternative were substituted for the bill we would be \nwell on the way to getting legislation enacted into law, because it \nwould remove the veto threat at the end of this path and would in \neffect put the Senate essentially in the same ballpark, although not \nexactly, with where the House Banking Committee was when it reported \nout, on a vote of 51 to 8, a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  It is quite true that bill now has to go through the House Commerce \nCommittee because of the division of jurisdiction on the House side, \nand presumably differences between how the House Commerce Committee \nsees issues and how the House Banking Committee has seen them will have \nto be resolved on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  But at this stage, the first step, what the House Banking Committee \nhas done--I underscore score again on a very strong 51 to 8 vote, an \noverwhelming bipartisan endorsement--parallels, is very similar, to \nwhat is contained in the alternative that we will be offering as an \namendment as a substitute for the bill that is now before us.\n  Let me turn to the bill that is now before us with special emphasis \non its differences from the Committee reported bill last year with the \n16 to 2 vote that we had in the Committee.\n  It is important I think to try to develop a consensus on these \nissues. The Committee in the past has essentially worked in a \nnonpartisan way. We have divisions within the Committee but they have \nnot usually been on a straight party basis.\n\n  I share the regret expressed by the chairman that we have not been \nable to work this matter out this year in a way to avoid these sharp \nparty differences. But the failure to do so relates back directly to \nthese very critical issues that are at stake. These were issues on \nwhich last year we were able to work out accommodations and in fact the \nprovisions we are advancing in the substitute are last year's agreed-\nupon provisions, the consensus provisions from last year with the one \nexception of the operating sub-affiliate issue which I will address \nshortly.\n  Clearly one obvious and extremely important problem with S. 900, the \nbill now before us, brought out by the Committee is the treatment of \nthe Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The agreement that we have \nreached in terms of the order of procedure provide that an amendment \nspecifically directed to CRA will be in order as fourth in the line.\n  We set out this order just for the first four amendments in an effort \nto structure at least the outset of the consideration of this very \nimportant legislation.\n  I share the chairman's perception that this is very important \nlegislation. It is an issue we have wrestled with for many years. It \npertains to the workings of our financial services industry, which in \nturn, of course, pertains to the workings of our economy and our \nposition in the international economic scene. These are important \nmatters to which we are addressing ourselves.\n  I echo the chairman's hope that Members will pay close attention. I \nassume that Members will pay close attention, and that they will come \nto it with an open mind as they weigh the various considerations that \nare before us.\n  Let me turn to the CRA provisions.\n  Let me first say that the Community Reinvestment Act, in the judgment \nof most objective observers, has played a critical role in expanding \naccess to credit and investment in low- and moderate-income \ncommunities. We think it has been of critical importance in providing \naccess to credit, which very frankly is, in today's context when we \ntalk about civil rights in terms of economic opportunity, a very \nimportant aspect of civil rights.\n  In 1977, the CRA was enacted to encourage banks and thrifts to serve \nthe credit needs of their entire communities. Consistent with safe and \nsound banking practices, banks and thrifts must serve not just upper-\nincome areas but low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, as well. CRA \nreflect the view that banks and thrifts receive public benefits such as \ndeposit insurance, access to the Federal Reserve discount window and \nthe Federal Reserve payment system, that they draw deposits out of \nthese communities and that they have a responsibility to make loans \ninto the communities in order to serve the entire community.\n  In fact, the loan-to-deposit ratio is often an important standard to \nmeasure the extent to which the institutions drawing deposits out of \nthe community are providing a flow of credit back into those \ncommunities.\n  Now, my colleague, the chairman of the Committee, has talked about \nthese very large amounts of money that have been committed for \ncommunity reinvestment purposes. First of all, let me say those figures \nare grossly overstated. The figures cited reflect commitments made by \nfinancial institutions projected 10 years into the future. They are not \nthe commitments for 1 year. He is upset by the size of them. I wish \nthey were for 1 year. I am not upset by the size of them. I would like \nto see these kind of commitments made into reinvesting in our \ncommunities. In any event, in order to get this debate on an apples and \napples basis, I think it is very important to understand that the \nfigures that were being tossed around by the chairman reflect \ncommitments made by the institutions over an extended period of time \nand not what is going to take place this year.\n  CRA has significantly improved the availability of credit in \nhistorically underserved communities. There are any number of success \nstories. Obviously, we will address those when we turn to the specific \nCRA amendment. Let me just simply point out that CRA has been credited \nwith a dramatic increase in homeownership by low- and moderate-income \nindividuals. Between 1993 and 1997, private sector home mortgage \nlending and low- and moderate-income census tracks increased by 45 \npercent. CRA has helped spur community economic development. The number \nof loans for small business in low- and moderate-income areas has \nincreased substantially.\n  Now, the chairman says there has been this sharp increase in the \namount of commitments. That is true, but there has been a very sharp \nincrease in the amount of mergers and acquisitions which helped to \ntrigger the CRA process. There has been a more receptive attitude \ntoward CRA on the part of the regulatory agencies. In fact, regulatory \nagencies, community groups, local and State elected officials and many \nbankers agree that CRA has been beneficial. Chairman Greenspan \nspecified that ``CRA has very significantly increased the amount of \ncredit in communities,'' that the changes have been ``quite profound.''\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors has promoted CRA as an essential tool \nin revitalizing cities, while the National League of Cities has listed \nCRA preservation as a major Federal priority for 1999.\n  Bankers have been able to work with CRA, made it very effective and \ndeveloped new relationships with their communities. As a consequence, \nthe chairman and CEO of BankAmerica, Hugh McColl, stated earlier this \nyear,\n\n       My company supports the Community Reinvestment Act in \n     spirit and in fact. To be candid, we have gone way beyond its \n     requirements.\n\n  CRA has accomplished these goals by encouraging banks and thrifts to \nmake profitable market rate loans and investments. Chairman Greenspan \nnoted last year that there is no evidence that banks' safety and \nsoundness have been compromised by low- and moderate-income lending and \nbankers often report sound business opportunities. In fact, the CRA \nlegislation requires that these loans are made consistent with safety \nand soundness criteria.\n  My colleague suggests that somehow the CRA was put into law sort of \nunbeknownst to everyone, that the only vote was a 7-7 vote in Committee \non an amendment to take the provision out of a bill that had been laid \nout for markup. When that bill came to the floor an amendment was \nproposed to\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nstrike the CRA title of the bill. That amendment was defeated on a vote \nof 31 in favor and 40 against.\n\n  For whatever it is worth, I simply want to put down this notion that \nsomehow this matter wasn't considered at the time it was first put into \nlaw in the Senate. It was considered in the Committee and it was \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate. It was voted on in both places \nand it remained in the law. That is the provision that we now have with \nsome subsequent modifications.\n  In the mid-1990s an effort was made to revise the CRA regulations and \ndeal with the complaint that was being received from a number of \nfinancial institutions that the regulatory process was overly \nburdensome. Secretary Rubin actually took the lead in doing that. I \nthink he did a very successful job, in effect trimming down CRA \nrequirements, in order to ease that burden. In fact, at the time his \nwork was received with great approval.\n  Let me talk very quickly about the defects that are in the bill with \nrespect to CRA. As I said, we had good agreement on this last year. \nThis year, unfortunately, we really have had a major conflict over this \nextremely important issue.\n  The chairman makes a number of assertions about CRA but we have never \nheld any hearings to substantiate those assertions. We are constantly \nbeing told about how extensive the abuse is. I am prepared to consider \nthe possibility that on occasion abuses occur, but I think the ones \nthat took place and most of the ones talked about took place in the \nearly years of the CRA and that, by and large, now the CRA process is \nworking quite well.\n  I know that doesn't meet my colleagues concern. I'm a little bit \nreminded of the story of the program that was working well in practice, \nbut the objection was raised, Is it working well in theory? As I listen \nto this debate, I'm reminded of that story.\n  Let me talk about the provisions in the bill as it differed from last \nyear's approach. The bill eliminates the need to have a \n``satisfactory'' CRA rating as a precondition of expanded affiliations. \nIn other words, the substitute we will offer will provide that if a \nbank wants to go into securities or into insurance, that the bank must \nhave a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. In other words, a bank that has an \nunsatisfactory performance rating would not be able to move into those \nactivities. It is asserted that that is a major expansion of CRA. The \nmajor expansion is the ability of the banks to go into those activities \nwhich heretofore they have been precluded from. That is the expansion.\n  Our position is if that is going to take place, a CRA screening with \nrespect to the bank's performance--not to the securities or insurance \naffiliate, the bank's performance--is a perfectly reasonable \nrequirement to expanding the activities. Otherwise, this bill is not \nneutral. I mean, it allows the banks in effect to shift assets out. If \nthey do not have the requirement of a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating, you \nwould dramatically undermine CRA as it now exists. In fact, Secretary \nRubin stated:\n\n       If we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time when \n     the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and the \n     establishment of non-bank financial services will become \n     increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly \n     authorized activities should be connected to a satisfactory \n     CRA performance.\n\n  The financial institutions are prepared, willing, to live with this \nrequirement. They are not clamoring that it be dropped from the \nlegislative package. In fact, they were supportive of it last year and \naccepting of it this year.\n  Second, and I am touching on them very quickly because I know there \nare other Members wishing to make an opening statement.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I just interrupt my colleague and \nask a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Surely.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am a little uneasy he is being rushed along. My \nunderstanding is at 12:15 we were going to go into morning business; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not an order to that effect.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is or is not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague I did not want him to rush. I \nwill come after the caucuses and speak.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, there are a number of people who \nwant to make opening statements. Presumably we would complete opening \nstatements after lunch if we have not completed them before lunch.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me just ask our colleague how long he \nneeds after lunch to speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a fairly lengthy statement because I am \nprobably one of the few Senators who objects to this bill and I want to \nlay out my case. I want to talk strongly in the positive about some of \nwhat Senator Sarbanes is presenting. So I think probably about 40 \nminutes, I would need.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say I do not object. I think we should go back and \nforth. So if we have a Republican who would like to speak after Senator \nSarbanes, we can do that. If the Senator wants, he can have 40 minutes \nor an hour and 40 minutes. We would like to hear it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could just do this, because I do not want my \ncolleague from Maryland rushing along and there are other colleagues \nout here: I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak this afternoon \nbefore we get to amendments?\n  Mr. SARBANES. You don't have any objection to that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Second, Mr. President, is the provision for a safe \nharbor for banks with a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. Actually, what \nthis provision would do is effectively eliminate public comment on CRA \nperformance. Banks that had received a ``satisfactory'' or better \nrating at the recent exam, and during the preceding 3 years, would be \ndeemed to be in compliance with CRA and immune from public comments on \nCRA performance. That would be the case unless you had substantial, \nverifiable information to the contrary--which of course is a very heavy \nburden of proof.\n  Actually the regulators oppose this. Comptroller of the Currency \nHawke stated:\n\n       Public comment is extremely valuable in providing relevant \n     information to an agency in its evaluation of an application \n     under the CRA, convenience and needs and other applicable \n     standards--even by an institution that has a \n     ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. This amendment would limit or \n     reduce public comment that is useful in our application \n     process.\n  And there is a similar comment from Ellen Seidman, the Director of \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision.\n  Public comment is useful because many banks or regulators sample only \na portion of the markets to determine the institution's CRA rating. \nPublic comment provides an opportunity for community members to point \nout facts and data that have been overlooked in a particular \nexamination.\n  Actually, 97 percent of the institutions get a ``satisfactory'' \nrating so you, in effect, are going to exclude out from this CRA review \nmost of the institutions.\n  None of the statistics support these assertions that there are too \nmany challenges, that there is too much delay. In fact the percentages \nare quite small, in terms of the number of challenges that are filed, \nand then the number of instances in which the challenge gains any \nrecognition from the regulators.\n  The regulators, of course hear all of the comments. Individuals \nseeking to comment on other aspects of the bank's performance--\nfinancial and managerial resources, or competitive implications--are \nnot going to have their rights similarly curtailed. We do not think the \nrights on CRA should be so curtailed. We will develop this, of course, \nlater in the debate.\n  Let me now turn very quickly to the small bank exemption. The \nexemption for the rural institutions would exempt a vast number of \ninstitutions in underserved rural areas. It is asserted that these \nbanks by their very nature serve their communities. But small banks \nhave historically received the lowest CRA ratings. In fact, FDIC \nstatistics show that 57 percent of small banks and thrifts have loan-\nto-deposit ratio below 70 percent, with 17 percent of those having \nlevels below 50 percent.\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\n  The Madison, Wisconsin Capital Times, in an editorial, summed up this \npractice in many rural communities as follows:\n\n       [M]any rural banks establish a very different pattern [than \n     reinvesting in their communities], where local lending takes \n     a lower priority than making more assured investments, like \n     federal government securities. Thus, such banks drain local \n     resources of the very localities that support them, making it \n     much harder for local citizens to get credit.\n\n  We revised the regulations, I think in a very effective way, to slim \nthem down in terms of the burden on the small banks. We don't think an \nexemption is necessary to relieve the regulatory burden. They now have \na streamlined examination process. They generally do not need to keep \npaperwork or records beyond what they would do in the ordinary course \nof business.\n  OTS Director Ellen Seidman stated:\n\n       Small banks should be subject to CRA. The simple assumption \n     that if an institution is small it must be serving its \n     community is not entirely correct.\n\n  Let me turn very quickly to the banking and commerce issue. Again, \nthat is an area in which there is a difference between what was worked \nout last year and the bill that has been brought to the floor this \nyear.\n  A wide range of commentators including, interestingly enough on this \nissue, Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin, former Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker, banking industry associations and public \ninterest groups, support retaining the separation of banking and \ncommerce.\n  Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       It seems to us wise to move first toward the integration of \n     banking, insurance and securities and employ the lessons we \n     learn from that important step before we consider whether and \n     under what conditions it would be desirable to move to the \n     second stage of the full integration of commerce and banking.\n  And Secretary Rubin stated, ``We continue to oppose any efforts to \nexpand the integration of banking and commerce.''\n  The Committee bill permits the continued existence of what is called \na unitary thrift loophole; and, therefore, it permits a major breaching \nof the separation between banking and commerce.\n  The American Bankers Association and the Independent Community \nBankers of America have written to the Senate urging us to support the \nJohnson amendment on unitary thrifts that would prohibit existing \nunitary thrift holding companies to sell themselves to commercial firms \ngoing forward. I think it is very important that we try to check this \nloophole which continues to exist in the law.\n  I simply say to the chairman that I share his view that we ought not \nto cross any line that is violative of the Constitution. We do not \nthink this provision is violative of the Constitution. We think there \nis a lot of very good case law that would support that position.\n  In addition to the unitary thrift loophole, the Committee-reported \nbill--and I will just touch on these--allows unnecessary, open-ended \nmerchant banking investments. It permits holding companies to engage in \nany nonfinancial activities that regulators believe are \n``complimentary'' to financial activities, which is, of course, a \npotentially very large stretch of these activities.\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker gave very strong \ntestimony on this very issue. And careful observers of the issue have \nsaid that they regard the failure to maintain this distinction between \nbanking and commerce, which we have had in our law for a very long \nperiod of time, as one of the reasons that contributed to the Asian \nfinancial crisis.\n  Economist Henry Kaufman warned us. He said that it would lead to \nconflicts of interest and unfair competition in the allocation of \ncredit. He said:\n\n       A large corporation that controls a big bank would use the \n     bank for extending credit to those who can benefit the whole \n     organization. . . . The bank would be inclined to withhold \n     credit from those who are, or could be, competitors to the \n     parent corporation. Thus, the cornerstone of effective \n     banking, independent credit decisions based on objective \n     evaluation of creditworthiness, would be undermined.\n\n  And Paul Volcker, in commenting about the Asian financial crisis has \nwritten:\n\n       Recent experience with the banking crises in countries as \n     different in their stages of development as Japan, Indonesia \n     and Russia demonstrates the folly of permitting industrial-\n     financial conglomerates to dominate financial markets and \n     potentially larger areas of the economy.\n\n  Now, let me turn very quickly to some consumer protection issues \nwhich we think will be more adequately covered in our alternative than \nin the Committee bill.\n  The alternative, which reflects last year's bipartisan agreement, \nprovides mechanisms for regulators to receive and address consumer \ncomplaints. It provides that Federal regulations that provide a greater \nprotection for consumers would apply rather than weaker State \nregulations. It provides that the securities activities of banks would \nbe more closely checked on the broker-dealer question and with respect \nto mutual fund investors.\n  The Committee bill extends the assessment differential on the special \ndeposit insurance assessment paid by thrifts. We do not do that in our \nalternative.\n  Let me turn quickly to the operating subsidiary issue. This is one \narea where we do differ from last year's joint bipartisan bill. We were \nmuch impressed by the fact that the Treasury Department agreed to \nsignificant additional safeguards regarding the scope and regulation of \nbank subsidiary activities. Therefore, we thought it now reasonable to \npermit activities to take place in an operating subsidiary with the \nsafeguards the Treasury came forward with.\n\n  First, that insurance underwriting may not take place in a bank's \nsubsidiary; secondly, that the Federal Reserve shall have exclusive \nauthority to define merchant banking activities in bank subsidiaries; \nthirdly, that the Treasury agrees that the Secretary and the Federal \nReserve shall jointly determine which activities are financial in \nnature, both for a holding company and for a bank subsidiary, and that \nthey shall jointly issue regulations and interpretations under the \nfinancial-in-nature standard.\n  So we think that these changes on the part of the Treasury--including \nthe requirement that every dollar of a bank's investment in a \nsubsidiary would be deducted from the bank's capital for regulatory \npurposes, that a bank could not invest in a subsidiary in an amount the \nbank could not pay its holding company as a dividend, and the strict \nlimits which now apply to transactions between a bank and its \naffiliates would apply to transactions between banks and their \nsubsidiaries--we think this will level the playing field, eliminate any \neconomic benefit, and provide for safety and soundness.\n  So we take the view now, on the basis of this agreement that the \nTreasury has made, that permitting bank operating subsidiaries can be \nconsistent with the goals of preserving safety and soundness, \nprotecting consumers, and promoting comparable regulation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``Ex-FDIC Chiefs \nUnanimously Favor the Op-Sub Structure'' be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 3.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. In conclusion, let me simply state, Mr. President, that \non this side of the aisle we are very much committed to trying to get \nfinancial services modernization legislation. All of us supported it \nlast year. In the Committee again this year we supported legislation \nwhich would accomplish that purpose. We do not believe that the bill \nbrought forward by the Committee meets the very important goals which I \noutlined at the outset.\n  I think the legislation introduced by Senator Daschle, and joined in \nby us, is a balanced, prudent approach to financial services \nmodernization. It reflects last year's carefully struck bipartisan \ncompromises. It is not opposed by any financial services industry actor \nor player. It is similar to the bill passed, by a broad bipartisan \nvote, by the House Banking Committee, and it is clearly the approach \nmost likely to achieve the enactment of financial services \nmodernization legislation.\n  If you want to get legislation, given that at the end of the line it \nmust not\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nonly pass the Congress, but be signed by the President, this approach \nis clearly the one that is most likely to achieve the enactment of \nfinancial services modernization legislation.\n  When the opportunity presents itself, I urge my colleagues to shift \noff the path that is before us and to move on to that path.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, March 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Paul: This Administration has been a strong proponent \n     of financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase \n     access to financial services for consumers, businesses and \n     communities. Nevertheless, we cannot support the ``Financial \n     Services Modernization Act of 1999,'' as currently proposed \n     by Chairman Gramm, now pending before the Senate Banking \n     Committee.\n       In its current form, the bill would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a law \n     that has helped to build homes, create jobs, and restore hope \n     in communities across America. The CRA is working, and we \n     must preserve its vitality as we write the financial \n     constitution for the 21st Century. The bill would deny \n     financial services firms the freedom to organize themselves \n     in the Way that best serves their customers, and prohibit a \n     structure with proven advantages for safety and soundness. \n     The bill would also provide inadequate consumer protections. \n     Finally, the bill could expand the ability of depository \n     institutions and nonfinancial firms to affiliate, at a time \n     when experience around the world suggests the need for \n     caution in this area.\n       I agree that reform of the laws governing our nation's \n     financial services industry would promote the public \n     interest. However, I will veto the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act if it is presented to me in its current \n     form.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                Executive Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 1999.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  s. 900--Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm (R) TX)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S. 900, which would \n     revise laws governing the financial services industry. This \n     Administration has been a strong proponent of financial \n     modernization legislation that would best serve the interests \n     of consumers, businesses, and communities, while protecting \n     the safety and soundness of our financial system. \n     Consequently, it supports the bill's repeal of the Glass-\n     Steagall Act's prohibition on banks affiliating with \n     securities firms and of the Bank Holding Company Act's \n     prohibitions on insurance underwriting. Nevertheless, because \n     of crucial flaws in the bill, the President has stated that, \n     if the bill were presented to him in its current form, he \n     would veto it.\n       In its current form, the bill would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a law \n     that has helped to build homes and create jobs by encouraging \n     banks to serve creditworthy borrowers throughout the \n     communities they serve. The bill fails to require that banks \n     seeking to conduct new financial activities achieve and \n     maintain a satisfactory CRA record. In addition, the bill's \n     ``safe harbor'' provision would amend current law to \n     effectively shield financial institutions from public comment \n     on banking applications that they file with Federal \n     regulators. The CRA exemption for banks with less than $100 \n     million in assets would repeal CRA for approximately 4,000 \n     banks and thrifts that banking agency rules already exempt \n     from CRA paperwork reporting burdens. In all, these \n     limitations constitute an assault upon CRA and are \n     unacceptable.\n       The bill would unjustifiably deny financial services firms \n     holding 99 percent of national bank assets the choice of \n     conducting new financial activities through subsidiaries, \n     forcing them to conduct those activities exclusively through \n     bank holding company affiliates. Thus the bill largely \n     prohibits a structure with proven advantages for safety and \n     soundness, effectively denying many financial services firms \n     the freedom to organize themselves in the way that best \n     serves their customers.\n       The bill would also inadequately inform and protect \n     consumers under the new system of financial products it \n     authorizes. If Congress is to authorize large, complex \n     organizations to offer a wide range of financial products, \n     then consumers should be guaranteed appropriate disclosures \n     and other protections.\n       The bill would dramatically expand the ability of \n     depository institutions and nonfinancial firms to affiliate. \n     The Administration has serious concerns about mixing banking \n     and commercial activity under any circumstances, and these \n     concerns are heightened by the financial crises affecting \n     other countries over the past few years.\n       The Administration also opposes the bill's piecemeal \n     modification of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The \n     Administration believes that the System must focus more on \n     lending to community banks and less on arbitrage activities \n     and short-term lending that do not advance its public \n     purpose. The Administration opposes any changes to the System \n     that do not include these crucial reforms.\n       In addition, the Administration opposes granting the \n     Federal Housing Finance Board independent litigation \n     authority. Such authority would be inconsistent with the \n     Attorney General's authority to coordinate and conduct \n     litigation on behalf of the United States.\n\n\n                         Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n\n       S. 900 would affect direct spending and receipts. \n     Therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's pay-as-\n     you-go scoring of this bill is under development.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n             [From the American Banker, September 2, 1998]\n\n         Ex-FDIC Chiefs Unanimously Favor the Op-Sub Structure\n\n   (By Ricki Tigert Helfer, William M. Isaac, and L. William Seidman)\n\n       The debate on banks conducting financial activities through \n     operating subsidiaries has been portrayed as a battle between \n     the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The Treasury believes \n     banks should be permitted to conduct expanded activities \n     through direct subsidiaries. The Fed wants these activities \n     to be conducted only through holding company affiliates.\n       Curiously, the concerns of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corp. have been largely ignored. The FDIC, alone among the \n     agencies, has no ``turf'' at stake in this issue, as its \n     supervisory reach extends to any affiliate of a bank. The \n     FDIC's sole motivation is to safeguard the nation's banks \n     against systemic risks.\n       In the early 1980s, when one of us, William Isaac, became \n     the first FDIC chairman to testify on this subject, he was \n     responding to a financial modernization proposal to authorize \n     banks to expand their activities through holding company \n     affiliates.\n       While endorsing the thrust of the bill, he objected to \n     requiring that activities be conducted in the holding company \n     format. Every subsequent FDIC chairman, including the current \n     one, has taken the same position, favoring bank subsidiaries \n     (except Bill Taylor who, due to his untimely death, never \n     expressed his views). Each has had the full backing of the \n     FDIC professional staff on this issue.\n       The bank holding company is a U.S. invention; no other \n     major country requires this format. It has inherent problems, \n     apart from its inefficiency. For example, there is a built-in \n     conflict of interest between a bank and its parent holding \n     company when financial problems arise. The FDIC is still \n     fighting a lawsuit with creditors of the failed Bank of New \n     England about whether the holding company's directors \n     violated their fiduciary duty by putting cash into the \n     troubled lead bank.\n       Whether financial activities such as securities and \n     insurance underwriting are in a bank subsidiary or a holding \n     company affiliate, it is important that they be capitalized \n     and funded separately from the bank. If we require this \n     separation, the bank will be exposed to the identical risk of \n     loss whether the company is organized as a bank subsidiary or \n     a holding company affiliate.\n       The big difference between the two forms of organization \n     comes when the activity is successful, which presumably will \n     be most of the time. If the successful activity is conducted \n     in a subsidiary of the bank, the profits will accrue to the \n     bank.\n       Should the bank get into difficulty, it will be able to \n     sell the subsidiary to raise funds to shore up the bank's \n     capital. Should the bank fail, the FDIC will own the \n     subsidiary and can reduce its losses by selling the \n     subsidiary.\n       If the company is instead owned by the bank's parent, the \n     profits of the company will not directly benefit the bank. \n     Should the bank fail, the FDIC will not be entitled to sell \n     the company to reduce its losses.\n       Requiring that bank-related activities be conducted in \n     holding company affiliates will place insured banks in the \n     worst possible position. They will be exposed to the risk of \n     the affiliates' failure without reaping the benefits of the \n     affiliates' successes.\n       Three times during the 1980s, the FDIC's warnings to \n     Congress on safety and soundness issues went unheeded, due \n     largely to pressures from special interests.\n       The FDIC urged in 1980 that deposit insurance not be \n     increased from $40,000 to $100,000 while interest rates were \n     being deregulated.\n       The FDIC urged in 1983 that money brokers be prohibited \n     from dumping fully insured deposits into weak banks and S \n     paying the highest interest.\n       The FDIC urged in 1984 that the S insurance fund be \n     merged into the FDIC to allow the cleanup of the S problems \n     before they spun out of control.\n       The failure to heed these warnings-from the agency charged \n     with insuring the soundness of the banking system and \n     covering its losses-cost banks and S, their customers, and \n     taxpayers many tens of billions of dollars.\n       Ignoring the FDIC's strongly held views on how bank-related \n     activities should be organized could well lead to history \n     repeating itself. The holding company model is inferior to \n     the bank subsidiary approach and should not be mandated by \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Presiding \nOfficer and come up and preside so he can give his opening statement, \nif he would like to do that. Before doing that, however, I will make a \ncouple of points in response to Senator Sarbanes' statement.\n  First of all, the substitute that Senator Sarbanes will offer is not \nlast year's bill. In fact, it is fundamentally different from last \nyear's bill on the most important issue in financial services \nmodernization. That issue is, should the modernization occur within the \nstructure of the bank, or should it occur through the holding company? \nLast year's bill followed the proposal which has been made and \nsupported by all of the members of the Federal Reserve Board and its \nChairman, Alan Greenspan, whereas this bill----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator isn't suggesting that I didn't lay out in \nthe course of my statement the fact that it differed in this respect \nfrom last year's bill, is he?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. I am simply making sure that everybody understands--\nbecause there were a lot of references made between last year's bill \nand this year's bill--that how someone voted last year is interesting \nand may, to some extent, be relevant, but on the fundamental issue that \nis before us, whether or not these new services should be provided \nwithin the bank or outside the bank in holding companies, the \nsubstitute which the Senator will offer later today is a very different \nbill from last year's bill. That is the only point I am making.\n  The second thing I will make clear is, I didn't object to the growth \nin CRA and the commitments made to CRA. I did make the point, however, \nthat when in a given year--in fact, last year--the loans, the \ncommitments to lend, the cash payments, and the commitments to pay cash \nin the future are bigger than the Canadian economy, bigger than the \ndiscretionary budget of the Federal Government, perhaps it is time to \nlook at potential abuses.\n  Now, granted, the Senator made the point that not every loan was made \nthis year, and not every cash payment was made this year. I was simply \nusing the data the way community groups presented it. I was very \ncareful to say that the $694 billion was loans, commitments to lend, \ncash payments, commitments to pay cash in the future. I stand by those \nnumbers, and those are the numbers of the community service groups.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Was the Canadian GNP figure the Senator was using a 1-\nyear figure or a 10-year figure?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It was a 1-year figure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There will be more agreements next year and next year and \nnext year. The point is, this has grown from a very small program into \na very big program. I believe, and the majority of the members of the \ncommittee believe, it is time to look at this program and look at \nabuses, and we are going to have plenty of time to debate this later.\n  Let me also note that, under current law, a bank is not required to \nget CRA approval to sell insurance. Under current law, there are a \nlimited number of banks that do have some insurance powers. They are \nnot required under current law to get CRA approval to engage in those \nsecurity powers.\n  Now, in terms of the CRA reforms in the bill reported by the Banking \nCommittee, those reforms have been endorsed by the American Bankers \nAssociation, by the Bankers Roundtable, and by the Independent Bankers \nAssociation of America. When our colleague says everybody is happy with \nthe provisions of his substitute, I want people to know that three \nmajor banking groups have endorsed the provisions of our bill.\n\n  Let me say again--and I don't know what you do to get people to use \nthe English language--there is not a safe harbor in this bill. A safe \nharbor is where something can't be challenged. There is a rebuttable \npresumption in the bill. There is a big difference between the two. The \nrebuttable presumption in the bill simply says that in order to stop or \ndelay a regulatory action, you have to present substantial evidence. \nThat substantial evidence is defined in law as more than a scintilla. \nIt is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might \naccept as adequate to support a claim.\n  That is not a safe harbor. That simply is giving the evaluation that \nhas occurred some standing.\n  Our colleague talks about comments. Nothing in the bill prevents \nanybody from commenting on any CRA evaluation. Comments can be made. \nPeople can submit any comments. All our provision says is, if a bank \nhas been in compliance for 3 years in a row, if they are currently in \ncompliance in their evaluation with CRA, if the regulator is going to \nstop the process or delay it, they have to have more than a scintilla \nof evidence. In order for the protest or objection to be used to stop \nthe process for a bank with a long history of compliance, there has to \nbe substantial evidence. People can comment all they want to comment. \nNothing in this provision prevents comments.\n  Finally--and we will have lots of time to debate these--in terms of \nunitary thrifts, unitary thrift holding companies are not a loophole. \nCongress legislated them. We end them in saying that you cannot do any \nmore, but to suggest that they are a loophole, an accident, that nobody \never intended they come into existence, they have existed for over 30 \nyears. We are not debating here whether or not we should stop the issue \nof new licenses to commercial interests to create ``new unitary \nthrifts.'' The question is, What do you do with people who already have \nthe charters? Do you change the rules of the game on them?\n  If our colleagues would indulge me, I yield to Senator Enzi.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, just a point of information, I presume we \nare going to adjourn at 12:30. Presumptively, that means Senator Enzi \nwould be the last speaker this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gramm). Let the Chair ask Senator Enzi, \ncould the Senator tell us how long he intends to speak?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I think I have about 7 or 8 minutes' worth \nand would be willing to stay for Senator Reed's comments as well.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 900, the Financial \nServices Modernization Act of 1999.\n  I commend the senior Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Mr. Gramm, for his leadership on this important measure, a \nbill that will increase global competitiveness of U.S. financial firms. \nIt will increase access to financial services for all Americans, and it \nwill decrease costs for consumers.\n  I congratulate Senator Gramm on his willingness to meet with all of \nthe different groups that have asked to meet with him, the way he has \nreached out and been willing to talk to people on both sides of the \naisle, as well as spend innumerable hours with those of us who have had \nquestions about some of the very detailed technical parts of the bill, \nparticularly the operating subsidiaries, for the research that he has \ndone. I compliment him on the simplification he has done. There were \nsome very complicated issues in last year's bill that, because of the \nend of the year pressure, were included but weren't very concise. They \nseemed to be misunderstood by people on both sides of whatever issue. \nOf course, around here there are more than two sides to every issue.\n  The chairman sat down with those people and worked out some \nsimplification of language that they say they agree with now. One of \nthe results is, it has reduced a 308-page bill to 150 pages without \ndamaging anything, but it has greatly increased the readability.\n  We have asked the banking industry and we have asked the agencies to \nput this in plain language. The chairman has done that and, I think, \ngiven people an opportunity to comment on it and discuss it with him in \nprivate meetings, if they wanted, as well as in other meetings. It is \nlong overdue that Congress pass legislation that will allow full and \nopen competition at least across the banking, securities and insurance \nindustries.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n  I believe now is the best time to pass S. 900 in order for U.S. \nfinancial intermediaries to be prepared for the challenges of the new \nmillennium. The current laws governing our financial sector have been \neroded by the actions of regulators, the decisions of the courts, the \ncontinuing changes in technology, and the increasing competitive global \nmarkets. In addition, these laws limit competition and innovation, thus \nimposing unnecessary costs onto the service provider, and that is \nultimately additional costs on the consumer.\n  There are several provisions in this bill I believe are particularly \nimportant as several of them are very relevant to small financial \ninstitutions.\n  Section 306 of the bill requires the Federal banking agencies to use \nplain language in all of their rulemakings used to implement this bill. \nSince this legislation will impact both large and small financial \ninstitutions, this provision will help ensure that small banks will not \nhave to hire several lawyers to interpret the new rules resulting from \nthis legislation.\n  The bill also requires the GAO to study expanded small bank access to \nS corporation status, specifically those provisions relating to Senator \nAllard's bill. I enthusiastically support his efforts to reduce the tax \nburden on small business corporations.\n  Additionally, this legislation grants non-metropolitan banks of less \nthan $100 million in assets--very small institutions by any standard--\nan exemption from the paperwork requirements of the Community \nReinvestment Act, or CRA. The total bank and thrifts assets exempt from \nthis requirement would equal only 3 percent. Small, non-metropolitan \nbanks and thrifts by their very nature must be responsive to the needs \nof the entire communities they serve or they will not remain in \nbusiness. The exemption in this bill will help reduce the regulatory \ncosts imposed on these smaller institutions. When less time is used to \ncomply with the letter of the law, more time can be devoted to comply \nwith the spirit of the law by better serving the needs of each customer \nand the entire community.\n  Title III of the bill also eliminates the Savings Association \nInsurance Fund (SAIF) special reserve, a top priority of the FDIC. \nSenator Johnson and I have introduced identical language in a stand \nalone bill, S. 377, to ensure that the special reserve is abolished. \nThis could save the thrift industry about $1 billion because the funds \nset aside in the special reserve cannot be used until the SAIF reaches \na dangerously low level. Therefore, if unforeseen circumstances impact \nthe SAIF, the FDIC may choose to increase insurance premiums on thrifts \nto recapitalize the SAIF. The elimination of the special reserve \nrepresents a sound public policy that will save the private sector from \nunnecessary costs.\n  I strongly support the approach the chairman of the Banking Committee \nhas taken to develop a more streamlined, less burdensome bill. It is \nonly 150 pages. The bill reported out of the Banking Committee last \nyear was 308 pages--double the length of the bill we are debating \ntoday. I do not believe more is usually better in terms of the length \nof a bill. Many times that policy means more hoops and ladders the \nprivate sector must go through, thus creating more inefficiencies and \nhigher costs in the marketplace. I believe the bill before us will not \nhamper industries with unnecessary, congressional-created, burdens and \ninefficiencies.\n  Before closing, I want to dispel some of the myths surrounding this \nlegislation--specifically the allegation that the majority in the \nBanking Committee have abandoned the consensus reached by the Committee \nlast year.\n  There is no consensus in the substitute bill sponsored by the \nminority members of the Banking Committee. The House Commerce Committee \nheld a hearing last week on H.R. 10, which is nearly identical to the \nsubstitute bill. Members on both sides of the isle were very critical \nof the bill. Ranking Member Dingell was especially harsh in his \ncriticism. I mention this to prove there is not consensus on the \nsubstitute bill.\n  Further, this substitute is not the product from last year. It \ndiffers in a number of respects from last year's bill, most \nsignificantly with regard to the operating subsidiary provisions. The \nop-sub provisions in the House bill and the minority's bill are those \nthat are causing significant heartburn for the House Commerce Committee \nand Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n  In addition, I want to set the record straight about the vote on the \nold H.R. 10 in Banking Committee last year. The bill did pass by a vote \nof 16 to 2. However, I for one can say that I support the bill we are \nnow debating, S. 900, much more than the H.R. 10 I reluctantly \nsupported last year. My biggest concern with that H.R. 10 was, and \ncontinues to be, the expansion of CRA.\n  It has been mentioned that with CRA there have been more loans, \nhouses and businesses. I suggest that, particularly with the time \nperiod that we are relating to, those are as a result of low interest \nrates, not some kind of effort that we are making under CRA.\n  I want to reiterate that there were 16,380 investigations into CRA, \nand three small banks were out of compliance. It takes an extra officer \nto handle CRA, and that is a huge cost to them. To find three people? \nThere has to be something better that we can do.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the bill passed by the \nBanking Committee. It represents a sensible approach to forming the \nfuture framework for our financial services industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate be \nextended for Senator Reed to give his remarks, followed by Senator \nSpecter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  At the conclusion of Senator Reed's remarks, Senator Specter will be \nrecognized, and at the conclusion of his remarks, we will adjourn for \nthe luncheons.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi for his graciousness in \noffering the unanimous consent request.\n  I want to begin by stating how important I think it is to pass \nfinancial service modernization legislation as quickly as possible.\n  The existing legal framework has become an anachronism over the last \nseveral years--in fact, even the last decade or so. The industry has \nresponded to changes in this market faster than the law has responded. \nIt is our obligation to ensure that we have appropriate legal \nstandards, so that our financial services industry can be competitive \nin a worldwide market, which is highly dynamic, and which requires more \nflexibility and more responsiveness than is inherent in the current \nsystem, which began under Glass-Steagall more than 60 years ago.\n  So I am a strong proponent of financial modernization. In fact, it is \nironic that we were very close in the last Congress to passing \nfinancial modernization legislation, which was agreed to by all the \nmajor interest groups and which represented a balancing of the need for \nflexibility, the need for new and expanded powers, the need for \nfinancial services industry to be able to reach across prior lines of \ndemarcation to the securities industry, banking industry and insurance \nindustry, and at the same time maintain the principles of safety and \nsoundness, and also the notion that we have to ensure community access \nto credit. All these things were carefully worked out. Yet, \nregrettably, H.R. 10 failed in the last few moments of the last \nCongress.\n\n  We are back today to begin to address these issues again on the floor \nof the Senate. That is an encouraging point because I think the worse \nthing to do would be to continue to delay and avoid this debate.\n  Having said that, let me also recognize that the current legislation \nwe are considering, S. 900, significantly deviates from the principles \nand the compromises that were carefully worked out in the last \nCongress. In so doing, I think it raises serious questions about the \nviability of this legislation, regardless of whether it will pass this \nbody or the other body. There is a strong question of whether it will \nultimately become law. It think it should become law and, as a result, \nI think we need to make changes in the form of amendments. In fact, \nunless we can deal with some of the issues, I am prepared to oppose \nthis legislation, even though I am strongly committed to ensuring that \nwe ultimately achieve a modernization of our financial services \nindustry.\n  The critical issues that face us with respect to this bill that are \ntroubling are, first, with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act. \nOver the last\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nseveral decades, since 1977, over $1 trillion in loans and loan \ncommitments have been made under the Community Reinvestment Act. It has \nliterally helped maintain and rehabilitate communities, both urban \ncenters and rural areas, throughout this country. Without it, this \nwould be literally a foreign issue, particularly in urban neighborhoods \nand rural areas. With it, we managed to spark hope and build new \ncommunities in places that were sadly lacking in significant \nopportunities and significant hope.\n  One example of the many in my State is in Woonsocket, RI. It was, at \nthe turn of the century, a thriving mill town. In fact, the river was \ncrowded with factory after factory after factory. With the demise of \nnorthern manufacturing, that town has seen difficult times. Through the \nCRA, citizens were able to avail themselves of significant assistance \nand credit when they formed the Woonsocket Neighborhood Development \nCorporation to work toward preserving the neighborhood. I have been \nthere. I have visited these neighborhoods. They are rebuilding old \nhomes that were built in the 1800s. They receive grants and loans from \nthe First National Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Boston, \nall under the auspices of CRA. Without these loans, they would not be \nable to rebuild their communities. It is necessary, it is important, \nand it can't be dismissed or short-circuited, as I fear S. 900 attempts \nto do.\n\n  One of the other provisions in the bill that specifically cuts back \non the scope and the effectiveness of CRA is the limitation exemption \nof CRA for rural financial institutions with assets under $100 million. \nWe all admit that a $100 million bank is a small institution. But such \nbanks represent 76 percent of rural banks in the United States, the \nvast majority of rural institutions. And these banks historically have \nthe lowest CRA ratings. They are a bank that, on their own volition, \naren't responsive going through the data to their local community, and \nby taking away the responsibility of CRA we will make this situation \nworse.\n  I think what we will do, in effect, is deny to many rural areas what \nthey think is part and parcel of the local bank in the community; that \nis, investment in their own community, in their own neighborhood. The \nreality of this is that people who run banks, which comes as no \nsurprise to anybody, want to make money. When they look around their \ncommunity and they see a loan for a community project, for housing \nredevelopment, or a local project to develop a community with a low \nrate of return, and yet they can see they can park their money \nsomeplace in a big city without CRA, the tendency, the temptation, and \nprobably the reality is they will send that money out of that \ncommunity.\n  It is the local money that forms the basis of these banks. CRA says \nyou have to look at the community, you have to invest in it, you have \nto care for it, and you have to commit to it, but you don't have to \nlose money. There is nothing in the CRA law that says you have to make \na bad loan. There is nothing in the CRA law that says you have to do \nsomething unsafe, unsound, or foolish in banking. It does say that you \nhave to look for appropriate lending opportunities in your community \nand make those commitments. That is what I think most people assume \nthat local community banks do day in and day out.\n  What I think will happen by the exemption is you will find in rural \nareas it will be harder to get the kind of credit for those types of \ncommunity projects, rebuilding of housing, small businesses that do not \nhave the kind of attraction or a track record yet to get the support of \nthe local banks. That is something I think would represent a further \ndemise in the community.\n  Then there is another provision, which has been referred to as \n``rebuttal of presumption'' by some and ``safe harbor'' by others, \nwhich is included in the legislation and which essentially says, if you \nhave a satisfactory CRA rating, you are presumptively in compliance \nwith respect to a proposed transaction unless someone can come forward \nwith ``substantial verifiable information'' that your rating is not \nwarranted.\n  First, you have to ask yourself, who outside of the bank would have \n``substantial verifiable information''? That is typically not in the \npublic domain. So you are setting up in this rebuttal of presumption, \nor safe harbor, an impossible task that outside community groups \nparticularly would be able to know the inner workings of the bank so \nwell that they could come in and present ``substantial verifiable \ninformation.'' So, in effect, what you are doing is saying, if we get \nyour satisfactory rating, we are not going to pay much attention to the \nCRA.\n\n  The practical reality is that in major transactions, the notion that \nCRA is a factor that prompts first these depository institutions to \nbehave better before the transaction and, certainly in contemplation of \nthe transaction, review carefully their commitment to their local \ncommunity, is one of the most effective and nonintrusive ways, because \nit doesn't represent the Government going in and directing lending or \ndirecting anything in a nonintrusive way if a bank responds to the \nneeds of the community, and to vitiate this by this rebuttal of \npresumption is, I think, a mistake.\n  One of the other aspects of this rebuttal of presumption is the fact \nthat 97 percent of the institutions have these satisfactory ratings, \nwhich could lead to the question of how thorough these reviews are by \nthe regulatory agencies in the first place.\n  It might add a further argument to the fact that perhaps it is only \nin the context of a serious review or serious questions raised by \noutside parties that banking institutions take their CRA \nresponsibilities seriously and, in fact, act upon them. But that is \nanother factor which I think we have to consider when we are talking \nabout dispensing with the opportunity to raise in a meaningful way CRA \nconcerns with respect to major transactions.\n  Frankly, everything we have read in the paper over the last several \nyears, several days, and several months has been about major \ntransactions between financial institutions. That has been the driving \nforce in the industry and, coincidentally, has helped the bank be more \ncommitted and more responsive to the CRA concerns, because they know \nthis is an item that can be looked at and challenged in a meaningful \nway in a transaction. If you dispense with that, I think that would be \na mistake.\n  There is another provision in the legislation which has been alluded \nto by the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, and that is essentially \nproviding very limited opportunities to conduct activities in a \nsubsidiary of a banking institution.\n  The bill as it stands today would establish a $1 billion asset cap on \nthose banks that may engage in underwriting activities for securities \nand merchant banking in an operating subsidiary. I believe that banks \nof any size should have the opportunity to form themselves in such a \nway that they feel most competitive in the marketplace with respect to \nthese two particular functions, securities underwriting and merchant \nbanking. Therefore, they can choose to put them in an affiliate holding \ncompany, which would be a Federal Reserve regulation, or in a \nsubsidiary of the depository institution which would be subject to the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n  I think giving that type of flexibility makes more sense than \ndetermining that ``one size fits all'' and all has to be done in the \ncontext of a holding company arrangement.\n  I offered last year, because of these views, an amendment to H.R. 10 \nwhich would have allowed banks to engage in securities underwriting and \nmerchant banking subsidiaries. I would anticipate another amendment \nwith respect to that. In fact, this language is in the alternative \nwhich Senator Sarbanes will offer later today, or which I would expect \nto be offered to try to reach this point. It is an important point. It \nis not just a point with respect to turf allocations between Federal \nregulators; it is an opportunity to give the banking industry the \nflexibility that all say they deserve.\n  There is another problem I see in the legislation. That is with \nrespect to the elimination, for all practical purposes, of prior \nFederal Reserve Board approval before allowing a bank to merge or \nengage in a new activity. This once again goes to the heart of the \nregulatory process.\n  It is nice to assume that banking institutions and financial \ninstitutions\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nare responsible and appropriate in their conduct of activities and that \nthey would only conduct a merger that would be in the best interests of \nnot only themselves but the public. But I think that sometimes strains \ncredulity.\n  It is appropriate, important and, in very practical ways, necessary \nto have the requirement for prior approval of these major transactions \nby the Federal Reserve Board, because the Federal Reserve Board has a \nrole independent of the management of the banks. They are trying to \nmaximize shareholder value; they are trying to be competitive in a very \ndifficult market.\n\n  But it is the Federal Reserve's responsibility to ensure safety and \nsoundness, that competition will not be adversely affected, and that \nthis transaction will in some way serve the public interest. I don't \nthink you can do that by implication. I don't think you can do that by \nchecking after the fact.\n  Again, the reality is that when multibillion-dollar institutions \nmerge and then discover after the fact that it really was a bad idea, \nit is hard to unravel those transactions. To do it right, you have to \ndo it up front. Therefore, this legislation should have prior approval \nby the Federal Reserve Board.\n  All of my comments have been appropriately addressed by the Democrat \nsubstitute, which will be offered by Senator Sarbanes.\n  Let me conclude with some specific concerns about a question that has \nconcerned me throughout the course of our debate not only in this \nCongress but in the last Congress. That is whether or not the \nregulatory framework we are creating will be sufficient to protect the \nsafety and soundness of institutions and ultimately protect the public \ninterest.\n  We are trying to expand opportunities, to break down the old \nhierarchies, the old barriers between different types of financial \nactivity, to give the kind of robust, dynamic opportunities that are \nconcomitant with this world of instantaneous transfer of information \nand billions of dollars across boundaries. In doing that, we have to \nrecognize our ultimate responsibility is to ensure these institutions \noperate safely, that they are sound, and that regulatory \nresponsibilities are discharged.\n  We expand dramatically the powers of these institutions under this \nlegislation. But in some respect we are inhibiting some of the \ntraditional regulatory roles of our Federal regulators. For example, in \nsection 114, there is a prohibition which prevents the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision from \nexamining a mutual fund operated by a bank or thrift. Currently, they \nhave limited authority to do such examinations. We are taking that \naway.\n  Section 111, another example, prohibits the Federal Reserve from \nexamining the securities or insurance affiliate unless there is a \n``reasonable cause to believe'' the affiliate is engaging in risky \nactivity. Ask yourself, how do you reasonably believe such activity is \ntaking place unless you have the opportunity and indeed the authority \nto at least go in and check periodically what is going on?\n  Many of these provisions might create a structure of regulation which \nis just too porous to withstand the kind of pressures that we see in \nthe financial marketplace. It is reasonable to conclude how we got \nhere. We have emphasized throughout this debate this notion of \nfunctional regulation, that securities should be regulated by the SEC, \ndepositories should be regulated exclusively by banking regulators, and \nthat a loose, overarching regulatory provision should be discharged by \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  Setting up compartments with a loose umbrella invites the notion that \nsomething will go wrong, something will fall through the cracks. As we \ngo through this process, the debate and the continued examination of \nthis bill, we have to ask ourselves not only before the legislation is \npassed but if it is passed afterwards, are there any unintended \nloopholes that could be exploited, unfortunately, which would be \ndetrimental to safety and soundness?\n  There is another provision which I think is important to point out. \nThat is the notion that in the context of the insurance business, State \ninsurance regulators basically have a veto over Federal Reserve \nauthority to demand that an insurance affiliate contribute to the State \nof a holding company. This is a reversal from the traditional authority \nand the traditional regulatory perspective of the Federal Reserve.\n\n  For years, since their active regulation of the Bank Holding Company \nAct, the doctrine of the Federal Reserve has been that the holding \ncompany is a source of strength to the underlying depository \ninstitution. That ``source of strength'' doctrine is, in part, repealed \nby this legislation, because within the context of an insurance \ncompany, and specifically the next great round of mergers will be \nbetween depository institutions and insurance companies--that is the \nexample that Travelers and Citicorp established when these insurance \ncompanies started merging together with banks, big banks, big insurance \ncompanies--we are going to have for the first time in our financial \nhistory, a situation where an insurance regulator can say to the \nChairman of the Fed, even though that depository institution is ailing \nmightily and my insurance company is very healthy, I'm not going to \nallow any transfer of funds from the insurance entity to the depository \ninstitution because I don't have to, one; and, two, I'm concerned about \nthe long-term viability of the insurance entity, so I will not \ncooperate.\n  What that means is that rather than the present model where every \nsubsidiary affiliate of a holding company contributes to the health of \nthe deposit insurance, we have a situation where the taxpayer, through \nthe insurance funds, will be bailing out a bank that very well might \nhave a very healthy insurance affiliate.\n  These are some of the regulatory examples which I think have to \ncontinue to be watched, examined, and thought about. I hope as we go \nforward that we could engage the Fed in a constructive dialog with \nrespect to their views on how we on a practical basis deal with some of \nthe concerns I raised today.\n  We have the potential of passing legislation which would be terribly \nhelpful to our financial community. I want to pass the legislation. \nUnless we resolve the issue of the Community Reinvestment Act, unless \nwe resolve the issue of operating subsidiaries, unless we look more \ncarefully and closely and make changes perhaps in some of the \nregulatory framework, this is not the legislation that ultimately can \nor should become law.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes its session, I believe it is now scheduled for 2:15--\nafter the party caucus break--Senator Wellstone be recognized to make \nhis opening statement. I think he thought that was the understanding \nbut we did not actually have a unanimous consent request. This has been \ncleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I compliment the Palestinian Authority \nfor not acting unilaterally to declare statehood. Chairman Yasser \nArafat visited me on March 23, and I urged him at that time not to make \na unilateral declaration of statehood. He then said to me that when the \nPalestinian Authority had changed its charter, as it was urged to do so \nby an amendment introduced by Senator Shelby and myself some years ago, \nthat there was no credit given for that. I said there should have been \ncredit given. And Chairman Arafat asked if they did not make the \nunilateral declaration if there would be some acknowledgment of that \nmove. I said I would take the floor when May 4 came, which was the date \ntargeted--that is today--and there was no unilateral declaration of \nstatehood. And there has been none.\n  I congratulate the Palestinian Authority for its restraint. That is a \nmatter which ought to be negotiated under the terms of the Oslo \nagreement. Chairman Arafat asked me if I would put it in writing that I \nwould make the statement. And I said I would; and I did.\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to him dated in March be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1999.\n     Chairman Yasser Arafat,\n     President of the National Authority, Gaza City, GAZA, \n         Palestinian National Authority.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you very much for coming to my \n     Senate hideaway and for our very productive discussion on \n     March 23rd.\n       Following up on that discussion, I urge that the \n     Palestinian Authority not make a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood on May 4th or on any subsequent date.

The Senate will continue consideration of S. \n900.\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be spending some time on S. 900, but I also, in \nmy remarks today, will be focusing on the question of when the Senate \nis going to start dealing with issues that affect ordinary citizens. I \nthink that is what people in Minnesota would like to know.\n  This is called the Financial Services Modernization Act. I have no \ndoubt that the large banks and lending institutions are all for this. \nThe question I have is, When are we going to come out here with \nlegislation that benefits ordinary citizens?--which I mean in a \npositive way. I will come back to this later on.\n  The Minnesota Farm Services Administration has now had to lay off \nclose to 60 employees. That is where we are heading. This is an agency, \nthe Farm Services Administration, that is a grassroots organization. \nThey are out there trying to serve farmers. They are out in the field. \nThey pick up on what is happening in rural Minnesota.\n  Right now the message we are sending here from the Congress is, we \ncan't even pass a supplemental appropriations bill that we started \nworking on several months ago to provide spring planting operating \nmoney for family farmers. Prices are way down. Income is way down. \nPeople are being foreclosed on. It is not just where they work, it is \nwhere they live. They are losing their farms, and we can't even get to \nthem some disaster relief money, some loan money, so they can continue \nto go on until we go back and change this ``Freedom to Fail'' bill that \nwe passed several years ago.\n  I am not telling you that some of the large conglomerates and some of \nthe large grain companies and some of the large packers aren't making \nrecord profits. They are. They have muscled their way to the dinner \ntable. They exercise raw political control over family farmers.\n  Meanwhile, this bill, the Financial Services Modernization Act, is \nall about consolidation and letting large financial institutions have \nunchecked power. But what we should be talking about is these family \nfarmers going under.\n  I talked with Tracy Beckman today, director of the Minnesota FSA \noffice. He told me that right now we have 340 loan requests, totaling \n$44.9 million, that are approved but are unfunded due to a lack of \nfunding. Right now there is the possibility, unless we get this \nfunding, that we are going to have 800 farm families in Minnesota that \naren't going to get any financing. They need that financing if they are \ngoing to be able to go on.\n  Yesterday Tracy Beckman told me the story of a family farmer who \nfound out he couldn't get any loan money and he doesn't have any cash \nflow. You can work 24 hours a day and be the best manager in the world, \nand you will not make it as a family farmer right now. He said to one \nof our FSA officers out in the field, out in the countryside, when he \nfound out that FSA can't help him because we are not able to pass a \nsupplemental emergency assistance program, this farmer said, ``I'm just \ngoing to go home and shoot myself and my family.''\n  This is someone who is desperate. There is a lot of desperation in \nthe countryside. We can't even pass a supplemental appropriations bill \nthat will get some loan money out to family farmers, which we should \nhave done a month ago or 6 weeks ago. Instead, we are out here on the \nfloor talking about the Financial Services Modernization Act of \n1999, the big bank act, the large conglomerate act, the large financial \ninstitution act. When are we going to be out here talking about \naffordable child care, or about raising the minimum wage? When are we \ngoing to make sure people get decent health coverage? When are we going \nto talk about providing more funding for the Head Start Program? When \nare we going to be out here talking about how to reduce violence in \nhomes, and in schools, and in our communities? When are we going to be \nout here talking about something that makes a difference to ordinary \npeople?\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand that all of the trade groups support \nthis legislation--that is to say, all of the financial services groups. \nBut I rise in strong opposition to this legislation called the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act of 1999.\n  This bill, S. 900, would aggravate a trend toward economic \nconcentration that endangers not only our economy, but, I think, more \nimportantly, it endangers our democracy. S. 900 would make it easier \nfor banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and, in some cases, \ncommercial firms, to merge into gigantic new conglomerates that would \ndominate the financial industry.\n  Mr. President, this is the wrong kind of modernization at the wrong \ntime. Modernization of the existing, confusing patchwork of laws, \nregulations, and regulatory authorities would be a good thing; but that \nis not what this legislation is really about. S. 900 is really about \naccelerating the trend toward massive consolidation in the financial \nsector.\n  This is the wrong kind of modernization because it fails to put in \nplace adequate regulatory safeguards for these new financial giants \nwhose failure could jeopardize the entire economy. It is the wrong kind \nof modernization because taxpayers could be stuck with the bill if \nthese conglomerates become ``too big to fail.'' We have heard that \nbefore--``too big to fail.''\n  This is the wrong kind of modernization because it fails to protect \nconsumers. In too many instances, S. 900 would lead to less competition \nin the financial industry, not more. It would result in higher fees for \nmany customers, and it would squeeze credit for small businesses and \nrural America. Most importantly, Mr. President, this is the wrong kind \nof modernization because it encourages the concentration of more and \nmore economic power in the hands of fewer and fewer people. The \nregulatory structure of S. 900, as well as the concentration it \npromotes, would wall off enormous areas of economic decisionmaking from \ndemocratic accountability.\n  Mr. President, this is the wrong time to be promoting concentration \nin the financial sector. S. 900 purports to update obsolete financial \nregulations, but\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nthe bill itself is already obsolete. This idea has been around for over \na decade. But economic circumstances have changed drastically in the \nintervening years. Today, much of the global economy is in crisis, and \nthis is no time to be promoting a potentially destabilizing \nconcentration of economic power.\n  The banking industry has become more and more concentrated over the \nlast 18 years, and especially during the 1990s. There have been 7,000 \nbank mergers since 1980. In the last year or so, we have seen \nmegamergers that are the largest in the history of American banking. \nThe merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica would have assets of $525 \nbillion, and the BancOne and First Chicago/NBD merger would have assets \nof $233 billion. In 1980, by comparison, there were no mergers or \nacquisitions of commercial banks with a total of more than $1 billion \nin assets.\n  What is new and different about the situation today is that banks are \nbeginning to merge with insurance and securities firms. The merger \nbetween one of America's largest banks, Citibank, and the largest of \ninsurance groups and brokerage groups, Travelers, is probably the best \nexample. This new conglomerate will control over $700 billion in \nassets.\n  Supporters of S. 900 argue that whether we like it or not, the lines \nbetween banking and securities--and the lines between banking and \ninsurance--have already been breached. Regulators and courts have \nalready let banks dabble more and more into securities and insurance, \nand they have let brokerages invade banking. The battle over Glass-\nSteagall has already been lost, they say.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am not so convinced. If S. 900 didn't \nencourage more and bigger mergers, I don't think so many big banks, big \ninsurance companies, and securities firms would be so enthusiastic \nabout it.\n  In fact, passage of S. 900 would set in motion a tidal wave of big \nmoney mergers. It would prompt other banks to start courting insurance \nand securities firms. And it would put increasing pressure on the banks \nof every size to find new partners. It may be true that we have already \ncome a long way down this road. It may be true that the protections of \nGlass-Steagall and the Bank Holding Company Act have already been \neroded. It is certainly true that we cannot turn back the clock.\n  But it does not necessarily follow that we are doomed to continue \ndown this perilous path wherever it may take us. Yes, regulators have \nalready given banks an inch, but it doesn't mean we have to give them a \nmile. If the old laws and regulations are inadequate to deal with the \nchanging world of finance, then we need better regulations, not weaker \nones. We should not be supplying the wrecking ball that tears down all \nremaining walls between banking and other risky activities, without \nfirst putting into place adequate safeguards.\n  Passing this bill would be an act of monumental hubris. It would \nreflect a smugness and complacency about our economic policy that I \nbelieve is unhealthy and unwarranted. We have heard the argument that \nAmerica has entered the new age, a ``new paradigm,'' a so-called ``new \neconomy.'' Depression and deflation are relics of a distant past. The \nold laws of ``boom and bust'' no longer apply. Our superior technology, \nso the argument goes, will allow us to sustain this economic recovery \nfor another 20 or 30 years, and maybe more. This is the beginning of a \nlong boom. Some have dared to imagine that we have arrived at the end \nof history.\n  There is a dangerous moral to this story: that we no longer have to \nprepare for emergencies or guard against disaster; that the safeguards \nput in place years ago to stabilize the economy can now be safely \nwithdrawn; that a safety net that will never again be tested by \nadversity can now be safely shredded; that we no longer need to worry \nabout inadequate oversight of markets because the markets can and will \npolice themselves; that bigger is better, antitrust is obsolete, and \nregulation is passe.\n  I think we are flirting with disaster. We are strolling casually \nalong the upper decks of the Titanic, oblivious to the dangers ahead of \nus. Remember, the Titanic in its day symbolized the ultimate triumph of \ntechnology and progress. Just like these new financial conglomerates, \nit was considered ``too big to fail.'' Because everybody assumed this \nflagship of Western technology was unsinkable, they saw no need to take \nordinary precautions. They disregarded the usual rules of speed and \nsafety, as Congress is now doing with S. 900. And they failed to store \nenough lifeboats for all the passengers, which reminds me of nothing so \nmuch as the repeal of the welfare entitlement.\n  Mr. President, that is another thing that maybe we should be talking \nabout on the floor of the Senate--what is happening with welfare \nreform. Later in my remarks, when I am talking about the real issues \nthat affect real people, and in particular poor people, I will return \nto that.\n  Some of the passengers in first class may be oblivious, but the world \neconomy is still in a precarious state. Most of Asia is still in a \ndepression. The Japanese economy is slugging through the 9th year of an \nunshakable slump. Russia has been mired in a depression for 8 years, \nits economy shrunk to half its former size. Brazil is entering into \nrecession, with serious implications for all of its Latin American \nneighbors. European economies are showing signs of weakness.\n  In the face of these sobering developments, the solution offered by \nthis legislation is simply more of the same--more deregulation, more \nmergers, more concentration. At precisely the moment when, for the \nfirst time in 50 years, we face some of the hazards that Glass-Steagall \nwas designed to contain, Congress wants to tear down the remaining \nfirewalls once and for all.\n  We seem determined to unlearn the lessons of history. Scores of banks \nfailed in the Great Depression as a result of unsound banking \npractices, and their failure only deepened the crisis. Glass-Steagall \nwas intended to protect our financial system by insulating commercial \nbanking from other forms of risk. It was designed to prevent a handful \nof powerful financial conglomerates from holding the rest of the \neconomy hostage. Glass-Steagall was one of several stabilizers designed \nto keep that from ever happening again, and until very recently it was \nvery successful. But now S. 900 openly breaches the wall between \nbanking and commerce.\n\n  And what about the lessons of the savings and loan crisis? The Garn-\nSt Germain Act of 1982 allowed thrifts to expand their services--people \nin the country will remember this--beyond basic home loans, and only \nseven years later taxpayers were tapped for a multibillion-dollar \nbailout. I'm afraid we're running the same kind of risks with this \nlegislation. S. 900 would lead to the formation of a wide array of \n``too big to fail'' conglomerates that might have to be bailed out with \ntaxpayer money. These financial holding companies may well be tempted \nto run greater risks, knowing that taxpayers will come to their rescue \nif things go bad.\n  S. 900 does set up firewalls to protect banks for failures of their \ninsurance and securities affiliates. But even Alan Greenspan has \nadmitted that these firewalls would be weak. And as the Chairwoman of \nthe FDIC has testified, ``In times of stress, firewalls tend to \nweaken.'' The economists Robert Auerbach and James Galbraith warn that \n``the firewalls may be little more than placing potted plants between \nthe desks of huge holding companies.''\n  Regulators will have little desire to stop violations of these \nfirewalls if they think a holding company is ``too big to fail.'' After \nthe stock market crash of 1987, for example, Continental Illinois \nbreached its internal firewalls to prop up a securities subsidiary. \nRegulators reprimanded Continental with a slap on the wrist.\n  And even if there is no taxpayer bailout, the Treasury Department has \nexpressed its concerns about unmet expectations. Investors and \ndepositors may assume protection is indeed much greater for these \nholding companies than it actually is. And they may panic when they \nrealize they were mistaken.\n  And what about the lessons of the Asian crisis? Just recently, the \nfinancial press was crowing about the inadequacies of Asian banking \nsystems. Now we are considering a bill that would make out banking \nsystem more like theirs. The much maligned cozy relationships between \nAsian banks,\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nbrokers, insurance companies and commercial firms are precisely the \nkind of crony capitalism S. 900 would promote.\n  The economists James Galbraith and Robert Auerbach warn against \nrepeating the mistakes of the Asian economies: ``There is already \nevidence of monopolistic practices in the banking industry that would \nbe heightened by [S. 900]. There is now devastating experience from the \nrecent problems experienced by huge banking-finance conglomerates in \nAsia. There is little justification to follow these examples, as would \nbe allowed by [S. 900]. It could happen here if we build the same \nunwieldy structures to dominate our banking system.''\n  To be accurate, if we want to locate the real causes of the Asian \ncrisis, we have to look at the reckless liberalization of capital \nmarkets that led to unbalanced development and made these economies so \nvulnerable to investor panic in the first place. The IMF and other \nmultilateral institutions failed to understand how dangerous and \ndestabilizing financial deregulation can be without first putting \nappropriate safeguards in place.\n  World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote last year about the \nAsian crisis:\n\n       The rapid growth and large influx of foreign investment \n     created economic strain. In addition, heavy foreign \n     investment combined with weak financial regulation to allow \n     lenders in many Southeast Asian countries to rapidly expand \n     credit, often to risky borrowers, making the financial system \n     more vulnerable. Inadequate oversight, not over-regulation, \n     caused these problems. Consequently, our emphasis should not \n     be on deregulation, but on finding the right regulatory \n     regime to reestablish stability and confidence.\n\n  That is World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz. We claim to have \nlearned our lessons from the crisis in Asia. But I am not sure we have.\n  Tell me why on Earth are we doing this, besides the fact that these \nlarge financial institutions have so much political power? Why now?\n  The backers of S. 900 claim that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and \nthe Bank Holding Act of 1956 are obsolete and financial regulation must \nbe modernized. Well, I'm all for modernization. But the question is: \nwhat kind of modernization?\n  I think most of us agree that the existing patchwork of confusing and \ninconsistent regulations needs to be simplified and rationalized. GAO \nhas testified that the piecemeal approach to deregulation taken by the \nFed and Treasury has resulted in ``overlaps, anomalies, and even some \ngaps'' in oversight.\n  The problem is that S. 900 doesn't really fix that problem. It \nmaintains a patchwork of regulators. Who knows how they would \ncoordinate their efforts when holding companies run into trouble?\n  But most importantly, the reach of S. 900's regulatory safeguards \ndoes not match the size of these new conglomerates. A central feature \nof S. 900 is the transfer of regulatory authority for the newly created \nholding companies to the Federal Reserve. This seems a lot more like \nderegulation than modernization.\n  Let me repeat that. A central feature of S. 900 is the transfer of \nregulatory authority for the newly created holding companies to the \nFederal Reserve. This sounds a lot more like deregulation than \nmodernization.\n  How much confidence can we have in the Fed's oversight? The case of \nLong Term Capital Management last year does not exactly inspire \nconfidence. Only one week before that $3.5 billion bailout, Alan \nGreenspan testified before Congress that the risk of hedge funds was \nwell under control and that bankers policing them knew exactly what \nthey were doing. Well, in this case at least, they didn't know what \nthey were doing. And apparently neither did the Fed.\n  What concerns me more is that this massive transfer of power is anti-\ndemocratic. The Federal Reserve Board is not an elective body, and it's \nnot democratically accountable. To the extent Congress pries into the \nFed's business--which is not very much--we focus on monetary policy, \nnot bank oversight. Why should we hand over so much power to an \ninstitution that is essentially accountable to the financial industry \nand nobody else?\n  I repeat that. Why should we hand over so much power to an \ninstitution that is essentially accountable to the financial industry \nand nobody else?\n  James Galbraith and Robert Auerbach write:\n\n       The Federal Reserve's decision-making is contingent to a \n     great extent on the banking industry which it regulates. \n     Bankers elect two-thirds of its 108 directors on the boards \n     directors of its 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. This \n     25,000 employee bureaucracy with its own budget that is not \n     authorized or approved by the Congress is not independent of \n     the bankers and finance companies that it would regulate.\n\n  Several commentators have expressed open delight that this transfer \nof power to the Fed will insulate financial regulation from ``partisan \npolitics.'' The Christian Science Monitor endorsed H.R. 10 last year \nbecause ``it would make financial regulation more remote from \npolitics.''\n  But is this really something we should welcome? Another term for \n``partisan politics'' in this case is ``democracy.'' Democracy may be \nmessy sometimes. It would be vastly improved by real and meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. But it also happens to be the basis of our \nform of government.\n  Why should such an important area of public life be ``insulated'' \nfrom democratic accountability? Why should the people making the most \nimportant economic decisions in our country be accountable only to Wall \nStreet and not to voters?\n  Why are we transferring this kind of authority?\n  We've already walled off most economic decisionmaking from any kind \nof democratic input. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has argued \nthat we no longer have any fiscal policy to speak of, and Congress has \ndelegated monetary policy to the Federal Reserve. ``The Fed, the IMF, \nand the Treasury are staffed by skilled economists,'' he wrote, ``but \ncan we be sure that the choices they make are the right ones in the \neyes of most of the people whose lives are being altered by them?'' He \nhas noted that ``One reason governments exist is to insure that \neconomies function for the benefit of the people, and not the other way \naround.'' Already, decisions about interest rates and desirable rates \nof unemployment--decisions that will decisively impact the lives of \nmillions of Americans--are beyond the reach of democracy. They are \nreserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of unelected bankers.\n\n  What does it mean, as a practical matter, for supervision of the \nfinancial sector to be protected from democratic accountability? The \ncontents of S. 900 itself should give us a pretty good idea. For whose \nbenefit is this legislation being passed? In the long debate over this \nlegislation, there has been a lot of talk about the conflicting \ninterests of bankers, insurance companies, and brokers, but very little \ndiscussion of the public interest.\n  Financial services firms argue that consolidation is necessary for \ntheir survival. They claim they need to be as large and as diversified \nas foreign firms in order to compete in the global marketplace. But the \nU.S. financial industry is already dominant across the globe and in \nrecent years has been quite profitable. I see no crisis of \ncompetitiveness.\n  Financial firms also argue that consolidation will produce \nefficiencies that can be passed on to consumers. But there is little \nevidence that big mergers translate into more efficiency or better \nservice. In fact, studies by the Federal Reserve indicate just the \nopposite. There is no convincing evidence that mergers produce greater \neconomic efficiencies. On the contrary, they often lead to higher \nbanking fees and charges for small businesses, farmers, and other \ncustomers. Bigger bankers offer fewer loans for small businesses. And \nother Fed studies have shown that the concentration of banking squeezes \nout the smaller community banks.\n  S. 900 reflects the same priority of interest promoted by financial \nconsolidation itself. A provision designed to ensure that people with \nlower incomes can have access to basic banking services has been \nstripped out. Let me repeat that. A provision designed to ensure that \npeople with lower incomes can have access to basic banking services has \nbeen stripped out. This provision was to address the growing problem \nthat banking services are beyond the reach of millions of Americans. \nAccording to U.S. PIRG, the average cost of a checking account is $264 \nper year, a major obstacle to opening a checking\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\naccount for low-income families. These families have to rely instead on \nusurious check-cashing operations and money order services.\n  I don't see much protection for consumers in S. 900 either. Banks \nthat have always offered safe, federally insured deposits will have \nevery incentive to lure their customers into riskier investments. Last \nyear, for example, NationsBank paid $7 million to settle charges that \nit misled bank customers into investing in risky bonds through a \nsecurities affiliate it set up with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.\n  S. 900 makes nominal attempts to address these and other problems. \nBut in the end, I am afraid this bill is an invitation to fraud and it \nis an invitation to abuse.\n  Finally, the impact of S. 900 on the Community Reinvestment Act is a \ncause of real concern. I thank my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, for his \ntremendous leadership in making sure that we protect community \nreinvestment as a part of his substitute legislation. CRA has been an \neffective financial tool for the empowerment and growth of our \ncommunities for over 20 years. Despite this success, CRA is now in \ngreat danger. Why? Because S. 900 is a legislative package of deals and \nfavors aimed to please Wall Street, certainly not Main Street. It is \nnot good for small business, not good for low-income families, not good \nfor rural America, not good for our neighbors or our communities.\n  Within this bill are three substantial provisions intended to \n``modernize'' financial services by rolling back the Community \nReinvestment Act. But that will only encourage discrimination and \npromote economic despair.\n  We need to ask ourselves a very important question: Are we willing to \nturn the clock back and abandon the Community Reinvestment Act? Are we \nwilling to return to the days before 1977 when banks could freely \ndiscriminate against neighbors, farms, small towns, and other \nunderserved populations, just because they were viewed as less \nprofitable customers?\n\n  We need to keep the doors open for families, seniors, farmers, small \nbusinesses, for consumers to access credit so they can realize their \ndream to own a home or start a business. We need to keep the doors open \nfor community groups, for cities and towns to access credit to \nrevitalize impoverished neighborhoods or to restore once abandoned \nbuildings. We need to keep CRA strong because we all benefit from \ncommunity reinvestment.\n  CRA establishes a simple rule--that depository institutions must \nserve the needs of the communities in which they are chartered. In a \nsafe and sound manner, they form partnerships with groups and consumers \nto provide lending to those denied credit. In a safe and sound manner, \nbanks work with families looking to achieve their dream of owning a \nhome. In a safe and sound manner, banks lend to small businesses to \nhelp them grow. In a safe and sound manner, banks lend to farmers who \nfall on hard times and need some extra help to survive falling \ncommodity prices.\n  For many consumers, CRA has been a lifesaver. To deny the positive \nimpact CRA has made in improving the economic health of our country is \nsimply to deny the facts. The CRA has delivered an estimated $1 \ntrillion or more for affordable homeownership and community \ndevelopment. The role of CRA is not just to benefit the most \nimpoverished neighborhoods in our States; rather, CRA cuts across class \nlines, race lines, gender lines, practically every hurdle to \ndiscrimination, to promote economic stability for families, small \nfarmers, and communities. This legislation in its present form begins \nto take all that away.\n  What is my proof? According to the statistics collected by the Local \nInitiative Support Corporation, or LISC, in 1997 the Home Mortgage \nDisclosure Act data showed that lending to minority and low-income \nborrowers is on the rise. For example, since 1993 the number of home \nmortgage loans to African Americans increased by 58 percent; to \nHispanics, by 62 percent; and to low- and moderate-income borrowers by \n38 percent--well above the overall market.\n  In 1997, large commercial banks made $18.6 billion in community \ndevelopment investments. In 1997, banks and thrifts subject to CRA's \nreporting requirements made two-thirds of all the small business loans \nmade that year. More than one-fifth of those loans were made to small \nbusinesses and low- and moderate-income communities.\n  Each time I return to Minnesota, I am convinced that CRA is working. \nEarly this year, I had a chance to present an award to a family who had \nachieved their dream of becoming homeowners. Rene and Gloreen Cabrarra \nwere the 750th family to purchase their home through an innovative \npartnership between the community group ACORN and a local bank. Rene \nand Gloreen had to move out of their apartment when it was condemned \nfor repair problems. As a result, they moved in with other family \nmembers. The Cabrarras began working with the community group ACORN in \nthe Twin Cities and were soon able to obtain a special low-income loan \nto buy their home, thanks to a CRA agreement between that community \ngroup and that bank in that metro area. There is no doubt that CRA has \nbenefited Rene and Gloreen. As a result, they are now proud homeowners \nliving in the Phillips neighborhood.\n  From the nearly 170 mayors who have signed their name in support of \nthe progress CRA has made in their communities, there is tremendous \nsupport. From family farm and rural organizations who see access to \ncredit as being essential tools for their small communities, there is \ntremendous support. A story of empowerment can be shared by every group \nworking for the advancement of their rights.\n  Despite this undeniable success, the CRA is under attack. S. 900 \nwould begin to dismantle its effectiveness in the communities where it \nhas been most beneficial. Specifically, I will speak to two anti-CRA \nprovisions in S. 900.\n  First, S. 900 creates a safe harbor for banks that have maintained a \nsatisfactory CRA rating for 3 consecutive years. This provision would \npractically eliminate the opportunity for public comment on the CRA \nperformance of a bank at the time of a merger application. Banks that \nhave received a satisfactory or better CRA rating for 3 years \nconsecutively would be deemed in compliance and therefore freed from \nthe requirement of public comment on their application.\n  Public comment on a proposed merger is an especially useful tool in \nthe case of large banks serving a variety of markets. In such cases, \nregulators examine only a portion of these markets to evaluate a bank's \nCRA rating. Since performance in small communities is weighted less \nthan in larger areas, public comment sometimes provides the only means \nto truly examine the commitments of a bank to all of its community \nmembers. Simply put, public comment is a chance for community groups \nand consumers to bring to light important information and facts that \nmay have been overlooked during the review process.\n  However, this avenue for public involvement in the merger process is \nseriously undercut by S. 900's safe harbor provision. The only way a \ncitizen could exercise his or her democratic rights would be to find \n``substantial verifiable information'' of noncompliance since the \nmerging bank's last CRA examination. This is a very high burden. An \nestimated 95 percent of all banks are deemed CRA compliant. As a \nresult, the vast majority of mergers would be exempted from public \ncomment.\n  Some have justified this undemocratic safe harbor as a way to prevent \nextortion by community groups during the merger review process. Mr. \nPresident, in August 1998, I wrote a letter to the Federal Reserve \nrequesting a public hearing on the proposed merger between Norwest \nCorporation, based in Minnesota, and Wells Fargo Company. I \nspecifically requested that special attention be paid to the possible \neffects that this merger would have on the people and the communities \nwho rely on Norwest's services and community participation across the \nState. I ask my colleagues, Was this extortion?\n  I was not the only elected official to request such a hearing. A \nCongressman, a State representative, and various community groups did \nas well. Were they guilty of extortion?\n  The 2-day hearing opened the doors for 70 different groups and \nindividuals to publicly comment on the strengths and weaknesses of both \nNorwest and Wells Fargo with regard to community involvement. \nRepresentatives from the Navajo Nation, statewide nonprofit\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nhousing organizations, and microcredit lending organizations that \nprovide a lifeline to small businesses, all had their chance to be \nheard. They had their chance to publicly challenge these merging \nentities to remain involved in their communities. Did this constitute \nextortion?\n  No one was practicing extortion by requesting a public hearing on the \nmerger between these two financial giants. No elected officials or \nnonprofits were doing anything improper when they publicly commented on \nthe lending practices of these two banks. What these 70-plus groups and \nindividuals were practicing was democracy.\n  Using S. 900, citizens would be deprived of these democratic rights \nunless they could ``substantially verify'' a merging bank's \nnoncompliance. That is not just undemocratic, it is unjust. At least \nthe Daschle-Sarbanes amendment would retain the consumers' democratic \nright to participate in the process.\n  The second anti-CRA provision in S. 900 is the small bank exemption. \nThis provision would exempt banks in rural communities with assets of \nless than $100 million from CRA requirements. In fact, it would exempt \n63 percent of all banks from the requirements of CRA. It would send a \nclear message to farmers, to small businesses, and to consumers in \nsmall towns that they do not have the same rights to access credit as \nconsumers who live in urban areas.\n  Some of my colleagues would argue that small banks in rural \ncommunities do not need CRA. Why? They claim that small banks by their \nnature serve the credit needs of local communities. But CRA compliance \nrecords will tell you a different story.\n  More importantly, rural America is facing an economic crisis. Family \nfarms are disappearing one by one from this country's rural landscape. \nMany rural communities are in great need of access to credit before \ntheir economies collapse. This anti-CRA provision completely ignores \nthe realities and needs of rural America.\n\n  According to a recent SBA (Small Business Administration) report, \nJune 1998 data show a 4.6-percent decline in the number of small farm \nloans. That June 1998 data also reveals that the value of very large \nfarm loans, over 1 million, has increased by 25 percent, while small \nfarm loans under $250,000 increased by only 3.9 percent. As family farm \nand rural community organizations have concluded, larger loans are \ngoing to fewer farmers.\n  According to a similar study conducted by the State of Wisconsin, \nfarming operations were more likely to obtain a loan if they were under \ncontract with an agribusiness. Small and independent farmers faced \ngreater difficulty accessing the necessary credit to remain in \noperation.\n  To quote an April 29 letter signed by 19 organizations representing \nthe interests of farmers in rural communities:\n\n       Rural areas continue to suffer from a serious shortage of \n     affordable housing. Farmers are facing the worst financial \n     conditions in more than a decade due to declining commodity \n     prices. Rural Americans continue to need the tools of the CRA \n     to ensure accountability of their local lending institutions. \n     CRA helps to meet the credit demand of millions of family \n     farmers, rural residents, and local businesses.\n\n  In a March 24 letter to Senators, the National Farmers Union also \nsent the message that rural America needs the CRA just as much as our \nurban centers. To quote the letter from President Leland Swenson:\n\n       The Community Reinvestment Act prohibits redlining, and \n     encourages banks to make affordable mortgage, small farm, and \n     small business loans. Under the impetus of CRA, banks and \n     thrifts made $11 billion in farm loans in 1997. CRA loans \n     assisted small farmers in obtaining credit for operating \n     expenses, livestock and real estate purchases. Low- and \n     moderate-income residents in rural communities also benefited \n     from $2.8 billion in small business loans in 1997.\n\n  In 1999, access to credit is tighter than usual, making it critical \nto maintain the CRA.\n  For many consumers living in rural communities, having access to \ncredit is having access to a future. Our rural communities need CRA \nbecause they can depend on little else in today's agricultural markets.\n  I am strongly opposed to the small bank exemption in S. 900 because I \nhave witnessed firsthand the important role CRA plays in rural \ncommunities in Minnesota. At least the Sarbanes-Daschle amendment would \nremove this harmful provision from the bill.\n  We need to ask ourselves, do we really intend to return to the old \nbanking practices of red lining? Do we want to leave our cities, small \ntowns, and families without a means to become economically stable and \nstrong? Do we intend to draw a clear line between the haves and have-\nnots?\n  It has been nearly 3 years since the passage of welfare reform. Since \nthen, urban and rural America has seen a dramatic rise in the numbers \nand needs of the desperately poor.\n  Mr. President, that is right. Since then, we have seen a dramatic \nrise in the number and needs of the desperately poor. Why are we not \ntalking about other issues on the floor of the Senate? I will get back \nto this in a little while.\n  What does that have to do with CRA? Everything. Because of CRA, \nnonprofit organizations that assist the homeless are able to establish \npartnerships with banks to access credit and build affordable and \nemergency long-term housing. CRA loans that develop dilapidated \nneighborhoods and bring more jobs to our urban centers benefit former \nwelfare recipients. Over $1 trillion has been invested with innovative \nways of providing housing, jobs, and community revitalization to \nstabilize these economically troubled areas.\n  CRA has been a mainstream banking practice for over 20 years. It has \nevolved over the years to better serve banks and their communities, and \nit has been streamlined to reduce the regulatory burden on small banks. \nThis is a law that has been improved and has grown to better serve \nbanks and consumers.\n  A lot of big banks don't like the CRA. They feel it is an imposition. \nThey denounce it as big government and overregulation. But for most \npeople I ask, Which is the greatest danger here, concentration of \npolitical power in government or concentration of economic power? I \ndon't think it is a close call.\n  I think our goal should be to help ordinary people make sure they \nhave some say over the economic decisions that affect their lives. \nRepealing CRA is not going to do that. No amount of antigovernment \nrhetoric is going to do that. But enforcing some meaningful consumer \nprotections would do that. So would prohibiting mergers that threaten \nto crowd out community banking, squeeze credit for small businesses, \nand open the door to higher fees and ever more fraud and abuse.\n  This is the fundamental problem with deregulation and economic \nconcentration generally. It allows the Nation's economic power to be \nheld in the hands of fewer and fewer people. The same thing is \nhappening in many of our other major industries, including airlines, \nelectric utilities, and communications.\n  Ben Bagdikian has noted that 20 corporations and multinationals own \nmost of the major media in the entire country--newspapers, magazines, \nradio, television and publishing companies. In the 2 years since the \nCongress eased restrictions on ownership of radio, 4,000 stations have \nbeen sold--in the last 2 years--and more than half of all big-city \nstations are in the hands of just five companies.\n  The electric utility industry is already consolidating in expectation \nthat the States and Congress will soon mandate retail competition. And \n4,500 corporate mergers were announced in the first 6 months of last \nyear, with the combined value of $1.7 trillion. These include SBC and \nAmeritech, Chrysler and Daimler Benz, Enron and PGE, Monsanto and \nAmerican Home Products, Worldcom and MCI, and Columbia and HCA \nHealthcare. Now we hear about mergers between BP and Amoco, Mobil and \nExxon, and on and on.\n  Pretty soon we are going to have three financial service firms in the \ncountry, four airlines, two media conglomerates, and five energy \ngiants.\n  Mr. President, this is absolutely amazing to me, which is why I have \nspent some time making the case. We see more consolidations here. We \nsee a dangerous concentration of power in telecommunications--that is \nthe flow of information in democracy--and the same thing in energy, the \nsame thing with health insurance companies.\n  In agriculture it is absolutely unbelievable--absolutely \nunbelievable. Everywhere family farmers look you have these \nconglomerates that have muscled\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\ntheir way to the dinner table, exercising their raw economic and \npolitical power over family farmers, over consumers, and I might add, \nover taxpayers as well.\n  Joel Klein came out to Minnesota, along with Mike Dunn, who heads the \nPackers and Stockyard Administration in the USDA, for a very dramatic \npublic hearing in our State just a couple of Sundays ago. Let me tell \nyou, you have these hog producers that are facing extinction, and then \nyou have these packers that are in hog heaven. You have your grain \nfarmers going under; and you have Cargill making a 52-percent profit in \nthis past year.\n  The farmers are saying, ``What is going on here? Consumers aren't \ngetting a break. And we're not getting the prices that enable us to \neven keep going on with our farming. Who is making the money?'' \nEverywhere you see this concentration of power. I will have an \namendment on this bill later on that will talk about antitrust action.\n  Antitrust action has been taken off the table. Antitrust action has \nbeen taken off the table. This is a classic example of why we need \nreform. Because when it comes to antitrust action, and having the \nSenate say we are on the side of consumers, we are on the side of \nfamily farmers, we are on the side of community people, and we are \nwilling to take on these huge companies, we dare not do that. These \nmonopolies are the campaign givers. These are the heavy hitters. These \nare the investors.\n  We have been through this before, Mr. President. At the end of the \nlast century, industrial concentration accelerated at an alarming pace. \nLots of people, including the columnist and author E.J. Dionne, former \nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the philosopher, Michael Sandel, have \nnoted the similarities between that era and our own.\n  American democracy suffered as a result of that concentration of \neconomic power. The two parties became dominated by similar corporate \ninterests. Their platforms started to sound an awful lot alike, and \nvoter participation declined dramatically. Why? Because people realized \nthat they had little to say in the economic decisions that most \naffected their lives.\n  I think that aptly describes the situation today. I tell you, when I \ntravel in Minnesota or travel in the country, one of the things that \npeople say to me is that they think both parties are controlled by the \nsame investors. They do not think there is any real opportunity for \nthem to have any say anymore in this political process.\n  And once again, we are about to pass a piece of legislation --I hope \nwe do not, but if we do--a piece of legislation that will lead to the \nrapid consolidation in the financial services industry, to the \ndetriment of rural America, to the detriment of small towns, to the \ndetriment of low- and moderate-income people, and to the detriment of \nworking families. But there is an awful lot of economic and political \nclout behind this bill.\n\n  And what is in store for us if we allow this trend to continue? Huge \nfinancial conglomerates the size of Citigroup will truly be ``too big \nto fail.'' Government officials and Members of Congress will be prone \nto confuse Citigroup's interests with the public interest, if they do \nnot already. I think they do already.\n  What happens when one of these colossal conglomerates decides, for \nexample, it might like to turn a profit by privatizing Social Security? \nWho is going to stand in their way? That is a trick question, of \ncourse, because we already face that dilemma today. But I contend that \nthe economic concentration resulting from passage of S. 900 would only \nmake that problem worse.\n  In a sense, then, campaign finance is only a symptom of a larger \nproblem. By all means, we should drive money out of politics. \nAbsolutely, we should. But even if we succeed, the trend towards \neconomic concentration will diminish the value of democratic \ndecisionmaking. If few or none of the most important economic decisions \nare made democratically, or are even subject to democratic \naccountability, what is the point of voting? Indeed, these developments \nraise important and fundamental questions about the role of democracy \nitself.\n  It used to be that these questions were a source of concern for many \npeople. And they were a hot topic for political debate. Thomas \nJefferson and Andrew Jackson warned not only against the concentration \nof political power, but also against the concentration of economic \npower.\n  The great Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis railed against the \n``Curse of Bigness.'' Brandeis argued that industrial concentration \ncoarsened the value of democracy by diminishing the role of individuals \nin economic decisions. We should not let that debate die. It is a vital \npart of our democratic heritage.\n  There may be some colleagues who share these concerns but will \nnonetheless vote for S. 900. They say this is the best we can do. They \nsay the damage has already been done, and concentration will continue \nwith or without this legislation.\n  I disagree. I think we need to take a good look at this. Before we \nconsider sweeping changes in our financial services laws, we had better \nunderstand the effects of the latest wave of mergers. The true test of \nthese new combinations will be the impact of the next recession. We \nneed to see how these megamergers hold up before proceeding any \nfurther.\n  There is simply no justification or excuse for this kind of \ninvitation to bigness before a solid, updated regulatory system can be \nput in place. I believe this legislation is an enormous mistake. It is \nnot necessary. And it could do real harm to the economy. It should be \nsoundly defeated. It should be soundly rejected.\n  Mr. President, with due respect to my colleagues, while I have the \nfloor I want to argue one other case. And I say to both the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Utah, I will not dominate the whole \nafternoon, but I do want to make one other argument. And it is this: I \ndo not understand why we are on the floor dealing with this \nlegislation. I do not really understand why we are dealing with--what \nis it called--the Financial Services Modernization Act.\n  When I talk to people in cafes in Minnesota, they do not talk to me \nabout the Financial Services Modernization Act at all. As a matter of \nfact, I will tell you something. If you spend a little bit of time with \npeople, most people will say--and both of my colleagues, the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Utah will be happy to hear the first \npart of what they say, and maybe not as happy to hear the second part. \nIf you do a poll and ask them, ``Are you a liberal or a conservative,'' \nat the Town Talk Cafe in Willmar, which is my focus group--and that is \nthe name of the cafe--I would say 75 percent of the people say they are \nconservative. They do.\n  But you know what? If you stick around and talk to people for a \nwhile, they do not like the way in which these big banks have taken \nover financial services and have driven out the community banks. And \nthey do not like these big insurance companies that are dominating \nhealth insurance. And they do not like how these conglomerates are \ndriving family farmers out. And they do not like the concentration in \ntelecommunications. And they do not like to see the merger of the \nenergy companies. And they are not all that happy with Northwest \nAirlines that basically dominates about 75 percent of the flights in \nthe State of Minnesota.\n  Those people in the cafes of Minnesota have a healthy skepticism \nabout bigness. They have a healthy skepticism about a piece of \nlegislation that leads to dangerous consolidation, and basically leaves \nthe economic decisionmaking, that can make or break the lives of \nfamilies and communities and neighbors, in a few hands. They are right. \nMore importantly, one more time, I just want to sound this alarm, which \nis why I am going to talk a little bit more here. We have a situation \nin my State of Minnesota right now which I can only define as \ndesperate.\n\n  I have spoken at enough farm gatherings. I spoke first, it was a farm \ngathering in northwest Minnesota, Crookston. Then there was a farm \ngathering that I spoke at in Worthington. Then there was a farm \ngathering in Sioux Falls, SD. Then there was a farm gathering in Sioux \nCity, IA. Every time I spoke at those gatherings--and there were 500, \n600, 700, several thousand farmers--I looked out\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nthere and I saw the pain in the faces of family farmers.\n  I see the pain in the faces of those family farmers as I am in this \nChamber for two reasons: First of all, on the long-term front, these \nfamily farmers can't make it without a decent price. They want to know \nwhat we are going to do about getting farm income up. Why aren't we \ntalking about farm income today? Why aren't we doing something about \nagriculture?\n  They want to talk about when there is going to be antitrust action. \nThey want to talk about who is going to be on their side, not on \nCargill's side or IBP's side or Monsanto's side. They want to talk \nabout whether or not there is going to be some protection for them so \nthey have a chance to make it.\n  These family farmers also want to know why in the world we can't get \nemergency assistance to them as a part of the emergency supplemental \nbill. They thought 2 months ago we were going to do it, but we didn't. \nWe left and went home for spring break. Now we are back. I say to the \nmajority party, get that supplemental bill out here on the floor and \npass it. How can we hold this bill up? There was supposed to be a \nseparate ag supplemental bill. But I think it was tied to Central \nAmerican assistance. I think they went together.\n  It should be passed out of here, because, one more time, the \nMinnesota FSA is laying off its employees. You might say, so what, a \nbunch of bureaucrats. Not so. This is a grassroots organization, with \npeople out in the farmland providing people with credit, as a lender of \nlast resort, with more and more demand as farm prices are down, farmers \nare facing foreclosure, trying to get out there and plant, and they do \nnot have the loan money. This is a demoralized agency, and they are \nletting people go.\n  As I said earlier, we are going to have, on the present course, at \nleast 800 farmers who aren't going to get any financing at all. They \nare going to go under. That is a real emergency supplemental bill.\n  I am tempted, while I have the floor, to speak for a while about \nthis, because it seems to me that we ought to be doing something about \nthis and we ought to be doing something about it right now. The \nFinancial Services Modernization Act--I have to write this down--the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act does not mean a thing to them. The \nFinancial Services Modernization Act does not mean a thing to these \nfamily farmers. They want this Congress to pass that supplemental bill \nbecause for them time is not neutral. Time marches on. If they do not \nget any assistance, they are going to go under. These are hard-working \npeople. I think it is just simply unconscionable. I am not just talking \nabout the Financial Services Modernization Act. I think it is \nunconscionable that any piece of legislation go forward on the floor of \nthe Senate until we do something about this.\n  It is absolutely unbelievable; it really is.\n  I mentioned a story earlier. I see there are people in the Chamber \nwho are watching the debate--or at least watching one person speak. I \nhave a hard time giving people a feel for the gloom that is out there. \nAgain, I talked to Tracy Beckman, not using any names, who is director \nof the Minnesota FSA.\n  He said, I think it was this morning, that one of the farmers who was \ndenied a loan because there was no money, because we haven't done \nanything--we are supposed to pass this emergency supplemental bill and \nget the funding out there--one farmer today said, ``Well, I'm just \ngoing to shoot myself and my family.'' That is horrifying. That is what \nhe said.\n\n  There is tremendous economic pain, tremendous desperation. People are \ngoing under. We have the Financial Services Modernization Act, this \npiece of legislation. Frankly, it doesn't mean anything to these \nfarmers. They want to get some help. They would like to get spring \nplanting loan money. That is what they would like to have done for \nthem. That is not what we are doing.\n  When are we going to get serious? It is clear what this piece of \nlegislation does. We have the Community Reinvestment Act, which has \nbeen tremendously important to lots of people in small communities. It \nhas ended redlining. I used to do community organizing against \nredlining. It has worked well. It has made a huge difference. It's a \nsource of capital, and lots of communities have overcome \ndiscrimination. This piece of legislation takes all that away. Wipes it \nout, wipes it out through the two provisions that I talked about.\n  My question is, what does it do for ordinary citizens? What does it \ndo for ordinary people? That is the question. Why aren't Senators \ntalking about issues that matter to working people, that matter to \nordinary citizens in our country? Why aren't we talking about the Town \nTalk Cafe?\n  I see my colleagues on the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As long as I continue to have the floor, I will be \npleased to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have to accommodate our dear colleague from Minnesota. \nLet me say, I wish he could go on forever, because I am always \nenlightened listening to him. But to accommodate him, I asked unanimous \nconsent that he might have 40 minutes when we came back in at 2:15. It \nis now 3:15. The Senator has spoken an hour.\n  I asked other people to come over to speak based on that agreement. I \ndo not intend to try to enforce the 40 minutes, but if the Senator \ncould take that into account, because I asked Senator Bennett, who, as \nare all of us, is busy, to come over based on that agreement. He has \nbeen sitting here now for 25 minutes or so. If the Senator could sort \nof begin to bring it to a close, it would be much appreciated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague that \ninitially--and I appreciate what he is saying and because of that, I \nwill try to bring it to a close--I said I thought it would take 40 \nminutes. My colleague was gracious enough to say, take the time you \nneed, take an hour and a half, whatever you need. I think that is \nactually part of the Record.\n  And when he said that--I usually take direction from my colleague \nfrom Texas--I thought to myself, well, if I have an hour and a half to \ntalk about the issues that I think we really ought to be talking about, \nI will take that. So I am about ready to finish up on that hour and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to, although I want to make sure that I \nfocus on some of these other issues. Let me yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I want to answer some of the things the Senator has been \nsaying here and ask him a question in that context.\n  The Senator has asked the question, why we are taking this up, and \nwhy does it matter, and is there any urgency. My question to the \nSenator is, is he aware of the fact that Robert Rubin, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, and Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nsystem, both testified before the Senate Banking Committee that this \nlegislation was of the highest urgency and that if it did not pass as \nquickly as possible, the entire banking system of the United States \nwould be adversely affected by virtue of foreign competition? Is the \nSenator aware of that testimony from the administration and the Federal \nReserve Board?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is a fair enough question. In \nanswering the question, let me say that I actually just did have an \nopportunity to be in a session with Secretary Rubin in which several of \nus expressed the very concerns that I have taken an hour to express. He \nsaid they are very valid concerns. ``On balance, I think it is better \nthat we do this'' was what he said.\n  And then when we had a discussion about CRA--and I have devoted a \ngood deal of my time talking about that--the Secretary was very clear \nabout the President's veto letter and very clear that it was important \nthat we maintain these CRA provisions.\n  Of course, the Secretary is interested in this legislation, though it \nwasn't quite the same report I heard that my colleague heard. I say one \nmore time--I am coming to the end of my remarks--that in deference to \nall my colleagues out here, I know this Financial Services \nModernization Act has the support of the industry groups and has the \nsupport of the financial institutions. Of course, because it is going \nto lead to more concentration of power and give them more say.\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\n  I am sure Alan Greenspan would like it. The Federal Reserve Board is \ngoing to have even more power--an unelected body with yet even more \ndecisionmaking power over decisions that vitally affect people's lives. \nBut I have to tell you, in all due respect to one of my favorite \ncolleagues, the Senator from Utah, one more time, besides believing \nthis piece of legislation is a huge mistake, I won't support this \nlegislation in its present form.\n  I won't support the alternative, the substitute, either. Besides \nthinking it is a huge mistake, for reasons I have argued over the last \nhour--and my colleague from Texas was gracious enough to give me that \nopportunity--I also want to say one more time to family farmers in the \nState of Minnesota right now that this Financial Modernization Services \nAct doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean a thing. They want to know \nwhy we are not getting some loan money out to them right now because \nthey are in such desperate shape. They are trying to live to be able to \nfarm another day.\n  To the people who are going to be laid off in Minnesota FSA, who are \ndoing the good work of trying to process loans and help people, but \nhave no money to work with, I think it is absolutely outrageous. To all \nthe farmers in economic pain because we are not doing a darn thing \nabout getting farm income up, or about getting price up, or a darn \nthing to take on some of these big grain companies and packers so \nfamily farmers can get a fair shake in the marketplace, I am for \nputting more free enterprise back into the food industry. It is the big \nmonopolies I don't care for. These farmers have every reason to wonder \nwhat we are doing here.\n  I will tell you one more time that the people in the cafes I have \nbeen in are not talking about this particular legislation; they don't \nsee this as a crisis. Alan Greenspan may see the world in a very \ndifferent way than people in the cafes in Minnesota, and so might the \nSecretary. Certainly these financial institutions do. Certainly Wall \nStreet does.\n  But people in Minnesota are not particularly interested in mergers, \nacquisitions, and all this consolidation of power. They are interested \nin a good job at a good wage. Why aren't we out here talking about \nraising the minimum wage?\n  They are interested in not falling between the cracks when it comes \nto health care coverage. Why aren't Senators talking about decent \nhealth care coverage for people? They are interested in how they can \nafford prescription drugs. Why aren't Senators talking about affordable \nprescription drug coverage for seniors, and, for that matter, for all \nof us? They are interested in how there can be a decent education for \ntheir children. Why aren't Senators having a major debate about \neducation or getting resources to communities so we can do a better job \nof educating our children? They are interested in how we can reduce \nviolence in homes, in schools, and end the violence in our communities. \nWhy aren't Senators out here with legislation that deals with that? \nThey are interested in how to earn a decent living and how to give \ntheir children what they need and deserve. They are interested in \nmaking sure that every child, by kindergarten, comes to school ready to \nlearn. Why aren't we investing in good, developmental affordable child \ncare?\n  That is what they are interested in.\n  We are not dealing with any of those issues. I want to know when \nSenators are going to come out on the floor and deal with pieces of \nlegislation that dramatically affect ordinary people, working families \nin my State and working families around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the presentation by my \nfriend from Minnesota. I return his friendship, and he is my friend. We \ndisagree on just about everything, and we disagree about most of the \nthings he said here today. I want to make a few comments about some of \nthe positions he has taken before I talk about the bill.\n  As I listened to the Senator run down the litany of things he thinks \nwe ought to solve with legislation--we ought to solve farm prices with \nlegislation; we ought to solve preparation for school with legislation; \nwe ought to solve education, generally, with legislation; we ought to \nsolve the amount of money people earn with legislation, and on down the \nlist--he reminds me of a comment that I found very insightful that was \nmade by a head of state in another country as I was visiting there. \nThis man said to me, ``Politicians think that money comes from the \nbudget.'' Money does not come from the budget. Money comes from the \neconomy. If the economy doesn't work, there is no money in the budget. \nAnd if I may, Mr. President, I think that discussing financial \nmodernization has a great deal to do with all of the issues that the \nSenator from Minnesota was discussing because it has to do with the \nhealth of the economy.\n\n  If the banking system, the financial system, and the economy does not \nwork efficiently, if it does not work carefully and properly, the \neconomy as a whole will suffer, the amount of tax revenue coming into \nthe Government will suffer, and we can have all of the discussions we \nwant about solving all of the social problems with legislation, and \nthen we will turn around and find that the cupboard is bare.\n  It is very important that we recognize the impact of this legislation \non the Nation's economy. As I said in my question to my friend from \nMinnesota, we heard testimony in the Banking Committee from the member \nof the administration most charged with focusing on this area of the \neconomy, the Secretary of the Treasury, and with the head of the \nindependent agency most charged with keeping the economy strong and \nvital, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that it was essential \nthat we modernize our financial legislative structure in this country.\n  Why? They told us that foreign banks are coming to the United States, \nand as the American banks go overseas, they are competing in a \ndifferent regulatory framework. They said that the American framework \nis outdated, it is outmoded, it is expensive, and that it gets in the \nway of America's ability to compete.\n  The big banks that my friend from Minnesota attacks so vigorously, \nthe last time I checked, all paid taxes on the revenues they received. \nThe best way to make sure that we do not get those tax revenues is to \nsay, let us hobble those banks in their competitive structure with \nforeign banks. Let's see to it that they cannot compete in the same \nkind of atmosphere as their foreign competitors, in the name of \npreventing them from concentrating power, and then see how much taxes \nwe get from those big banks. Taxes are a percentage of profits; if \nthere are no profits, there are no taxes and there is no money in the \nbudget to pay for all of the programs that the Senator from Minnesota \nwants to fund.\n  Now, he made another comment that I found fascinating, from a \npersonal point of view. He said that, of course, the big banks don't \nlike CRA because it forces them to do what they should be doing. He \nstands up for the little banks that he wants to protect from the big \nbanks that, in his view, want to gobble them up. In my experience with \nthis legislation, it has been exactly the reverse. The big banks have \nsaid to me: We don't much care about the CRA provisions. We have \nlearned to live with CRA. We have learned to handle our banking \npractices in such a way that gets us appropriate CRA ratings. And some \nof the big banks have said: Don't pay any attention to the CRA \namendments in this bill because we can live with them just fine. No. \nThe protest about CRA has come, ironically, given the position of the \nSenator from Minnesota, from the small banks, the little bank.\n\n  Let me give you an example that I have heard of, secondhand, but I \nthink summarizes what we are dealing with here. I have heard of a bank \nin California that was opened by a group of Chinese Americans. What do \nyou do in the marketplace when you are trying to find a niche that will \nallow you to survive, whether you are in the banking business, or the \nclothing business, or the automobile business, or whatever kind of a \nbusiness? You do look around for some community that is not being \nserved properly, and say to yourself, ``I can fill that niche.'' The \noldest business advice in the world is find a need and fill it. Here \nwere a group of\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nChinese Americans who decided that other Chinese Americans for some \nreason or another were not getting access to the credit they needed. \nThey found this need and they hoped they could fill it. They did. They \nwere successful. They prospered.\n  Then comes the CRA regulators, and they said, ``Let us see your \nbooks. Let us look at your loans.'' They came back and said, ``You are \nonly making loans to Chinese Americans. That is, you are not complying \nwith the Community Reinvestment Act that requires you to make loans to \nHispanics or African Americans or other minorities that we, the \nregulators, will identify and determine.'' The people at this bank \nsaid, ``Of course we are only making loans to Chinese Americans. That \nis what we set up to do. That is the market we set up to serve.'' \n``Well, you will accept the penalties and strictures of CRA regulation \nif you do not go out and find statistically enough African Americans \nand Hispanics to meet our requirements.''\n  This was a community that these Chinese Americans did not understand \ninstinctively. This was the community that they were not set up to \nserve. Maybe you can say that it was a good kind of thing for them to \nreach out beyond their natural business area and start serving these \nother sectors, but it created a burden on this small bank, and it was a \nvery small bank that the managers of the bank objected to.\n  In my own State of Utah, I get the same reaction. The big banks don't \nmuch care about CRA. They don't like it. They find it burdensome. But \nthey have learned to live with it. Banks that have written in that are \ncomplaining are the little banks, and they are complaining for the same \nreason in the example that I have given. They feel they are serving \ntheir communities and they are being forced to try to reach beyond \ntheir natural communities to try to find somebody who can statistically \nqualify under CRA.\n  This is from a very small bank in Utah. The President of the bank \nsays, ``We have and will continue to lend to all segments of our \ncommunity because it has been defined by regulation. The time spent \ndocumenting our community lending efforts for regulatory purposes is in \nitself counterproductive, as we could instead redirect our energies \ntoward additional lending and community development activities.''\n  In other words, they are spending more time filling out forms for CRA \nthan they are investing in their community.\n  Another one from a very small town in Utah, and it is surrounded by \nthe family farmers that the Senator from Minnesota was talking about: \n``Exempting our institution from CRA requirements would allow bank \npersonnel to spend more time with our customers and developing new \nproducts rather than gathering information to satisfy CRA documentation \nrequirements.''\n  We will have a great deal more to say about the CRA issue, I am sure, \nwhen it comes up. I simply wanted to make those points in response to \nthe points that were made by my friend from Minnesota, because he is \nvery clearly talking to different people than I am talking to. He is \ntalking to the people in the crossroads cafes. And I think that is \nfine. But I think when it gets to the issue of banking regulation, he \nmight spend some time talking to people who run banks and talking to \npeople who borrow from banks.\n  He made another point that I will talk about and then get \nspecifically to the bill.\n  He talked about the concentration of power, and he railed at great \nlength against corporations that he felt were destroying our democracy. \n``Fewer and fewer people,'' he said--I wrote that phrase down--are \ncontrolling our economic power.\n  I want to share a statistic that I saw in the paper last week that \nhas an interesting slant on this.\n  Back in, say, 1950--my memory is not sharp enough to give you the \nexact year, but it was sometime in the 1950s--the percentages of \nAmericans who owned stock in corporations was 4 percent. Today it is \nover 50 percent.\n  I would say to those who, like my colleague from Minnesota, are \nconcerned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few \npeople, who does he think owns Citibank? Who does he think owns these \ncorporations that he says are so terrible? They are owned by Americans. \nThey are owned by individuals. Fifty percent of Americans now own \nstock, and the number is going up all the time.\n  This is one of the reasons that the class warfare arguments that we \nhave heard around this Chamber for so long are beginning to wear \nthinner and thinner, because the people who own the corporations are \nordinary, everyday, hard-working Americans. The days of J.P. Morgan \nbeing the controller of these institutions are over. J.P. Morgan is \ndead, his heirs scattered, and the controlling shareholder ownership of \nthese corporations is in the hands of the teachers' pension fund--in \nthe hands of ordinary people who have invested their savings in these \ncorporations and have a stake in seeing to it that these corporations \nsurvive. That is why the class warfare arguments get thinner and \nthinner with each passing year.\n  We are in a sense, Mr. President, turning Karl Marx on his head. He \nwanted the people to own all of the means of production. That was tried \nin the Soviet Union in the name of the government as they attacked the \nterrible capitalists in the United States, and ironically it is the \ncapitalists that are seeing to it that the people ultimately own the \nmeans of production, but they own the means of production in their own \nname with shares held in their own name, which they can control and \nwhich they can vote and which they can sell if they don't like what the \ncorporation is doing. And we are getting the people's ownership of the \nmeans of production through capitalism rather than through the forced \ndistribution of wealth that Karl Marx and his followers practiced in \nmodern communism.\n  Having given that reaction to the political science lecture from my \nfriend, who was once a professor of political science--I was never a \nprofessor, but I was once a student of political science, and I like to \nengage in these kinds of debate--I would like to say just a few words \nabout the bill.\n  The fact that it is just a few words is a testament to the expertise \nof our chairman who has worked harder and more personally on a piece of \nlegislation than any chairman I have ever seen. We have resolved the \ncontroversies in this legislation to the point where there are only a \nfew left. The Senator from Texas has led the fight in doing that.\n  When we first started this, when I first came to the Banking \nCommittee, the number of issues was huge and the gap between those \nissues was very wide. I would go out and people would ask me where we \nwere on financial modernization. Unlike my friend from Minnesota, I did \nget those questions. I would go out in places where people were \ninterested. And I would say repeatedly through my first term of service \nin the Senate that we were nowhere and we were not going to have \nfinancial modernization legislation, because the issues were so \ncontentious and the gap between the two sides was so great that we were \nsimply not going to get it done, and, quite frankly, I was not paying \nany attention to it for that reason. I didn't want to waste my time \nbecoming cognizant of all of the ins and outs of these arguments when \nthe arguments were going nowhere, and the legislation was going \nnowhere.\n  We made a major step towards resolving these last year when Senator \nD'Amato was the chairman of the committee, and we finally began to \ngrapple with some of these issues and tried to bring them closer \ntogether. But Senator Gramm has brought us even closer together and \nproduced a bill on which there are now only relatively few issues in \ncontention rather than the great many issues that were in contention 4 \nor 5 years ago.\n  I think that is an extraordinary achievement, not only on the part of \nthe chairman who has led the issue, but, frankly, on the part of the \ncommittee as a whole. The fact that we are having this debate when we \nshould have been having it a few years ago, according to those who are \nfollowing the issue, demonstrates how far we have come.\n  This reminds me in some ways of the debate we had in the \ntelecommunications bill where we had huge forces on both sides of the \nissue struggling, literally, for survival. We had telephone companies, \ncable companies, long-distance carriers, local carriers, all fighting \nover what would happen to their future.\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n  We finally came together on a bill that virtually everybody could buy \noff on. They weren't happy with it, but they said they could live with \nit. We made a landmark step forward in telecommunications.\n  I think that analogy holds true here. Insurance companies, when I \nfirst came to the Senate, were bitter in their opposition to any kind \nof change that would affect them; banks were chomping at the bit for \nmore competitive opportunities and complaining that laws passed in the \n1930s were freezing them out; testimony which I have referred to from \nChairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin indicated we are being savaged \nby foreign competition because our regulatory structure gets in the \nway; the securities industry and all the other folks, everybody agreed \nwe needed reform but nobody could agree on the form of that reform.\n  Now we have a bill before the Senate that, however reluctantly, the \ninsurance companies have said, ``We can live with,'' and the banks have \nsaid, ``We can live with''--the big banks and the little banks that are \nnot usually on the same page on everything; the insurance agents and \nthe insurance companies are not necessarily always on the same page.\n  We have reconciled these various interests now. The regulators have \nsaid they can live with this and that. There is only one major \nregulatory argument left, and we will do our best to work our way \nthrough that one and find a compromise.\n  The time to pass the bill is now. The moment has come when all of \nthese forces are together. Let us not waste that moment. Let the Senate \nnot shatter it all and say we will deal with it later. The forces of \ncompetition that led Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan to speak of \nthe urgency of this are still there and their pressures are still \nthere. The passage of time, as we get farther and farther away from the \n1930s when our present regulatory structure was put in place, is not on \nour side in terms of making the financial services in this country \nefficient, more effective, and more competitive.\n  We need this bill. We need it now. We should not lose the opportunity \nwe have to seize the moment while there is a degree of agreement among \nall of the parties of the bill to get it done.\n  I salute the chairman for his personal effort in getting us where we \nare. I urge the Senate to pass the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me thank our dear colleague from Utah \nfor his very fine comments. Any colleagues who want an opportunity to \nspeak on the bill should come to the floor to be afforded that \nopportunity. At some point, if we don't have people over to speak on \nthe bill, Senator Sarbanes, under the unanimous consent request, will \noffer his substitute. Members can wait and speak on that substitute, if \nthe Senator chooses to offer it, and obviously if you want to speak \nabout the bill itself, you can do it on the substitute. Members \ndesiring to speak on the bill before the substitute is pending, should \ncome on over.\n  Mr. President, I will respond very briefly to our dear colleague, \nSenator Wellstone. Senator Wellstone gave an impassioned plea not to \nrepeal CRA. Let me say that one of my great frustrations with our \nefforts to reform CRA and curb abuses in CRA is that nobody wants to \ndebate the reforms. Even the spokesman for the national association of \nthe community groups that form the heart of CRA has said what they call \n``green mail'' exists. They think it is harmful to CRA. Most Americans \nwould call that process ``blackmail'' and not ``green mail.''\n  I think many people have had at least their eyebrows raised by the \nfact that $9 billion in cash payments have been made or committed under \nCRA. CRA is not about giving people money not to testify against your \nbank merger, or to testify for it; instead, CRA is about giving people \nan opportunity to have input and present evidence as to whether they \nare meeting the requirements of the law.\n  I don't know what any judicial process--and this is a quasi-judicial \nprocess, I guess you could say--how anyone would not be revolted by the \npractice of paying witnesses. In essence, as Members will see when we \nbegin the debate on CRA and we show some of the documents with the \nnames redacted, that is exactly what is happening all over America \ntoday.\n  The point I make about CRA is no one is talking about repealing CRA. \nThis is not a debate about repealing or weakening CRA. This is a debate \nabout integrity of banks that have longstanding records of compliance, \nand whether somebody just by calling them a name--by saying they are a \nloan shark, they are a racist, or some other inflammatory name--should \nbe able to delay actions that they are guaranteed on an impartial basis \nunder the law.\n  All our provision in the bill says is that if a bank is going to be \ndenied the ability to do something that they would have to be in CRA \ncompliance for, and they have a long history of being in compliance on \nCRA, then those people who object--for their objection to be used to \ndelay the process--have to present substantial evidence.\n  Now, ``substantial evidence'' is defined in law more precisely than \nany other term of art in the American legal system: more than a \nscintilla of evidence; facts that would lead a reasonable person to \nthink that something might be true.\n  We are talking about the lowest standard of law, not the highest \nstandard.\n  The second provision in out bill would allow very small banks in \nrural areas that don't have a city to serve, much less an inner city, \nto be exempt from a regulatory burden that costs them between $60,000 \nand $80,000 a year, even though these banks generally have only between \n6 and 10 employees. Since 1990, in 16,000 audits of these small, rural \nbanks, only three banks have been found to be in substantial \nnoncompliance.\n  Every word that the Senator said about not repealing CRA I am sure \nresonated, but it doesn't have anything to do with the debate we are \nhaving. Nobody is proposing we repeal CRA in this bill. We are talking \nabout two targeted reforms. I don't want anybody to get confused.\n  Senator Dodd has come to the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have noticed over the last week every time \nI get up to give a talk, the Senator from Idaho is in the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I love to hear the Senator's speech.\n  Mr. DODD. I enjoy the Senator's collegiality and leadership. It is \nnice to have the distinguished Senator from Idaho as a new Member of \nthe Senate.\n  Let me begin these brief remarks by commending the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Gramm, and the ranking Democrat, \nSenator Sarbanes, for their efforts on this legislation to date.\n  I have been on the Banking Committee, and in fact I sat with my \ncolleague from Maryland. I have been in the Congress 24 years, and I \nthink for almost all 24 years he has been my seatmate--usually \ndepending on where we were, the majority or the minority, to the left \nor right of me--almost all 24 years on one committee or \nanother, including service in the House, in the Judiciary Committee, \nand then over these last 18 years in both the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Banking Committee. I have been fortunate to have his \ngood counsel and advice, and admired his leadership and thoughtfulness \non so many issues. This is one which I constantly feel like the \nmythological figure of Sisyphus, rolling up this rock of financial \nservices modernization every Congress. I do not think there is one we \nhave missed since my arrival in this Chamber 18 years ago, not one \nCongress in which we have not tried to address the issue of \nmodernization of financial services. On numerous occasions, the Senate, \nthis body, actually completed its work but, because of bifurcated \njurisdictions and other matters in the House, we were never able to \nattain success; that is, sending a bill, a broad bill on financial \nmodernization, to a President, any of them that I served with--\nincluding President Reagan, President Bush, and now President Clinton.\n\n  But we are precariously close to achieving a result that has been \nunattainable over the last number of years. The fact that we are \ndealing with this legislation as early as we are in this Congress is \nheartening to me, because it means we have in front of us an \nopportunity to complete action on what I think is a worthwhile \nendeavor.\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\n  Again, let me commend my two colleagues who are making it possible \nfor us to arrive at the point where we are on the floor of the Senate. \nOver the next several days we will consider, I assume, a number of \ndifferent amendments that will, I hope, allow us to bring broad-based \nsupport to this proposal and to enter a conference with the other body \nand send a measure to the President which he can sign.\n  That is a lot of steps in front of us. I realize that. But if you \nknow the past history of this legislation, they seem like minor steps \nindeed, when you consider we rarely reach the point we are today.\n  Let me also, once again, in this forum here, commend my colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator Gramm. This is his first major legislative effort \nas chairman of the Banking Committee. He has had other major \nlegislative efforts but never as the chairman of this committee. He \ndeserves all due credit for his contributions to this bill. Few \ncommittee chairmen have more personally invested themselves in a piece \nof legislation than he has. As I said a moment ago, my colleague and \nfriend from Maryland brings a career's worth of experience in dealing \nwith financial services issues, both domestic and international. His \ncounsel and advice and words of wisdom ought to be heeded.\n  The legislation before us does address some very, very important \nissues, outstanding issues. It provides a framework for modernization \nof our Nation's financial services. It allows banks and securities \nfirms, as I know you have heard from both the chairman of the committee \nand the Senator from Maryland, and insurance companies, to affiliate. \nIt provides a rational process, we think, for these affiliations to \ntake place.\n  Although it needs to improve, in my view this bill provides some \nsignificant benefits and protections to consumers who would not only \nbenefit from these diversified firms but who would also benefit from \nhaving standardized and comprehensive protections for the sale of \nsecurities and insurance products.\n  Let me add right here, these are arcane subject matters. Sometimes we \nare asked where the consumer protections are in this bill; where is the \nconsumer in this legislation? The consumer is all through this bill, in \na sense. First and foremost, the consumer is there because consumers \nare seeking to handle their financial matters in a more expeditious \nway, knowing they have broad, comprehensive protections.\n  In many ways, this legislation is trying to catch up with what \nalready is occurring in the marketplace, both at home and abroad. By \nregulation and court decision, much of our modernization is occurring. \nWhat we are seeking to do here is involve ourselves, as we should have \nbeen years ago, in setting out the guidelines of modernization from a \npublic policy standpoint. So it is very important legislation because \nthe courts, and in too many cases the regulators, do not bring to bear \nthe kind of consumer issues that only a public policy forum like the \nSenate can do.\n  When the issue is raised where is the consumer in this legislation, \nin fact the consumer is all through this bill. It is our goal here to \nsee to it that they will be able to conduct their financial matters, \nfinancial business in a way that conforms to the lives and demands of \nconsumers in this country, and that will also better equip them with \nprotections in dealing with other matters in securities and insurance \nissues.\n  This bill also protects the traditional right of States to regulate \ninsurance, something that has been subject to longstanding debate. This \nwill codify at the end of the 20th century how we in Congress feel \nabout that issue, while at the same time will provide for functional \nregulation of all financial institutions. That has been an ongoing \ndebate for years, and one that the adoption of this bill would \nestablish firmly as we enter the 21st century.\n  But I believe the outstanding issues, such as banking and commerce, \nthe operating subsidy of affiliate structure and additional consumer \nprotections, can and will be worked out in a reasonable fashion. \nHowever, I must share my deep frustration, frankly, and great concern \nover the future of financial services modernization legislation. During \nmy tenure, as I said a moment ago, in the Senate, I, like many of my \ncolleagues, have invested a significant amount of time and effort \nattempting to enact modernization legislation. I am of the belief that \nit is vital to the future of America's financial services industries \nand important to consumers as well.\n\n  This process has not been an easy one. Finding the delicate balance \nof protecting consumers while at the same time creating a regulatory \nframework that fosters market efficiency and industry innovation has \nbeen a difficult and a long task. I had hoped that by today I would be \nspeaking on behalf of the merits of a bipartisan legislative approach. \nI had hoped to speak on behalf of a bill that last year received the \noverwhelming support of the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to \n2. Just recently, similar legislation passed the House Banking \nCommittee by a vote of 51 to 8. Instead, I reluctantly rise to express \nmy deep concerns about the legislation before us that attacks what I \nconsider to be one of the most important laws in our Federal code, the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, CRA, of which you are going to hear a great \ndeal in the coming days.\n  The attack on CRA contained in this legislation is clear, in my view, \nand unmitigated. It broadly exempts depository institutions from CRA. \nIt attempts to address a problem that simply does not exist, and in the \nprocess, in my view, does great harm to a law that has brought billions \nof dollars in mortgage and small business credit to rural and urban \nAmericans, allowing them to participate with equal opportunity to \nexpand their financial gains and opportunities in this country.\n  As you know, this bill as drafted will be vetoed by the President. We \nusually receive a statement of administration policy written by the \nappropriate department head. Only on rare occasions does the President \nof the United States write a personal letter prior to committee markup, \nstating his concerns and articulating his promise to veto a bill if \ncertain provisions are not resolved. Of primary importance to the \nPresident is the preservation of the Community Reinvestment Act in the \ncontext of any financial modernization legislation.\n  I will say very directly--I say this to my colleagues, whom I know \nhave a different point of view. If this bill is not changed to address \nvarious CRA concerns, the President of the United States will veto this \nbill. And that mythological figure of Sisyphus will, once again, rear \nhis head at the close of the 20th century and we will fail in our \nattempts to modernize financial services.\n  That would be a great misfortune. But I say as well that to pass a \npiece of legislation as we end the 20th century, about to begin the \n21st, and to disregard the principles and values incorporated in the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, also, in my view, would be a tragedy of \nsignificant proportion.\n  The veto of this bill as written is certain, as certain as our \nability to avoid it. We should understand who supports this attack on \nthe CRA provisions contained in this bill. The attack has not been \nsought by the industry, which is normally the case. There is no \nconstituency of support for them. The support of this legislation is \nnot contingent on the inclusion of CRA provisions. Banks are in the \nmidst of their 7th year of record profits with CRA as the law of the \nland.\n  Over the years, at the request of industry and appropriate \nregulators, CRA has been simplified and modified to be far less \ninvasive to depository institutions. The fact of the matter is that \nbanks care little about changing CRA. The attack on CRA is truly \nsupported only by a few people. I say again with deep respect to my \ncolleague and friend from Texas, who cares deeply about this issue, as \ndoes the senior Senator from Alabama: I respect their points of view. I \ndisagree with them fundamentally. I respect their points of view. But \nthere are really no other constituencies that I can find who share \ntheir point of view on this issue. There are many people who have a \ndifferent point of view, including financial institutions, consumer \ngroups, and others about the importance of extending the CRA \nprovisions.\n\n  Let me reiterate, if I can. The President of the United States, all \nFederal regulators, industry, 51 of the 60 Democrats and Republicans in \nthe House\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nBanking Committee, 16 of the 18 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \nBanking Committee, all support the preservation of CRA.\n  While not perfect--and no one is arguing that it is--CRA, in my view, \nand in the view of many others, has been truly a success story.\n  Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home mortgage loans \nextended to African Americans increased by over 70 percent. Let me \nrepeat that. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home \nmortgages extended to African Americans increased by over 70 percent.\n  Over the same period, the number of home mortgage loans increased 45 \npercent for Hispanics, and 30 percent for Native Americans.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, loans to African-\nAmerican-owned businesses doubled between the years of 1993 and 1997.\n  More than $1 trillion has been leveraged under CRA--credit for home \nmortgages, small businesses, and other purposes--that has enabled \ncreditworthy citizens, minority creditworthy citizens to improve their \neconomic status and that of their families in both rural areas and \ninner cities.\n  We should not retreat from these laudable goals if we are going to \nmake the modernization of financial services conform with the \nmodernization of a society that reaches out to each and every sector of \nthat society to see to it that they have the equal opportunity to \ninvest and to grow and to enjoy the full benefits of being Americans.\n  Despite these strides, CRA has not erased all lending discrimination \nin this country.\n  In 1997, mortgage loans for African Americans, Native Americans, and \nHispanics were denied at a rate of more than twice those of white \nmortgage applicants of similar incomes. For both urban and rural areas, \nCRA has played an invaluable role in economic development.\n  I recently received a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nsigned by the mayors of nearly 200 towns and cities of all sizes, from \nNew Haven, CT, to Houston, TX. Let me quote them. It states:\n\n       The Community Reinvestment Act has played a critical role \n     in encouraging federally insured financial institutions to \n     invest in the cities of our nation.\n\n  The letter goes on further and says:\n\n       Unless the onerous CRA provisions are addressed and the CRA \n     is preserved, we would urge strong opposition to the Senate \n     bill as presently drafted.\n\n  Urban areas are not the only beneficiaries of CRA. CRA loans assist \nsmall farmers in obtaining credit for operating expenses, livestock, \nand real estate.\n  Less than a month ago, we voted unanimously to award a Congressional \nMedal of Honor to Rosa Parks. As we all know, Ms. Parks led the fight \nin this country for racial equality. The CRA provisions in this bill we \nhave before us today would send, in my view, Rosa Parks and many others \nto the back of that bus economically. They would directly hurt \nminorities and rural citizens by restricting their right to pursue the \nAmerican dream to own a home, start a small business, to receive fair \naccess to credit.\n  Despite my strong support for financial services modernization--and, \nMr. President, it is very strong, indeed--if the price of modernization \nis the denial of financial services in the 21st century to rural \nAmericans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and \nNative Americans in the country, then I am unwilling to pay it.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support Senator Sarbanes' substitute \namendment and Senator Bryan's CRA amendment. In my view, if these \nmeasures are improved, as I believe they should be, then I think we \nwould have a strong bill.\n  There are a lot of other amendments that may be offered. There is a \ndebate over the op-sub and the affiliate issue. I think that is an \nimportant issue. I think the issue of privacy in financial dealings is \nan important issue. And there are many other matters that may be \nraised.\n  But, in my view, nothing--nothing--is as important as whether or not \nwe are going to provide equal access to our financial institutions to \nall Americans. The Community Reinvestment Act has made a significant \ncontribution to tearing down the barriers that have existed far too \nlong and has provided the access to credit, home mortgages, and \nimproving the financial future of too many of our citizens to retreat \nnow. To back up on a major, major bill such as this, I think, would be \na great retreat, indeed.\n  So as strongly as I support the concepts included in the fundamental \nfinancial modernization bill, Mr. President, I could not support a bill \nthat treats too many of our Americans unfairly as they presently are by \nretreating on Community Reinvestment Act provisions.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues, those who care about financial \nmodernization, those who care about civil rights and care about access \nto financial institutions, to support the substitute, support the CRA \namendments. I think then we would have a strong bill, and remaining \nissues could be resolved without too much difficulty. But a bill that \nfails to address this issue is a bill that, in my view, will not pass \nand will not be signed into law, and it would be an unfortunate, \nunfortunate day, indeed.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is time under control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no control of time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I presume that the Pastore rule has expired for the day?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It expired at 1:15 this afternoon.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for not to exceed 5 \nminutes out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the weekend, a glimmer of light broke \nthrough the war clouds shrouding Yugoslavia. That light was kindled by \nthe release of the three American soldiers who have been held hostage \nin the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since their capture by the forces \nof Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on March 31. The individual \nresponsible for this remarkable turn of events is the Reverend Jesse L. \nJackson. For his efforts, he has earned the thanks of a grateful \nnation. Due to the faith and determination of Mr. Jackson, the Reverend \nJoan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches and the \ndelegation of religious leaders that Mr. Jackson led to Yugoslavia, in \nthis one small corner of a terrible conflict, good has triumphed over \nevil.\n  I have no doubt but that the motives of President Milosevic in \nfreeing the American servicemen will be analyzed, dissected, and \nruminated on by the commentators in the coming days. Despite all the \nconjectures, we may never know what he was hoping to achieve. Surely \nMilosevic will be disappointed if he believes that this gesture, \nwelcome as it is, will blind the United States and the rest of NATO to \nthe atrocities that he is inflicting on the ethnic Albanian population \nof Kosovo.\n  But in contrast to Mr. Milosevic, we do know what the Reverend Mr. \nJackson was hoping to achieve.\n  He has faced some of the most ruthless strongmen in the world, \nincluding Syrian President Hafiz Assad, Cuban President Fidel Castro, \nand Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.\n  In 1984, Mr. Jackson won the release from Syria of Navy Lieutenant \nRobert Goodman Jr., who was shot down over Lebanon. That same year, he \npersuaded Castro to release 48 American and Cuban prisoners. In 1990, \nhe helped to win freedom for more than 700 foreigners who were being \ndetained as human shields by Saddam Hussein following the invasion of \nKuwait. His trip to Yugoslavia marks the fourth time that Jesse Jackson \nhas won freedom for hostages.\n  In the faces of the freed soldiers and their families, I am reminded \nonce again that faith can move mountains. I salute the Reverend Mr. \nJackson and his delegation for their remarkable success.\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\n  Mr. President, as a mark of respect for Mr. Jackson and the \ndelegation of church leaders, I am today submitting a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution commending Mr. Jackson for the deep faith that marked \nhis mission to Belgrade, and for his successful efforts to free Staff \nSergeant Andrew A. Ramirez of California, Staff Sergeant Christopher J. \nStone of Michigan, and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales of Texas. We \nwelcome these soldiers home with open arms. We also salute the brave \nmen and women of our armed forces who remain in harm's way in the \nBalkans. Their courage and patriotism, and the dedication and sacrifice \nof their families, are appreciated and honored by all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may send the resolution \nto the desk and that it be held there until the majority leader and the \nminority leader decide upon a proper disposition of it, but that it \ncan't be held longer than a day, the end of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia to add me as a cosponsor to that resolution, if he would.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. Mr. President, I make \nthat request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have retrieved my resolution from the \ndesk. I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 94 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 94\n\n       Whereas on March 31, 1999, Staff Sergeant Andrew A. \n     Ramirez, Staff Sergeant Christopher J. Stone, and Specialist \n     Steven M. Gonzales were taken prisoner by the armed forces of \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia while on patrol along the \n     Macedonia-Yugoslav border;\n       Whereas Sergeant Ramirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist \n     Gonzales conducted themselves throughout their ordeal with \n     dignity, patriotism, and faith;\n       Whereas the Reverend Jesse Jackson led a delegation of \n     religious leaders to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that \n     succeeded in negotiating the release of Sergeant Ramirez, \n     Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales; and\n       Whereas the Reverend Jesse Jackson has previously succeeded \n     in securing the release of hostages held in Syria, Cuba, and \n     Iraq: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate commends the Reverend Jesse Jackson for his \n     successful efforts in securing the release of Sergeant \n     Ramirez, Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales, and for his \n     leadership and actions arising from his deep faith in God; \n     and\n       (2) the Senate joins the families of Sergeant Ramirez, \n     Sergeant Stone, and Specialist Gonzales in expressing relief \n     and joy at their safe release.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 900, the financial \nmodernization bill. I supported this legislation as a member of the \nBanking Committee, and I commend Chairman Gramm for the excellent work \nhe has done in bringing this bill to the floor. The chairman has worked \nvery hard to craft a bill that makes sense. It is balanced and will \nbenefit our economy.\n  This legislation is designed to modernize America's financial \nservices industry by providing a sensible framework for the affiliation \nof banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial \ninstitutions. It is, of course, very difficult to craft a compromise \nthat is acceptable to many diverse interests, but it is necessary that \nwe do so.\n  Much of our financial services industry is governed by laws written \nin the 1930s. Congress has struggled with this issue for many years. I \nam hopeful that this is finally the year we enact this legislation.\n  I will focus my comments on several issues concerning community \nbanks.\n  In Colorado, the community bank is an important institution. It is \nthe center of many of our towns and rural areas. I have worked hard to \nrepresent their interests in the Banking Committee. I am a supporter of \nthe provisions in this bill to exempt small rural banks from the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. For small banks, the CRA, or Community \nReinvestment Act, is a regulatory burden. While a large bank can often \ndevote an entire department to CRA compliance, a small bank has to \ndivert scarce resources toward compliance. Each of these small banks is \nrequired to undergo regular exams and actually designate a CRA \ncompliance officer. This makes little sense when one recognizes that \nsmall rural banks could not survive if they did not invest in the \ncommunity. Frankly, where else could they put their money?\n  I will read a few excerpts from Colorado banks on this very important \npoint.\n  From the First National Bank of Stratton:\n\n       Your amendment removing the CRA requirement will have a \n     positive benefit for small community banks located in \n     nonmetropolitan areas. As a small community bank in a town of \n     700, the employees and the bank's officers are already \n     involved in literally everything going on in the town. The \n     CRA requirement provides a burdensome paper and personnel \n     requirement for small community banks.\n\n  Remember, this is coming from a bank in a town of only 700 people.\n  Then from the First National Bank of Cortez:\n\n       In our bank, our compliance officer spends a great deal of \n     time preparing documents for the CRA file and Bank Examiners. \n     We estimate that it takes 80 to 100 hours each year to update \n     the CRA file, and to date, we have never had a customer ask \n     to see the file.\n\n  Then from the First National Bank in Las Animas and La Junta:\n\n       I strongly support the provision to remove the onerous \n     requirements of the CRA from small rural banks. We serve our \n     communities well and if we do not serve the needs of our \n     community we will not exist.\n\n  From the Kirk State Bank:\n\n       As a small rural bank, the CRA is a burdensome regulation. \n     In reality, small banks and small communities have to be good \n     community citizens to be successful and a bureaucratic \n     regulation does nothing to improve the situation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of these \nletters and others from Colorado bankers printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The First National Bank\n\n\n                                                  of Stratton,\n\n                                     Stratton, CO, March 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Your amendment removing the CRA \n     requirement will have a positive benefit for small community \n     banks located in Non-metropolitan areas. As a small community \n     bank in a town of 700, the employees and the bank's officers \n     are already involved in literally everything going on in the \n     town. The CRA requirement provides a burdensome paper and \n     personnel requirement for small community banks.\n       Your support of this amendment is greatly appreciated.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                  Dana M.

Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Thank you for your letter of inquiry \n     regarding our position on your amendment to exempt banks less \n     than $100 million in aggregate assets from the CRA \n     regulation.\n       Needless to say, I am very proud of you and your committee \n     and strongly desire that this amendment be passed.\n       In our bank, our compliance officer spends a great deal of \n     time preparing documents for the CRA file and Bank Examiners. \n     We estimate that it takes 80 to 100 hours each year to update \n     the CRA file, and to date, we have never had a customer \n     request to see the file. Of course the Bank examiners do \n     request this information. We find that this regulation is \n     completely worthless and of no benefit at all.\n       Also, in my opinion the whole CRA regulation should be \n     disposed of, since it does not apply to others in the \n     financial industry.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Donald G.

Although I do not believe many of the \n     aspects of the financial services modernization bill are in \n     the best interest of our nation I strongly support the \n     provision to remove the onerous requirements of the CRA from \n     small\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\n     rural banks. We serve our communities well and if we do not \n     serve the needs of our communities we will not exist. The CRA \n     requirements, are in many cases, counter-productive and \n     anything that can be done to remove the bureaucracy involved \n     in that would be appreciated. Thank you again for soliciting \n     input.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dale L.

Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Banking Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Community Reinvestment Act has \n     outlived it's usefulness, and was never fairly implemented to \n     included all financial institutions. It was a government \n     hammer to force banks to make loans and open branches that \n     were not prudent. Enforcement of discrimination laws produces \n     better results.\n       Please hold firm on exempting banks with less than $100 \n     million in assets from CRA requirements during your \n     consideration of the Financial Services Modernization bill. \n     The exemption should be at the $500 million level, if not \n     removed altogether, and all financial institutions (lenders) \n     should be included; such as Credit Unions.\n       Finally, please remember, this great Country's economic \n     health is largely based on the freedom of individuals who \n     take the risk of opening a small business, and a small bank \n     is a small business. The less government regulation for small \n     banks the better we can compete with large banks who have \n     full time staffs to handle regulatory requirements. As the \n     President of a small bank that I started after a large bank \n     purchased the bank I had worked at for 20+ years, and let me \n     go at the ripe old age of 49 years, I wear many hats and \n     spend much of my mornings reviewing stacks of regulatory \n     correspondence. Any relief will be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Joe L.

Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: We support your thoughts that rural \n     banks of less than $100 million in assets should be exempt \n     from the provisions of CRA. In my thirty years of banking, I \n     can honestly say that CRA compliance issues in a bank of this \n     size ($95 million in assets in a community of less than \n     50,000 people)are unnecessary. This bank and every other \n     rural bank, by their very nature, are leaders and innovators \n     in meeting the credit needs of the citizens and businesses in \n     communities in which they are located.\n       Our directors, officers and employees, for the most part, \n     were born and raised in this community and they volunteer \n     untold numbers of hours to community organizations and \n     governmental agencies. While attending these events, we have \n     and take the opportunity to listen to the needs of the \n     community and to communicate our products and services \n     accordingly. We often develop new products and services, or \n     actually sponsor events, to satisfy specific needs based on \n     feed-back we have received from the community.\n       The present CRA examination procedures for small banks have \n     already been simplified to the point, that the remaining \n     procedures are nothing more than an exercise in futility. The \n     results prove nothing that the examiner doing the work and \n     the bank being examined does not already know. The bank is \n     truly meeting the community's credit needs and there is no \n     discrimination or redlining taking place. Eliminating small \n     rural banks from any and all CRA requirements would be cost \n     effective and will permit bank examiners to focus on safety \n     and soundness areas that are truly meaningful and effective \n     in the examination process.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                               William H.

Please be advised that we do support \n     the amendment to the Financial Services Modernization bill, \n     to exempt banks with less than $100 million in assets and in \n     non-metropolitan areas, from CRA requirements.\n       We believe that mall community banks have more than \n     demonstrate that we must reinvent in our communities on a \n     wide basis, simply to continue in business. With the high \n     levels of competition in the marketplace, we do not have any \n     alternative but to complete rigorously, and that means \n     covering all areas and segments of our population and service \n     areas, with full and complete banking services. The costs of \n     doing so are enormous without the added costs of \n     documentation of compliance with CRA. It will be more helpful \n     to small community banks like ours to be relieved of such \n     burden, and we thank you for pursuing the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Clinton W.

Phil Gramm,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     pending financial modernization legislation. While I applaud \n     your support of regulatory relief from the burdens of the \n     Community Reinvestment Act for small rural banks, there \n     continue to be provisions of the financial modernization \n     legislation that concerns me. I believe, as does the \n     Independent Bankers of Colorado on whose Board I am a member, \n     that the financial modernization bill as it is currently \n     written is harmful to community bank interests.\n       We support the closure of the unitary thrift holding \n     company loophole through which an increasing number of non-\n     banking firms are acquiring thrifts. We agree with the \n     Federal Reserve, Independent Bankers' of America Association \n     and American Bankers' Association that this loophole allows \n     the mixing of banking and commerce and the entry of non-\n     federally insured entities to the payments system and \n     discount window. Without a payments system reserved solely \n     for federally insured financial institutions the future of \n     community banking is doubtful. Community banks cannot compete \n     effectively against a combination of the country's largest \n     banking, financial and commercial firms. These combined \n     entities would own and control products and services vital to \n     the continuing viability of community banks. Moreover, they \n     would control access to the payments system the lifeblood of \n     community banks and communities throughout Colorado and the \n     nation, especially of our rural community banks and \n     communities.\n       For these same reasons, we oppose any commercial basket \n     that allows a bank to invest its revenues in commercial \n     firms-the mixing of banking and commerce. Community banks \n     cannot compete effectively against financial and commercial \n     conglomerates that will control a variety of commercial and \n     consumer markets.\n       We support an increase in community bank access to the \n     Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) by according membership to the \n     FHLB for all banks less than $500 million in assets and by \n     including agricultural and small business paper as eligible \n     collateral. Alternative sources of funding are becoming \n     increasingly expensive for community banks to acquire. \n     Increased access to the FHLB will help to ensure an \n     additional, affordable source of funds for community bank \n     lending, particularly rural community bank lending. Without \n     affordable sources of funding, community banks cannot \n     adequately support their local communities.\n       Community banks remain concerned about the insurance \n     provisions that may be included in financial modernization \n     legislation. We urge that Congress not take any legislative \n     steps that would hinder community bank insurance activities. \n     Community banks must retain the authority to engage in \n     insurance activities to be able to compete effectively \n     against big banks, insurance companies and financial \n     conglomerates controlled by unitary thrift holding companies \n     that are increasingly in pursuit of community bank customers.\n       Thank you for seeking my input into your laudable efforts \n     to reach a comprise on financial modernization that benefits \n     all parties.\n           With Sincere Regards,\n                                                    Tom L. Havens,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The First National Bank\n\n\n                                                  of Stratton,\n\n                                     Stratton, CO, March 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee On Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I would like to thank you for your \n     support in the Senate Banking Committee, concerning your \n     proposal to exempt Banks with under one hundred million in \n     assets, from the Community Reinvestment Act.\n       We strongly support this exemption. We are all over \n     burdened with regulatory requirements and CRA is at the top \n     of this list. We have devoted countless hours and thousands \n     of reams of paper to be outstanding in our CRA Reports.\n       It is a well known and documented fact that any Bank \n     surviving in the 80's and into the 90's who is not meeting \n     the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, is not \n     succeeding. Most small Banks not in the metropolitan setting \n     perform all the acts, required under CRA, in their daily \n     survival.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n       It might be further interesting to note that due to the \n     change in the matrix and composition of the requirements for \n     an outstanding CRA rural Banks find it very difficult to \n     receive an outstanding. We had worked diligently and \n     faithfully to maintain an outstanding CRA Rating and then \n     with the change of rules we are almost excluded by a \n     definition form being able to obtain an outstanding rating \n     and have to be satisfied with merely a satisfactory.\n       This again points up the fact that there is no reason to go \n     through that gyration to be only satisfactory, as we \n     certainly are satisfied in the daily performance of our \n     Banking lives. We are all concerned about the Community and \n     daily make every effort to enhance the Communities which we \n     serve.\n       We therefore highly support the exemption of this \n     requirement on the smaller institutions. It would save us \n     dollars and cents, but more importantly would allow us the \n     time to get out of the office, away from the paper work \n     requirements and actually serve the customers as we intend \n     to. It would also help provide one less unfair advantage to \n     small Banks concerning our Credit Union struggles and brings \n     us one step closer to a level playing field. Credit Unions \n     are not required to be under any CRA requirements.\n       I thank you for the opportunity to be heard and to support \n     your efforts on the Financial Modernization Bill. We also \n     would ask for your support in closing the unitary thrift \n     loophole which is detrimental to the small Banks and the \n     Banking payment system in general. We believe these two items \n     are of the highest priority in the up coming Modernization \n     Bill.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Robert L. Todd,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, these letters contain a number of views on \nthe CRA and other provisions of the bill.\n  Now I want to talk about taxes. For over a year now, I have been \nworking on legislation to reduce the tax burden on small banks. Last \nweek, I introduced S. 875 along with Chairman Gramm and Senators \nBennett, Abraham, Hagel, Enzi, Mack, Grams and Shelby.\n  This legislation expands the subchapter S option for small banks. \nSubchapter S is a portion of the Tax Code designed for small businesses \nwith a modest number of shareholders. The most important feature of \nsubchapter S is that it eliminates the double taxation faced by \ncorporations. Subchapter S businesses are taxed only at the shareholder \nlevel.\n  Congress made this provision available to banks 3 years ago. Since \nthen, nearly 1,000 small banks have converted from C corporations to S \ncorporations. Unfortunately, many more would like to convert. They are \nprevented from doing so by a number of remaining obstacles in the tax \nlaw.\n  My legislation would change this by making subchapter S available to \nmany more banks. I will be working closely with Senator Gramm and the \nFinance Committee in the months to come in an attempt to include this \nlegislation in a tax bill.\n  Mr. President, I will include a full description of the provisions of \nmy bill at the end of these comments.\n  I also want to talk briefly about one additional matter that has come \nto my attention. This is a proposal to permit banks to be organized as \nlimited liability companies, or LLCs. LLCs were first created in the \nmid-1980s and have spread throughout the Nation. Virtually every State \nnow permits businesses to be organized as LLCs, as well as corporations \nand partnerships. The tax benefit of an LLC is similar to that of a \nsubchapter S corporation. Double taxes are eliminated and taxes are \npaid at the level of the owners. Up to this point, Federal law had \nlimited banks to the corporate form.\n  In recent years, a number of experts have questioned this \nrestriction, and there appear to be good reasons why we may wish to \nexamine permitting small banks to be organized as LLCs.\n  I will provide the chairman with language on this point and ask that \nhe take a good look at it. I want to thank Chairman Gramm, once again, \nfor his hard work on this bill. I have been pleased to be a member of \nthe Banking Committee, and I am pleased to support the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an explanation of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Small Business and Financial Institutions Tax Relief Act of 1999 \n      Legislation To Reduce the Federal Tax Burden on Small Banks\n\n       This legislation expands Subchapter S of the IRS Code. \n     Subchapter S corporations do not pay corporate income taxes, \n     earnings are passed through to the shareholders where income \n     taxes are paid, eliminating the double taxation of \n     corporations. By contrast, Subchapter C corporations pay \n     corporate income taxes on earnings, and shareholders pay \n     income taxes again on those same earnings when they pass \n     through as dividends. Subchapter S of the IRS Code was \n     enacted in 1958 to reduce the tax burden on small business. \n     The Subchapter S provisions have been liberalized a number of \n     times over the last two decades, significantly in 1982, and \n     again in 1996. This reflects a desire on the part of Congress \n     to reduce taxes on small business.\n       This S corporation legislation would benefit many small \n     businesses, but its provisions are particularly applicable to \n     banks. Congress made S corporation status available to small \n     banks for the first time in the 1996 ``Small Business Job \n     Protection Act'' but many banks are having trouble qualifying \n     under the current rules. The proposed legislation:\n       Permits S corporation shares to be held as Individual \n     Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and permits IRA shareholders to \n     purchase their shares from the IRA in order to facilitate a \n     Subchapter S election.\n       Clarifies that interest and dividends on investments \n     maintained by a bank for liquidity and safety and soundness \n     purposes shall not be ``passive'' income. This is necessary \n     because S corporations are restricted in the amount of \n     passive investment income they may generate.\n       Increases the number of S corporation eligible shareholders \n     from 75 to 150.\n       Provides that any stock that bank directors must hold under \n     banking regulations shall not be a disqualifying second class \n     of stock. This is necessary because S corporations are \n     permitted only one class of stock.\n       Permits banks to treat bad debt charge offs as items of \n     built in loss over the same number of years that the \n     accumulated bad debt reserve must be recaptured (four years) \n     for built in gains tax purposes. This provision is necessary \n     to properly match built in gains and losses relating to \n     accounting for bad debts. Banks that are converting to S \n     corporations must convert from the reserve method of \n     accounting to the specific charge off method and the \n     recapture of the accumulated bad debt reserve is built in \n     gain. Presently the presumption that a bad debt charge off is \n     a built in loss applies only to the first S corporation year.\n       Clarifies that the general 3 Year S corporation rule for \n     certain ``preference'' items applies to interest deductions \n     by S corporation banks, thereby providing equitable treatment \n     for S corporation banks. S corporations that convert from C \n     corporations are denied certain interest deductions \n     (preference items) for up to 3 years after the conversion, at \n     the end of three years the deductions are allowed.\n       Provides that non-health care related fringe benefits such \n     as group-term life insurance will be excludable from wages \n     for ``more-than-two-percent'' shareholders. Current law taxes \n     the fringe benefits of these shareholders. Health care \n     related benefits are not included because their deductibility \n     would increase the revenue impact of the legislation.\n       Permits Family Limited Partnerships to be shareholders in \n     Subchapter S corporations. Many family owned small businesses \n     are organized as Family Limited Partnerships or controlled by \n     Family Limited Partnerships for a variety of reasons. A \n     number of small banks have Family Limited Partnership \n     shareholders, and this legislation would for the first time \n     permit those partnerships to be S corporation shareholders.\n       Permits S corporations to issue preferred stock in addition \n     to common. Prohibited under current law which permits S \n     corporations to have only one class of stock. Because of \n     limitations on the number of common shareholders, banks need \n     to be able to issue preferred stock in order to have adequate \n     access to equity.\n       Reduces the required level of shareholder consent to \n     convert to an S corporation from unanimous to 90 percent of \n     shares. Non-consenting shareholders retain their stock, with \n     such stock treated as C corporation stock. The procedures for \n     consent are clarified in order to streamline the process.\n       Clarifies that Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiaries (QSSS) \n     provide information returns under their own tax id number. \n     This can help avoid confusion by depositors and other parties \n     over the insurance of deposits and the payer of salaries and \n     interest.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of the \nfinancial services legislation now before us. Like many of my \ncolleagues, Mr. President, this marks my 19th year of trying to improve \nfinancial services. We haven't done much in 19 years, but I am hoping \nthis 20th year is the charm.\n  Today, however, regrettably I have a few doubts. As much as anyone in \nthe Senate, I want to see modernization pass, and I want to see it pass \nnow. The bill is critical to the vitality of New York's economy. New \nYork City is the financial capital of the world.\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\n  As I have said time and time again, financial modernization \nlegislation is critical to ensuring that our financial institutions are \ncompetitive at home and abroad. Because of the entrepreneurialness of \nAmerica, particularly in financial services, we dominate the world. \nHundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are employed in every \none of the 50 great States because of our dominance in this area. And \neven as things that have happened in America spread to Europe and Asia, \nit is more and more American companies that are taking the lead and \ndoing them. That is because we are technologically, entrepreneurially, \nand in innovation ahead of just about every other country in the world \nin financial services. So today we are the financial capital. We are \nthe leaders. But we may not be tomorrow. Our superiority is not some \nhistorical inevitability. We need to compete in order to win. And we \ncannot compete in the present context of the laws.\n  Mr. President, when I came to the Congress in 1981, I was strongly \nsupportive of the Glass-Steagall law. It seemed to me very simple--that \nwhile my inclination would be to allow financial institutions to do \nwhatever they chose, they should not take part in risky activities with \ninsured dollars. In those days, many of the banking institutions in the \ncountry wanted to use their insured dollars for the riskiest of \nactivities. Some of us, even back in the early eighties, warned against \nit, and we were like voices against the wind.\n  I will never forget an amendment of the Banking Committee in the \nHouse, sponsored by the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Roemer, and \nmyself, that said no S, for instance, could use insured dollars for \nequity investments in real estate. It lost by one vote. Had it passed, \nAmerica would have saved $200 billion.\n  But as a result of the awful S crisis, we were able to come closer \ntogether on financial services. One of the great ironies is that in the \nearly eighties, when many had said let everybody do everything, even \nwith insured dollars, and they deadlocked with those of us who felt--\nsome felt that each institution should be pigeon-holed, but others felt \ndon't pigeon-hole institutions but pigeon-hole insured dollars and make \nsure they only go to low-risk types of activities. But the S crisis \nallowed us to come together because everyone realized that insured \ndollars should not be used for risky activities.\n  And so in the early and middle nineties, legislation was crafted that \nallowed institutions to underwrite, sell, and even be agents for all \nvarieties of financial services, but that successfully walled off \ninsured dollars from the rest. This is good legislation. And so in the \nlast few years, I--who was regarded, I guess, as one of the leading \nopponents of modernization--became an advocate. I was proud to support \nthe modernization bill that reached the floor of the House last year. \nIn fact, I persuaded a good number of my New York colleagues to support \nit and it passed by one vote.\n\n  We found a good model, Mr. President; we ought to stick with it. \nThere was balance in that model. There was bipartisanship in that \nmodel. It worked. Yet, we come here to the floor of the Senate today, \nwith financial services at risk. They are at risk because even though \nwe had a plan that had almost everyone's support, that is not the bill \ncoming to the floor today.\n  One of the main sticking points is CRA. CRA is supported by most of \nthe financial institutions in my State, while those who seek to lift \nCRA say that it is a terrible burden for the financial institutions. I \nseem to hear that more from some of my colleagues in the Senate than \nfrom the institutions that it is supposed to help. In fact, if you \nsurveyed the major banks and major insurance companies and major \nsecurities firms in my State of New York, almost every one would say \nthey were happy to support last year's H.R. 10 and would be happy to \nsupport it again this year.\n  They realize that CRA has been an important tool for building \ncommunities across America. It has been at work in my State, whether it \nbe in the inner city, which in the past was starved for capital, or \nwhether it be in rural areas, also starved for capital. Individuals, \nhomeowners, small builders, small business people, from the Adirondack \nMountains and from the South Bronx, have come and said, ``Senator, make \nsure we keep CRA.''\n  The amazing thing is that CRA has worked. While in the past financial \ninstitutions, banks, would write off whole areas because it was hard to \nfind the good loans, the economical loans, CRA forced them to go in and \nnow they find they are making money by lending money in rural areas and \ninner-city areas. So it works. All of a sudden, we see that these \nprovisions, widely accepted by the industry, widely accepted in a \nbipartisan measure in the House this year, accepted last year by the \nSenate Banking Committee by a 16-2 vote margin, are ready to scuttle \nthe whole bill.\n  Let me say this: I fear that the Community Reinvestment Act \nprovisions in the bill before us would doom modernization's failure \nonce again, doom modernization to partisanship, doom modernization to a \nPresidential veto. It cannot and should not be the monkey wrench that \ngrinds modernization to a halt. CRA or removing CRA should not be the \nmonkey wrench that grinds modernization to a halt.\n\n  I greatly respect the views of our chairman. He is a towering \nintellect--somebody I joust with on many occasions and have always done \nit in a respectful way so that we each enjoyed it and went away shaking \nhands.\n  I say to my chairman that I understand his strongly held views. But \nif you believe that financial modernization is important, given the \nconsensus that CRA has built through most parts of this country and \namong most Members of both parties--the House, for instance, passed a \nbill with a similar CRA provision as the Sarbanes substitute by a 51 to \n8 margin--I ask the chairman to reexamine it, and again not have his \nstrong feelings about CRA be the monkey wrench that undoes the whole \nfinancial services construct.\n  Strangely enough, it is not the passions of the many in the House but \nrather the passions of the few in the Senate that are causing us \nproblems today. This is a reversal of what has usually happened.\n  The bill's provisions that undermine CRA will clearly cause a \nPresidential veto. It caused all of the Democrats on the committee to \nvote against the bill.\n  One thing we have learned in financial services in this long, \ntortuous, and sad history is that unless we have bipartisan support, a \nbill such as this with so many conflicting interests will fail. It is \nmy hope we can today move this bill forward by setting aside \npartisanship and confrontation and replacing it with pragmatism and \ncompromise.\n  There are certain provisions in the Democratic substitute that I \ndon't particularly like. I am giving serious thought to the affiliate \nop-sub issue. In the past I have strongly been for the affiliates for \nthe same Glass-Steagall reasons I mentioned before. I talked to the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who feels strongly on the other side, and he \nhas modified the bill to meet some of the objections I have. But I \ndon't want to let my views on that issue hold up the bill.\n  It is my hope similarly with CRA that we will act with dispatch. It \nis my hope that the Senate will adopt the CRA provisions of the \nDemocratic substitute and we can move this bill forward to conference \nassured that we have created a bill that has sufficient support to pass \nthe Senate on a bipartisan basis, assured that we have created a bill \nthat will finally, after 20 years, be signed into law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have been trying to accommodate \nMembers who wish to make opening statements. We have been forbearing on \noffering the substitute, which is in order under the agreement as the \nfirst amendment. I guess I am really just trying to let colleagues know \nthat I am sort of close to being ready to offer the substitute. I don't \nknow whether there are others who want to make an opening statement \nbefore we get to that. I see the Senator from Nebraska may be \ninterested in doing so. I withhold. Obviously, Members, once the \nsubstitute is offered, can make statements, too. But I withhold. I see \nthe Senator is seeking recognition.\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on this side I think we have at least two \nMembers right now who want to be recognized to make opening statements. \nI request we go ahead and give them an opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 900, the Financial \nServices Modernization Act of 1999. As a member of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, I am proud to have played a small role in writing this bill.\n  America's financial services companies operate under a regulatory \nregime that dates back to the Great Depression. Our banks, insurance, \nand securities firms are bound by artificial barriers that do not \nrecognize the current realities of the global marketplace. The reality \nis this: That the line separating these industries have been blurred by \nthe evolution of new financial products and technology.\n  Securities firms, insurance companies, and banks already affiliate \nwith one another, because the marketplace demands it. However, these \naffiliations cannot lead to full and fair competition or the full \npotential benefits for consumers because of the Glass-Steagall Act and \nits legal barriers.\n  Clearly, it is time for Congress to modernize U.S. financial service \nregulations and introduce full and open competition across the banking \nsecurities and insurance industries. S. 900 would accomplish that.\n  Passage of this bill will benefit consumers in two basic ways: First, \nallowing competition among banks, securities firms, and insurance \ncompanies will lead to lower costs and higher savings for consumers. \nSecond, this competition will strengthen our financial service firms \nthat are integral to the health of the American economy.\n  A 1995 Bureau of Economic Analysis report estimated that increased \ncompetition in the financial services industry would save consumers \nnearly $3 billion a year. I realize, Mr. President, that $3 billion may \nnot seem to be a large figure around here, but in places such as \nScottsbluff, NE, and other towns in my State that is real money.\n  If we don't modernize our laws governing the delivery of financial \nservices, then we will put our companies and our industries at a severe \ndisadvantage in the global arena.\n  Today, the United States is the world leader in financial services. \nWe must not jeopardize this position through congressional inaction. \nJust as exports of manufactured goods and commodities have become \nincreasingly important to the growth of our Nation's economy, so are \nour exports of financial services very important to our economy's \ngrowth.\n  Our global position was strengthened by the conclusion of a historic \nfinancial services side agreement to the Uruguay Round of GATT. It is \nironic that the United States pushed hard for this agreement to reduce \nbarriers to competition abroad while our domestic market continues to \noperate under a 1930s regulatory regime. It is time to tear down \nbarriers to competition in our domestic markets and ensure that our \nindustries are able to continue to compete at home and abroad.\n  The members of the Senate Banking Committee took a hard look at this \nimportant issue surrounding financial modernization. S. 900 balances \nthe sense of urgency surrounding passage of financial services reform \nlegislation with the need to ensure that the legislation responds to \nfuture marketplace dynamics and not just to today's realities and \npolitical pressures.\n\n  Is this legislation perfect? No, it is not perfect. There are far too \nmany competing and important interests involved in this legislation. \nAnd perfection means different things to different people. But this \nbill does achieve a very workable and relevant and realistic balance \nbetween the politics of financial modernization and sound public \npolicy.\n  Some of my colleagues have alleged that this bill is only going to \nhelp large financial institutions and will not help small banks. This \nis not true. S. 900 includes some very important changes, for example, \nto the Federal home loan bank system. These changes are very important \nto small banks everywhere across this country, not just in the rural \nStates, such as my State of Nebraska, but in urban communities and \nlarge cities as well.\n  The Federal home loan bank provisions in S. 900 will strengthen local \ncommunity banks that are vital to the economic growth and viability of \nall communities. They will ensure that in an era of banking \nmegamergers, smaller banks are able to compete effectively and continue \nto serve their customers' lending needs.\n  These provisions are supported by all of the major banking trade \norganizations. There are many specific dynamics to improving the \nmarketplace and the ability for the small institutions to compete. Many \nof my colleagues this afternoon have detailed those changes rather \nwell.\n  It is important, Mr. President, to modernize our financial service \nlaws to ensure that our companies can compete in this new global \nmarketplace. As barriers to trade come down, our financial service \nfirms must be prepared to take advantage of new global opportunities.\n  Congress can help them prepare by giving them the flexibility they so \ndesperately need. S. 900 provides this flexibility. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its speedy passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not a member of the Banking \nCommittee, although I have served there from time to time. I don't have \nan opening statement in the normal sense of the word because I don't \nintend to address the specific provisions in the bill, but rather to \nsay to those who are on the committee, and in particular the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Gramm, while many may not understand and \nappreciate the significance of the banking and financing institutions \nof the United States, and some may even come to the floor, as my good \nfriend, Senator Wellstone, and talk about when we might get on to some \nbusiness in the Senate that really helps people, that prompted me to \ncome down and talk about something that I think is very, very people-\noriented.\n  As a matter of fact, I have given a number of talks to fellow \nAmericans. When I have asked, what do you think is the most significant \nthing institutionally about the United States that contributes to the \nopportunities we have in our daily lives to live better lives? Then I \nanswer for them and say, it is the financing system in the United \nStates.\n  There is no doubt about what helps the average man buy a car, buy a \nhouse, make renovations to his house, perhaps even buy a second cabin, \nor a second car for his children, those things which, when added up, \nmake America the most prosperous Nation on Earth, the country that has \npeople with more material wealth--if that is what measures the validity \nof a society--than any other nation in the world. It is that we can \nfinance purchases. We can finance what we buy, we can pay for it over \ntime, and of late we are getting the interest rates down where they \nought to be, as low as possible.\n\n  This is the best thing for Americans in their day-by-day life which \npermits them to use their salary and their earnings in a way that will \nlet them spread out the costs of items that they need over a period of \ntime, with a reasonable and rational finance plan.\n  It is absolutely important that from time to time, even though in the \nCongress we don't like to legislate items like a brand-new banking and \nfinance bill--it is tedious for some, it is difficult, and for many it \ndoesn't even seem like anything exciting we ought to be doing in the \nSenate. However, realizing what it does for our people, it ought to be \nfull speed ahead to get to the floor with a good bill to modernize the \nbanking and financing system of this country.\n  Earlier in our history, almost everything was financed through banks \nand the type of institutions that are principally the subject matter of \nthis bill. Because we didn't modernize the system soon enough, \nfinancing is done in various ways--perhaps there is more financing done \noutside the banking system than there is in the banking system per se. \nInsurance companies do financing; companies that are big\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nenough do their own financing of appliances; clearly, institutions that \nare not banks and not subject to banking rules or financing purchases.\n  When it comes to measuring a country's long-term success and the \ninternational markets and the day-by-day availability of good credit \nand soundness of our economy, we have to always look to the banking \nsystem. As a matter of fact, just think a moment of the past 3 years \nwhen things have gone wrong in other countries, when some of these \ncountries went almost totally bankrupt. What led such failures? It was \nfrequently led by the failure of their banking system. That should say \nsomething when we see that all around us.\n  Why is the country of Japan, that many people 15 years ago said we \nshould mimic--obviously we don't choose to speak that way today; I \nnever spoke about it even 15 years ago--what has happened to Japan \ntoday? They don't want to face up to the fact their financing \ninstitutions are in a state of chaos, if not bankruptcy. It is tough \nfor them to admit.\n  We didn't want to admit it when our savings and loans were going \nbankrupt. We didn't want to come up with the money it took to bail out \nthe depositors who were guaranteed their money, up to $100,000, who \nfinanced the S banking system in the United States, but we finally \ndid it. We saved it. We spent a lot of money doing it.\n  In a very real sense, those who are managing this bill, including my \ngood friend from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, and obviously the \nchairman, who I have already mentioned, are contributing a very vital \nquality to American life by trying to modernize the financial and \nbanking system of the United States.\n  As my good friend from Nebraska said, what we have is too old, too \nancient. It is not modern. It is not taking care of modern problems. It \nis not helping banks grow in a way they can and should to be modern \ninstitutions of financing.\n  I commend and laud those on the committee who have worked hard. I \nhope even with our differences we will get a bill. I read a letter from \nthe President saying if certain things are in the bill, he will veto \nit. This letter was directed to the distinguished chairman, Senator \nGramm. We know the executive branch has a couple of strong feelings \nabout this bill; perhaps the Senate has equally strong feelings about \nthe same items.\n  On the other hand, I believe when we are finished and go to \nconference and work this through with the House and with the \nadministration in an effort to get a bill that is sound, reform-minded, \nmodern and yet protects certain interests that the banking system is \ncurrently helping and protecting, we will get a bill. The opportunity \ndoesn't come very often for Congress to reform a significant portion of \nour capitalist system.\n  I will make one other observation. For anyone who doesn't think \ncapital--which is the substance of banks--isn't important to a \ncapitalist society, let me suggest that the last 3 years ought to prove \nit up in America in spades. While many economies in the world were in a \nstate of bankruptcy, couldn't buy our goods and were having great \neconomic difficulty, what happened to America? Our consumers bought \nmore rather than less. Interest rates went down rather than up. There \nwas more money for almost any venture desired because the banking \nsystem in our country was the greatest safe haven for capital that the \nworld has ever seen. That meant anyone with extra money sent it here. \nThus, that money was available to finance purchases in America, bring \ninterest rates down rather than up.\n  The question is, What will happen when the world economy goes the \nother direction? Frankly, we ought to have a modernized banking system \nwhen that occurs. It is predicted that America's prosperity may turn a \nlittle bit in the wrong direction within 3 to 5 years. If it lasts 5 \nyears, it will be astronomical in terms of a previous growth period. We \nhave learned that the availability of a lot of capital in a capitalist \nsystem such as ours can make this economy grow and prosper in a way we \nhad never quite figured out until we became almost totally dependent \nupon that.\n\n  There are signs all over the place that this great opportunistic land \nof ours needs a good, sound, solvent, and modern banking system. I came \ndown to make sure those listening understand this is not a bill for \nbankers. This is not a bill for rich people. This is a bill to let a \nbanking and finance system work for Americans--whether they are \nfinancing a home, whether they are moderate-income people, whether they \nare financing an education for their kids, whatever it may be. We have \nto have a sound set of financial rules in America for Americans to grow \nand prosper.\n  American business needs to borrow money, and clearly a banking system \nhas to be ready and able to do that for the American business people \nhere and abroad. It cannot be done with a system that is hog tied with \nancient rules and regulations that don't meet today's times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank both my Republican colleagues for great \nstatements. I think the Senator from New Mexico reminded us of the \nsuccesses of our banking system and how we should appreciate it. I \nthink he made a very good statement. My colleague from Nebraska, who is \nworking real hard on the Banking Committee with the chairman and all \nmembers on the Banking Committee, I appreciate his effort and help on \nthese very important issues. He has contributed considerably to this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 302\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, pursuant to the order that is governing \nour consideration of this bill, at least currently, I send an amendment \nin the nature of a substitute to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for Mr. Daschle, \n     for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bryan, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bayh and Mr. Edwards \n     proposes an amendment numbered 302.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I have indicated earlier in the \ncourse of the opening debate on this issue, we are very anxious on our \nside to have financial service modernization legislation, and most of \nus subscribe to the proposition of allowing affiliations between banks, \nsecurity firms, and insurance companies.\n  However, as I have indicated, that is not the only issue before us. \nWe have to consider that question in the context of addressing \nimportant questions of providing credit in all communities in our \ncountry; namely, the Community Reinvestment Act issue. We have to \nconsider how these activities are to be done, whether they are to be \ndone solely in an affiliate, outside of the banking structure, or \nwhether banks will have the opportunity either to use the affiliate or \nto do it in an operating subsidiary. We have the important issue of the \nlong historical separation between banking and commerce, which has \nprevailed in this country. And we have other aspects of the legislation \nwhich I think are of importance, including important provisions with \nrespect to consumer protection.\n  As we have indicated earlier, we were not able to support this \nlegislation in the committee and the legislation was brought to the \nfloor on an 11-to-9 vote. The alternative, which we have now offered, \njust offered, and which is at the desk, is, in effect, the bill that \nthe committee reported last year on a 16-to-2 vote with the one \nsubstantial change of providing for the operating subsidiary approach. \nThat is now contained in the alternative, the substitute amendment \nwhich I have sent to the desk.\n  Last year some very careful compromises were worked out in order to \nmove this legislation forward on a consensus basis. Unfortunately, that \nhas\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nnot been the case this year, and the legislation that was developed in \nthe committee was reported by the majority but contained no supporting \nvote from any of the Democratic members of the committee. The proposal \nbefore us, S. 900, the bill from the committee, is strongly opposed by \na great number of civil rights groups, community groups, consumer \norganizations, and local government officials. People within the \nfinancial services industry have mixed views on some of the provisions \nof S. 900, and of course the President has indicated that he will veto \nthe committee bill.\n  Unfortunately, we have this sharp contrast with last year's \nbipartisan approach. I think it is fair to say that none of the \nindustry association groups oppose the substitute. They have been \ncaught in the switches, so to speak, on this issue, and subjected to \nconsiderable persuasion. But I think it is fair to say that the \nprovisions that are in the substitute will pass muster. These \nprovisions also are fairly close to what the House Banking Committee \nhas done by a 51-to-8 bipartisan vote. So we think the approach \ncontained in the substitute just sent to the desk stands the greatest \nchance of finally being enacted into law. This substitute amendment, in \neffect, would put us on a path, at the end of which we could obtain the \nPresident's signature and get legislation.\n  Let me briefly seek to contrast the substitute and S. 900, the bill \nbrought from the committee. It should be clearly understood that there \nis an intense view on this side of the aisle, and I believe shared by \nat least a few on the other side of the aisle, that the Community \nReinvestment Act has really been a very significant and constructive \npublic policy. It has improved the availability of credit in low- and \nmoderate-income communities. There is example after example, and we \nwill put those in the Record as this debate develops, where the CRA \nlending and investments have brought life to previously neglected \ncommunities and given people not only hope, but the ability to move up \nthe American ladder of opportunity. It has helped to alleviate credit \nneeds and improve services in rural areas and on Native American \nreservations. It has had a significant impact on home ownership amongst \nminority groups, African Americans and Hispanic Americans, whose \nnumbers in terms of home ownership have increased dramatically, and \neveryone who goes and observes that phenomenon reports back that the \nCRA has had a considerable role to play in that very important \nobjective.\n\n  The President has stated:\n\n       [W]e should all be proud of what [CRA] has meant for low \n     and moderate-income Americans of all races. Although we still \n     have a long way to go in bringing all Americans into the \n     economic mainstream, under CRA the private sector has pumped \n     billions of dollars of credit to build housing, create jobs \n     and restore hope in communities left behind.\n\n  It is for this reason that farm groups, labor unions, mayors all \nacross the country, community development corporations, Hispanic \norganizations, Asian American, Native American--this has had a \nsignificant impact on the Indian reservations across the country--and \ncivil rights groups all support retaining the effectiveness of CRA.\n  I will include in the Record at the end of my remarks letters from \nthese various organizations detailing their very strong view about CRA, \nand in effect their support for this substitute.\n  The substitute requires that banks should have at least a \nsatisfactory CRA rating before they can affiliate with securities and \ninsurance firms, and that they would have to maintain that rating to \ncontinue the new affiliation. These provisions are essential in order \nto maintain the effectiveness of CRA within the expanded holding \ncompany structure. Capital, management, and CRA performance are at \nissue when an institution files an application for deposit insurance, a \ncharter, a merger, an acquisition or other corporate reorganization, a \nbranch or the relocation of a home office or branch.\n  If you are going to allow banks for the first time in a comprehensive \nway to engage in insurance and securities activities, then it is \nimportant that those banks, before they can do that, meet the CRA test. \nOtherwise, you are going to have a situation in which financial \ninstitutions could enter into additional activities, even if they were \ndeficient in their CRA performance.\n  As the FDIC Chairman, Donna Tanoue stated:\n\n       The bank and thrift regulatory agencies consistently take \n     into account an insured institution's record of performance \n     under CRA when considering an application to open or relocate \n     a branch, a main office, or acquire or merge with another \n     institution. As this legislation would enable institutions to \n     enter into additional activities, it would seem consistent \n     that CRA compliance should continue to be a determining \n     factor.\n  Last year, we worked out these CRA provisions in the bill that was \nreported out of the committee. And the consensus, a 16-2 vote, \ncontained these important CRA provisions.\n  This year, the provision requiring a satisfactory rating as a \nprecondition of expanded affiliations is absent from the committee-\nreported bill. There are two provisions in the committee-reported bill \nwhich we feel very strongly contribute to undermining the application \nof CRA.\n  This substitute amendment, unlike the committee bill, requires banks \nhave and maintain satisfactory CRA ratings in order to engage in and \nmaintain expanded affiliations. To fail to do so would allow banks, for \nthe first time, to move out in terms of the activities they can engage \nin, in a comprehensive way--both securities and insurance--without the \nbank that is going to do that having to meet the CRA test.\n  It does not apply, the CRA, to the insurance and securities \nactivities, although many CRA advocates want to do exactly that. It \nonly requires that the bank, as a condition of affiliation, meet the \nCRA performance standards.\n  As Secretary Rubin has stated:\n\n       If we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time when \n     the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and the \n     establishment of non-bank financial services will become \n     increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly \n     authorized activities should be connected to a satisfactory \n     CRA performance.\n\n  Let me turn to the other CRA issues that are, in effect, posed by the \nsubstitute as compared to the committee-reported bill.\n  The second provision of the committee bill that weakens CRA is its \nsafe harbor for banks with a ``satisfactory'' or better CRA rating. \nThis is, banks would be deemed in compliance with CRA if they had in \neach of their three preceding examinations received a satisfactory \nrating. Groups, in fact, would not be able to comment about CRA \nperformance unless they could carry the very heavy burden of providing \nsubstantial, verifiable information to the contrary.\n  The Federal bank regulatory agencies oppose this provision. They \nagree that a satisfactory CRA rating is not conclusive evidence that a \nbank is meeting the credit needs of all of its communities. On the \ncontrary, they welcome comments from the public regarding the CRA \nperformance of the institutions they supervise.\n  For example, Ellen Seidman, Director of the Office of Supervision \nsaid:\n\n       [w]e generally find that the information received from \n     those few who do comment on applications is relevant, \n     constructive, and thoughtful, and frequently raise issues \n     that need to be considered. In order for us to reach a \n     supportable disposition on an application, and satisfy our \n     statutory responsibilities, we need to have public input.\n\n  Public comment is especially useful in the case of large banks \nserving multiple markets, because regulators sample only a portion of \nthese markets to determine the institution's CRA rating. Public comment \nprovides an opportunity for community members to point out facts and \ndata that may have been overlooked in a particular examination.\n  In fact, the provision that is in the committee bill would preclude \nlooking at anything that took place prior to the past examinations if \nthose examinations produced a satisfactory rating.\n  It is very clear that this safe harbor provision of the committee \nbill would stifle public comment on banks' and thrifts' CRA \nperformance. This is so because nearly all banks and thrifts receive \nsatisfactory or better CRA ratings, well up into the 90s, 90-percentile \nfigures.\n  The committee majority asserts that the public comment process has \nbeen routinely abused, but that assertion is not supported by the \nrecord. We get these sort of examples that are brought in. There has \nnever been a full-scale hearing on this issue. All of the statistical \ninformation from the regulatory\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nagencies indicate that there has not been abuse of the public comment \nprocess. The vast majority of applications reviewed on CRA grounds are \napproved in a timely manner. Many do not receive any adverse comments. \nVery few applications that receive adverse CRA comments are delayed.\n  The substantial, verifiable information would really knock community \ngroups and ordinary citizens out of being able to comment in any \nmeaningful way. As the FDIC Chairman Tanoue stated, ``Public comments \nrelating to CRA should not bear a burden of proof that is not imposed \non public comment related to any other aspect of a bank's \nperformance.''\n  The regulators take in all these comments and then they make their \njudgment. There seems to be a presumption here that when people come in \nand make a comment that somehow they then carry the day. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. The regulators collate all these comments, \nconsider them, and proceed to make their judgment. And the number of \ninstances in which CRA has been raised is a very small percentage of \nthe total.\n  The third way in which the committee bill attacks CRA is the \nexemption for rural institutions with less than $100 million in assets. \nThis would obviously have very severe consequences for low- and \nmoderate-income rural communities which depend heavily on small banks \nfor their credit needs.\n  It is asserted that these small banks, by their nature, serve the \ncredit needs of their local communities. However, historically, in the \nratings made by the regulators, small banks have received the lowest \nCRA ratings. Although many small banks do serve the needs of their \ncommunities, observers note that some small banks often invest in \nTreasury bonds rather than in their own communities.\n  Some have argued that you need an exemption in order to relieve the \nregulatory burden. The fact of the matter is, as the Federal bank \nregulators revised the CRA regulations in 1995 to reduce the cost of \ncompliance for small banks, the new rules provided a streamlined \nexamination for small banks. They exempted small banks from reporting \nrequirements. And they emphasized the institution's actual performance \nrather than paperwork.\n  The FDIC, the OTS, and the OCC support the application of CRA to \nsmall banks. FDIC Chairman Tanoue stated:\n\n       Although the vast majority of institutions satisfactorily \n     help to meet the credit needs of their communities, not all \n     institutions may do so over time, including small \n     institutions. Some institutions may unreasonably lend outside \n     of their communities, or arbitrarily exclude low- and \n     moderate-income areas or individuals within their \n     communities. We believe that periodic CRA examinations for \n     all insured depository institutions, regardless of asset-\n     size, are an effective means to ensure that institutions help \n     to meet the credit needs of their entire communities, \n     including low- and moderate-income areas.\n  Before I turn to that subject, let me again stress how critical the \nflow of credit, which has resulted from CRA, has been to the \nredevelopment of low- and moderate-income areas. The bill brought out \nof the committee, S. 900, would really close down opportunity for large \nnumbers of people in these low- and moderate-income communities to \nreally improve themselves, to move to home ownership, to open small \nbusinesses, to carry out the sort of community renewal which gives them \na better neighborhood in which to live.\n\n  I have heard these assertions, but we can take you through instance \nafter instance in which the impact of CRA has been such as to provide \nhope to communities and to lift them up and to enable people to move up \nthe ladder of opportunity. I do not know what could be more consistent \nwith an American goal or objective than to give people this opportunity \nto advance. And particularly the financial institutions, which are \nsubject to these CRA requirements, are prepared to abide by them. Many \nof them have given testimony about the beneficial impact it has had on \nthe community and the beneficial impact on their relationship with the \ncommunity.\n  Let me turn to the banking and commerce issue. Another aspect of the \ncommittee bill--and this is an important part of the substitute--that \ndiffers significantly from the substitute amendment is its approach to \nthe separation of banking and commerce. In an important respect, the \ncommittee bill breaches the separation of banking and commerce, and \nthis could lead to biased lending decisions and may well ultimately put \nthe taxpayer-backed deposit insurance funds at risk.\n  Now, this separation of banking and commerce is a longstanding \nprinciple in American law, dating back over now almost 140 years to the \nNational Bank Act of 1864, which specifically forbids banks to engage \nin or invest in commercial or industrial activities. Under existing \nlaw, a commercial firm, such as General Motors or Microsoft, may not \nown a bank or be owned by a bank. We have tried to draw a line there. \nThere has been some fuzzing of that line, but not much.\n\n  In 1956, the Congress enacted the Bank Holding Company Act, which \nprohibited commercial firms from owning banks and prohibited holding \ncompanies owning two or more banks from owning commercial firms. This \npolicy was strengthened by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of \n1970, which extended the prohibition on owning commercial firms to \nholding companies owning just one bank. In other words, it drew a very \nsharp line.\n  In submitting the 1970 amendments, President Nixon said:\n\n       The strength of our banking system depends largely on its \n     independence. Banking must not dominate commerce or be \n     dominated by it.\n\n  Now, why do we have this principle of separating banking and commerce \nin U.S. law? Because allowing banks to affiliate with commercial firms \nraises concerns relating to risk to the deposit insurance fund, the \nimpartial granting of credit, unfair competition, and concentration of \neconomic power. A bank affiliated with a commercial firm would have an \nincentive to make loans to that firm, even if the firm were less \ncreditworthy than other borrowers. The bank would have a similar \nincentive not to lend to the firm's competitors, even if they were \ncreditworthy.\n  Financial experts have pointed out these dangers. Secretary Rubin \ntestified that mixing banking and commerce:\n\n       . . . might pose additional, unforeseen and undue risk to \n     the safety and soundness of the financial system, potentially \n     exposing the federal deposit Insurance funds and taxpayers to \n     substantial losses. . . . Equally uncertain is the effect \n     such combinations might have on the cost and availability of \n     credit to numerous diverse borrowers and on the concentration \n     of economic resources.\n\n  The leading economist Henry Kaufman warned that mixing banking and \ncommerce would lead to conflicts of interest and unfair competition in \nthe allocation of credit. In his view:\n\n       . . . a large corporation that controls a big bank would \n     use the bank for extending credit to those who can benefit \n     the whole organization. . . . The bank would be inclined to \n     withhold credit from those who are or could be competitors to \n     the parent corporation. Thus, the cornerstone of effective \n     banking, independent credit decisions based on objective \n     evaluation of creditworthiness, would be undermined.\n\n  Public interest groups have made the same point. Consumers Union \ntestified that it opposes:\n\n       . . . permitting federally-insured institutions to combine \n     with commercial interests because of the potential to skew \n     the availability of credit, conflict of interest issues, and \n     general safety and soundness concerns from expanding the \n     safety net provided by the government.\n\n  The difficulties experienced in Asia demonstrate the risks associated \nwith mixing banking and commerce. Both Secretary Rubin and Chairman \nGreenspan testified that the financial crisis in Asia was made worse by \nimprudent lending by banks to affiliated commercial firms. In other \nwords, if you cross that line and put the commercial firm in the bank--\nas it were, in the same pot--you run a heavy risk, as was exemplified \nin the Asian financial crisis, of imprudent lending.\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wrote, recent experience \nwith the banking crises in countries as different in their stages of \ndevelopment as Japan, Indonesia and Russia demonstrate the folly of \npermitting industrial financial conglomerates to dominate financial \nmarkets in potentially large areas of the economy.\n  The substitute amendment tries to sustain this line between banking \nand commerce. The committee bill crosses this line in a number of \nrespects.\n  First of all, it permits bank affiliates to acquire any type of \ncompany in connection with merchant banking activities. However, the \ncommittee bill drops\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\ncertain safeguards that are in the substitute and that were in last \nyear's bipartisan bill. Those safeguards allowed merchant banking \ninvestment to be held only for such period of time as would permit the \nsale of the investment on a reasonable basis. It precluded the bank \naffiliate from actively participating in the day-to-day management of \nthe company.\n  The committee bill drops those safeguards. In effect, it would allow \na bank holding company to operate commercial companies of any size and \nin any industry for an unlimited period of time. This would break down \nthe separation of banking and commerce.\n  The substitute restores the safeguards that were in last year's bill.\n  Secondly, both the committee bill and the substitute amendment allow \nholding companies that own banks to engage in activities that are \nfinancial in nature or incidental to such financial activities. But the \ncommittee bill goes further by authorizing holding companies to engage \nin activities that are complementary activities that are financial in \nnature. It provides no definition or limitation of these complementary \nactivities and, therefore, raises the danger that these complementary \nactivities would be commercial in nature and cross the separation \nbetween banking and commerce. The substitute does not permit those \ncomplementary activities.\n\n  Finally, the committee bill does not close the unitary thrift company \nloophole. That loophole refers to the fact that a company that owns \njust one thrift, called a unitary thrift holding company, may also own \na commercial firm. There are currently over 500 thrifts owned by \nunitary holding companies. The vast majority of these are owned by \nfinancial firms. Now, both the committee bill and the substitute would \nprohibit the creation of new unitary thrift holding companies by \ncommercial firms. However, there is a sharp difference in that the \ncommittee bill would allow a commercial company to acquire any of the \n500 existing unitary thrift holding companies.\n  Now, obviously, if they can do that, if hundreds of commercial firms, \nin effect, can acquire a unitary thrift holding company, they can \neffectively obliterate the separation between banking and commerce. \nFinancial leaders and banking industry groups advise the committee to \nprohibit commercial firms from acquiring control of thrifts. Chairman \nGreenspan recommended that financial services modernization legislation \nat least prohibit, or significantly restrict, the ability of \ngrandfather unitary thrift holding companies to transfer their \nlegislatively created grandfather rights to another commercial \norganization.\n  Secretary Rubin observed that, ``without such a limit on \ntransferability, existing charters may tend to migrate to commercial \nfirms and could become a significant exception to the general \nprohibition against commercial ownership of depository institutions.''\n  Both the ABA and IBAA--the American Bankers Association and the \nIndependent Bankers Association of America--wrote to Senators yesterday \nexpressing their support for closing the unitary thrift holding company \nprovision, including restricting transferability of existing unitaries.\n  Now, let me turn briefly to some important consumer protection \nprovisions that are in the substitute amendment, but that are not in \nthe committee bill, and which we think make the substitute more \ndesirable legislation than the committee bill.\n  Obviously, if you are going to have a financial services \nmodernization bill, you must ensure adequate consumer protection. We \nneed to be sure that consumer protections keep pace with changes taking \nplace in the financial market. In recent years, banking securities and \ninsurance products have become more similar. A wider variety of \nfinancial products is available through banks. This increases potential \ncustomer confusion about the risks of the product the customer is \nbuying, who is selling it, and whether or not it is insured by the \nFDIC. Measures such as disclosure to customers and licensing of \npersonnel can help keep such misunderstandings to a minimum, and such a \nprovision should be included in any financial services modernization \nbill.\n  Unfortunately, the committee bill fails to include a number of \nimportant consumer protection provisions that passed the committee \noverwhelmingly last year, and which we have now included in the \nsubstitute that is now before the body.\n  Very quickly, on insurance sales, while some of the provisions of \nlast year's bill relating to insurance sales have been substituted into \nthe committee bill--that was done in the committee--but more remains to \nbe done. The substitute amendment would require Federal bank regulators \nto establish mechanisms for receiving and addressing consumer \ncomplaints--something that is completely absent in the committee bill.\n  The substitute amendment would provide that Federal regulations would \nsupersede State regulations when the Federal regulations afforded \ngreater protection for consumers. The committee bill allows State \nregulations to prevail even if it offers less protection to consumers.\n  With respect to securities activities, the committee bill provides \nless protection for consumers than does the substitute amendment.\n  Currently, banks enjoy a total exemption from the definitions of \n``broker,'' ``dealer'' and ``investment advisor'' under the Federal \nsecurities law. Because of this blanket exemption, consumers who \npurchase securities from banks do not receive any of the protections of \nthe securities laws, which in many ways are superior to those offered \nby the banking laws. For example, broker-dealer personnel have an \nobligation to recommend to their clients only transactions that are \nsuitable based on their client's tolerance for risk, overall portfolio, \nand so forth.\n  Bank personnel have no such obligation. Broker-dealer personnel must \npass licensing exams and are subject to continuing education \nrequirements. Bank personnel are exempt from these requirements. \nDisciplinary histories of broker-dealer personnel are made publicly \navailable to investors. No such history is available regarding bank \npersonnel. Broker-dealer managers have a duty to supervise their sales \npersonnel, which is enforceable under the Federal securities laws. Bank \nmanagers do not.\n\n  Finally, customer disputes with brokerage firms are subject to \narbitration, which offers a specialized, quicker and cheaper forum for \nsettling disputes. No arbitration exists for customer disputes with \nbanks.\n  Now, the committee bill, like the substitute amendment, would repeal \nthe total exemption banks enjoy from the definition of broker and \ndealer. Also, like the substitute amendment, the committee bill \ncontains a number of exceptions that allow certain securities \nactivities to continue to take place directly within banks. However, \nthe exceptions in the committee bill are significantly wider than those \nin the substitute amendment. Let me just mention some of those \nimportant differences.\n  The committee bill allows a bank trust department conducting \nsecurities transactions to be compensated on a transaction-by-\ntransaction basis, just like a broker. Where the substitute amendment \nallows a bank to sell unregistered securities exclusively to \nsophisticated investors, the committee bill allows a bank to sell \nunregistered securities to all investors.\n  Finally, the committee bill prohibits the SEC from determining that a \nnew product is a security and, therefore, must be sold by an SEC-\nregistered broker-dealer, unless the Federal Reserve concurs. Over \ntime, this will move even more securities activities directly into \nbanks. The substitute amendment would afford the SEC the first \nopportunity to define new products as securities.\n  The committee bill also leaves the SEC with less authority over bank-\nadvised mutual funds and with less ability to protect investors in \nthose funds.\n  Now, the substitute amendment requires the Federal banking regulators \nto issue regulations regarding the sale of securities by banks and bank \naffiliates. The bank regulators would have established mechanisms to \nreview and address consumer complaints. The committee bill does not \ninclude this provision.\n  No one of these provisions that I made reference to may seem to be of \nmajor import. But all of them taken together, I think, indicate that \nthe protections for consumers that are contained in the substitute \namendment\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nsignificantly exceed those that are in the committee-reported bill.\n  Another area in which the committee bill departs from last year's \nagreement regards a special deposit insurance assessment paid by \nthrifts.\n  Prior to 1996, thrifts paid a higher assessment rate than banks did \nfor interest payments on certain bonds issued to pay for the resolution \nof the savings and loan crisis, so-called ``FICO bonds.'' In 1996, \nCongress acted to close this assessment differential on FICO bonds. The \nrates were to be equalized until January 1, 2000, and the bill that we \nreported last year left the 1996 agreement intact. The committee bill \nnow before us would extend this assessment differential for another 3 \nyears, so that thrifts would continue to pay a higher assessment rate \nfor another 3 years.\n  This may well lead institutions to shift their deposits from the \nthrift insurance fund to the bank insurance fund, which might well \ncreate stability problems for the thrift insurance fund.\n  Chairman Tanoue has written that this provision serves no positive \npublic policy purpose. And it is not in the substitute amendment that \nis now before us.\n  Let me now turn to an issue in which my colleague, the chairman of \nthe committee, has spent a considerable amount of time here on the \nfloor today in pointing out the differences between the substitute that \nis now before us and the committee bill.\n\n  All of these provisions I have thus far enumerated were essentially \ncontained in the bill that was reported last year by the committee on a \n16-to-2 vote. The one area in which the substitute amendment differs \nfrom last year's bipartisan bill is its treatment of operating \nsubsidiaries and banks.\n  Last year's bill contemplated that principal activities, such as \nunderwriting securities and insurance, would take place in a holding \ncompany's subsidiary rather than bank subsidiaries. Certain agency \nactivities such as sales of insurance were permitted in bank \nsubsidiaries.\n  This approach was supported by the Federal Reserve. It was opposed by \nthe Treasury Department. That was an important difference last year. It \nremains an important difference this year.\n  As the legislative process has proceeded, the Treasury Department has \nagreed to significant additional safeguards regarding the scope and \nregulation of bank subsidiaries' activities. With these safeguards, it \nappeared to us that banks should be given the option of conducting \nfinancial activities in operating subsidiaries. That approach is \ncontained in the substitute amendment now before the Chamber.\n  President Clinton has indicated that he will veto the reported bill \nin part because ``it would deny financial services firms the freedom to \norganize themselves in a way that best serves their customers.''\n  Let me talk a bit about the safeguards, the changes in the sense that \nthe Treasury has agreed to, which I think now warrant allowing the \nbanking institution to have a choice. They wouldn't be required to do \nit in an op-sub. They could still do it in an affiliate. They could \nhave a choice between the two as a matter of their own organizational \npreference.\n  Last year, the Treasury was clear that they would not do real estate \nin the operating-sub. And they continue to hold to that position this \nyear. In addition, the Treasury last year agreed that insurance \nunderwriting may not take place in a bank subsidiary. This prohibition \non insurance underwriting would be in addition to an explicit \nprohibition on real estate development conducted by bank subsidiaries \nto which the Treasury agreed last year. So we have these two areas now \nthat were provided for and placed outside of the op-sub umbrella.\n  On merchant banking, the Treasury has agreed that the Federal Reserve \nshall have the authority to define merchant banking activities and bank \nsubsidiaries. This meaningful step on the part of the Treasury will \ncontribute to bank subsidiary activities being structured in a prudent \nfashion.\n  Merchant banking presents a potential breach in the separation of \nbanking and commerce. The possible dangers would be increased if two \ndifferent regulators were to define separately the dimensions of \npermissible merchant banking activities. Then to avoid the possibility \nthat would happen--that the dimensions of the permissible merchant \nbanking activities would be defined by two different regulators who \nwould have different concepts--in the substitute, we have the provision \nthat the Federal Reserve would have the exclusive authority to define \nmerchant banking activities and bank subsidiaries.\n  The Treasury has also agreed that the Secretary and the Federal \nReserve should jointly determine which activities are financial in \nnature, both for a holding company subsidiary and for a bank \nsubsidiary. Both the Secretary and the Federal Reserve would jointly \nissue regulations and interpretations under ``the financial in nature'' \nstandard. This would eliminate a potential competition between bank \nregulators.\n  Further, to place activities on an equal footing, the same conditions \nwould apply to a national bank seeking to exercise expanded affiliation \nthrough a subsidiary as a holding company seeking to exercise those \naffiliations. These conditions are that banks be well capitalized, well \nmanaged, and in compliance with CRA.\n  The Treasury also supports the application of the functional \nregulation of securities and insurance activities taking place in bank \nsubsidiaries just as it applies to holding company subsidiaries.\n  These provisions are all reflected in the substitute amendment.\n  In addition, the Treasury supports a requirement that national banks \nwith total assets of $10 billion or more retain a holding company, even \nif they choose to engage in expanded financial activities through \nsubsidiaries. This is designed to preserve the oversight that the \nFederal Reserve now has over the Nation's largest commercial banks \nthrough their holding company. So this was an effort by the Treasury to \naccommodate one of the concerns that had been repeatedly expressed by \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  Furthermore, the substitute amendment contains certain additional \nsafeguards that the Treasury Department now supports for financial \nservices modernization legislation. Every dollar of a bank's investment \nin a subsidiary would be deducted from the bank's capital for \nregulatory purposes. In this way, the bank would have to remain well \ncapitalized, even after deducting the investment in the subsidiary, and \neven should it lose its entire investment.\n\n  Secondly, a bank could not invest in a subsidiary in an amount \nexceeding the amount the bank would pay to a holding company as a \ndividend.\n  And, thirdly, the strict limits that now apply to transactions \nbetween banks and their affiliates would apply to transactions between \nbanks and their subsidiaries.\n  These restrict extensions of credit from banks to their affiliates \nguaranteed by banks for the benefit of their affiliates and purchases \nof assets by banks from their affiliates. All such transactions must be \nat arm's length, and fully collateralized, and the total amount of such \ntransactions between a bank and all of the affiliates is limited.\n  In total, these safeguards pertaining to the regulation of bank \nsubsidiaries should eliminate any economic benefit that may exist when \nactivities are conducted in bank subsidiaries rather than holding \ncompany subsidiaries.\n  The provisions regarding the scope of activities permitted for bank \nsubsidiaries should remove any opportunity for regulators to compete \nwith one another to the detriment of the safety and soundness of the \nbanking system, or the separation of banking and commerce.\n  FDIC Chairman Tanoue testified:\n\n       From a safety-and-soundness perspective, both the bank \n     operating subsidiary and the holding company affiliate \n     structures can provide adequate protection to the insured \n     depository institution from the direct and indirect effects \n     of losses in nonbank subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n  This position of the current FDIC Chairman was echoed by three former \nChairmen of the FDIC in an editorial that I printed earlier in the \nremarks.\n\n       On the basis of the provisions agreed to by the Treasury \n     Department and the testimony given by the FDIC--\n\n  And I want to underscore the efforts on the part of the Treasury \nDepartment to address questions that had been raised last year; in \nother words, what we are containing in the substitute differs from what \nthe Treasury\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nwas putting forward last year and has encompassed all of these various \nsafeguards which they have sought to develop--\n\n       [it was our judgment that] permitting bank operating \n     subsidiaries can be consistent with the goals of preserving \n     safety and soundness, protecting consumers, and promoting \n     comparable regulation.\n\n  Therefore, we have included the operating subsidiary provisions in \nthis substitute amendment and regard it as a meaningful step toward \nenactment of financial services modernization legislation.\n  Let me simply close with these observations. The substitute amendment \nnow before the body achieves the primary objective of financial \nservices modernization; namely, allowing affiliation of banks, \nsecurities firms, and insurance companies. It does so while preserving \nsafety and soundness, protecting consumers, providing for regulatory \nparity, and promoting the availability of financial services to all \ncommunities.\n  The committee bill, S. 900, falls short of these goals. It undermines \nthe Community Reinvestment Act. It does not provide bank operating \nsubsidiaries with the scope sought by the Treasury Department. Its \nprotections for consumers are substantially less than in the \nsubstitute. And, finally, it enables the separation of banking and \ncommerce to be breached with respect to the unitary thrift holding \ncompanies.\n  For all of these reasons, the President has declared he will veto it \nin its current form. I believe that the substitute amendment, the one \nthat is now before the Senate and on which at the conclusion of this \ndebate we will vote, represents a balanced, prudent approach to \nfinancial services modernization. It is legislation which has broad \nacceptance within the industry. In many ways, it is comparable to the \nactivities of the legislation of the House Banking Committee.\n  I am frank to say that I clearly think it is the approach most likely \nto achieve the enactment of financial services modernization \nlegislation. If Members want financial services modernization \nlegislation, if Members want to manufacture a legislative vehicle that \ncan go all the way through to Presidential signature and become law, \nthen Members should vote for the substitute amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me talk about simplicity and clarity in \nthe two bills. I know that seldom in writing laws do we hear lawmakers \ntalk about what makes sense and what is simple and what is readable.\n  I begin by asking people to look at the bill adopted by the Senate \nBanking Committee modernizing financial services. That bill is 150 \npages long. The substitute which has been offered by Senator Sarbanes \nis 349 pages long. Members might ask, What is the extra 200 pages for? \nThe extra 200 pages is for a convoluted process that breaks the \nsimplicity of the bill adopted by the Banking Committee.\n  What is very good about our bill is, it is very easy to understand. \nIf a securities firm wants to set up a bank holding company and engage \nin securities activities, banking activities, and insurance activities, \nit can set up a bank holding company, and outside the bank it can be \ninvolved in insurance and securities and it can be involved in banking \nunder the bank holding company. It is a very simple organization. It is \nan organization that provides any one of the three financial industries \nto become bank holding companies and participate in providing a broad \narray of services, including banking services. And it is an \norganization that is very easy to understand. It is an organization \nthat you can set out in 150 pages with all the whistles and bells and \nall the icing on the cake.\n\n  The Sarbanes substitute is 200 pages more complicated, and it is more \ncomplicated because it goes about things in a very different way. You \ncan have a bank holding company that can be in the banking business and \nin the securities business under the basic framework of the bank. You \ncan have a financial services holding company, a totally new entity, \nand it can have an insurance company, a bank holding company, and a \nsecurities firm. And under the bank holding company, you can have a \nbank, and that bank can be in the securities business, and it creates \nanother totally new entity, a wholesale financial holding company, and \nit can be in the insurance business, wholesale financial institution \nbusiness, and securities firms. Finally, banks can be in the securities \nbusiness.\n  So the first argument I want to make is based on simplicity--not that \nanybody ever gauged a Federal law based on, ``Does it make sense, is it \nsimple, could people actually employ it, what kind of roadmap is it for \nthe development of new financial institutions in America?'' But the \nreason our bill can do what it sets out to do in 150 pages, and the \nreason the substitute takes 300 pages, is the underlying bill adopted \nby the Banking Committee has a simple structure that everybody can \nunderstand and that securities firms, banks, and insurance companies \ncould all participate in. Under our bill, it is easy for any one of the \nthree to set up a bank holding company.\n  The substitute is a lot more complicated and brings in a lot of new \ninstitutions. It would be very hard, in terms of a user-friendly \nroadmap, as to how to do this. I do not know that sways anybody in the \nprivate sector or in any real world activity. But simplicity, and the \nsort of clear approach that people can follow--if they are buying a \nroadmap or if they are buying a computer program--is an important \nthing. Unfortunately, it is not something that is often mentioned in \nmaking the law of the land; but, quite frankly, it should be.\n  I am going to try to take less time in responding than I did in my \nopening statement on this. I want to break the proposal into eight \nareas and discuss the proposal in that way. There are eight key ways \nthat this substitute is fundamentally different from the bill which was \nadopted by the Banking Committee and which is before us.\n  The first and most important difference is that the substitute before \nus--offered by Senator Sarbanes, which is different from the bill that \nSenator Sarbanes supported last year, different from the bill that was \nadopted by the Banking Committee last year, and far different from the \nbill that is before the Senate now--allows banks to engage in broad \nfinancial services within the legal framework of the bank.\n  Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve, has said--and I want to read this quote because I think it is \nimportant. I think, No. 1, everybody in America takes Alan Greenspan \nseriously. Second, I want to remind people that the majority of the \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve Board were appointed by this \nPresident, Bill Clinton. This is a statement that Chairman Greenspan \nmade just last week before the House Commerce Committee in opposition \nto exactly the proposal which is the heart of the Sarbanes substitute. \nWhen Chairman Greenspan refers to ``colleagues,'' he means every member \nof the Federal Reserve Board, including those appointed by Bill \nClinton:\n\n       I and my colleagues are firmly convinced of the view that \n     the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the \n     interests of the American taxpayer would be better served by \nno financial modernization bill rather than one that allows the \nproposed new activities to be conducted by the bank. . . .\n\n  I want to be sure everybody understands this quote. It is as clear as \nyou can be clear. The most respected economic mind in America, the man \nwho more than any other person on this planet has been responsible for \nthe financial stability that has created over 20 million jobs and \nenriched working Americans by driving up equity values and by creating \nunparalleled prosperity in America, said last week that he and every \nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve believe it \nwould be better to have no financial services modernization bill than \nto adopt the Sarbanes substitute.\n  That is pretty clear. I think it is a profound position to take. Let \nme make the point: Everybody who knows Alan Greenspan knows that Alan\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nGreenspan goes out of his way not to be confrontational. Everybody who \nknows Chairman Greenspan knows that if there is a way of saying \nsomething around the barn, something which might be offensive to \nsomebody, he sort of walks all the way around the barn and let's you \nunderstand--where you can hope nobody else understands--that he said \nyour idea is a bad idea. That is the way Alan Greenspan works.\n  But in front of God and everybody at the House Commerce Committee \nlast week, Alan Greenspan said if the alternative is the Sarbanes \nsubstitute or no bill, he and every member of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve are convinced that ``no bill'' is better than the \nSarbanes substitute.\n  Why does he say this? In a dozen other quotes, he basically says two \nthings: No. 1, since we have deposit insurance, where the taxpayer is \non the hook for bank failures that threaten insured deposits, he is \nconcerned that allowing banks to get into these other kinds of \nfinancial businesses within the framework of the bank itself endangers \ndeposit insurance and threatens the taxpayer. So the first reason that \nChairman Greenspan made this extraordinary statement--in fact, the \nstrongest statement he has made as Chairman of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve--is concern about the insurance fund and the \ntaxpayer being on the hook.\n  The second concern is that if banks provide these expanded \nactivities, such as securities and insurance or whatever activities are \nultimately allowed within banks, the subsidy that banks have in deposit \ninsurance--something no other institution has besides banks, S, and \nother institutions that have Federal guarantees, and when I am saying \nbanks I mean broadly defined--plus the ability to borrow from the \nFederal Reserve at the lowest interest rates at which anybody in the \nworld borrows, and the ability to use the Fed wire, where they can wire \nmoney that instantly becomes bank reserves and it is guaranteed by the \nFederal Reserve bank, Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have \nestimated that if banks were allowed to provide these services within \nthe bank, they probably have an effective subsidy of around 14 basis \npoints. And this subsidy is due to the access to these three items: \nDeposit insurance, the Fed window, the Fed wire.\n  Chairman Greenspan has explained to anybody who would listen that if \nyou let banks perform these services within the banking structure \nitself, banks will have an advantage over those who are providing \nsecurities services and selling securities outside of banks; that if \nyou allowed banks to do insurance within the bank, they would have an \nadvantage over insurance companies that are not banks.\n  Chairman Greenspan has tried to alert us to the fact that if we \nadopted the Sarbanes substitute we could literally, within 10 or 20 \nyears, have a financial system where virtually all of the securities \nactivities and all of the insurance activities, if banks were allowed \nto do insurance within the bank itself, would be dominated by a handful \nof big banks. In other words, our economy would look very much like the \nJapanese economy, in terms of its financial structure.\n  Chairman Greenspan says, if your choice is no bill or doing what the \nSarbanes substitute wants to do, for safety and soundness reasons, for \nthe protection of the taxpayer, for the protection of competition, for \nthe protection of the competitiveness of the American economy, Chairman \nGreenspan says: Kill the bill before you do what the Sarbanes \nsubstitute would do, in terms of letting banks in these other lines of \nfinancial services within the structure of the bank.\n  Chairman Greenspan said let banks do these things--let them sell \ninsurance, let them provide securities services--but make banks do them \noutside the bank where they have to take capital out of the bank to \ncapitalize these companies and where they compete with nonbanks on an \nequal footing.\n  This is a critically important issue, and it is an incredible \nparadox, an absolutely astounding paradox that Senator Sarbanes, who \nsupported Chairman Greenspan's position in the bill last year, is now \ntaking exactly the opposite position. It is my understanding that \nperhaps all the Democrat Members of the Senate may be inclined to take \nthis position, a position that many of them, perhaps two out of every \nthree, would have opposed as any kind of freestanding measure. I hope \nthat is not the case, but perhaps it is.\n  If for no other reason, if you do not have 101 other reasons to vote \nagainst the Sarbanes substitute, listen to Alan Greenspan: Spare the \ntaxpayer, spare deposit insurance, and spare the economy by rejecting \nthis proposal.\n  The pending substitute dramatically expands CRA. It dramatically \nexpands CRA in several ways. For the first time in the history of CRA, \nthe Sarbanes substitute provides that financial institutions that fall \nout of compliance with CRA will now be deemed to be in violation of \nbanking law and, therefore, potentially subject to fines of up to $1 \nmillion a day.\n  Let me remind those who do not follow these issues--and why would you \nunless you are in this line of work?--currently under the Community \nReinvestment Act, while banks are evaluated every year and while banks \ntake a legitimate pride in getting good scores on their evaluations, \nthey are not required to be in compliance. The only time CRA imposes a \n``penalty'' is if a bank wants to take an action that requires CRA \nevaluation--such as the opening or closing of a branch, or selling or \nbuying a bank, or merging with another bank.\n  The Sarbanes substitute would vastly expand CRA by making it a \nviolation of Federal banking law simply to be out of compliance with \nCRA and, in the process, potentially subject not just the bank, but an \nindividual bank officer and an individual board member, to a fine of $1 \nmillion a day.\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America sent a letter today \nraising a very important issue. Little banks have trouble getting \npeople of substance to serve on their bank boards. It is hard because \nthere are liability issues involved, and one of the big struggles that \nlittle banks have is getting city leaders to be on the bank board. We \nwant the best people to serve on bank boards because they are the \npeople who ultimately make decisions that affect safety and soundness, \nthat affect the well-being of the depositor, that affect lending \npolicy, and that affect the taxpayer through Federal deposit insurance.\n  I want you to listen to the president of the Independent Community \nBankers of America. This is an organization that represents small, \nindependent banks all over America. Listen to this paragraph:\n\n       We also have grave concerns about expanding CRA enforcement \n     authority to include the levying of heavy fines and penalties \n     against banks or their officers and directors. An ongoing \n     challenge for many community banks in small communities is \n     finding willing and qualified bank directors. Legislation \n     following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early \n     1990s greatly increased the amount of civil monetary \n     penalties to which bank officers and directors may be \n     subject. Any increase in the potential for fines and \n     penalties could provide further disincentive for serving on a \n     bank board.\n\n  All Members should realize that this does not apply just to small \nbanks, it applies to big banks. If you had a bank with 200 branches and \njust one branch fell out of compliance, you could potentially be \nsubjected to this fine. This is regulatory overkill. This is totally \nunjustified.\n  Our colleague, Senator Sarbanes, says we have not presented enough \ndata about abuses. Where is the abuse that could possibly call for such \na provision? This is punitive legislation at its worst, and if you \nthink we have a problem now with community groups intervening and \ndemanding cash payments, you add to it a possibility that a bank \nofficer or board member could be fined $1 million a day and you are \ngoing to multiply the abuse a thousandfold. This is a proposal which \nwas clearly written, and I can tell you where and when, when there was \na desperate effort in the House to get their bill passed last year. It \npassed by one vote, and they basically gave this provision to groups \nthat wanted to massively expand CRA. That is how it got into this whole \ndebate.\n  I cannot believe anybody seriously would want to subject bank \nofficers and bank directors to a potential $1-million-a-day fine for \ntemporarily falling out of compliance with CRA.\n  The Sarbanes substitute expands CRA by requiring CRA compliance to\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\nengage in new financial activities, including insurance and securities. \nNo CRA test is now required for such banking activities.\n  Here is the whole issue. Today, some banks do sell insurance. Today, \nsome 20 banks engage in securities activities, and virtually every \nbank, through their holding company, engages in activities which, under \nthe Sarbanes substitute, would be pushed out of the trust department \nand into an affiliate or an operating sub and, therefore, would subject \nthat bank to this new regulation.\n  The point is, current law does not require a bank to get CRA approval \nto sell insurance. Current law does not require a bank to get CRA \napproval to sell securities. This is, again, a massive expansion in \nCRA. And if the Senator is justified in questioning our justification \nfor wanting to adopt two modest reforms of CRA, I think it is \nreasonable to ask what is the justification for this massive expansion \nin CRA.\n  Finally, on CRA, for the first time in American history, the Sarbanes \nsubstitute would expand CRA to a noninsured institution. The \njustification for CRA was that banks and other banking-type \ninstitutions, S, have deposit insurance.\n  And that is a subsidy to the bank. Therefore, asking the bank to \nprovide these resources, on a broad basis, to the community or to \nallocate capital based on a Government dictate rather than the market \nhad a justification. That was the justification for CRA.\n  The Sarbanes substitute would expand CRA coverage to a new \ninstitution, the wholesale financial institution, or WFI, which does \nnot have FDIC insurance. This is a clear expansion of CRA beyond \nanything that has ever been enacted into law. In addition, the Sarbanes \nsubstitute would repeal the two reform provisions that are in the bill.\n  I am not going to get into a long dissertation on this subject, \nbecause we are going to have an opportunity to debate this subject at \nlength tomorrow--and believe me, I am ready to debate it--but I just \nwant to make a couple points about the provisions that would be \nstricken by the Sarbanes substitute.\n  First of all, our first provision is an integrity provision. Put \nsimply, consider a bank that is in compliance and has been in \ncontinuing compliance with CRA for 3 years in a row, so that in the \nmind of the regulator, based on the information they have been \npresented--and any group in America can have an input into those \nevaluations--this bank is a good actor, they have a good record of \ncompliance.\n  The Sarbanes substitute would strike our provision that says that \nwhile anybody can present any information they want to the regulator--\nand the regulator can demand a new evaluation when the bank in question \nseeks, for example, to merge with another bank or sell or buy a bank--\nbut unless the protesting group presents some substantial evidence that \nthis bank is out of compliance--something that their regulators had \nsaid three times in a row they were not--unless they can present some \nsubstantial evidence, then based on that objection alone, the regulator \ncannot turn down the proposal or delay it.\n  I went through earlier today--and I hope people heard it and remember \nit--but I went through what ``substantial evidence'' means. The most \nimportant thing to remember about it is, the law already requires it. \nAll banking law requires decisionmaking to be based on ``substantial \nevidence,'' and bars decisionmaking based on arbitrary and capricious \naction. All banking law currently requires it. All appeals of banking \nregulator decisions must be based on the absence of substantial \nevidence.\n  So really what we are trying to do here is force the regulator to \ncomply with the normal administrative convention, which is, if somebody \nwants to enter a process--at the last moment, in this case--and demand \nthat someone not be allowed to do something that they have earned a \nright to do, then they must present substantial evidence to show that \nthey are not complying.\n  Senator Sarbanes suggested that the evidence can only be on items \nwhich have occurred since the last evaluation. Not so. In fact, what \nour bill says is that the regulator may not delay or deny an \napplication unless ``substantial verifiable information arising since \nthe time of [the bank's] most recent examination under that Act \ndemonstrating noncompliance is filed with the appropriate Federal \n[regulator].''\n  Our provision provides that any new information may be presented. It \nis not something that has occurred since the last evaluation. It is \nsomething that the banking examiners did not have before when they said \nthe bank was complying with the law.\n  I went through at great length the 900--I did not go through all 900 \nof them--but 900 times in Federal statutes we refer to ``substantial \nevidence.'' We have 400 court cases that have defined it. What does it \nmean? ``More than a scintilla of information,'' a factual basis under \nwhich a reasonable person might reach a conclusion--not that they would \nreach a conclusion, but that they might reach a conclusion.\n  So what Senator Sarbanes is determined to kill is a simple proposal \nthat certainly does not repeal CRA or overturn CRA or do violence to \nCRA. All it says is, if a bank has a long record of being in compliance \nwith CRA, if they are in compliance with CRA now, and they want to \nundertake an action that requires CRA evaluation, that if somebody \nwants to come in and object, they can say anything they want, they can \npresent any information they want, but the regulator cannot overturn \ntheir established record unless the protester presents substantial \ninformation or data to back up their claim.\n\n  You might ask, why could anybody be opposed to that? Can you imagine \nthat you have a bank which is trying to buy another bank, and they have \nbeen in compliance with CRA for three evaluations in a row and are \ncurrently in compliance, they have hundreds of millions of dollars at \nstake in consummating this agreement, a decision that can affect \nthousands of people, and you let one protester, who often is from not \njust another State but another region of the country--a protester from \nBrooklyn, NY--and he comes in and protests a bank merger in Illinois \nand will not go away until he gets his ``expenses paid'' and until he \ngets a cash payment? Now, under our provision, anybody can come in and \nprotest, but in order for them to be able to stop the process, they \nhave to provide substantial information.\n  I cannot understand how anybody can be opposed to that.\n  The second provision of our bill that would be overturned by the \nSarbanes substitute is the small bank exemption. Let me try to explain \nthis, I think, in a way that everybody can understand.\n  I have two colleagues here. Let me say that I am sorry, but Senator \nSarbanes took an extended period of time to present this, and I have to \ngo through and be sure it is responded to comprehensively. So I am \nprobably going to talk for another half an hour or 45 minutes. If \neither one of my colleagues has just a few minutes, I will stop and let \nthem speak. But I do not want them staying around here, standing up and \nthinking that I am about to finish. So with that, if either one of you \njust has an announcement you want to make or a unanimous consent \nrequest, I will yield. OK.\n  Here is the problem. You have little banks in rural areas. They have, \nmost of them, between 6 and 10 employees. They are serving communities \nthat do not even have a city, much less an inner city, and they are \nbeing forced to comply with this law called CRA.\n  It would be one thing if there were a record showing that these \nsmall, rural banks are not lending in their communities. But the plain \ntruth is, as I pointed out earlier, since 1990 there have been 16,380 \nexaminations conducted by bank regulators of small banks and S in \nrural areas, that is, outside standard metropolitan areas. And in those \n16,380 examinations, only 3 rural banks have been found to be in \nsubstantial noncompliance. These examinations and the regulatory burden \nimposed in complying with this law costs the average rural bank between \n$60- and $80,000. Imagine, you have a bank with 6 to 10 employees and \nthey have to pay $80,000 to comply with a law that has found, since \n1990, 3/100 of 1 percent of them out of compliance.\n\n  You might ask, is this overkill? It is interesting, because in other \nfinancial laws that relate to similar issues, we exempt banks outside \nstandard metropolitan areas. In the HMDA statute related to similar \nareas, if you are very\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\nsmall, you are exempt if you are outside a standard metropolitan area. \nAnd that is what we are talking in our provision--exempting very small \nbanks in very rural areas.\n  Instead of my speaking for the problem, let me let the people who are \naffected speak. They are a lot more articulate on these issues than I \nam. Let me just run over some numbers with you.\n  We have received hundreds of letters from small banks all over \nAmerica urging us to adopt the provision in this bill; we have received \n488 as of today. What these small banks tell us is that CRA compliance \nis costing them between $60- and $80,000 a year.\n  The First National Bank of Seiling, OK, has estimated it takes the \nequivalent of one full-time employee to comply with CRA. The Chemical \nBank of Big Rapids, MN--with assets of $94 million--agrees that it \ntakes one full-time employee. Crosby State Bank of Crosby, TX, agrees \nwith the one full-time employee. The First National Bank of Cortez, CO, \nthinks that they spend a minimum of 100 hours annually of CRA \ncompliance officer time.\n  Let me read from some of the letters that have been submitted to the \ncommittee. I am only going to read from five or six of them, but I \nthink they tell the story.\n  The first letter is from the Cattle National Bank. The Cattle \nNational Bank, for those of you who don't know, and you should, is in \nSeward, NE. Here is what the vice president and cashier of the Cattle \nNational Bank in Seward, NE, says:\n\n       Let me add that since the origination of public disclosure \n     of CRA examinations we have not had one person from our \n     community ever request the information. The only requests \n     that we have had have come from bank consultants wanting to \n     glean some tidbit from our disclosure.\n\n  This is a letter from Copiah Bank, which is a national bank in \nCrystal Springs, MS. This is written by the president and chief \nexecutive officer.\n\n       Our Compliance Officer, Gary Broome, and his assistant have \n     spent many research hours and reams of paper in their efforts \n     to comply with the mandated requirement's paper work. We have \n     even had to outsource some of its checkpoints to a compliance \n     consultant from time to time. As an $83 million community \n     bank . . . that means they probably have 6 or 7 employees . . \n     . we feel an obligation to help in your efforts toward easing \n     our paper work burden.\n\n  Lakeside State Bank, ND.\n\n       As a former bank examiner for the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, which included consumer compliance experience, \n     and as a banker for over 15 years I believe I have a good \n     understanding of the intent and the workings of CRA. Over 47 \n     years of our existence we have provided financing to \n     virtually every main street business in our town, our \n     customer base includes approximately 80 percent of the area \n     farms and for the last several years over 50 percent of our \n     loans have been to American Indians. The law--\n\n  And he means CRA.\n\n     . . .is a heavy burden because of the expansiveness of the \n     regulations and the paper requirements of compliance. We \n     spend hours documenting what we have already done rather than \n     spending that time more efficiently by doing more for our \n     community.\n\n  This is from Farmers and Merchants Bank, and this is in Arnett, OK, \nwritten by the executive vice president and CEO.\n\n       I am the CEO as well as the chief loan officer, compliance \n     officer and CRA officer. I have to wear so many hats because \n     we are small and have a staff of only 7 including myself. CRA \n     compliance, done correctly, takes a lot of time, which takes \n     me away from my primary responsibility of loaning money to my \n     community. It has almost gotten to the point that lending is \n     a secondary function. It seems like we have the choice of \n     lending to our community or writing up CRA plans showing how \n     we would lend to the community if we had time to make the \n     loans.\n\n  It is funny how wisdom just leaps off the page.\n\n       Large banks can hire full time CRA officers and other \n     compliance personnel to administer CRA programs, but small \n     banks cannot . . .\n\n  This is from the Redlands Centennial Bank, and it is in Redlands, CA.\n\n       We spent approximately $80 thousand dollars of our \n     shareholders' money last year supporting this ill-defined \n     regulation. Even the regulators who examined us were hard \n     pressed to give us specific definitions on how we might \n     better implement this regulation. I am urging you to get rid \n     of this nonsensical CRA yoke. Keep up the fight, because \n     there are a lot of us out here who are too busy balancing \n     making a living with government regulations in this crazy \n     business . . .\n\n  Chemical Bank North, which is a little bank in Grayling, MI. It is a \n$74 million bank, which means it probably has 6 to 10 employees.\n\n       As it is, we must devote disproportionate resources to \n     creating and maintaining the ``paper trail'' that the current \n     CRA regulations require. Our board members must attend time \n     consuming CRA Committee meetings and our officers and staff \n     members spend significant valuable time preparing reports and \n     keeping records that serve no purpose other than to keep us \n     in compliance with a regulation that attempts to enforce from \n     a regulatory standpoint what we do everyday in the normal \n     course of our business . . . I would estimate that we devote \n     the equivalent of a full time employee to all aspects of CRA \n     compliance.\n\n  I mean, does anybody care that, for this little bank, that one-tenth \nof their payroll is needed to comply with a government regulation that \nin 9 years, in 16,000 such audits, has found only 3 banks substantially \nout of compliance? In 9 years, in 16,000 audits of banks like the \nChemical Bank in Grayling, MI, government regulators have found only 3 \nbanks out of the 16,000 evaluations where there was substantial \nnoncompliance. And yet, we are making these banks pay $80,000 a year. \nDoes anybody care? You know, we talk about the little guy and why \naren't we here debating this and that. Does anybody care that a little \nbank, trying to serve consumers in a small town, a little independent \nbank in an era when a lot of people are worried about all the banks \nbeing taken over by big banks, here is a little bitty bank trying to \nstay in business, and 1 out of every 10 people they employ--because \nthey only employ 10--has to spend time complying with one regulation, \nwhich, over 9 years, in 16,000 audits, has found 3 violators? Yet, our \ncolleague, Senator Sarbanes, is so outraged that we would lift this \npaperwork burden that he has offered a substitute. I don't understand \nit. I don't understand it. But I don't guess I have to understand it.\n\n  First National Bank, founded in 1876, in Wamego, KS, spelled W-A-M-E-\nG-O. I ask the Chair, am I pronouncing it right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Chair notes that the \ncorrect pronunciation is Wamego.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The occupant of the Chair knows because he knows and loves \neverybody that lives in that State, and I appreciate that. Wamego, KS. \nThis is a little bitty bank, the First National Bank of Wamego, KS, \nfounded in 1876. In other words, it has been in business for 123 years. \nHow big do you think it is after 123 years of service? They have $65 \nmillion in assets, and it is the lifeblood of Wamego, KS. It is \nstruggling with paperwork. It is a small bank and has 6 to 10 \nemployees. People in that town are proud they have a bank. In a lot of \ntowns that size, the bank has already gone broke and moved off to the \nbig city. This bank has not deserted its customer base. They are trying \nto make a living. Let me read to you from their letter:\n\n       Our bank was listed 2 years in a row as the best bank in \n     Kansas to obtain loans for small businesses by Entrepreneur \n     Magazine.\n\n  They have received an outstanding rating under CRA--the best rating \nyou can get.\n\n       Our outstanding grade did not make us a better bank. CRA \n     did not make us make more loans than we would have made. CRA \n     did take a lot of employee time to document that we were an \n     outstanding bank.\n\n  Here is the point. This is a little bank that has been doing the job \nfor 123 years. It only has $65 million in assets. This is a very small \nbank. It probably does not have 10 employees. It has been evaluated as \nbeing outstanding. But in 16,000 evaluations over the last 9 years, \nbank regulators nationwide found only 3 banks that were in substantial \nnoncompliance. Why are we tormenting this little bank in Wamego, KS, \nwhich is doing a great job, and imposing $60,000 to $80,000 in costs on \nthem to discover that only 3 banks out of 16,000 evaluations aren't \ndoing a good job?\n  The next letter is from Nebraska National Bank, which is in Kearney, \nNE. They have $34 million in assets. This has to be one of the smallest \nbanks in America. It has been in business for an extended period of \ntime. I don't know how many employees they have, but I would guess five \nor six employees in the whole bank:\n\n       We do not make foreign loans. We don't speculate in \n     derivatives. We don't siphon deposits from this area to fund \n     loans elsewhere. Instead, like virtually all banks\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\n     under $250 million in assets [remember, they are only $34 \n     million in assets], we provide home loans, business loans, \n     farm loans, construction loans. We don't do this because of \n     the Community Reinvestment Act, but because it makes good \n     business sense. I bitterly resent every minute of my time and \n     that of my staff spent to comply with this regulation because \n     it takes time away from productive duties. I feel the \n     regulation is now being used by consumer activist groups to \n     shake down banks seeking regulatory approval for expansion of \n     mergers.\n\n  Now, that is a strong testament. Nothing I could say could give a \nstronger testament than that.\n\n  Let me give you one final one. Like I said, we have 488 just like it. \nThey don't understand why it is unreasonable to lift this heavy \nregulatory burden when only 3 substantial noncompliant banks have been \ndiscovered in 9 years after 16,000 audits. You take 16,000 audits at \n$80,000 apiece, for the banks, that is a lot of money for these little \ntowns.\n  The last letter is from American State Bank, an independent bank in \nPortland, OR. It is signed by the chairman and the CEO:\n\n       As one of the oldest and most strongly capitalized African \n     American owned banks west of the Mississippi River, Portland \n     based American State Bank supports your position on CRA \n     exemption for nonmetropolitan banks. We also urge you to \n     explore exempting from CRA requirements minority-owned \n     commercial banks. Today, minority-owned banks still maintain \n     their focus on serving our Nation's minority communities and \n     their citizens. It is redundant at best to impose CRA \n     requirements on banks whose sole purpose is to serve minority \n     citizens. At worst, it compels minority banks to sustain \n     burdensome, expensive administrative costs and subjects banks \n     to a bureaucracy largely unaware of the realities of the \n     inner-city marketplace.\n\n  Now, I could go on and on, Mr. President, in outlining the arguments \nrelated to small banks, but let me stop there on this issue and go back \nto the other provisions of the bill.\n  Let me say to my colleague that to go through and respond to each of \nthe points Senator Sarbanes made is probably going to take me another \nhalf hour. If the Senator has a unanimous consent request, or a short \nstatement, I would be glad to yield. But if not, I want him and others \nto know that I should be finished maybe by 7 o'clock.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Senator Kerry has been trying to make a statement all \nday. I guess, by this process he won't be able to do it now. What is \nthe Senator's intention for tomorrow? How can we carve out some time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It was my hope tonight that we could finish debate on this \namendment, and that we would have a vote tomorrow. Our problem, as you \nknow, is that we have the two Senators from Oklahoma who have flown \nhome to participate in the evaluation and assistance with the terrible \ntragedy that happened there with the tornadoes. We are hopeful that \nthey are going to be back tonight or in the morning. Then we are going \nto have a vote on Senator Byrd's resolution commending the Rev. Jesse \nJackson, and other clergy leaders who participated in his trip. That \nvote is going to occur in the morning; I am not sure exactly what time. \nBut the idea would be to have that vote in the morning and then, at \nthat point, either I or the majority leader would move to table the \namendment and we would have a vote on it. We would then offer one of \nour amendments at that point.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Unaccustomed as I am to speaking from this side of the \naisle, maybe it will get me extra credit from the Senator from Texas. \nWould it be possible to carve out some time because of my complications \non the schedule? I have been here a number of times today trying to get \nin on the schedule to speak prior to the vote. Would I be able to have \n20 minutes set aside for that purpose?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would assume we will have a debate in the morning and \nthat we will probably have at least a half an hour on each side. I see \nnothing unreasonable about having time in the morning. I would strongly \nsuggest that we do it. Any Member can object to any unanimous consent \nrequest. Otherwise, if the Senator wishes to have time, we will divide \nthe time equally tomorrow. I don't see any reason why he couldn't have \na chance to speak tomorrow.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, I don't \nwant to disturb the schedule of the Senator from Maryland or concept of \nhow he wishes to proceed managing our side of the aisle, if that would \nfit within his framework.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If we have sufficient time before we vote on this \nsubstitute to take care of the Senator and a couple of others who want \nto speak on it, including the minority leader, I don't have a problem \nwith that. But if the time period is extremely short, then we would be \nprecluded from accomplishing this objective.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why don't I do this. Just reclaiming my time, why don't I \ntry to finish up here in 20 minutes and yield and let the Senator \nspeak?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the problem is that isn't going to work on \nthe schedule I have now this evening. I simply say to the Senator, Mr. \nPresident, that it would seem to me, in furtherance of what the Senator \nfrom Maryland has said, that if we were to write in the order for the \nmorning for tomorrow that X amount of time will be set on both sides, \ntaking into account the amount of time I have requested from the \nSenator, we could accomplish all of the goals, if the Senator were \nwilling to try to make that the order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't know whether we have 30 minutes equally divided or \n1 hour equally divided, but within that constraint, it seems to me, the \nSenator could speak.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Texas. I thank \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me just touch on four more issues in \nthe Sarbanes substitute that I take strong issue with. I see Senator \nGorton is here and he wanted to say something.\n  The next concern that I have and that the majority has with the \nSarbanes substitute is that it adopts security law revisions making it \nsignificantly more difficult for small banks to engage in trust and \nfiduciary activities. These activities currently make up about 15 to 20 \npercent of the revenues of small banks.\n  Here is the problem. Our bill goes to great lengths to say to some \nsmall bank in some small town that doesn't intend to get into financial \nservices, that nothing in this bill is going to force them to take \ntheir trust department activities that they are now engaged in and \neither set up an operating subsidiary or set up an affiliate.\n  I believe the provisions of the Sarbanes substitute could adversely \naffect virtually every small bank in America and endanger the \noperations that they currently can do within a bank only under \nregulation by the bank in the name of trust department activities. I \nbelieve the provision offered by Senator Sarbanes could force many of \nthese banks to set up operating subsidiaries, or set up affiliates, and \nin the process drive up their costs and threaten their revenues.\n  Now we come to the so-called unitary thrift holding company. If you \nlisten to Senator Sarbanes, you get the idea that somehow we are \nexpanding commercial activities of banks. The reality is that the \nSarbanes substitute, by allowing banks to hold a commercial basket for \n15 years, expands commercial activities of banks substantially more \nthan our bill does.\n  Our bill restricts the ability of commercial companies--an ability \nthey have under current law--our bill restricts their ability to apply \nfor charters and to set up a unitary thrift.\n\n  Unitary thrifts are legal under current law. So, for example, General \nMotors can get an S charter and can go into the S or banking \nbusiness through that charter. That is the law of the land today. As a \nresult, a substantial number of commercial companies have gotten those \ncharters.\n  Our bill ends that practice. And effective on the day that the \nunderlying committee bill was released as a committee print, any \napplication for a unitary thrift received after that date would not be \nacted upon.\n  The difference between the Sarbanes substitute and what we do is \nthat, in addition, the Sarbanes substitute goes back and says that \nthose unitary thrifts that already exist would have an ex post facto \nchange in law that would limit their ability to sell their\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nthrift--which is a change in the regulations under which they set up or \nbought the charter.\n  I believe that this is a takings of property, that it violates the \nfifth amendment of the Constitution. In fact, we have recently had a \nSupreme Court ruling striking down another ex post facto law that \nCongress passed that took away provisions that were in contracts that \nbanks--and in this case S negotiated with Federal S \nregulators.\n  So we create no new commercial powers. There is nothing in our bill \nthat in any way expands the ability of banks to hold commercial assets, \nwhereas the substitute will allow them to hold them for 15 years under \na grandfather provision, a provision that is not in our bill.\n  I was somewhat stunned to hear the presentation by Senator Sarbanes \nthat we were expanding commercial powers when in reality his substitute \nhas a 15-year grandfather for existing activities, a provision that our \nbill does not have. Our bill not only does not expand commercial \nactivities but it cuts off the issue of new unitary thrift licenses. \nBut we do not go back and change the rules of the game on S that \ninvested good money, many of them during the S crisis, saving the \ntaxpayer billions of dollars. We don't go back and change the rules of \nthe game on them.\n  I talked about No. 7. That is the commercial basket issue. The \nsubstitute offered by Senator Sarbanes allows commercial banks to hold \nthese commercial assets for up to 15 years. There is no similar \nprovision in our bill.\n  Finally, the Sarbanes substitute strips away power from State \ninsurance regulators. Under the Sarbanes substitute, States could only \ncollect information but could not act on information, nullifying the \nauthority of State insurance commissioners to review and approve or \ndisapprove applications.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners opposes this \nprovision.\n  So basically those are the differences. I think the differences are \nvery clear and very stark. I hope my colleagues will look at them and \nwill reject this substitute.\n  This substitute would create a bill that Alan Greenspan and every \nmember of the Federal Reserve Board, speaking as a body through the \nChairman, has said would be worse, in terms of danger to the taxpayers, \ndanger to the insurance fund, danger to the economy, than passing no \nbill at all.\n  This bill would repeal two very simple, very targeted, very minor \nreforms of CRA, and would institute the most massive expansion of CRA \nin America history.\n  I think if people look at any one of these eight areas that I have \noutlined, they will conclude that the committee acted properly in \nrejecting the Sarbanes substitute. But the Sarbanes substitute wasn't \nrejected just because it was deficient in, say, five of these eight \nareas. It was rejected because in each and every one of these areas it \nwas inferior--in terms of the well-being of the taxpayer, the well-\nbeing of the depository insurance system, the well-being of the \neconomy--to the underlying bill that was adopted by the Banking \nCommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this substitute. There will be a \ntabling motion tomorrow on some basis yet to be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I support the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, in his advocacy of his \nown proposal and in his desire that we defeat the substitute which is \nbefore the Senate at the present time.\n  He has stated in great detail his reason for his support and the \nmajority support for his financial reorganization bill. I mention only \nthree differences that seem to me to be very significant.\n  One is the arcane but vitally important difference between a holding \ncompany structure and a structure of making subsidiaries. In this \nrespect, it seems to me the holding company system has worked well for \nthis country, literally for generations. The advice of the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, overwhelmingly supports the \nproposition of the choice that has been made in this regard by the \ncommittee majority itself.\n  Second, with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act, it also seems \nto me that the chairman's modest reforms are steps in the right \ndirection. They do not destroy that system by any stretch of the \nimagination but, they do fire a warning shot across the bow of those \nwho would use that bill for extortion purposes.\n  Finally, and most important to me in my own State, is the way in \nwhich the bill, is against the proposed substitute, deals with unitary \nthrifts. A unitary thrift is authorized to affiliate with both \nfinancial and commercial companies. This authority is balanced both by \nlending restrictions and by safeguards prohibiting thrifts from \nextending credit to a commercial affiliate. This chartering structure \nhas been available for more than 30 years. To the best of my knowledge, \nduring that 30-year period of time, 30 years during which thrifts have \nbeen allowed to combine with commercial firms, there have been no major \nscandals, no serious corruption, no sapping of America's capitalism \nvigor. In other words, to limit the authority of thrifts while we are \nextending the authority of commercial banks in the bulk of this bill is \nto deal with an evil that simply does not exist.\n  Financial modernization should be about expanding choices for \nconsumers and chartering options, not constricting those options and \nstripping existing authorities from consumer-oriented institutions \nwithout sound policy justification.\n  I do not believe we should limit the unitary thrift chartering option \nat all. Unitary thrifts have a longstanding record of serving their \ncommunities. There is a glaring absence of any evidence that their \ncommercial affiliations have led to a concentration of economic powers \nor posed risks to consumers or taxpayers. This legislation includes a \nprovision that grandfathers the commercial affiliation authorities of \nunitary thrifts chartered or applied for before February 28 of this \nyear. Given the lack of any evidence that those affiliations are \nharmful, financial modernization should, at the minimum, not roll back \nthe authority of existing unitary thrifts.\n  Limiting the ability of commercial firms to charter thrifts in the \nfuture is debatable policy, but there is no question in my mind that \nthe authorities of existing unitary thrifts should not be abolished.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the Democratic substitute and intend to \nfight any later amendment which deals with this issue alone.\n  With the expression of my support for the position taken by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4658-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4658-S4659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE AND RECRUIT CLASS 116\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the past year has been a trying one for the \nUnited States Capitol Police. The deaths of Officer Jacob Chestnut and \nDetective John Gibson struck a chord with the American people and the \nCongress. We are keenly aware that we rely on the men and women of the \nU.S. Capitol Police to protect the Capitol Complex and all of those who \nwork and visit here. In doing so, they ensure that the national \nlegislative process proceeds unhindered and that citizens are safe and \nfree to visit their Capitol, view the House and Senate in session, and \nmeet with their elected representatives.\n  Protecting the Capitol Complex requires well trained, highly-\nmotivated, and dedicated police officers. On April 27, the U.S. Capitol \nPolice added such officers to its ranks when it graduated Recruit Class \n116. The twenty-four recruits in this class proudly became police \nofficers after successfully completing five months of exhaustive \ntraining. These officers came from all walks of life and from a number \nof states around the nation. Many had prior military experience, others \nhad previous experience in the law enforcement profession, while some \njust recently graduated from college. The\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\ncommon bond among these officers is the desire to enter the law \nenforcement profession and honor the memory of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson.\n  During the graduation ceremony, which was attended by the members of \nthe U.S. Capitol Police Board, the Department's Command Staff, and \nfamily and friends of the recruit officers, Class President Robert \nGaristo gave a speech on behalf of the members of the Recruit Class \n116. I feel that this speech is indicative of the caliber of personnel \nwho fill the ranks of the U.S. Capitol Police. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Officer Garisto's speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       United States Capitol Police Class 116--Graduation Speech\n\n       Good afternoon everyone. I would like to start by \n     expressing my gratitude to the Members of Class 116. I have \n     been fortunate to have spent the last five months getting to \n     know each and every one of you. Now that I do, the honor you \n     have bestowed on me by allowing me to represent you means so \n     much more and it is an experience I will cherish forever.\n       Now, class, we are about to take a dramatic step forward. \n     The challenges which lie ahead of us are immense, many of the \n     problems we will confront as police officers are highly \n     complex. The skills and abilities we bring to our positions \n     in law enforcement must be continually honed to transcend \n     these obstacles.\n       I am sure everyone here is aware of the events that have \n     taken place recently in the United States. The crisis of \n     crime and violence in our society is really a crisis of \n     values and conscience. It is a problem compounded by the \n     glamorization of violence, drugs, sex and greed in Hollywood \n     films and music lyrics. Our young people are being told that \n     it is okay to carry a 9MM and live the lifestyle of a drug \n     dealer, it is all right to ``sex you up.'' They are told they \n     have the right to the latest music CD or the coolest clothes. \n     They have the right to have these things even if they have to \n     take from someone else. They can have what they want at any \n     price regardless of the consequences. However, there are \n     consequences to a society that sensationalizes sin while it \n     trivializes morality and religious beliefs. The consequence \n     is the carnage we see on the streets of America almost every \n     day. Too many of our children have learned to solve problems \n     of conflict and anger with weapons for the simple reason that \n     they haven't experienced love, compassion and understanding \n     from those who should be the role models in their lives. \n     It's insane and it's hurting our Nation in the worst \n     possible way, because our young people are our greatest \n     national resource and asset. More importantly, they are \n     our future.\n       We as parents, police officers, teachers and public \n     officials must take an active role in the rearing of \n     America's youth.\n       This world we live upon is a tremendously huge place but, \n     technology is, and will continue to make, the global \n     experience more accessible to everyone. Young people must \n     understand the global context of our existence. The horizons \n     and life opportunities that exist for them throughout this \n     world. And, yes, there will continue to be racism and bias \n     fueled by ignorance and fear. Those who are different will \n     continue to be judged by the standard of what is considered \n     by the judge to be normal. However, it should never be \n     intellectualized as the sole excuse for failure. More \n     importantly, it must serve as the impetus which pushes us \n     forward toward higher achievement and success.\n       A contemporary society cannot develop unless it places a \n     premium on education and human development. The complex \n     issues and problems we face today require agents with \n     thoughtful and progressive minds committed to bringing about \n     positive change.\n       I believe that each of us of The Graduating Class of 116 \n     are those agents of change.\n\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am proud of the men and women of the \nUnited States Capitol Police and I appreciate what they do, each day, \nin service to the Congress and the nation. I would like to congratulate \nOfficer Garisto and the men and women of Recruit Class 116 on their \naccomplishments and I wish them continued success during their careers \nwith the United States Capitol Police.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4659-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4659-S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE AAA SAFETY PATROL LIFESAVING MEDAL AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the 7 young men and women who have been selected to \nreceive the 1999 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. This \naward is the highest honor given to members of the school safety \npatrol.\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the school safety patrol in this \ncountry, helping over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young people \nensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, and \nback home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But, on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions, placing \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic \nactions of this year's honorees exemplify this selflessness, and richly \ndeserve recognition.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Rochester, New \nYork.\n  On September 22, 1998, 11-year-old Theodore Roosevelt Elementary \nSchool Safety Patrol Katherine Garcia was at her post in the back \nparking lot. She was helping create order out of the chaos that occurs \nwhen buses, walkers and parents all try to leave the school at the same \ntime.\n  Behind her post, a 9-year-old boy and his 7-year-old friend separated \nfrom his grandmother to look for their car. They tried to run past \nKatherine. As they did, she quickly reached out, grabbed the boys by \ntheir t-shirts, and pulled them out of the path of an oncoming car.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Brooklyn, \nNew York.\n  On January 5, 1999, an 8-year-old student asked Public School 151 \nSafety Patrol Anthony Christian, Jr. if he would walk him across the \nstreet.\n  Leaving his post in the hands of his patrol partner, Anthony \ncarefully checked the traffic signal and crossed the street. Just as \nthey reached the other corner, two cars collided at high speed in the \nmiddle of the intersection. One of the cars spun out of control, \nheading directly for the two boys. Without regard for his own safety, \nAnthony pulled the little boy out of the way just before the car jumped \nthe curb where the two boys were.\n  The third AAA Lifesaving Medal winner comes from Unadilla, New York.\n  On October 8, 1997, Unadilla Elementary School Safety Patrol Nichole \nL. Decker was at her post at the school's back door when she heard a 7-\nyear-old boy's desperate cries for help.\n  When she went outside, she saw the boy trapped on the ground by a \nhuge dog--a husky/wolf mix. The dog was biting at the little boy's face \nand throat. Without considering what the 50-pound dog could do to her, \n13-year-old Nichole began shouting and waving her arms to distract it \nfrom the boy. When the dog ran away, Nichole scooped up the badly \nbleeding boy and took him inside the school for help.\n  The fourth recipient of the AAA Lifesaving Medal comes from Brooklyn, \nNew York.\n  On January 28, 1999, 10-year-old Public School 91 Safety Patrol \nStacia Walker saw a car drop off a 5-year-old boy at school, then \ndepart.\n  Instead of entering the schoolyard, the little boy turned around and \nheaded for a park across the street, Stacia ran to the little boy and \nstopped him just before he crossed the street in front of a car.\n  This year's fifth AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Mt. \nPleasant, Michigan.\n  On September 2, 1998, 12-year-old Ganiard Elementary School Safety \nPatrol Michael T. Wiltsie was helping the adult crossing guard at the \ncorner of Broadway and Adams streets, the busiest corner for patrols.\n  The adult crossing guard had just walked to the center of the street \nto stop traffic when a 7-year-old boy walked around Michael's \noutstretched arms to follow her. A truck made a left-hand turn and \npassed between the adult crossing guard and Michael's post on the curb, \nignoring the stop sign held by the adult crossing guard. Michael \nreached out, grabbed the 7-year-old boy by the backpack, and pulled him \nto safety just as the truck sped by.\n  The fifth recipient of the AAA Lifesaving Medal comes from Fairfax, \nVirginia.\n  On February 22, 1999, Fairhill Elementary School Safety Patrol \nRoxanne A. Bauland (BALL-lund) was standing at her post near a bus stop \nwhen she noticed there was something wrong with a 6-year-old girl \napproaching the bus stop from across the street.\n  When the little girl began running toward the bus stop, the hard \ncandy she had been eating became lodged in her throat, causing her to \ncough and choke. Quickly sizing up the situation, 11-year-old Roxanne \nperformed the\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nHeimlich maneuver on the little girl and dislodged the candy from her \nthroat, quite possible saving the little girl's life.\n  The final AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Award recipient comes \nfrom Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n  On November 2, 1998, 11-year-old Jenny Lind Community School Safety \nPatrol Tonya L. M. Boner was completing her shift for the day when she \ndecided to wait a little longer to help some stragglers cross the \nstreet safely.\n  Three students, ages 7, 9, and 10, began to cross the road. Across \nthe intersection, a car stopped briefly at the stop sign, then headed \nstraight for the crosswalk and the students. Seeing the immediate \ndanger, Tonya hurried the students to the other side just as the car \nsped through the crosswalk a mere 2 feet from where she and the \nstudents had been walking seconds before.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and \nthanks to these young women and men who are visiting the Capitol today. \nThey are an asset to their communities, and their families and \nneighbors should be very proud of their courage and dedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n  Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring \nstudent safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against \ntraffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange \nsafety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the \nvery best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school \nsafety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic \naccidents and fatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound.\n  And we owe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for \ntheir selfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed \ndeserves the praise and recognition of their schools, their communities \nand the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4660-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CLARIFYING TAX TREATMENT OF SETTLEMENT TRUSTS ESTABLISHED UNDER ANCSA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Murkowski in rising \nin support of S. 933, which would clarify tax treatment of Settlement \nTrusts established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Our \nlegislation would amend the U.S. tax code by allowing these Settlement \nTrusts to organize as 501(c)(28) tax exempt organizations. This bill is \nsimilar to S. 2065 which I co-sponsored with Senator Murkowski last \nyear.\n  Consistent with last year's proposal, this bill allows for \nconveyances to a Settlement Trust without including those contributions \nin the beneficiaries' gross income. This is an important provision \nbecause under the current tax code, beneficiaries of a Settlement Trust \ncan be taxed on contributions to the trust, even though they haven't \nreceived a payment or disbursement from the Settlement Trust.\n  Our new provision also outlines the process and terms for revoking a \ntrust's tax exempt status as a 501(c)(28) organization. Under this \nprovision, if a Settlement Trust engages in forbidden activities as \noutlined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, its election as a \n501(c)(28) tax exempt organization would be revoked and the trust would \npay a tax on the fair market value of the assets held. This ensures \nthat U.S. taxpayers will not underwrite forbidden transactions within \nthe trusts or between the trusts and the beneficiaries.\n  This provision also requires a Settlement Trust to distribute at \nleast 55 percent of its adjusted taxable income for each year. This \nwould insure that Settlement Trusts fulfill a basic obligation to the \nbeneficiaries.\n  In addition, the new provision requires trusts electing to be \nrecognized as 501(c)(28) tax exempt organizations to withhold income \ntax from payments made to beneficiaries. There is, however, an \nimportant exception to this withholding provision. That exception would \napply to third party payments made on the behalf of beneficiaries for \neducational, funeral, or medical benefits.\n  It is my hope that we will clarify the tax treatment of these \nSettlement Trusts so that beneficiaries are treated in a fair and just \nmanner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4660-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, ``Teacher''--Webster's defines a teacher \nas one who ``imparts knowledge of or skill in'' a particular subject \nmatter. Teaching, of course, extends far beyond that clinical \ndefinition. Many teachers bring passion and dedication to their work \nthat often reaches outside the classroom as teachers serve as mentors, \ncoaches, advisors and friends to their students. Each of us can \nremember a teacher who inspired us, motivated us, even changed our \nlives.\n  The students at Shorecrest High School in Washington state have just \nsuch a teacher. Karen Mikolasy has taught for 28 years with passion for \nher students and for her work. She emphasizes consistency and \nstandards. In Mrs. Mikolasy's class homework is handed in on time and \npapers are rewritten until they earn at least a B. That consistency in \nexpectations also carries over to consistent positive reinforcement to \nher studnets--she tells them daily that it is a privilege to be their \nteacher. She says that in 28 years, not one day has gone by which she \nhasn't wanted to be in the classroom with her students.\n  I was honored to meet Mrs. Mikolasy a few weeks ago in my office \nwhile she was in DC to be recognized as the Washington State Teacher of \nthe Year. In the few minutes I met with her, I understood why she won \nthis honor. Her passion and commitment to educating and inspiring young \npeople was clear. The words of her students however, are probably the \nbest tribute.\n  One student characterized Mrs. Mikolasy this way: ``. . . she teased, \nshe nagged, fumed, roared, tested and laughed. She turned us into real \nreaders. She led us through worlds both familiar and foreign. There are \nstill rumors that hint at her unwavering stance in class, but one \nlegend should not be overlooked for forgotten. Mrs. Mikolasy is and \nalways will be a masterful teacher.''\n  Mrs. Mikolasy also tells a story about a package she received one day \nfrom a former student who is now a lawyer. The package, in which was a \nMont Blanc pen, also included a note: ``Dear teacher, big case, won \nlots of bucks! Won case because of writing. You taught writing: you get \npen. I did writing: I get money. Spend money. Money gone? Do more \nwriting, get more money. Writing not work, maybe I come get another \nwriting lesson.'' It is said that while most Americans spend their \nliving building careers, teachers spend their careers building lives. \nThat certainly seems to be the case with Karen Mikolasy.\n  So today I recognize Karen Mikolasy with the Innovation in Education \nAward. This is an award I give out each week to recognize people who \nmake a difference in our local communities. It is based on the common-\nsense idea, that it is parents and educators who look our children in \nthe eyes every day who know best how to educate them. Karen Mikolasy is \nmost deserving of this award.\n  Last night another experience made clear to me the impact teachers \ncan have on their students. I attended an awards dinner for the ``We \nthe People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' program. The \nprogram encourages junior high and high school students to study the \nconstitution by developing competitive teams at each school. Each team \nhas a teacher as a coach. Last night each teacher was recognized. There \nwere no fewer than 1200 students giving their teachers standing \novations and cheering in appreciation of their efforts.\n  I also like to recognize all of the teachers in Washington state, who \ndemonstrate their passion for teaching and for kids every day in the \nclassroom. Today and the balance of this week is set aside to honor and \ncelebrate teachers. I know that all of my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing our wonderful teachers across the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4661-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4661-S4662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE WASHINGTON STATE CHAMPIONS OF THE ``WE THE PEOPLE . \n          . . THE CITIZEN'S AND THE CONSTITUTION'' COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this week's Innovation in Education Award \nrecipient is an award winning class from Tahoma High School in Maple \nValley, Washington. Earlier this year 29 exceptional students from \nTahoma High School in Washington state won Washington state's \ncompetition testing their knowledge of the Constitution. As a result of \nthat victory, this past weekend they were in Washington, D.C. to \nparticipate in the national finals of the ``We the People . . . The \nCitizen and the Constitution'' program.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program, \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education, provides our elementary \nand secondary students a strong foundation in the history and \nphilosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. That foundation \nultimately promotes a sense of civic responsibility in these students \nand provides them with the means to act effectively within a democratic \nsociety.\n  The final activity in this program, which took place April 30-May 3, \nis a simulated congressional hearing in which students ``testify'' \nbefore a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and \nunderstanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to \nevaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues. I am happy to announce that I attended last \nnight's award ceremony which the Tahoma High team won a regional award.\n  I am proud of the achievement of these students and am happy to \nrecognize them. They are Adam Baldridge, Mary Basinger, Josh Bodily, \nSydney Brumbach, Katie Carder, Erica Chavez, Elizabeth Dauenhauer, \nSteven Dekoker, Meaghan Denney, Nathan Dill, Marisa Dorazio, Jesse \nDuncan, Jayson Hart, Jon Hallstrom, Carolyn Hott, Daniel Linder, Casey \nLineberger, Clark Lundberg, Karrie Pilgrim, Michael Pirog, David \nRosales, Jason Shinn, Jeremy Sloan, Justin Sly, Donny Trieu, Orianna \nTucker, Jessica Walker, Raymond Williams, and Elizabeth Zaleski. I also \nrecognize Kathy Hand, the Washington state coordinator for the ``We the \nPeople . . .'' program, and Kristy Ulrich, the district coordinator.\n  Finally, I applaud Mark Oglesby and his assistant Stephanie Galloway, \nthe teachers who have led their Tahoma High School class to this \nnational competition, and have taught the past four\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nstate championship classes from Washington state. That track record \nshows great leadership and dedication to the education of their \nstudents.\n  I enjoyed meeting with the students this weekend and wish them the \nbest for their future. They will certainly be well prepared for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4662-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1480.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8013\n\n       To the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the \n     United States, and to the President of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the Senate \n     and House of Representatives of the United States, in \n     Congress assembled:\n       We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative \n     session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as \n     follows:\n       Whereas, parts of Western Washington received the highest \n     amount of rainfall in state history between the months of \n     November and February, raining for ninety-one consecutive \n     days and producing over fifty-five inches of rain in King \n     County; and\n       Whereas, parts of the Olympic Peninsula, i.e., Lilliwaup, \n     received over one hundred fourteen inches of rain in a four-\n     month period; and\n       Whereas, sixty-one homes have been damaged and twenty-six \n     homes are uninhabitable in the area known as Carlyon Beach in \n     Thurston County, with property losses estimated at over ten \n     million dollars; and\n       Whereas, ground water flooding and landslides in Thurston \n     County have directly impacted at least seven hundred and \n     sixty-five residents, many of whom are elderly or have \n     special needs; and\n       Whereas, a landslide in the Aldercrest neighborhood in \n     Cowlitz County has damaged one hundred and thirty-seven homes \n     to date, and at least fifty additional homes are threatened; \n     and\n       Whereas, ground water problems will cost over two million \n     dollars to repair and currently no water or sewer systems are \n     in operation; and\n       Whereas, shoreline bulkheads are failing, and public \n     facilities expenses are estimated at one million dollars, \n     excluding the cost of geotechnical assistance; and\n       Whereas, Washington State Department of Transportation \n     estimates of highway damages reach eleven million two hundred \n     two thousand dollars, and ten million dollars of those \n     damages are in Mason County alone; and\n       Whereas, local government estimates of damages to county \n     roads and city streets reach seven million three hundred \n     ninety-two thousand four hundred thirty-five dollars; and\n       Whereas, Governor Locke's emergency proclamation now \n     includes six western counties and directs state government to \n     support emergency response activities as needed around the \n     state and authorizes the Washington Military Department and \n     its Emergency Management Division to coordinate state \n     agencies in the affected areas; and\n       Whereas, county officials are continuing to assess damages \n     to determine sufficient damage for justification of federal \n     assistance; and\n       Whereas, when damage from an event is so great it is beyond \n     the capability of local and state government to repair, the \n     Governor can ask the President to declare a disaster, thus \n     making a variety of federal disaster assistance programs \n     available to help restore communities to their predisaster \n     condition; and\n       Whereas, the federal disaster assistance programs available \n     may include housing and relocation assistance, individual and \n     family grants, funding to restore public infrastructure and \n     roads, tax exemptions for the relocation of evacuated \n     citizens, funding for geotechnical studies to prevent future \n     damage, and hazard mitigation;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully pray that if \n     the Governor requests federal assistance, the President and \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency will respond \n     favorably to the request and authorize the needed maximum \n     available disaster recovery support to address the needs of \n     Washington's citizens devastated by the record rainfall.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4008\n\n       To the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the \n     United States, and to the President of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the Senate \n     and House of Representatives of the United States, in \n     Congress assembled:\n       We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative \n     session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as \n     follows:\n       Whereas, the introduction of aquatic nuisance species, such \n     as the zebra mussel, European green crab, and the mitten crab \n     have the potential to cause significant environmental and \n     economic damage to our state and nation; and\n       Whereas, aquatic nuisance species can spread from any state \n     within our nation causing harm to all; and\n       Whereas, the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and \n     Control Act of 1990 authorizes the Aquatic Nuisance Species \n     Task Force to approve aquatic nuisance species management \n     plans that are submitted by state governors, and authorizes \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to fund up to \n     seventy-five percent of the implementation cost of approved \n     plans; and\n       Whereas, an important function of aquatic nuisance species \n     management plans is to encourage state and regional \n     jurisdictions to respond to aquatic nuisance species \n     problems; and\n       Whereas, Congress has authorized four million dollars \n     annually to fund the implementation of state management plans \n     to minimize the environmental and economic damage caused by \n     aquatic nuisance species to our state and nation; and\n       Whereas, in recent years only two hundred thousand dollars \n     has been appropriated annually to fund the implementation of \n     aquatic nuisance species management plans; and\n       Whereas, the Washington State Aquatic Nuisance Species \n     Management Plan alone identified one million seven hundred \n     thousand dollars in additional funding needed to address \n     aquatic nuisance species problems; and\n       Whereas, two hundred thousand dollars is inadequate to \n     allow fifty states, as well as interstate organizations, to \n     implement effective programs identified in aquatic nuisance \n     species management plans; and\n       Whereas, the appropriation of the full four million dollars \n     authorized to fund aquatic nuisance species management plans \n     would encourage development of plans, and thereby serve to \n     reduce the destructive impact of aquatic nuisance species and \n     minimize the risk of their spread to other states;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the President and Congress should recognize the destructive \n     potential of aquatic nuisance species and act to minimize \n     this destruction by supporting appropriation of the four \n     million dollars authorized to fund state aquatic nuisance \n     species management plans in fiscal year 2000 and future \n     years.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of \n     the United States, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member \n     of Congress from the State of Washington.\n       POM-83. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                          Joint Resolution 17\n\n       Whereas, the President of the United States, by Executive \n     Order, initiated the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem \n     Management Project (ICBEMP) to create a scientifically sound, \n     legally defensible, ecosystem management plan; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP was to be a broad-scale, 12-month \n     project that would give general direction to public land \n     managers for ecosystem management but has become a top-down, \n     highly prescriptive set of management directives; and\n       Whereas, the management direction provided by the ICBEMP \n     does not match the purpose and need statements made in the \n     environmental impact statement (EIS), which were to restore \n     and maintain a healthy forest, to provide sustainable and \n     predictable levels of products and services, and to support \n     economic and social needs of people, cultures, and \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, the Columbia Basin ecosystem is a very diverse and \n     complex environment, and basinwide standards could be a \n     detriment to some or all forest-dependent and range-dependent \n     economies; and\n       Whereas, experts maintain that the ICBEMP violates the \n     Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, the National Forest \n     Management Act of 1976, the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \n     Resource Planning Act of 1974, the Regulatory Flexibility \n     Act, and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \n     Act of 1996; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP was intended to be a scientifically \n     sound management plan but has become politically based on \n     selective science, which supports predetermined preservation \n     goals with a top-down, one-size-fits-all, highly prescriptive \n     set of management objectives and standards; and\n       Whereas, the recent interim roadless policy proposed by \n     federal agencies indicates a strong desire to create de facto \n     wilderness areas and circumvent the authority of Congress (in \n     direct violation of the previously listed laws) and indicates \n     the political direction incorporated into the ICBEMP, which\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n     obfuscates the tireless, good faith efforts of local \n     representatives who participated in the ICBEMP process; and\n       Whereas, public lands administered by the U.S. Forest \n     Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are to be \n     managed for multiple use for the benefit of the citizens of \n     the United States, and road closures proposed within the \n     ICBEMP EIS preferred alternative will severely limit the \n     multiple use of millions of acres of public land; and\n       Whereas, current road closures already dramatically limit \n     physical and financial abilities to control noxious weeds, \n     and the ICBEMP-proposed further closures pose a serious \n     threat of further and more serious weed encroachment into \n     Montana's forests and grasslands; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP has become a political document, rather \n     than a resource manageable planning document; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP contains too many economic assumptions \n     and too few economic projections based on accurate \n     information; and\n       Whereas, implementation of the ICBEMP will directly affect \n     management of 16 BLM districts and 30 national forests, all \n     in the western United States; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP coverage extends to 104 counties and \n     144 million acres of land (72 million scores of which are \n     private), and the ICBEMP implementation will directly and \n     indirectly affect the livelihoods of millions of citizens in \n     the planning area; and\n       Whereas, a major component of the basic economies of about \n     two-thirds of the affected rural and natural resource-\n     dependent counties would be directly and potentially severely \n     impacted by implementation of the ICBEMP; and\n       Whereas, the citizens of Montana, Montana's local \n     government units, and Montana's communities have a direct \n     interest in public land management that produces payments in \n     lieu of taxes and (most importantly) forest receipts that \n     generate revenue to the federal treasury and significantly \n     contribute to funding public schools and roads; and\n       Whereas, it is questionable whether Congress will fund the \n     ICBEMP implementation, and the impacts of inadequate \n     implementation funding would be significantly more disastrous \n     for natural resources than if implementation were fully \n     funded; and\n       Whereas, the citizens of the United States and communities \n     throughout the western United States depend on the \n     stewardship, sustained yield, and even-flow production of \n     goods and services from multiple-use management of public \n     lands located in those states; and\n       Whereas, there is increasing national and world demand for \n     renewable, recyclable goods and services, including \n     recreation, wildlife, fisheries, food, fiber, clean air, and \n     clean water; and\n       Whereas, in Montana, the U.S. Forest Service has reduced \n     timber harvest by over 50% since 1950, even though wood is \n     the preferred raw material for home building, and transferred \n     global environmental consequences were never discussed or \n     considered when decisions were being made to reduce budgets; \n     and\n       Whereas, domestic raw materials production is being \n     increasingly restricted in the United States, even in light \n     of rising domestic consumption and the United States' \n     position as a massive net importer of raw materials; and\n       Whereas, decisions are being made on a daily basis and at \n     all levels of government to restrict raw materials \n     production, almost always on environmental grounds, yet \n     consumption is virtually never discussed; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP draft documents fail to adequately and \n     truthfully define and disclose the economic, environmental, \n     and social conditions of Montana's communities and local \n     government units and the future effects on these entities of \n     implementation of the proposed ecosystem management \n     practices; and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP represents a top-down management \n     paradigm that reduces or eliminates effective local input to \n     natural resource management and environmental decisionmaking; \n     and\n       Whereas, the ICBEMP has become a 6-year, over $40 million \n     project, with no end in sight: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the federal government be strongly \n     urged to:\n       (1) terminate the ICBEMP and issue no Record of Decision on \n     the ICBEMP;\n       (2) forward the accurate ecosystem management data \n     developed through the ICBEMP to relevant BLM district \n     managers and U.S. Forest Service forest supervisors;\n       (3) ensure that all public comments on the ICBEMP be \n     incorporated into the public record for the ICBEMP;\n       (4) forward to district managers and supervisors the public \n     comments provided on the ICBEMP for the managers' and \n     supervisors' consideration related to updates to the land and \n     resource management plans required by federal law; and\n       (5) coordinate plan revisions between adjoining management \n     units to provide consistency and connectivity and to consider \n     cumulative impacts in dealing with broad-scale issues that \n     affect multiple jurisdictions.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that federal natural resource \n     planning and environmental management feature site-specific \n     management decisions made by local decisionmakers, local \n     citizenry, and parties directly and personally affected by \n     these decisions for our public lands.\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal government \n     acknowledge that the alternatives presented in the ICBEMP EIS \n     are inconsistent with but should be consistent with the \n     balanced ``Purpose of and Need for Action'' statements in the \n     same documents, which are:\n       (1) ``restore and maintain long-term ecosystem health and \n     ecological integrity'' (i.e., restore and maintain a healthy \n     forest); and\n       (2) ``support economic and/or social needs of people, \n     cultures, and communities, and provide sustainable and \n     predictable levels of products and services from our public \n     lands administered by the Forest Service or BLM . . .''; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent by the \n     Secretary of State to the President of the United States, the \n     Vice President of the United States, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, the presiding \n     officers of the Appropriations Committees of the U.S. Senate \n     and U.S. House, the Montana Congressional Delegation, the \n     Chief of the Forest Service, and the Director of the Bureau \n     of Land Management.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4664-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROBB:\n       S. 948.

A bill to clarify and enhance the authorities of the Chief \nInformation Officer of the Department of Agriculture; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\nthe usda information technology reform and year-2000 compliance act of \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the USDA \nInformation Technology Reform and Year-2000 Compliance Act of 1999. \nThis legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion \nand other information technology acquisition and management activities \nwithin the Office of the Chief Information Office of the Department of \nAgriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the \ncomplex and important task of ensuring that all critical computer \nfunctions at the department are operational on January 1, 2000. It is \nalso a wiser and more cost-effective way to construct an information \ntechnology infrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems \nto interoperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do.\n  The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous \nresponsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a \ndiverse portfolio of over 200 Federal programs throughout the Nation \nand the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. \nIt is the fourth largest Federal agency, with 31 agencies and offices. \nThe department is responsible for the safety of our food supply, \nnutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the \nprotection of our natural resources. Since more than 40 percent of the \nnon-tax debt owed to the Federal Government is owed to USDA, the \ndepartment has a responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of \ntaxpayers' investments.\n  Responsibility for keeping the mission-critical information \ntechnology functioning should clearly rest with the Chief Information \nOfficer. The decentralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA led \nto a lack of focus on departmental priorities. Each agency was allowed \nto determine what services, programs, and activities it deemed \nimportant enough to be operational at the end of the millennium. This \ndecentralized approach also led to a lack of guidance, oversight and \nthe development of contingency plans. Efforts to rectify this situation \nare well underway. I am pleased that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman \nhas pledged his personal commitment to the success of year 2000 \ncompliance and has made it one of the highest priorities for USDA.\n  In fiscal year 1999, USDA plans to spend more than $1.2 billion on \ninformation technology and related information resources management \nactivities, including year 2000 computer compliance. The General \nAccounting Office has chronicled USDA's long history of problems in \nmanaging its substantial information technology investments. The GAO \nreports that such ineffective planning and management have resulted in \nUSDA's wasting millions of dollars on computer systems.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 2116, a bill to reform the information \ntechnology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief \nInformation Officer control over the planning, development, and \nacquisition of information technology at the department. Introduction \nof that bill and similar legislation in 1997 prompted some coordination \nof information technology among the department's agencies and offices. \nHowever, component agencies are still allowed to independently acquire \nand manage information technology investments solely on the basis of \ntheir own parochial interests or needs. This legislation is needed to \nstrengthen that coordination and ensure that centralized information \ntechnology management continues in the future.\n  This legislation further requires that the Chief Information Officer \nmanage the design and implementation of an information technology \narchitecture based on strategic business plans that maximizes the \neffectiveness and efficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in \nthe bill is authority for the Chief Information Officer to approve \nexpenditures for information resources and for year 2000 compliance \npurposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, \nthe bill requires that each agency transfer up to 10 percent of its \ninformation technology budget to the Chief Information Officer's \ncontrol.\n  The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring \nthat the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible \ncommon computing environment for the field service centers based on \nintegrated program delivery. The architecture will also provide maximum \ndata sharing with USDA customers and other Federal and state agencies, \nwhich is expected to result in a significant reduction in operating \ncosts.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, \nUSDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual \namong Government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. \nI commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to \naddress a portion of the information resource management problems of \nthe Federal Government and ask for their support of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text and a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States agriculture, food safety, the health of \n     plants and animals, the economies of rural communities, \n     international commerce in food, and food aid rely on the \n     Department of Agriculture for the effective and timely \n     administration of program activities essential to their \n     success and vitality;\n       (2) the successful administration of the program activities \n     depends on the ability of the Department to use information \n     technology in as efficient and effective manner as is \n     technologically feasible;\n       (3) to successfully administer the program activities, the \n     Department relies on information technology that requires \n     comprehensive and Department-wide overview and control to \n     avoid needless duplication and misuse of resources;\n       (4) to better ensure the continued success and vitality of \n     agricultural producers and rural communities, it is \n     imperative that measures are taken within the Department to \n     coordinate and centrally plan the use of the information \n     technology of the Department;\n       (5) because production control and subsidy programs are \n     ending, agricultural producers of the United States need the \n     best possible information to make decisions that will \n     maximize profits, satisfy consumer demand, and contribute to \n     the alleviation of hunger in the United States and abroad;\n       (6) a single authority for Department-wide planning is \n     needed to ensure that the information technology architecture \n     of the Department is based on the strategic business plans, \n     information technology, management goals, and core business \n     process methodology of the Department;\n       (7) information technology is a strategic resource for the \n     missions and program activities of the Department;\n       (8) year-2000 compliance is 1 of the most important \n     challenges facing the Federal Government and the private \n     sector;\n       (9) because the responsibility for ensuring year-2000 \n     compliance at the Department was initially left to individual \n     offices and agencies, no overall priorities have been \n     established, and there is no assurance that the\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\n     most important functions of the Department will be operable \n     on January 1, 2000;\n       (10) it is the responsibility of the Chief Information \n     Officer to provide leadership in--\n       (A) defining and explaining the importance of achieving \n     year-2000 compliance;\n       (B) selecting the overall approach for structuring the \n     year-2000 compliance efforts of the Department;\n       (C) assessing the ability of the information resource \n     management infrastructures of the Department to adequately \n     support the year-2000 compliance efforts; and\n       (D) mobilizing the resources of the Department to achieve \n     year-2000 compliance;\n       (11) the failure of the Department to meet the requirement \n     of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that \n     all mission-critical systems of the Department achieve year-\n     2000 compliance would have serious adverse consequences on \n     the program activities of the Department, the economies of \n     rural communities, the health of the people of the United \n     States, world hunger, and international commerce in \n     agricultural commodities and products;\n       (12) centralizing the approval authority for planning and \n     investment for information technology in the Office of the \n     Chief Information Officer will--\n       (A) provide the Department with strong and coordinated \n     leadership and direction;\n       (B) ensure that the business architecture of an office or \n     agency is based on rigorous core business process \n     methodology;\n       (C) ensure that the information technology architecture of \n     the Department is based on the strategic business plans of \n     the offices or agencies and the missions of the Department;\n       (D) ensure that funds will be invested in information \n     technology only after the Chief Information Officer has \n     determined that--\n       (i) the planning and review of future business requirements \n     of the office or agency are complete; and\n       (ii) the information technology architecture of the office \n     or agency is based on business requirements and is consistent \n     with the Department-wide information technology architecture; \n     and\n       (E) cause the Department to act as a single enterprise with \n     respect to information technology, thus eliminating the \n     duplication and inefficiency associated with a single office- \n     or agency-based approach; and\n       (13) consistent with the Information Technology Management \n     Reform Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), each office or \n     agency of the Department should achieve at least--\n       (A) a 5 percent per year decrease in costs incurred for \n     operation and maintenance of information technology; and\n       (B) a 5 percent per year increase in operational efficiency \n     through improvements in information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to facilitate the successful administration of programs \n     and activities of the Department through the creation of a \n     centralized office, and Chief Information Officer position, \n     in the Department to provide strong and innovative managerial \n     leadership to oversee the planning, funding, acquisition, and \n     management of information technology and information resource \n     management; and\n       (2) to provide the Chief Information Officer with the \n     authority and funding necessary to correct the year-2000 \n     compliance problem of the Department.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish permanent tax incentives for research and development, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     private sector research and development investment act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am joining my cosponsors, \nSenators Bingaman, Frist, Lieberman, and Snowe, in introducing the \nPrivate Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999.\n  This bill makes the research tax credit permanent and significantly \nimproves the structure of that credit. Many Senators are for this \nextension, and it is high time, and for the permanentization of this \ncredit.\n  This also adjusts the credit to today. That credit was put in place \nmany years ago, and much of what it does doesn't fit today's industrial \nbase, including many startup companies that cannot take the right kind \nof credit.\n  We have made some changes which will make it cost a little bit more, \nbut I think the Finance Committee should take a look at some of the \nchanges that are in this Domenici-Bingaman bill, because it will make \nthe credit more effective and more available.\n  In March of 1998, 150 of our Nation's top decisionmakers met at MIT \nfor the first national innovative summit. The summit leaders included \nCEOs, university presidents, labor leaders, Governors, Members of \nCongress, and senior administrative officials.\n  In essence, they conclude that in order to keep the United States of \nAmerica on the cutting edge of research that can be applied to \ninnovative things for America's future and for our businesses, that we \nmust make this tax permanent, that dollar for dollar it is the best \ninvestment in both general research and specific research to keep \nAmerica strong and competitive in the world.\n  When those people say dollar for dollar it is the most effective, \nthey are saying it is more effective than programmatic assistance to \nresearch, which obviously is very necessary, and we continue to expand \nupon and have it grow. But if you don't make this permanent, you are \nlosing a lot of research by American businesses, No. 1. If you don't \ncorrect it, you will lose the effectiveness among companies that need \nit the most. And third, you will see to it that more, rather than less, \nAmerican companies do research overseas.\n  Research jobs are great jobs. They are just as much a part of \nAmerica's basic prosperity as are the jobs that come from that research \nby way of products or activities.\n  Mr. President, advanced technologies drive a significant part of our \nnation's economic strength. Our economy and our standard of living \ndepend on a constant influx of new technologies, processes, and \nproducts from our industries.\n  Many countries provide labor at lower costs than the United States. \nThus, as any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor \nfrequently find ways to undercut our production costs. We maintain our \neconomic strength only by constantly improving our products through \ninnovation. Maintaining and improving our national ability to innovate \nis critically important to the nation.\n  The majority of new products requires industrial research and \ndevelopment to reach the market stage. I want to encourage that \nresearch and development to create new products to ensure that our \nfactories stay busy and that our workforce stays fully employed at high \nsalaried jobs.\n  I want more of our large multi-national companies to select the \nUnited States as the location of their R R done here creates \nAmerican jobs. And since frequently the benefits of research in one \narea apply in another area, I want those spin-off benefits here, too.\n  Congress created the Research Tax Credit to encourage companies to \nperform research. But many studies document that the present form of \nthis Tax Credit is not providing as much stimulation to industrial R \nas it could. Today, we're introducing legislation to improve the \nResearch Tax Credit.\n  In March of 1998, 150 of our nation's top decision makers met at MIT, \nfor the first National Innovation Summit. The Summit included corporate \nCEO's, university presidents, labor leaders, governors, members of \nCongress, and Senior Administration officials.\n  At the Summit, these experts discussed the health of the future \nnational research base. More than three-quarters of them thought that \nthe quality of that base would be no better or worse than it is today, \nwith nearly one third projecting that it would be weaker.\n  The Summit participants singled out the Research Tax Credit as the \npolicy measure with the greatest potential for a positive near-term \nimpact. The Council on Competitiveness, who co-sponsored that Summit, \nstated that ``making the [Research] Tax Credit permanent reflected a \nwidely share consensus among leaders whose companies and universities \ncontribute decisively to the nation's economy.''\n  The single most important change in our bill is to make the Credit \npermanent. Many studies point out that the temporary nature of the \nCredit has prevented companies from building careful research \nstrategies.\n  Many of my colleagues in Congress have also expressed interest in \nmaking the Credit permanent. But we're urging them to go beyond that \naction and, at the same time, address shortcomings that have been \nidentified in the current Credit. I want to use the current enthusiasm \nfor permanence to also craft a Credit that will better serve the \nnation.\n  For example, the current Credit references a company's research \nintensity back to 1984-88. That's too outdated to meet today's dynamic \nmarket conditions. Many companies are involved today in products that \nweren't even invented in 1984.\n  Our legislation allows a company to base their credit on their \nresearch intensity averaged over the preceding eight years. It also \nallows companies to stay with the current formulation of the Credit if \nthey prefer.\n  Our bill builds other improvements into the Credit as well. For \nexample, the Alternative Research Credit component has been criticized \nbecause it only rewards the maintenance level of a company's research, \nit does not provide significant motivation to increase research \nintensity. With our proposed changes, the Alternative Credit now \nincorporates the same 20 percent motivation for increased research \nintensity that is found in the regular Credit--this is a major \nimprovement. We also increase the base level of the Alternative Credit \nsignificantly.\n  The current Credit has a provision that severely restricts the \nability of start-up companies to fully benefit. Analysis by the \nCongressional Research Service showed that 5 our of 6 start-up \ncompanies received reduced benefits because of a current provision that \nlimits their allowable increase in research expenditures.\n  I'm concerned when start-up companies aren't receiving full Credit. \nThese are just the companies that drive the innovative cycle in this \ncountry; they are the ones that frequently bring out the newest \nleading-edge products. Our legislation thus drops this limitation and \nintroduces additional help for start-up businesses.\n  Our legislation addresses several other shortcomings in the current \nCredit as well. Now there is a ``Basic Research Credit'' allowed, but \nrarely used. This should be encouraging research conducted at \nuniversities.\n  But that part of the Credit is now defined to include only research \nthat does ``not have a specific commercial objective.'' There aren't \nmany companies that want to support--much less admit to their \nstockholders that they are supporting--research with no commercial \ninterest. The idea of this clause was to encourage support of long term \nresearch, which is a fine idea.\n  This is the kind of research that benefits far more than just the \nnext product improvement. It can enable a whole\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nnew product or service and we need to encourage it.\n  Our legislation adds major incentives for basic research by dropping \nthe requirement that only increments above a baseline can be used and \nby including any research that is done for a consortium of U.S. \ncompanies or any research that is destined for open literature \npublication. We're also allowing this Credit to apply to research done \nin national labs.\n  And finally our legislation recognizes the importance of encouraging \ncompanies to use research capabilities wherever they exist in the \ncountry, whether in other businesses, universities, or national labs. \nThe current credit disallows 35% of all expenses for research performed \nunder an external contract--our legislation allows all such expenses to \napply towards the Credit when the research is performed at a \nuniversity, small business, or national laboratory.\n  In summary, this bill incorporates all the improvement suggested in \nother bills that primarily make the credit permanent and provide some \nincrease in the alternative credit. But this bill goes further and \ncorrects weaknesses in the current formulation of the Credit. I want to \nseize this opportunity to make the Research Tax Credit a tool that will \ntruly meet the goals for which it was established.\n  The fact that this bill addresses significant shortcomings in the \ncurrent Credit has not gone unnoticed. Spokesman for several groups \nthat endorse this bill are here with us today. After Senator Bingaman \nspeaks, I'll invite representatives from the Council on \nCompetitiveness, the National Association of State Universities and \nLand Grant Colleges, the National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing, \nand the American Association of Engineering Societies to add their \nperspectives.\n  With this new bill, we will significantly strengthen incentives for \nprivate companies to undertake research that leads to new processes, \nnew services, and new products.

Thus, all companies benefiting \n     from its current formulation are positively impacted. The \n     changes in the Credit are focused in the Alternative Credit \n     and Basic Research Credit portions of the current Credit \n     legislation and represent significant enhancements to these \n     options.\n       The Bill addresses several concerns with the existing \n     Credit: base period used for the regular credit, 1984-88, is \n     out-dated; 50% rule precludes most startups from gaining full \n     credit; basic research credit is very difficult to use, and \n     alternative credit provides no strong incentive for increased \n     research intensity.\n       In addition to permanence, the Bill increases the \n     maintenance level of the alternative credit to 4%. (Thus the \n     Bill meets the goals of some groups who favor simply \n     permanence and 1% additional to the alternative credit). In \n     addition, the bill; establishes a 20% marginal rate for \n     increased intensity for users of the alternative credit; \n     changes the base period for alternative credit users to an 8 \n     year average; eliminates the 50% rule for users of the \n     alternative credit; encourages industrial partnerships with \n     universities and national labs; expands definition of basic \n     research to include all published work; enables basic \n     research at FFRDCs to count toward their basic research \n     credit; qualifies 100% of contract research accomplished at \n     universities, national labs, and small businesses; encourages \n     establishment of research-driven consortia by providing 20% \n     credit for their research expenses; provides a phase-in of \n     credit for start-up businesses, and enables small businesses \n     to count patent filing fees toward research expenses.\n       With these enhancements, the Domenici-Bingaman Bill \n     provides a permanent Research Tax Credit that address \n     shortcomings in the current formulation of the Credit. \n     Furthermore, the Bill meets the goals of constituents who \n     favor only permanence or only permanence plus an increase in \n     the alternative credit.\n\n                                 SUMMARY\nJoint Tax 10-yr evaluations:\n    Section II: Make the Credit permanent....................    $26.3 B\n    Section III: Improve the Alternative Investment Credit,          3.8\n     AIC, by increasing the Credit allowed for the base\n     maintenance level of R expenditures, and add an\n     incremental incentive package onto the AIC.

These two sections give \n     permanence plus increase the AIC by slightly more than 1%. \n     They also add major enhancements to the AIC by establishing \n     an option for companies to realize a 20% incremental benefit. \n     The Baucus/Hatch version is supported by the R Tax \n     Coalition, using their mantra of ``Permanence plus 1%.'' \n     Sections II and III do everything that the R Tax Coalition \n     wants and a lot more.\n       Section IV is expensive at $5 Billion, but gains the \n     strongest possible support from universities. This section \n     changes the definition of basic research, but more important, \n     lets contract research at a university (+SB or lab) be \n     treated as a flat 20% credit, not above an incremental base. \n     This is a tremendous incentive to fund expenditures for basic \n     research at universities.\n       Section V encourages consortia to fund research. Senator \n     has encouraged consortia formation in other ways, this \n     continues his leadership in this area.\n       Section VI is a further major incentive for companies to \n     fund research at universities, labs, and small businesses.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my co-\nsponsors, Senators Domenici, Lieberman, Frist, and Snowe in introducing \nthe Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999. \nThis bill will finally make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit \npermanent, a provision of the federal tax code that was first enacted \nin 1981, and has been extended 9 times since.\n  In addition to the provision of permanence, our bill has other \nimprovements that I believe will address many of the shortcomings of \nexisting law, and will bring the code more in synch with the ways \nindustry is performing R today. But before I speak to some of those \nprovisions, I would like to spend a little time discussing why I think \nwe need to enact this legislation now.\n  I think it is fair to say that the nation's economy owes much of its \nresurgence to the increases in productivity attributable to the \ninfusion of high technology products and services. Our nation is today \nin the enviable position of not only having the greatest access to \nthese products, but also being the primary provider of these products \nfor the rest of the world.\n  These capabilities have enabled American businesses to be in a \nposition of world leadership in areas as diverse as medical and bio \ntechnologies, microelectronics, and financial services.\n  In order for us to insure that the economic engine continues to run \nat peak form, we must assure that there is a continual infusion of new \ntechnologies\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nthat will spawn the products and services of the future market. Many \neconomists state that the best way to do this is to create a stable \nincentive for research investment and an environment where businesses \nhave the flexibility to choose among all the options available to \nperform the research. A policy which achieves these goals will provide \nbusinesses with the long-term incentive to invest in both the research \nand the people that will create the next generation of commercially \nsuccessful products.\n  That is exactly what the ``Private Sector Research and Development \nInvestment Act of 1999'' does. First, it makes Section 41 of the \nInternal Revenue Code permanent, creating a stable long-term \nenvironment for investment. But it goes beyond that.\n  Present law does not allow all companies to benefit equally from the \nTax Credit. Some companies, simply as a result of where they were in \nthe business cycle in the late 80's, find that they cannot attain the \nfull benefit of the credit. And, if the company did not exist at all in \nthe 80's, as is the case with most of the Internet and many of the \nbiotech start-up firms, there is simply no way at all for them to \naccess the full credit rate. This is simply not fair. Our bill proposes \nto correct that inequity by making the 20% marginal rate available to \nall companies that are growing their research investment.\n  With much of the nation's research talent residing in our \nuniversities and federal laboratories, we are proposing to extend the \nfull Tax Credit for research investments companies make in those \ninstitutions.\n  I am particularly pleased with the part of this provision that \nprovides a more cost effective way for companies to invest in the \neducation of our future generation of scientists and engineers at our \nuniversities. If this bill becomes law, as many as 3000 additional \nmasters and doctoral level engineers and scientists could be produced \neach year, with up to 1000 of these being women and minorities, all at \nno additional cost to businesses.\n\n  I fully expect that the ``Private Sector Research and Development \nInvestment Act of 1999'' will accelerate business investment in \nuniversities, growing the number of trained scientists and engineers \neven faster. At a time when there has been much debate over providing \nadditional employment visas to foreign engineers, this bill provides \none mechanism for educating qualified Americans to fill these high tech \njobs.\n  As the cost of doing research continues to escalate, and companies \nfind it more difficult to go it alone, our bill proposes that the \nresearch investments companies make in research consortia with other \nbusinesses, universities, and federal laboratories be fully available \nfor the Tax Credit. I have seen firsthand, at places like Sandia and \nLos Alamos National Laboratories, the results of consortia partnerships \nbetween industry and our national labs, and I believe that it is in our \nnation's best interest to promote these research arrangements.\n  All of our studies indicate that small businesses are the ``high \ntest'' fuel of the nation's economy, producing more and highly paid \njobs. Yet it is this group of companies that have the hardest time in \naccessing the Tax Credit under existing law. We propose to modify the \nlaw so that small businesses have greater benefit in their early years, \nwhen the value of the credit can have the greatest impact on a rapidly \ngrowing, but often cash-limited, company.\n  Finally, to assure that these small businesses are truly able to \ncompete in the global market and to protect their intellectual assets, \nwe are proposing that the full value of the Tax Credit be applied to \ntheir patent filing fees, both here and abroad.\n  In speaking with owners of small, high tech businesses in New Mexico, \nI hear that anything we can do to increase the capital funds available \nto these businesses as they are starting up is critical to their \nsuccess. These two special provisions for small businesses are positive \nsteps in that direction.\n  Mr. President, many of my fellow Senators and Members of the House \nhave already endorsed the concept of a permanent R Tax Credit. With \nthat base of enthusiasm already in place, I encourage my colleagues to \nseize the opportunity to move forward and complete the job. Let's make \nit permanent, and let's make it right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Domenici \nand Bingaman today in supporting the Private Sector Research and \nDevelopment Investment Act of 1999. This bill recognizes that we are \nmoving toward a New Economy and supports the engine of that New \nEconomy. Let me explain.\n  In this decade, we have returned to our nation's historic growth rate \nof 3% plus growth. We haven't seen this in 30 years, but now we are \nback there again. We know what the last few years of growth feel like--\nAmerica is starting to feel like an opportunity society again. We are \nmoving toward some fundamental changes in our economic structure, \ntoward a knowledge-based economy and further away from a resource-based \neconomy. Key to these high growth rates has been overall productivity \ngains that are back in the 2% range, which has enabled the United \nStates to experience real growth and real growth in incomes without \nsignificant inflation. A significant part of our productivity gains \nhave come from gains in manufacturing productivity, which has \napproached 4% in each of the past three years. These manufacturing \ngains come directly from innovation, and in recent years these are \nlargely driven by innovation in information technology--one of the most \namazing results of R in this century from the invention of the \ntransistor over 50 years ago to the development of the Internet today. \nAnd it looks like we are starting to get noticeable productivity gains \nin our services sector as well, also driven by information technology. \nThe digital revolution is affecting every sector of our economy. As \nAndy Grove, Chairman of Intel, said, ``In five years, there will be no \nInternet companies. Every company will be an Internet company,'' or it \nwon't be in business.\n  Some analysts look at the stock market today and compare it to the \n1600's Dutch tulip bulbs investment bubble, maybe the largest bubble of \nall time, and its subsequent crash. The difference is that tulip bulbs \ndid not fundamentally alter the means of communication and increase \nproductivity as the Internet does.\n  Pharmaceuticals and health care is another area in which our \ncountry's investment in R has catapulted us above our competitors. A \nrecent study from the Department of Commerce found that the United \nStates is decades ahead of other countries in the pharmaceutical and \nhealth related industries directly because of our investment in R In \nthe past 50 years, researchers from U.S. pharmaceutical companies have \ndiscovered and developed breakthrough treatments for asthma, heart \ndisease, osteoporosis, HIV/AIDS, stroke, ulcers, and glaucoma. And they \nhave developed vaccines against previously common causes of infant \ndeath including polio, rubella, influenza B and whooping cough. Why is \nthe U.S. pharmaceutical industry the number one global innovator in \nmedicine? According to Raymond Gilmartin, Chairman, President and CEO \nof Merck & Co., because ``The U.S. pharmaceutical industry leads the \nworld in its commitment to research. . .''\n  There have been at least a dozen major economic studies, including \nthose of Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, which conclude that \ntechnological progress accounts for 50%, and lately considerable more, \nof our total growth and has twice the impact on economic growth as \nlabor or capital. For the long term health of our economy, we need to \ninvest now in activities that will have a future payoff in innovation \nand productivity. A one percent increase in our nation's investment in \nresearch results in a productivity increase of 0.23%. We need to ensure \nour future by creating the institutions and incentives to increase R \ninvestment in the United States. This Act will replace our current, \ndysfunctional system of on-again, off-again R tax credits with a tax \ncredit that is reliably permanent. In the global economy we will have \nto not only out-perform our competitors, but out-innovate them. Giving \nour industry the tools to support their own innovation is a timely act.\n  This Act meets the goals of some groups who favor simply making the \ncredit permanent and increasing the alternative credit by one percent, \nas does\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nthe bill introduced by my esteemed colleague Senator Hatch. I am a \ncosponsor of Senator Hatch's bill. I believe we need to make the R \ncredit permanent. But I feel strongly that we need further changes to \nthe Act to increase its effectiveness, make it more accessible to small \nand start up businesses, update the credit to account for changes we \nare seeing in industry and, importantly, to complement the relationship \nbetween Federal and private sector research. The bill that Senators \nDomenici, Bingaman, Frist, Snowe, and myself are introducing makes \nthese important changes, as well as making the R tax credit \npermanent.\n  Industry research is largely dependent on the basic research \nundertaken by the Federal government. Because industry itself does not \nperform basic research--84% of industry research is concentrated on \nproduct development, the final stage of R private sector must \ndraw on government-funded research to develop ideas for new market \nproducts. Of all papers cited in U.S. industry patents, 73% are from \ngovernment and non-profit funded research. This marriage of basic \nFederal research and applied private research is essential. Yet, as a \npercent of GDP, Federal investment in R has been nearly halved over \nthe last 30 years. We are living off of the fruits of basic research \nfrom the mid-1960s. In addition, the national labs and universities are \nfacing a brain drain by the private sector as engineers and scientists \nare in high demand and increasingly in short supply. The private sector \nrecognizes the importance of work accomplished through Federal funding \nand knows this is a problem that needs to be addressed. This bill \nencourages collaboration between private sector research and national \nlabs and universities and offers a financial incentive to use the \nnational labs and universities. Specifically, the Act encourages \nindustry to use the federally funded programs by qualifying 100% of \ncontract research accomplished at universities, national labs, and \nsmall businesses. It also enables basic research at Federally Funded \nR Centers to count toward the basic research credit. By expanding the \ncredit to research done in consortia, the Act also recognizes that \nresearch today is more often done in collaboration than in isolation.\n  The fastest method of moving research into the marketplace is often \nthrough small, startup companies. The Act updates the tax credit rules \nto accommodate the special R cycles faced by these companies. By \nsupporting the small but crucial R efforts of new technology-based \nfirms, the Act nurtures the very companies who contribute \ndisproportionately to our national productivity and employment growth.\n  The Act also updates our view of R For the alternative credit, it \ncalculates R expenditures with respect to a rolling baseline, rather \nthan a fixed 1980's baseline that is increasingly remote and outdated \nas time passes.\n  Mr. President, I believe there has been a growing awareness among \nSenators over the past couple of years that technology has been one of \nthe driving forces behind our fantastic economic growth in this \ncountry. Despite that we are finally out of the red on the budget and \nfinally in the black, we know that continued control and restraint must \nbe exercised on the budget and we will have to make difficult choices \nabout what programs to fund and what tax cuts to make. But now that we \nknow that technological progress is responsible for 50% or more of \neconomic growth, I think we owe it to ourselves to encourage such \nprogress whenever possible. It is an investment in our future which we \ncannot do without.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 952. A bill to expand an antitrust exemption applicable to \nprofessional sports leagues and to require, as a condition of such an \nexemption, participation by professional football and major league \nbaseball sports leagues in the financing of certain stadium \nconstruction activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n         stadium financing and franchise relocation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation, the Stadium Financing and Franchise Relocation \nAct of 1999, which is designed to respond to the need for stabilizing \nmajor league baseball and football franchises located in metropolitan \nareas of the United States.\n  I have long been concerned with the pressure put upon communities by \nbaseball and football clubs seeking new playing facilities, where, with \nthe gun to their heads of the team's overt or tacit threat to move to \nanother city, government leaders feel compelled to have taxpayers \nfinance a lion's share of ballpark and stadium construction costs. As \nthose costs rise--a present state-of-the-art new facility goes for \nclose to $300 million--those pressures have intensified.\n  Professional sports teams are entrusted with a public interest. The \nmovement of the Dodgers from Brooklyn, which broke the hearts of \nmillions of their Flatbush followers, was the start of pirating of \nsports franchises in America, and should never have been allowed. It \nwas accompanied, of course, by the flight of the Giants from New York \nto San Francisco.\n  Since then, the matter has proliferated to an almost absurd degree. \nIt is hard to understand why the taxpayers of Maryland and Baltimore \nhad to be in a bidding contest for the Cleveland Browns, when Baltimore \nshould have had its own team, the Colts, instead of the Colts moving \nout of Baltimore in the middle of the night to go to Indianapolis.\n  I have participated in America's love affair with sports since I was \na youngster in Wichita, Kansas, reading the box scores in the Wichita \nEagle every morning because of my love and passion for baseball. I have \nbeen attending Phillies and Eagles games, and, when I can, Pirates and \nSteelers games, because of my love for each of these sports. They are \ntremendously exciting.\n  Basically, it was unfair for the old Browns to have been taken out of \nCleveland, but now I am glad to hail the arrival of the new Browns, \neven though it was at great cost to the taxpayers, and deprived the \nEagles of a well-earned first overall draft pick.\n  The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned in \nrecent years. Jeffrey Lurie bought the Philadelphia Eagles in 1995 for \na then-high price of $185 million. Last year, the successful bidder for \nan expansion NFL franchise in Cleveland paid $530 million. The bidding \nfor the Washington Redskins franchise (including Cooke Stadium) has \nsurpassed $800 million. There also seems to be no limit to the amount \nof money available to club owners when it comes to paying players--\nwitness Mike Piazza's signing last year of a $91 million ten-year \ncontract with the New York Mets.\n  New ballparks and stadiums clearly provide an enhancement to the \nculture and tax base of communities. That said, however, there is also \nno doubt that having a new ballpark or stadium significantly increases \nthe value of a sports franchise for its owner. In December, 1998, \nForbes Magazine estimated the net worth of the nation's professional \nsports teams. Seven of the top ten valued baseball franchises and eight \nof the top ten valued football franchises were in cities with ballparks \nand stadiums built or approved to be built since 1990.\n  In January, 1999, the Philadelphia Inquirer quoted Jeffrey Stein, \nmanaging director of McDonald Investments, a Cleveland brokerage house, \nwho said: ``New stadiums, in and of themselves, significantly enhance \nthe value of a team.'' He cited the Cleveland Indians Baseball Club as \nan example. In the December, 1998, Forbes article, the value of that \nteam, which now plays in beautiful new Jacobs Field, was listed as $322 \nmillion, the third highest in baseball. In 1986, the Indians had been \npurchased for $35 million. In 1993, the last year the Indians played at \nCleveland Stadium, the team had revenues of $54.1 million. Its 1997 \nrevenues were $140 million.\n\n  The value of these sports franchises to a community is reflected in \nthe astronomical broadcast rights fees the sports leagues command in \nthe U.S. marketplace. Ten years ago, the National Football League \nreceived $970 million a year for its network television rights. The NFL \nnow receives three times that amount, through contracts with TV and \ncable networks that pay the League $17.6 billion for its TV rights over \nan 8-year period commencing with the 1998 season, an average of $2.2 \nbillion per year, while Major\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nLeague Baseball annually derives more than $400 million from this \nsource. These revenues are shared by the clubs and their players.\n  One would think some of that giant revenue windfall might trickle \ndown and be used to help finance new ballparks and stadiums, which \nproduce greatly enhanced revenues for team owners, yet it seems the \nmore TV money a league makes, the more its clubs demand from local \ntaxpayers to fund the construction of new playing facilities. The irony \nof this is that none of these huge TV revenues would accrue to the \nclubs and their players if the leagues did not have the benefit of an \nantitrust exemption permitting clubs to pool their TV rights.\n  In the interest of fairness, I believe the leagues should, with a \nsmall portion of these TV revenues, assist local communities in the \nfinancing of new playing facilities for the leagues' clubs, as a \ncondition of their continuing to receive the antitrust exemption which \npermits pooling of TV rights.\n  I also believe the leagues should have an antitrust exemption which \npermits them to deny a club's request to move, thus minimizing the \nimplied threat to move which has characteristically accompanied demands \nupon local government for a new ballpark or stadium.\n  Both these objectives are met by the legislation I am offering today. \nIt will clarify the broadcast antitrust exemption given to sports \nleagues and give the National Football League and Major League Baseball \nan opportunity to continue to receive it by agreeing to place 10% of \ntheir network TV revenues into a trust fund to be used to help finance \nconstruction or renovation of ballparks and stadiums for use by their \nteams. Trust fund revenues will be restricted to such use and will be \nexcluded from the league's gross receipts which are distributed to \nclubs and players.\n  Money from the trust fund will be provided to finance up to one-half \nthe cost of construction or renovation of ballparks and stadiums on a \nmatching fund basis, conditioned upon the local government's agreement \nto provide at least one dollar of financing for every two dollars to be \nprovided from the trust fund.\n  Thus, for example, if the cost of constructing a new stadium for the \nPhiladelphia Eagles, or for the Pittsburgh Steelers, were $280 million, \nthe National Football League would be obliged to provide $140 million \nto each such project, on condition that the city and state, combined, \nprovided at least $70 million. Ideally, the League would pay one-half \nthe cost out of the trust fund and the other half would be financed by \nthe club owner and the local government.\n  The legislation will also enlarge the antitrust exemption given to \nbaseball, basketball, football, and hockey leagues to permit those \nleagues to deny a member club's request to move its franchise to a \ndifferent city.\n  My bill will take effect on the date of its passage, and will apply \nto all network TV revenues thereafter received by the leagues, and to \nall new ballpark and stadium facilities not yet constructed, such as \nthe construction now underway in Cleveland and Pittsburgh.\n  I have sought recognition today to introduce the Stadium Financing \nand Franchise Relocation Act of 1999. This legislation would require \nthat the National Football League and Major League Baseball act to \nprovide financing for 50 percent of new stadium construction costs, and \nthat the National Football League be given a limited antitrust \nexemption to regulate franchise moves.\n  This legislation is necessary because baseball and football have for \ntoo long had a public-be-damned attitude. At the present time, major \nleague sports is out of control on franchise moves for football teams \nand the demands upon cities and states for exorbitant construction \ncosts is a form of legalized extortion in major league sports.\n  The National Football League has a multi-year television contract for \n$17.6 billion which it enjoys by virtue of a special status and \nantitrust exemption which they have for revenue sharing or else they \ncould not collect television receipts of $17 billion. But, at the same \ntime, when they are asked to step forward and help with stadium \nconstruction costs, which are minimal compared to their television \nreceipts, they put one community in competition with another community. \nA franchise, being what it is, leaves a city like Hartford and a state \nlike Connecticut to offer $375 million to lure the Patriots from \nMassachusetts to Connecticut.\n  This is a problem which is particularly acute for my State, \nPennsylvania, which is now looking at the construction of four new \nstadiums. Two are now under construction in western Pennsylvania--\nPittsburgh for the Pirates and the Steelers--and two more are being \nsought in eastern Pennsylvania for the Phillies and for the Eagles. It \nis a $1 billion price tag which we are looking at now, which is \nsignificant for public funding, especially in a context where our \nschools are under funded, where our housing is in need of assistance, \nwhere we need funds for child assistance, where we need funds for \ntransition from welfare to work, where we need funds for highways, and \nfor so many other important matters. But, understandably, a NFL \nfranchise is a very major matter for the prestige of a city and also \nfor the economy of a city. And a major league baseball franchise, \nsimilarly, is a major matter for the economy and the prestige of a \ncity.\n  You have a situation, for example, where the Colts left Baltimore in \nthe middle of the night for Indianapolis. Then there was a bidding war \nfor the Browns, which left Cleveland to go to Baltimore at an enormous \ncost to the taxpayers of Maryland and Baltimore. Indianapolis ought to \nhave a football team, but they ought not to have Baltimore's football \nteam. Similarly, Cleveland ought to be able to retain the Browns. It \nhas been a matter of great pride for Cleveland for many, many years.\n  The start occurred in 1958 when the Dodgers left Brooklyn to go to \nLos Angeles. Brooklyn had no more precious possession than ``Dem \nBums,'' the Dodgers. And I recall as a youngster the 1941 World Series, \nMickey Owens' famous fumble, dropping of the third strike, and the \ntremendous tradition that the Dodgers had with Jackie Robinson and Pee \nWee Reese in the Pennant races. And off they went to Los Angeles. Los \nAngeles should have had a baseball team, but not Brooklyn's baseball \nteam. And they had a twofer, they took the Giants out of New York and \nput them in San Francisco at the same time.\n  Baseball has had an opportunity, to some extent, to control franchise \nmoves because baseball has an unlimited antitrust exemption. And they \nhave it in a very curious, illogical way. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes \nruled in the 1920s that baseball was a sport and not involved in \ninterstate commerce and therefore exempt. That has been an item which \nhas been out of touch with reality for a long time. Justice Blackmun \nsaid baseball was a big business, in a Supreme Court decision, and \ninvolved in interstate commerce. But since it had been unregulated with \nthe antitrust exemption for so long, it has been left to Congress to \nmake a change.\n  It may be that we ought to make a change and take away the antitrust \nexemption from baseball generally. Baseball fiercely resists any \ncontribution to stadium construction costs--fiercely resists with a \nlobbying campaign, which is now underway, of great intensity. I will \nnot list the cosponsors who have prospectively dropped off this bill \nbecause of that lobbying.\n  I am introducing this bill on behalf of Senator Hatch, chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Biden, former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and myself. We had a hearing in the Antitrust \nSubcommittee of Judiciary where I serve, and I asked the head of the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Chairman of the \nFederal Trade Commission to take a look at revoking baseball's \nantitrust exemption totally. Baseball has not been responsible in \ndealing with salary caps and with revenue sharing. So there would be \nsome equality and some parity for cities like Pittsburgh, small cities, \nwhere you have the financial power of the New York Yankees dominating \nthe league, buying up all the players; where you have Mr. Murdoch \nacquiring the Dodgers for a giant price in connection with his \nsatellite ideas and with television revenues and the superstation which \nAtlanta now has.\n  Here you have a goose which is laying a golden egg and baseball has \nnot\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nfaced up to fairness in changing its approach to dealing with the \nrealities of the market and has not undertaken the salary caps and the \nrevenue sharing necessary to stabilize baseball.\n\n  So this bill goes, to a limited extent, on conditioning baseball's \ncontinuation of its antitrust exemption to helping with stadium \nconstruction costs. I want them to help build a stadium for the \nPhiladelphia Phillies. I want them to help on the construction costs \nfor the Pittsburgh Pirates. I went them to help on construction costs \nfor new teams, where cities are facing the reality of either spending \nhundreds of millions of dollars for these new stadiums, or having the \nteams flee to other cities. That is something baseball ought to face up \nto, even though it is true that baseball has a different situation from \nfootball, because baseball's television revenues are lesser. But there \nhas to be some equality and there has to be some parity. Or if baseball \nwants to function like any other business, let them do so, but without \nthe antitrust exemption, and let's see what will happen to those giant \nsalaries for the baseball players and those tremendous rates and the \nway baseball operates, if it does not have an antitrust exemption which \nis very special and unique.\n  Football has an antitrust exemption as to revenue sharing. Without \nthat exemption they could not have the $17 billion multi-year \ntelevision contract. They have plenty of funds to face up to stadium \nconstruction costs for the Pittsburgh Steelers and for the Philadelphia \nEagles and for other teams. The facts are not yet before the public, \nbut I hear the rumors that football is putting up a very substantial \nsum to have the Patriots remain in Massachusetts to top the bid of \nConnecticut. Connecticut is a television market, according to the \nmedia, about 24th. Boston, MA, is a media market about 6th. And the \nNational Football League wants to protect its media market so they will \nput up a substantial sum of money to accomplish that.\n  It ought to be regularized and they ought to have a specific \nobligation. And 50 percent is not too much for the leagues to \ncontribute. That would leave the owners with 25 percent and would still \nleave the public with 25 percent. One of the prospective cosponsors \ndropped off the bill because he does not want to be associated with \neven 25 percent for the public. But I suggest when the raiders--I am \nnot talking about the Oakland Raiders; I am talking about the sports \nfranchise raiders coming to his State, which I shall not name--go after \nhis baseball team and go after his football team, watch the scurrying \naround to pay a lot more than 25 percent unless there is some \nleveraging and some compulsion.\n  Baseball and football are not going to face up to a fair allocation \nof funds if they are left to their own devices. But the Congress of the \nUnited States does have control of the antitrust exemption and we can \ntake it away from baseball or we can limit it for baseball. And we can \ntake away, if we choose, the football antitrust exemption on revenue \nsharing. So I do believe this is a matter which is of significant \npublic interest. When a city like Hartford and a State like Connecticut \nbids $375 million of funds which could obviously be used better; where \nPennsylvania is looking at more than $1 billion in four new stadiums at \na time when $17 billion comes to the NFL, and the salaries are \nastronomical. If the leagues are to have this exemption, if they are to \nhave this special break, they ought to face up to some public \nresponsibility.\n  The second part of this legislation would grant football a limited \nantitrust exemption so they could regulate franchise moves. When the \nRaiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles, there was a multimillion-\ndollar lawsuit which the NFL had to pay. So they are reluctant to take \na stand on exercising their league rules which require three-fourths \napproval. But, if they had an antitrust exemption to this limited \nextent, then they would be in a position to ameliorate the larceny. \nMaybe it would be petit larceny instead of grand larceny. But I think \nthat kind of antitrust exemption would be worthwhile.\n  As you can tell, I feel very strongly about this subject. I have been \na sports fan since I was 8 years old--perhaps 5 years old when my \nfamily, living in Wichita, KS, made a trip to Chicago for the World's \nFair and I became a Cubs fan. And I became a Phillies fan when I moved \nto Philadelphia more than a half century ago. And I am a Pirates fan, \ntoo, except when they are playing the Phillies.\n  If you lived in Wichita, KS, when the morning paper came, the major \nitem of interest would be the sports page and the box scores. And I am \nan Eagles fan and a Steelers fan and held season tickets as early as \n1958. When the Dodgers and Giants moved away from Brooklyn and New York \nCity, I thought that was really a very serious breach. Such moves have \na great impact on the public, and we ought to stop this legalized \nextortion, and we ought to get a fair share for the tremendous \nantitrust break which baseball and football enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 954. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \ncitizens' rights under the second amendment to obtain firearms for \nlegal use, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               Second Amendment Preservation Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nthe Second Amendment Preservation Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, my bill is intended to address the lawsuits that have \nbeen filed by various municipal governments against firearms \nmanufacturers. These lawsuits are premised on the novel theory that \nmanufacturers in full compliance with all of the laws governing the \nproduction of their products can nevertheless be held liable for the \ncriminal misuse of those products by individuals who are completely \nbeyond their control. This radical notion is flatly contrary to the \nprinciple of individual responsibility on which the tort laws of our \nNation are based.\n  In at least some cases, Mr. President, these lawsuits seem to be \nintended to subject firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers to \nlegal costs that are so onerous that they may not be able to defend \nthemselves, or indeed be able to remain in business. A majority of \nfirearms manufacturers, importers and dealers are small, privately-\nowned businesses that cannot afford to bear the legal costs of \ndefending themselves in a large number of judicial forums. Moreover, \ncompared to most firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers, States \nand local governments are large and relatively wealthy entities that \nare able to spend large amounts of taxpayers' dollars on wars of \nattrition against small business.\n  Mr. President, these lawsuits represent an effort by social activists \nand trial lawyers to use the Nation's judiciary to secure victories \nagainst the firearms industry that they never would be able to achieve \nthrough the legislative process. In fact, the firearms industry won't \nbe the last target of these lawsuits. In a January 31, 1999, article in \nthe Washington Post, plaintiffs' attorney John Coale stated ``. . . we \nare interested in taking a close look at the exorbitant prices of \nprescription drugs for the elderly, for example.'' ``Unless the courts \nreject our approach,'' Coale continued, ``we will continue to utilize \nit to tackle industry bullies.''\n  Thankfully, Mr. President, the public is not fooled. A December, \n1998, survey of 1,008 U.S. adults by DecisionQuest, a jury consulting \nfirm, found that 66.2% of American adults oppose these lawsuits against \nfirearms manufacturers. Only 19.3% of Americans believe that these \nsuits are justified.\n  Even some anti-gun elements of the media oppose these lawsuits. A \nMarch 1, 1999, editorial in the Boston Globe stated that ``. . . guns \nshould be controlled by the legislative process rather than through \nlitigation.'' ``gun makers may be responsible for flaws in their \nproducts that lead to injury or death,'' the editorial continued. \n``Making manufacturers liable for the actions of others,'' the \neditorial concluded, ``. . . stretches the boundaries beyond reasonable \nlimits . . . .''\n  Mr. President, I believe that fairness requires that a unit of \ngovernment that undertakes an unsuccessful ``fishing expedition'' \nagainst a firearms manufacturer, importer or dealer should bear the \ncosts of that business in defending itself against such an frivolous \nand unwarranted civil action. Fairness also requires that taxpayers not \nbe required to pay millions of dollars to wealthy attorneys, out of\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nawards that are intended, at least in part, to benefit the victims of \ncrime.\n  The second amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nrequires that Congress must respond to actions that are intended to, \nand that would have the effect of, nullifying that provision of the \nBill of Rights. Congress has the power under the second amendment, and \nunder the Commerce Clause, to take appropriate action to protect the \nrights of citizens to obtain and own firearms.\n  Onr action that Congress may take, Mr. President, is to provide \nprotection from excessive and unwarranted legal fees. The Second \nAmendment Preservation Act, which I am introducing today, provides that \nprotection. My bill limits attorneys' fees to plaintiffs in civil \nlawsuits that seek ``to hold a firearms manufacturer, importer, or \ndealer liable for damages caused by the unlawful or tortuous use of a \nfirearm by a person not employed by or affiliated with the \nmanufacturer, dealer, or importer.'' Under my bill, those fees are \nlimited to the lesser of $150 per hour, plus expenses, or 10% of the \namount that the plaintiff is awarded in the action.\n  Further, my bill provides that in lawsuits in which the defendant is \nfound by the court to be ``not wholly or primarily liable for the \ndamages sought,'' the plaintiff must reimburse the defendant for \nreasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill provides that if a court strikes down \nthis legislation as unconstitutional, the decision is directly \nappealable as of right to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, the \nSecond Amendment Preservation Act, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 954\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Second Amendment \n     Preservation Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a number of State and local governments have commenced \n     civil actions, or are considering commencing civil actions, \n     against manufacturers, importers, and dealers of firearms \n     based on the unlawful use of the firearms by a purchaser or \n     other person;\n       (2) in at least some cases, the intent in bringing the \n     action is to subject manufacturers, importers, and dealers to \n     legal costs that are so onerous that the manufacturers, \n     importers, and dealers may not be able defend themselves, or \n     indeed be able to remain in business;\n       (3) a majority of manufacturers, importers, and dealers of \n     firearms are small, privately owned businesses that cannot \n     afford to bear the legal costs of defending themselves in a \n     large number of judicial forums;\n       (4) compared to most manufacturers, importers, and dealers \n     of firearms, States and local governments are large and \n     relatively wealthy entities that are able to spend large \n     amounts of taxpayers' dollars on a war of attrition with \n     small businesses;\n       (5) fairness requires that--\n       (A) a unit of government that undertakes an unsuccessful \n     ``fishing expedition'' against a firearm manufacturer, \n     importer, or dealer bear the cost of defending against its \n     frivolous and unwarranted civil action; and\n       (B) taxpayers not be required to pay millions of dollars to \n     wealthy attorneys, out of awards that are intended, at least \n     in part, to benefit the victims of crime;\n       (6) the Second Amendment to the Constitution requires that \n     Congress respond to actions that are intended to, and that \n     would have the effect of, nullifying that provision of the \n     Bill of Rights;\n       (7) Congress has power under the Second Amendment and under \n     the Commerce Clause to take appropriate action to protect the \n     right of citizens to obtain and own firearms; and\n       (8) one appropriate action that Congress may take is to \n     provide protection from excessive and unwarranted legal fees.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to allow the National Park Service to acquire certain \nland for addition to the Wilderness Battlefield in Virginia, as \npreviously authorized by law, by purchase or exchange as well as by \ndonation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       longstreet's flank attack\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will preserve a site of great historical importance. The legacy \nof Civil War battlefields must be perpetuated, not only to commemorate \nthose who lost their lives in this tragic epoch, but also to consecrate \nland upon which some our country's finest strategic maneuvers occurred. \nOn the hallowed land of Wilderness, Virginia occurred one of the \ngreatest tactical stratagems in military history. Snatching the \ninitiative to turn the tide of battle, Lt. General James A. Longstreet, \nunder the command of General Robert E. Lee, forced back Union forces \ndirected by General Ulysses S. Grant, in an advance known as \n``Longstreet's Flank Attack''.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will allow the Park Service to \nacquire this stretch of land, which will serve to ``complete'' \nWilderness Battlefield. The legacy of the Civil War is far-reaching. A \nwar which wrought such destruction has been the source of much \nfascination for scholars and amateur historians. The Battle of \nWilderness is legendary for the tactical skills employed and the \ncaliber of the soldiers who fought. There, among the tangled forests \nand twisted undergrowth, the Union Army, numerically superior and well \nsupplied, were forced into confrontation with General Lee's hard \nscrabble Confederate troops. It would be one of the last battles in \nwhich Lee's incomparable martial machine would force Grant's Army of \nthe Potomac to withdraw. It is also the site of the wounding of Gen. \nLongstreet, who, like General Stonewall Jackson, was wounded by \nfriendly fire. Though Longstreet's injury was not mortal, the genius of \nthe cadre of officers under the command of Lee dwindled. Thus would \nbegin the twilight of the Confederacy.\n  Legislation passed in the 102nd Congress would have allowed the Park\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\nService to acquire this land by donation. Despite numerous efforts, the \nPark Service has been unable to accomplish this. The legislation at \nhand would amend Public Law 102-541 to allow the Park Service to \nprocure the land by purchase or exchange as well as donation. The \nheritage and history which dwell amongst the interlaced undergrowth of \nthis land deserve our recognition. I look forward to the swift passage \nof this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 955\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish programs regarding early detection, \ndiagnosis, and interventions for newborns and infants with hearing \nloss; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n   newborn and infant hearing screening and intervention act of 1999\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nNewborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 1999. This \nbill is a companion bill to H.R. 1193, introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Jim Walsh. I am pleased to be joined again this year by \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has long been a champion of \nthe hearing impaired, and my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist.\n  We usually associate hearing problems with the aging process, and it \nis true that the largest group of Americans suffering from hearing \nimpairment are those in the 65 to 75 year age range. But at the same \ntime, approximately 1.5 to 3 out of every 1000 children--or as many as \n33 children per day--are born with significant hearing problems. \nAccording to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nDisorders, as many as 12,000 infants are born each year in the United \nStates with some form of hearing impairment.\n  In recent years, scientists have stressed that the first years of a \nchild's life are crucial to their future development. This makes early \ndetection and intervention of hearing loss a necessity if we are to \nensure that all our children get the strong start they deserve. \nSpecialists in speech and language development believe that the crucial \nperiod of speech and communication in a child's life can begin as early \nas six months of age. Unfortunately, though the average age of \ndiagnosis of hearing loss is close to three years of age.\n  The ability to hear is a major element of one's ability to read and \ncommunicate. To the extent that we can help infants and young children \novercome disabilities detected early in life, we will improve their \nability to function in society, receive an education, obtain meaningful \nemployment, and enjoy a better quality of life. Without early diagnosis \nand intervention, these children are behind the learning curve--\nliterally--before they have even started. They should not be denied a \nstrong start in life simply for the lack of a simple screening test.\n  There are many causes of hearing loss, and in many states a newborn \nchild is screened only if the physician is aware of some factor that \nputs that baby in a risk category. The good news is that over 550 \nhospitals in 46 states operate universal newborn hearing screening \nprograms. Nine states--Hawaii, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Connecticut, \nColorado, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Massachusetts--have passed \nlegislation requiring universal newborn hearing screening. Hawaii, \nMississippi, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming have statewide early \nhearing detection and intervention programs. And scientists across the \ncountry are developing and implementing model rural-based infant \nhearing, screening, follow-up, and intervention programs for children \nat risk for hearing and language disabilities.\n  The bad news is that, unfortunately, only about 20 percent of the \nbabies in this country are born in hospitals with universal newborn \nhearing screening programs, and more than 85 percent of all hospitals \ndo not do a hearing screening before sending the baby home.\n  Universal screening is not a new idea. As early as 1965, the Advisory \nCommittee on Education of the Deaf, in a report of the Secretary of \nHealth, Education and Welfare, recommended the development and \nnationwide implementation of ``universally applied procedures for early \nidentification.'' In 1989, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop used \nthe year 2000 as a goal for identifying 90 percent of children with \nsignificant hearing loss before they are one year old.\n  In 1997, an expert panel at the National Institute of Deafness and \nOther Communication Disorders recommended that the first hearing \nscreening be carried out before an infant is three months old in order \nto ensure that treatment can begin before six months of age. The Panel \nalso recommended that the most comprehensive and effective way of \nensuring screening before an infant is six months old is to have \nnewborns screened before they sent home from the hospital. But a 1998 \nreport by the Commission on Education of the Deaf estimated that the \naverage age at which a child with congenital hearing loss was \nidentified in the United States was a 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years old, with many \nchildren not being identified until five or six years old.\n  It is time to move beyond the recommendations and achieve the goal of \nuniversal screening. In addition to the nine states that require \nscreening, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, in conjunction with \nthe Centers for Disease Control, is helping 17 states commit to \nachieving universal hearing screening by the year 2000. This plan will \nlead to the screening of more than one million newborns a year, but it \nstill leaves more than half the states without universal screening \nprograms.\n  The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to provide the \nadditional assistance necessary to help all the states in implementing \nprograms to ensure that all our newborns are tested and to ensure that \nthose identified with a hearing impairment get help. Specifically, the \nbill:\n  (1) Authorizes $5 million in FY 2000 and $8 million in FY 2001 for \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with the states to \ndevelop early detection, diagnosis and intervention networks for the \npurpose of developing models to ensure testing and to collect data;\n  (2) Authorizes $5 million in FY 2000 and $7 million in FY 2001 for \nthe Centers for Disease Control to provide technical assistance to \nState agencies and to conduct applied research related to infant \nhearing detection, diagnosis and treatment/intervention; and\n  (3) Authorizes the National Institutes of Health to carry out \nresearch on the efficacy of new screening techniques and technology.\n  A baby born today will be part of this country's future in the 21st \ncentury. Surely we owe it to that child to give them a strong start on \nthat future by ensuring that if they do have a hearing impairment it is \ndiagnosed and treatment started well before their first year of life is \ncompleted. I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Harkin, and Senator \nFrist in supporting the Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and \nIntervention Act of 1999.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith my colleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Frist, the Newborn and \nInfant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 1999.\n  Tne Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act would \nhelp States establish programs to detect and diagnose hearing loss in \nevery\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\nnewborn child and to promote appropriate treatment and intervention for \nnewborns with hearing loss. The Act would fund research by the National \nInstitutes of Health to determine the best detection, diagnostic, \ntreatment and intervention techniques and technologies.\n  Every year, approximately 12,000 children in the United States are \nborn with a hearing impairment. Most of them will not be diagnosed as \nhearing-impaired until after their second birthday. The consequences of \nnot detecting early hearing impairment are significant, but easily \navoidable.\n  Late detection means that crucial years of stimulating the brain's \nhearing centers are lost. It may delay speech and language development. \nDelayed language development can retard a child's educational progress, \nminimize his or her socialization skills, and as a result, destroy his \nor her self-esteem and confidence. On top of all that, many children \nare diagnosed incorrectly as having behavioral or cognitive problems, \nsimply because of their undetected hearing loss.\n  In 1988, the Commission on Education of the Deaf reported to Congress \nthat early detection, diagnosis and treatment were essential to \nimproving the status of education for people who are deaf in the United \nStates. Based on that report and others, in 1991, when I was chair of \nthe Labor-HHS Subcommittee on Appropriations, we urged the National \nInstitute on Deafness and Other Communication Deisorders--NIDCD--to \ndetermine the most effective means of identifying hearing impairments \nin newborn infants. In 1993, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee supported \nNIDCD's efforts to sponsor a consensus development conference on early \nidentification of hearing impairment in infants and children. And in \n1998, the Subcommittee encouraged NIDCD to pursue research on \nintervention strategies for infants with hearing impairments, and \nencouraged HRSA to provide states with the results of the NIH study on \nthe most effective forms of screening infants for hearing loss.\n  Mr. President, the Act we are introducing today builds on these \nearlier efforts. The Act would help states develop programs that many \nof them already are working on; it would not impose a single federal \nmandate. At least eight states already have mandatory testing programs; \nmany others have legislation pending to establish such programs. Other \nstates have achieved universal newborn testing voluntarily. These \nprograms can work; they deserve federal help.\n  One of the highlights of my Congressional career, indeed, of my life, \nhas been working on policies and laws to ensure that people with \ndisabilities have an equal opportunity to succeed in our society. This \nis especially meaningful to me, because my brother Frank became deaf as \na child.\n  I watched Frank grow up, and I saw how few options and support \nservices were available for people who were deaf. I remember the \nfrustrations and challenges Frank faced, and I told myself early on \nthat I would do all I could to break down the barriers in our society \nthat prevented people who were deaf from reaching their potential. By \nsupporting early screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs, this act \nwould go a long way toward accomplishing that goal.\n  I would like to thank Senators Snowe and Frist for their hard work \nand support of this act, and I hope our colleagues will join us in this \nworthy effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 957. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   sunshine in litigation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Sunshine in \nLitigation Act of 1999, a measure that addresses the growing abuse of \nsecrecy orders issued by our Federal courts. All too often our Federal \ncourts allow vital information that is discovered in litigation--and \nwhich directly bears on public health and safety--to be covered up, to \nbe shielded from mothers, fathers and children whose lives are \npotentially at stake, and from the public officials we have asked to \nprotect our health and safety.\n  All this happens because of the use of so-called ``protective \norders''--really gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep \ninformation discovered in the course of litigation secret and \nundisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request \nto keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants \nthreaten that, without secrecy, they will fight every document \nrequested and will refuse to agree to a settlement. Victims cannot \nafford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations \nactually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, \ntypically they do not--because both sides have agreed, and judges have \nother matters to which they prefer to attend. So judges are regularly \nand frequently entering these protective orders, using the power of the \nFederal government to keep people in the dark about the dangers they \nface.\n  Perhaps the worst offenders are the tobacco companies. They have used \nprotective orders not only to keep incriminating documents away from \npublic view, but also to drive up litigation costs by preventing \ndocument sharing, effectively forcing every successive plaintiff to \n``reinvent the wheel.'' One tobacco industry official even boasted, \n``The aggressive posture we have taken regarding depositions and \ndiscovery in general continues to make these cases extremely burdensome \nand expensive for plaintiffs' lawyers, particularly sole practitioners. \nTo paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by \nspending all of our money, but by making the other S.O.B. spend all \nhis.''\n  This systematic abuse of secrecy orders is one of the reasons that it \ntook more than four decades of tobacco litigation to achieve a \nreasonable settlement. In fact, Congress and the public's shift in \nrecent years against Big Tobacco resulted in large part from disclosure \nof materials that had been concealed under secrecy orders, including \nmaterials regarding youth targeting and nicotine manipulation.\n  The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public \nhealth and safety has been apparent for years. The Judiciary Committee \nfirst held hearings on this issue in 1990 and again in 1994. In 1990, \nArthur Bryant, the executive director of Trial Lawyers for Public \nJustice, told us, ``The one thing we learned . . . is that this problem \nis far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the length and \ndepth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of civil \nlitigation in this country is taking place in secret.''\n  Four years later, attorney Gerry Spence told us about 19 cases in \nwhich he had been involved where his clients had been required to sign \nsecrecy agreements. They included cases involving defects in a hormonal \npregnancy test that caused severe birth defects, a defective braking \nsystem on a steamroller, and an improperly manufactured tire rim.\n  But that's not surprising, because individual examples of this \nproblem abound. For over a decade, Miracle Recreation, a U.S. \nplayground equipment company, marketed a merry-go-round that caused \nserious injury to scores of small children--including severed fingers \nand feet. Lawsuits brought against the manufacturer were confidentially \nsettled, preventing the public and the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission from learning about the hazard. It took more than a decade \nfor regulators to discover the danger and for the company to recall the \nmerry-go-round.\n\n  There are yet more cases like these. In 1973, GM allegedly began \nmarketing vehicles with dangerously placed fuel tanks that tended to \nrupture, burn, and explode on impact more frequently than regular \ntanks. Soon after these vehicles hit the American road, tragic \naccidents began occurring, and lawsuits were filed. More than 150 \nlawsuits were settled confidentially by GM. For years this secrecy \nprevented the public from learning of the alleged dangers presented by \nthese vehicles--millions of which are still on the road. It wasn't \nuntil a 1993 trail that the public learned about sidesaddle gas tanks \nand some GM crash test data that demonstrated these dangers.\n  The thrust of our legislation is straightforward. In cases affecting \npublic health and safety, Federal courts would be required to apply a \nbalancing test: they could permit secrecy only if\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nthe need for privacy outweighs the public need to know about potential \nhealth or safety hazards. Moreover, all courts--both Federal and \nstate--would be prohibited from issuing protective orders that prevent \ndisclosure to regulatory agencies. In this way, our bill will bring \ncrucial information out of the darkness and into the light.\n  Although this law may result in some small additional burden on \njudges, a little extra work seems a tiny price to pay to protect \nblameless people from danger. Every day, in the course of litigation, \njudges make tough calls about how to construe the public interest and \ninterpret other laws that Congress passes. I am confident that the \ncourts will administer this law fairly and sensibly. If this requires \nextra work, then that work is well worth the effort. After all, no one \nargues that spoiled meat should be allowed on the market because \nstricter regulations mean more work for FDA meat inspectors.\n  Having said all this, we must in fairness recognize that there is \nanother side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished possession, and \nbusiness information is a cherished commodity. For this reason, the \ncourts must, in some cases, keep trade secrets and other business \ninformation confidential.\n  But, in my opinion, today's balance of these interests is entirely \ninadequate. Our legislation will ensure that courts do not carelessly \nand automatically sanction secrecy when the health and safety of the \nAmerican public are at stake. At the same time, this bill will allow \ndefendants to obtain secrecy orders when the need for privacy is \nsignificant and substantial.\n  Indeed, this proposal would simply codify the practices of the most \nthoughtful Federal judges. As Justice Breyer has said, ``no court can \nor should stand silent when they see an immediate, serious risk to . . \n. health or safety.'' Virtually identical legislation received 49 votes \non the floor in 1994 and was passed with bipartisan support out of the \nJudiciary Committee in 1996.\n  Who knows what other hazards are hidden behind courthouse doors?

A bill to amend certain banking and securities laws with \nrespect to financial contracts; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n       financial institutions insolvency improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Financial \nInstitutions Insolvency Improvement Act of 1999. Recognizing that the \nchanges to our Nations' banking laws have not kept pace with changes in \nour capital markets, this bill would strengthen the laws that enforce \nand protect certain financial agreements and transactions in the event \nthat one of the parties involved becomes insolvent. This legislation \nwould also harmonize the treatment of financial instruments under the \nbankruptcy code and the banking insolvency laws.\n  The legislation that I am introducing is based largely on the \nrecommendations made in March of 1998 by the President's Working Group \non Financial Markets. This same working group reiterated on April 29th \nof this year, in their report on hedge fund activity, that Congress \nshould pass this legislation. However, in an effort to keep this \nlegislation free and separate from the ongoing bankruptcy debate, I am \nonly introducing those portions of the proposal which amend banking \nlaw. I will be chairing a hearing on this legislation on the Financial \nInstitutions Subcommittee tomorrow morning.\n  Since the adoption of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, Congress has \nrecognized that certain financial market transactions qualify for \ndifferent treatment in the event that one of the parties becomes \ninsolvent. Specifically, many financial instruments are exempted from \nthe automatic stay that is imposed on general commercial contracts \nduring a bankruptcy proceeding. This is largely due to the fact that \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), by law, becomes a \ntrustee during any bankruptcy proceeding.\n  Mr. President, the ability to terminate, or close out and ``net'' \nfinancial products is an essential and vital part of our capital \nmarkets. Congress has recognized that participants in swap transactions \nshould have the ability to terminate and ``net'' their swap agreements. \nSimply put, netting means that money payments or other obligations owed \nbetween parties with multiple contracts can be offset against each \nother, and one net amount can be paid by one party to the other in \nsettlement. Cross-product netting means that parties can net out \ndifferent kinds of financial contracts, such as swap agreements being \noffset with repurchase agreements. By eliminating the need for large \nfund transfers for each transaction in favor of a smaller net payment, \nnetting allows parties to enter into multiple-transaction relationships \nwith reduced credit and liquidity exposures to a counterparty's \ninsolvency.\n  Many parties involved in financial transactions have entered into \nthem for hedging purposes. My legislation encourages this type of \nbehavior by clarifying that cross-product close-out netting should be \npermitted for positions in securities contracts, commodity contracts, \nforward contracts, repurchase agreements and swaps.\n  For example, in certain cases, the protections for financial \ncontracts in the bank insolvency laws have not kept pace with market \nevolution. Assume, for example, that Party A and Party B have two \noutstanding equity swaps in which the payments are calculated on the \nbasis of an equity securities index. If Party A enter insolvency, it is \nnot entirely clear whether Party B's contractual rights to close-out \nand net\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\nwould be protected by the current ``swap agreement'' definition in the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act. If both of the parties are ``financial \ninstitutions'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nImprovement Act or the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation EE and the \nswap agreements are ``netting contracts,'' then Party B might (although \nit is not entirely clear) be able to exercise its close-out, netting \nand foreclosure rights.\n  However, if one of the parties is not a ``financial institution'' or \nthe contract does not constitute a ``netting contract'' (for example, \nbecause it is governed by the laws of the United Kingdom), then Party B \ncould be subject, among other things, to the risk of ``cherry-\npicking''--the risk that Party A's receiver would assume responsibility \nonly for the swap that currently favors Party A, leaving Party B with a \npotentially sizable claim against Party A (which would be undersecured \nbecause of the impairment of netting) and the risk that its foreclosure \non any collateral would be blocked indefinitely. This could impair \nParty B's creditworthiness, which in turn could lead to its default to \nits counterparties. It is this sort of ``chain reaction'' that can \nexacerbate systemic risk in the financial markets.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is important to recognize that the \nframework for the bill I am introducing was contained in S. 1301, the \nbankruptcy bill introduced by Senator Grassley last year which passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 97-1.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nhonoring the academic achievements and excellence of Lincoln Park High \nSchool in Chicago, Illinois, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary \nthis year.\n  Educating America's youth is a difficult and often overlooked task. \nFor the students of today to become the leaders of tommorrow, education \nis critical. It is the foundation on which a student builds his or her \nfuture. With our ever changing world, education is the key that unlocks \nthe door of opportunity. Therefore, it is an honor to acknowledge this \ninstitution for its great service over the last century.\n  Since 1899, Lincoln Park High School has been an educational leader \nin Chicago, maintaining a standard of excellence that should be looked \nupon as a model. Furthermore, Lincoln Park High School has been \nconsistently among the top public high schools in test scores and other \nmeasures of achievement, and has been racially integrated throughout \nits history.\n  I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Peter Fitzgerald, in presenting this resolution recognizing \nLincoln Park High School as a model for educational institutions \nthroughout the United States.\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, It is my pleasure to recognize \nan outstanding public high school in my home state of illinois. I, \nalong with Senator Dick Durbin, want to congratulate Lincoln Park High \nSchool, a public high school in Chicago, Illinois, on its 100th \nanniversary this year.\n  Throughout its history, Lincoln Park High School has been a model for \nother public schools in its single minded pursuit of excellence. I'd \nlike to share with you some of the history of this terrific school. \nLincoln Park is the oldest continually-used public high school in the \nChicago Public School system. Since its opening in 1899, more than \n100,000 students have passed through the doors of Lincoln Park High and \nbenefitted from the classes and extracurricular activities offered. \nAdditionally, Lincoln Park High has created an atmosphere of academic \nexcellence and produced many Illinois State Scholars and National Merit \nScholars. It is ranked consistently among the top high schools in test \nscores and other measures of academic achievement. The school's strive \nto excel is readily apparent with the establishment of rigorous \nacademic programs such as the ``Access to Excellence'' magnet program \nand the International Baccalaureate Program, a program available only \nin selected schools. The outstanding academic success of Lincoln Park \nHigh School prompted President Ronald Reagan to praise the school \npublicly in 1984.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this resolution with my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, and congratulate the faculty, staff and \nstudents who attend Lincoln Park High School on their 100th \nanniversary.

The success \nof the Platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War Two unto the present.\n  The 82d Airborne Division was the first airborne division to be \norganized. In a two-year period during World War Two, the regiments of \nthe 82d served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy, where I landed \nwith them, and at the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Other units were subsequently organized, including the 101st \nAirborne, and since their formation airborne forces have defended \nAmerican interests all over the world. They have seen action\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nin the Caribbean, Asia, Panama, and in the Persian Gulf. Airborne units \nhave earned over 65 Congressional Medals of Honor, our Nation's highest \nmilitary honor.\n  These brave soldiers have served our Nation for over sixty years with \ndistinction. This resolution recognize the airborne's past and present \ncommitment to our country. It is only fitting that we honor them.\n  I urge you to join with me in sponsoring ``National Airborne Day'' to \nexpress our support for the members of the airborne community and also \nour gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and \nideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4682-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4682-S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DASCHLE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 302\n\n  Mr. SARBANES (for Mr. Daschle, for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Edwards) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 900) to enhance competition in \nthe financial services industry by providing a prudenital framework for \nthe affiliation of banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and \nother financial service providers, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

In particular, Congress believes \n     that the Board and the State insurance regulators should \n     share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the \n     supervision of companies that control both a depository \n     institution and a company engaged in insurance activities, \n     including information regarding the financial health of the \n     consolidated organization and information regarding \n     transactions and relationships between insurance companies \n     and affiliated depository institutions.

The Board may provide any \n     other information to the appropriate State insurance \n     regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate \n     to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and \n     enforce applicable State insurance laws.\n       (2) Banking agency information.--Upon the request of the \n     appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate \n     Federal banking agency may provide any information of the \n     agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a \n     depository institution supervised by such Federal banking \n     agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in \n     insurance activities regulated by such State insurance \n     regulator.

or\n       (2) have enacted reciprocity laws and regulations governing \n     the licensure of nonresident individuals and entities \n     authorized to sell and solicit insurance within those States.\n       (b) Uniformity Required.--States shall be deemed to have \n     established the uniformity necessary to satisfy subsection \n     (a)(1) if the States--\n       (1) establish uniform criteria regarding the integrity, \n     personal qualifications, education, training, and experience \n     of licensed insurance producers, including the qualification \n     and training of sales personnel in ascertaining the \n     appropriateness of a particular insurance product for a \n     prospective customer;\n       (2) establish uniform continuing education requirements for \n     licensed insurance producers;\n       (3) establish uniform ethics course requirements for \n     licensed insurance producers in conjunction with the \n     continuing education requirements under paragraph (2);\n       (4) establish uniform criteria to ensure that an insurance \n     product, including any annuity contract, sold to a consumer \n     is suitable and appropriate for the consumer based on \n     financial information disclosed by the consumer; and\n       (5) do not impose any requirement upon any insurance \n     producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business \n     as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or \n     conditioning that producer's activities because of its \n     residence or place of operations, except that counter-\n     signature requirements imposed on nonresident producers shall \n     not be deemed to have the effect of limiting or conditioning \n     a producer's activities because of its residence or place of \n     operations under this section.\n       (c) Reciprocity Required.--States shall be deemed to have \n     established the reciprocity required to satisfy subsection \n     (a)(2) if the following conditions are met:\n       (1) Administrative licensing procedures.--At least a \n     majority of the States permit a producer that has a resident \n     license for selling or soliciting the purchase of insurance \n     in its home State to receive a license to sell or solicit the \n     purchase of insurance in such majority of States as a \n     nonresident to the same extent that such producer is \n     permitted to sell or solicit the purchase of insurance in its \n     State, if the producer's home State also awards such licenses \n     on such a reciprocal basis, without satisfying any additional \n     requirements other than submitting--\n       (A) a request for licensure;\n       (B) the application for licensure that the producer \n     submitted to its home State;\n       (C) proof that the producer is licensed and in good \n     standing in its home State; and\n       (D) the payment of any requisite fee to the appropriate \n     authority.\n       (2) Continuing education requirements.--A majority of the \n     States accept an insurance producer's satisfaction of its \n     home State's continuing education requirements for licensed \n     insurance producers to satisfy the States' own continuing \n     education requirements if the producer's home State also \n     recognizes the satisfaction of continuing education \n     requirements on such a reciprocal basis.\n       (3) No limiting nonresident requirements.--A majority of \n     the States do not impose any requirement upon any insurance \n     producer to be licensed or otherwise qualified to do business \n     as a nonresident that has the effect of limiting or \n     conditioning that producer's activities because of its \n     residence or place of operations, except that \n     countersignature requirements imposed on nonresident \n     producers shall not be deemed to have the effect of limiting \n     or conditioning a producer's activities because of its \n     residence or place of operations under this section.\n       (4) Reciprocal reciprocity.--Each of the States that \n     satisfies paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) grants reciprocity to \n     residents of all of the other States that satisfy such \n     paragraphs.\n       (d) Determination.--\n       (1) NAIC determination.--At the end of the 3-year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners shall determine, in \n     consultation with the insurance commissioners or chief \n     insurance regulatory officials of the States, whether the \n     uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) \n     has been achieved.\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\n       (2) Judicial review.--The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any \n     challenge to the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners' determination under this section and such \n     court shall apply the standards set forth in section 706 of \n     title 5, United States Code, when reviewing any such \n     challenge.\n       (e) Continued Application.--If, at any time, the uniformity \n     or reciprocity required by subsections (b) and (c) no longer \n     exists, the provisions of this subtitle shall take effect 2 \n     years after the date on which such uniformity or reciprocity \n     ceases to exist, unless the uniformity or reciprocity \n     required by those provisions is satisfied before the \n     expiration of that 2-year period.\n       (f) Savings Provision.--No provision of this section shall \n     be construed as requiring that any law, regulation, \n     provision, or action of any State which purports to regulate \n     insurance producers, including any such law, regulation, \n     provision, or action which purports to regulate unfair trade \n     practices or establish consumer protections, including \n     countersignature laws, be altered or amended in order to \n     satisfy the uniformity or reciprocity required by subsections \n     (b) and (c), unless any such law, regulation, provision, or \n     action is inconsistent with a specific requirement of any \n     such subsection and then only to the extent of such \n     inconsistency.\n       (g) Uniform Licensing.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to require any State to adopt new or additional \n     licensing requirements to achieve the uniformity necessary to \n     satisfy subsection (a)(1).\n\n     SEC. 322.

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of the Association shall be to provide a \n     mechanism through which uniform licensing, appointment, \n     continuing education, and other insurance producer sales \n     qualification requirements and conditions can be adopted and \n     applied on a multistate basis, while preserving the right of \n     States to license, supervise, and discipline insurance \n     producers and to prescribe and enforce laws and regulations \n     with regard to insurance-related consumer protection and \n     unfair trade practices.\n\n     SEC. 324. RELATIONSHIP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.\n\n       The Association shall be subject to the supervision and \n     oversight of the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (hereafter in this subtitle referred to as the \n     ``NAIC'').\n\n     SEC. 325.

The establishment of any such categories of \n     membership shall be based either on the types of licensing \n     categories that exist under State laws or on the aggregate \n     amount of business handled by an insurance producer. No \n     special categories of membership, and no distinct membership \n     criteria, shall be established for members which are insured \n     depository institutions or wholesale financial institutions \n     or for their employees, agents, or affiliates.\n       (d) Membership Criteria.--\n       (1) In general.--The Association may establish criteria for \n     membership which shall include standards for integrity, \n     personal qualifications, education, training, and experience.\n       (2) Minimum standard.--In establishing criteria under \n     paragraph (1), the Association shall consider the highest \n     levels of insurance producer qualifications established under \n     the licensing laws of the States.\n       (e) Effect of Membership.--Membership in the Association \n     shall entitle the member to licensure in each State for which \n     the member pays the requisite fees, including licensing fees \n     and, where applicable, bonding requirements, set by such \n     State.\n       (f) Annual Renewal.--Membership in the Association shall be \n     renewed on an annual basis.\n       (g) Continuing Education.--The Association shall establish, \n     as a condition of membership, continuing education \n     requirements which shall be comparable to or greater than the \n     continuing education requirements under the licensing laws of \n     a majority of the States.\n       (h) Suspension and Revocation.--The Association may--\n       (1) inspect and examine the records and offices of the \n     members of the Association to determine compliance with the \n     criteria for membership established by the Association; and\n       (2) suspend or revoke the membership of an insurance \n     producer if--\n       (A) the producer fails to meet the applicable membership \n     criteria of the Association; or\n       (B) the producer has been subject to disciplinary action \n     pursuant to a final adjudicatory proceeding under the \n     jurisdiction of a State insurance regulator, and the \n     Association concludes that retention of membership in the \n     Association would not be in the public interest.\n       (i) Office of Consumer Complaints.--\n       (1) In general.--The Association shall establish an office \n     of consumer complaints that shall--\n       (A) receive and investigate complaints from both consumers \n     and State insurance regulators related to members of the \n     Association; and\n       (B) recommend to the Association any disciplinary actions \n     that the office considers appropriate, to the extent that any \n     such recommendation is not inconsistent with State law.\n       (2) Records and referrals.--The office of consumer \n     complaints of the Association shall--\n       (A) maintain records of all complaints received in \n     accordance with paragraph (1) and make such records available \n     to the NAIC and to each State insurance regulator for the \n     State of residence of the consumer who filed the complaint; \n     and\n       (B) refer, when appropriate, any such complaint to any \n     appropriate State insurance regulator.\n       (3) Telephone and other access.--The office of consumer \n     complaints shall maintain a toll-free telephone number for \n     the purpose of this subsection and, as practicable, other \n     alternative means of communication with consumers, such as an \n     Internet home page.\n\n     SEC. 326.

Mr. President, on Sunday, May 2nd, John Elway, \nwho for 16 seasons has been the uncontested leader of the Denver \nBroncos and a valuable civic leader and mentor for young Americans, \nofficially announced his retirement from the NFL. He will be sorely \nmissed. From extraordinary moments like ``The Drive'' in the 1986 AFC \nChampionship Game to countless other picturesque instances, all we have \nare the many memories now. How do you replace a legend? You can't.\n  Exactly 16 years from the date of his announcement--May 2, 1983--the \nDenver Broncos acquired John Elway from, the then Baltimore Colts in \nreturn for offensive lineman Chris Hinton, quarterback Mark Herrman, \nand the Broncos' first round draft pick in the 1984 draft. That day \nwill go down as arguably the best day in Broncos' history, and one of \nthe best in football history.\n  I had the pleasure on January 27, 1998 of addressing my colleagues on \nthe Senate floor regarding the accomplishments of one of the best \nquarterbacks in the history of the NFL, John Elway, with Senate \nResolution 167. On February 3, 1999, I again had the honor of calling \nto my colleagues' attention the outstanding accomplishments of the \nDenver Broncos and John Elway for capturing another Super Bowl victory. \nToday I have the distinct honor of congratulating John Elway for a \nremarkable career and would like to thank him for all he contributed to \nColorado and to our nation.\n  Mr. President, John Elway's career has been packed with astonishing \nstatistics; 148 victories, the NFL record for a quarterback; nine Pro \nBowl selections; 5 Super Bowl starts, another NFL record; two Super \nbowl Championships; 300 career touchdown passes; over 50,000 passing \nyards; Super Bowl XXXIII's Most Valuable Player; the NFL's Most \nValuable Player in 1987; the American Football Conference's Most \nValuable Player in 1993; and 47 fourth-quarter comebacks, to name just \na few of the many highlights of a stellar career.\n  John Elway's leadership and dedication to excellence have benefitted \nthe Broncos, the city of Denver, the state of Colorado, and America. \nJohn Elway, your place in Canton, Ohio in the Pro Football Hall of Fame \nawaits.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4718-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4718-S4719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN ELWAY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on May 2, 1999, John Elway retired \nconcluding one of the most remarkable sports careers ever. After \nsixteen National Football League seasons, exactly sixteen years to the \nday after he was traded to the Denver Broncos by the Baltimore Colts, \nthe Magnificent Number 7 bid farewell to the team he has led to five \nSuper Bowls and two consecutive world championships.\n  John Elway has been among the most prolific quarterbacks ever. He is \nthe all-time winningest quarterback with 148 wins as a starter. In 46 \nof those wins Elway engineered game winning fourth quarter drives. He \nstands second in all-time passing yards and third all-time in touchdown \npasses. He has been elected to nine Pro Bowls, starting in eight of \nthem. He is the only quarterback to ever throw for 3,000 yards and rush \nfor 200 in 7 consecutive seasons. Elway started in a record 5 Super \nBowls, and last year was elected MVP of the game. In addition to his \npeerless offensive\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\nproduction John Elway has been the model of leadership and consistency \nboth on and off the field.\n  On the field Elway missed only 15 games in 16 years due to illness or \ninjury. This toughness is amazing considering that in 256 career games \nhe was sacked an NFL record 559 times. Former Broncos coach Dan Reeves \nsays that it is Elway's mental toughness that has allowed this \nconsistency. Current coach Mike Shanahan cites Elway's competitive \nhunger and his confidence. What is clear at the end of sixteen years is \nthat Elway's combined physical gifts and the mettle of his character \nhave made him an American icon.\n  Off the field Elway has worked tirelessly for numerous Colorado \ncharities, and his John Elway Foundation has generated more than a \nmillion dollars in contributions since its inception. The stability and \ncommitment of the Elway Foundation insures that it will continue to \nmake Colorado a better place for years to come.\n  In an age when so many celebrities shrink under the intensity of the \nspotlight John Elway has carried himself with class and dignity. It is \nhard to define what John Elway means to Colorado, but it is clear to me \nthat he is more than just a football player. He is more than just a \nsuperstar. He is a figure that stands for something good, something \nstrong and dedicated. John Elway is the athlete you don't mind being a \nrole model. It makes you feel good to see his jersey on a kid playing \nin the park. I believe that says far more than any statistic.\n  I know that the people of Colorado join me in wishing John Elway and \nhis family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4719-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4719-S4720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SALUTE TO THE NATIONWIDE COMPANIES\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

The \nfront-page feature, appropriately titled, ``The Nationwide Miracle,'' \nmeticulously describes the amazing progress of Nationwide, and applauds \nthe company's founder and president Bill Case for his leadership and \nunquestioned integrity. Perhaps the best description of Nationwide as a \nuniquely American business is the conclusion in the feature that Bill \nCase and his company are ``revolutionizing the way the American public \nearns and saves money.''\n  The Money Maker's Monthly feature is a tribute to a man's vision and \nthe ability to transfer dreams into reality. In order that others may \ncelebrate this wonderful and well-deserved award and perhaps be \ninspired each day to realize the American dream, Mr. President, I ask \nyou to join me and our colleagues in saluting the many successes of \nBill Case and the Nationwide Companies. I ask that the Money Maker's \nmonthly article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n   The Nationwide Miracle--One Man's Vision Produces Unique Network \n                             Marketing Biz\n\n       Bill Case dreamed for many years of a business where people \n     could enjoy financial freedom. He already knew that network \n     marketing was the wave of the future, but concluded that the \n     industry had complications that disillusioned many able and \n     talented people. He wanted to find the simplest way that a \n     home-based entrepreneur could earn impressively through \n     network marketing without spending hard-earned money on \n     things like inventory and also avoid obstacles like \n     unproductive downlines. In other words, could you build a \n     business where financial freedom was obtainable through good, \n     honest work?\n       After carefully researching other network marketing \n     companies and interviewing a cross-section of successful \n     networking entrepreneurs throughout the country, Case found \n     the answer. The result became The Nationwide Companies, his \n     seven-year-old business that is viewed by many observers as a \n     miracle in the network marketplace.\n        ``Instead of selling marked-up merchandise, we sell a \n     benefits package which gives the owner the right to purchase \n     popular items like cars, boats, furniture and health \n     insurance with the same group buying power and low prices \n     enjoyed by Fortune 500 Companies.'' Case emphasizes that the \n     Nationwide Benefits Package is ``a hot item because of value \n     in savings.'' Case says his network marketing business, which \n     is headquartered in Atlanta, is revolutionizing the way the \n     American public earns and saves money. Skeptics are few and \n     far between as Case and his company gladly showcase a growing \n     number of success stories from California to Florida who are \n     earning six-figure incomes. Nationwide networkers called \n     Independent Marketing Directors (IMDs), publicly and rather \n     proudly state that they are enjoying genuine financial \n     freedom as associates of Case's ``Team Nationwide.''\n       With evangelical drive, Case welcomes everyone to visit \n     under the umbrella of The Nationwide Companies. ``We are \n     truly one of a kind among network marketing companies,'' \n     observes Case. ``We have a quality product that stands on its \n     own in the marketplace because it allows purchasers to obtain \n     items of genuine value.'' He emphasizes that the Nationwide \n     Benefits Package can be purchased by anyone. It is a retail \n     item in the truest sense of the word. The Benefits Package \n     allows the owner, according to Case, to buy or lease cars, \n     trucks, RVs, boats, along with furniture, eye care, health \n     insurance, and even exotic vacations. ``Our Benefits Package \n     saves consumers substantial amounts of good, hard dollars. \n     The benefits are from recognizable Fortune 500 companies like \n     ``the big three'' automakers, General Electric, United Parcel \n     Service, Hertz and LensCrafters, just to name a few,'' says \n     Case, adding that the Package is ``one of the best bargains \n     in the country!''\n\n\n                            without burdens\n\n       Like other network marketing businesses, Nationwide \n     operates through its IMDs from Hawaii to New York. From the \n     company's Atlanta headquarters, Case's fast-growing \n     enterprise provides marketing and sales information, computer \n     support and state-of-the-art, easily accessible training for \n     its IMDs. When asked what makes Nationwide different from \n     other network marketers, Case, breaking into a wide grin, \n     responds, ``Our IMDS don't have to buy or keep any inventory. \n     There's no quota of any kind, no penalties, no competition \n     and no levels of unpaid production.'' Case adds that \n     Nationwide's system ``pays to infinity.'' ``You get paid what \n     you are worth with Nationwide, and you only have to make two \n     sales each year. We believe that our IMDs should earn good \n     money without unnecessary difficulty,'' he says.\n       Case describes Nationwide's management as ``hands-on.'' \n     ``We have a National Sales Training Coordinator for \n     Nationwide who has created the lion's share of the effective \n     marketing tools used in the company's training program. Lynda \n     is a crown jewel,'' says Hendryx. ``Her training expertise \n     gives our IMDS the head start they need in earning good, \n     solid money as quickly as possible.''\n       One of the key players on Nationwide's team is Dick Loehr, \n     president of Loehr's Auto Consultants in Ft. Lauderdale, \n     Fla., who operates the benefits company for Nationwide. \n     Loehr, who once owned nine automobile franchises, ranging \n     from Porsche to Chrysler, has vast experience in the national \n     automobile marketplace. A protege of Lee Iococca (Loehr was \n     an advisor to Iococca at Chrysler and still wears the lapel \n     pin award given for his service to Iococca and Chrysler), \n     Loehr is a virtual encyclopedia of knowledge of the \n     automobile industry, including the complicated areas of \n     financing and leasing. Nationwide recently produced a video \n     interview with Loehr, which is a reservoir of vital \n     information that any consumer would need to know before \n     buying or leasing an automobile.\n       Loehr's joining Nationwide meant coming out of retirement. \n     ``When I heard about Nationwide, I did my own investigation \n     and knew this company was a winner,'' says Loehr. With \n     Loehr's auto industry skills, Nationwide continues to be able \n     to make popular items like automobiles available to its \n     associates through the same group buying power enjoyed by \n     Fortune 500 companies. Also, Loehr's heralded experience in \n     the car market is invaluable to Nationwide. ``I understand \n     pricing of automobiles and trucks, and financing and leasing \n     is almost secondhand to me,'' says Loehr, who is not \n     bragging, but stating fact.\n       One of the most recent benefits available to Nationwide \n     associates is the availability of Program cars, which became \n     possible through Loehr's esoteric knowledge of the automobile \n     industry. Loehr says this makes the Benefits Package even \n     more valuable. ``A Program car is a recent model, low mileage \n     auto in top shape from a fleet program which we obtain for \n     sale or lease. These are incredible bargains available to \n     anyone owning the Nationwide Benefits Package.''\n\n\n                       tributes from the trenches\n\n       Case describes his national network of IMD's as ``my field \n     generals.'' ``I'm proud of the quality and high character of \n     every one,'' he says. Robert and Donna Fason of Mount Vernon, \n     Ark., are Nationwide's National Sales Directors who earned \n     their lofty title through impressive success. ``Every day is \n     a vacation to us,'' says Robert, adding, ``We are making more \n     money than ever and our IMD's are truly excited about even \n     greater earnings as we work together for financial freedom.''\n       Two key Team Nationwide Associates, says Case are Ruby and \n     Ray Riedel of Yakima, Wash. Both are successful veteran \n     network marketers who left one of the big\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\n     names in the industry for nationwide. Their story is a \n     fascinating, personal endorsement of Case's network business \n     dream. ``Unlike our previous company, we now have absolutely \n     no inventory, monthly quotas or penalties,'' stated Ruby \n     Riedel, ``How refreshing to be part of a genuine network \n     company and to be free of all overhead, competition and no \n     levels of unpaid production!'' In place of these obstacles, \n     Ruby says that IMD's now have ``value with rewards,'' ``We \n     and all others are paid what we're worth without limitations, \n     under an amazing income system that pays to infinity.'' She \n     hastens to add that Nationwide's regular training program \n     deserves accolades. ``The intensive and effective support \n     given to every IMD by people like Jack Hendryx and Lynda \n     Davis keeps all of us going upward with our earnings. This \n     training may be the very best in the network marketing \n     industry.''\n       Perhaps no higher praise for Nationwide has been given than \n     the observation of internationally respected and widely read \n     author Alfred Huang. A Maui, Hawaii resident and Nationwide \n     IMD, Huang says he became an associate of Case's team not \n     solely because of its proven earnings and savings, but \n     particularly because the system ``helps people to live a \n     better life.'' ``The true spirit and value of Nationwide is \n     caring of people.'' Huang is a best-selling author whose next \n     book, ``The Century of the Dragon--Creating Your Success and \n     Prosperity in the Next Century,'' is due for publication \n     later this year. He is convinced that network marketing will \n     soon be the mainstream solution for financial wellness.\n       ``Nationwide,'' Huang says, ``is the best network marketing \n     [company] I have ever known.'' A native of China, who was \n     imprisoned for 13 years after being wrongly convicted and \n     sentenced as an American spy (his conviction was overturned), \n     plans to write a book about Nationwide. ``I want to tell \n     people how to change their attitude and build their self-\n     confidence by sharing the beauty of Nationwide, its \n     philosophy, its system, its opportunity and its loving and \n     caring of people.''\n\n\n                          Income testimonials\n\n       Nationwide, according to Case, is a 100 percent debt-free \n     company that parallels the American Dream of entrepreneurial \n     success. ``Just look at Jack Hendryx, says Case. ``No man in \n     America could, I believe, exceed his professional marketing \n     ability and wonderful reputation for honesty.'' As a matter \n     of fact, one of Hendryx's presentations, which he gives live \n     in regional meetings, and is recorded on one of Nationwide's \n     video programs, concludes with Hendryx' advice to everyone, \n     ``The Benefits Package will sell itself. All you have to do \n     is tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \n     truth. the rest is easy.''\n       Case's expectations for 1999 and into the next millennium \n     are high. ``We turned the corner sometime back and this year \n     and the next will see us explode with new sales. My \n     projection is to have tens of thousands more IMD's on board, \n     spread evenly throughout the geographical areas of America \n     with resulting growth in sales of the Benefits Package.'' \n     Case revealed that new benefits are scheduled to be added to \n     the package soon, and as they are added, they will be placed \n     retroactively into Benefits Packages already owned. \n     ``Remember, we are family and we share,'' says Case with his \n     engaging smile and twinkling eyes.\n       Every great American business pioneer has said, in one way \n     or another, that a company is measured by the accomplishments \n     of its people. Perhaps no better measure of Nationwide's \n     enviable position in America's network marketplace can be \n     found than in the successes of its IMDs. Many companies, for \n     whatever reason, are reluctant to disclose individuals with \n     verifiable earnings, but not Nationwide ``We want people who \n     are looking for the best earnings opportunity in America \n     today to contact our folks and ask them questions,'' Case \n     says. ``They are going to hear revelations from our people \n     whose lives have been transformed because of the Nationwide \n     miracle. And, I might add, I am talking about genuinely \n     impressive earnings.''\n       Joyce Ross, along with her husband Marvin, is a Nationwide \n     Regional Director in Malden, MO. She revealed an upward \n     transformation in income during her first year with \n     Nationwide. ``For 26 years, we owned a combination barber and \n     beauty shop in a lovely small town, but worked ourselves \n     nearly to death with an accumulation of bills and not enough \n     money for the work we were doing. Then came Nationwide,'' \n     says Joyce. ``It would have taken me ten years to earn as a \n     hairdresser what I have earned with Nationwide in less than \n     two years.''\n       Similarly, Don Garrison of Lampe, MO discloses that he \n     earned over $300,000 in the first year. ``This is the only \n     way I want to live and work, as a free American citizen!'' \n     David Hervey mirrors Garrison's success by revealing that he, \n     too, earned beyond $300,000 during the past year as an \n     associate of Team Nationwide. Hervey, it should be added, is \n     a Nationwide Regional Director in Jackson, Miss. Lamar Adams, \n     a Regional Director in Madison, Miss., earned over $10,000, \n     he says ``. . . in just my first six months as a Nationwide \n     IMD!''\n       Jack Hendryx, speaking from Nationwide's Atlanta head-\n     quarters, confirms that there are ``large numbers of similar \n     testimonials that we are delighted to share with anyone, \n     anytime, who has a genuine interest in bettering their lives \n     and the lives of their families.'' Hendryx has an abundance \n     of examples. ``All of our Regional Directors have their own \n     earnings success stories. Jack and Becky Hearrell, Fred and \n     Betty Swindle, and Shelby Langston deserve special \n     recognition, as does Bob and Judi Montgomery. The team is \n     built upon the Regional Directors' Shoulders.\n       Case is inseparable from his wife, Carol. It is more than \n     symbolic that he includes Carol in as many Nationwide \n     activities as her time and schedule will permit. ``Carol was \n     instrumental in providing me with some of the central ideas \n     that made Nationwide possible.'' Case says, ``She, in an \n     admirable way, has marketing and public relations talents \n     that go well beyond what you might expect to find on Madison \n     Avenue or even here on Peachtree Street in Atlanta. Plus, we \n     believe in husbands and wives, along with their families, \n     being the core of Team Nationwide.''\n       The IMD Honor Roll of Nationwide bears out Case's \n     ``family'' vision. The Regional Directors are almost \n     invariably in husband and wife pairs. IMD's everywhere, \n     pictured on his large conference room walls, are there with \n     their respective husbands and wives and occasionally, other \n     family members. Dick Loehr and his wife, Mary Lou are main \n     stays in the Nationwide miracle; likewise, Jack and Heide \n     Hendryx. ``What a wonderful country this will continue to be \n     if we have more businesses like Nationwide,'' says Case \n     ``where the preservation and betterment of the family unit is \n     not only encouraged, but made possible through the miracle of \n     financial freedom!''\n       Nationwide's story is the embodiment of the American dream. \n     Case believes that Nationwide is just beginning its \n     revolution in the network marketplace. During 1999 and well \n     beyond, he is committed to making Nationwide the national \n     exemplar of true financial freedom. He and his key team \n     players like Hendryx, Loehr and Davis are driven toward their \n     goal of financial freedom for everyone who is willing to work \n     for it. Every bit of evidence, out in the national field and \n     within their own business data in Atlanta, indicates that \n     they must be taken seriously.\n       Nationwide is on solid ground in the precarious mine field \n     we call the marketplace. Leadership, from Bill Case on down \n     through the chain of command, is top-notch. The determination \n     to grow and expand, based upon time-honored business methods, \n     is evidenced dramatically by its affiliation with Superior \n     Bank. The respected financial institution provides consumer \n     loans and mortgages as one of Nationwide's benefits. Standing \n     on its own, this banking relationship is a network industry \n     original but merits applause.\n       Case lives his dream everyday, only now it's real for \n     others as well. His IMDs are earning handsomely through the \n     Nationwide miracle because Case has blended the magic \n     business ingredients of planning, managing, and training with \n     honesty and integrity, and combined it with a valuable, \n     unprecedented Benefits Package.\n       Case and his team are telling America that a dream becomes \n     a reality through hard work. The road to financial freedom \n     took some effort to locate, but they found it and have it \n     available today. It's a very rewarding journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4720-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4720-S4721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND MONSIGNOR R. DONALD KIERNAN\n\n Mr.COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Georgian and a good friend, the Reverend Monsignor R. \nDonald Kiernan, of Dunwoody, who today celebrates his 50th Anniversary \nof service to the Church.\n  Monsignor Kiernan is a man of great warmth and humor, strong \ncompassion for others, and deep devotion to God, the Church, and to his \ncommunity. I have been privileged to work with Monsignor Kiernan as a \nmember of the Selection Committee that assists me in choosing nominees \nfor appointment to the United States military academies. His perception \nand judgment have been invaluable in making those always difficult \nselections. But that is only one example of the community service that \nhas distinguished his career.\n  In 1962, Monsignor Kiernan was instrumental in founding the Georgia \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, and served as that organization's \ndirector and chaplain for over twenty years. He has also served as a \nchaplain for the Georgia State Patrol, the Georgia Bureau of \nInvestigation, the DeKalb County Police Department, the Atlanta office \nof the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the emergency medical \ntechnicians, and several other organizations. Three governors have \nrecognized his dedication to the law enforcement community by \nappointing him to state commissions on crime.\n  He also plays leading roles as a member of the executive committee of \nthe Atlanta Area Boy Scouts of America and on the Board of Directors of \nthe United Service Organization.\n  The Monsignor's many civic activities have been an expression of his \ndevoted service to the Church itself.\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\n After graduating from Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, \nMaryland, he was ordained on May 4, 1949 by Richard Cardinal Cushing, \nArchbishop of Boston, at the Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston. He was \nassigned to serve as Assistant Rector at the Cathedral of St. John the \nBaptist in Savannah Georgia. He went on to serve as an assistant pastor \nand then pastor of nearly a dozen churches across the state of Georgia, \ncurrently serving All Saints Catholic Church in Dunwoody. In 1969 he \nwas given the title Prelate of Honor (Reverend Monsignor) by Pope Paul \nVI. He was elevated to the highest rank of Monsignor by Pope John Paul \nI in 1979.\n  I could list many other honors and awards conferred upon Monsignor \nKiernan, but perhaps his greatest achievement is in the many lives he \nhas touched. By now he must be on the third generation of performing \nbaptisms and marriages. His counsel, his example, and his leadership \nhave been a comfort and an inspiration to many thousands of Georgians. \nHis community service and his work raising money for the Church have \nbenefitted many others.\n  Those of us fortunate enough to know Monsignor Kiernan are thankful \nthat we do and so I am pleased, Mr. President, to congratulate \nMonsignor Kiernan on reaching this milestone and to thank him for his \nmany years of outstanding service to our state, our nation, and to \nGod.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4721-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4721-S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN INDONESIA AND THE FUTURE OF EAST TIMOR\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are two issues of critical \nimportance to the future of Indonesia, the region, and the \ninternational community which has interest in securing a stable and \ndemocratic future for Southeast Asia: the upcoming elections in \nIndonesia and the political status of East Timor. If the June national \nelections in Indonesia are determined to be free, fair and transparent, \nthe ballot for East Timor's political future has a much better chance \nof being conducted under the same conditions. The U.S. and the \ninternational community must make a strong effort now to ensure that \nthese conditions are established and upheld.\n  For the first time in forty-five years, Indonesians have a chance to \nparticipate in a free and fair election and to establish a government \nwith popular support and legitimacy. For the first time in twenty-four \nyears, the Indonesian government is willing to consider an East Timor \nthat is independent of Indonesian rule, pending the decision of the \nEast Timorese, themselves. Indonesia, indeed, stands at a cross-roads.\n  We must be sure that the U.S. and the international community stands \nthere with it to guide Indonesia down the correct path. The path that \nleads to democracy and free-market economic growth. Not the one headed \ninto chaos and economic downturn. It is clear that the stakes are high.\n  Indonesia boasts the fourth largest population, and is a crucial \nplayer in Asia, where American economic and political interests \noverlap. In 1996, the United States benefitted from some $3 billion in \nexports to Indonesia and American firms had invested over $5.1 billion \nin Indonesia's growing economy. The Asian financial crisis reversed \nthis course of economic expansion, crippling Indonesia's economy and \nexposing the inherent weakness in Indonesia's political structure under \nthe Suharto regime.\n  The resulting disintegration, which I saw first-hand during my trip \nto Indonesia in December, is overwhelming. Indonesia's GNP fell by \nfifteen percent in 1998, and is predicted to experience another decline \nthis year. Unemployment stands at over 20 million, up from 8 million \nlast May. Forty percent of Indonesia's 218 million people live below \nthe poverty line. But, this is not the end of it.\n  Economic instability has exacerbated the already prevalent political \nand social tensions. Student protests, attacks on Chinese businessmen, \nconflicts between Ambonese Christians and Muslims, and paramilitary \nviolence in East Timor is evident across the country. Separatist forces \non Aceh, Irian Jaya and other islands in Indonesia's multi-ethnic \narchipelago are gaining sway as Timorese independence moves closer to \nreality. The Indonesian government must take strong and decisive steps \nnow to reduce these tensions and build respect for the rule of law and \nhuman rights. This is necessary and crucial in order to create an \natmosphere conducive to holding democratic elections and determining, \npeacefully, the future political status of East Timor.\n  I must, however, commend the actions that President Habibie has taken \nthus far to open the political process and set the stage for democratic \nelections in June. In February, 1999, he signed legislation that \nestablished guidelines and procedures for conducting national \nelections. Forty-eight parties are now registered to compete in the \nJune election, as opposed to three in the Suharto era. The military's \nrepresentation in the parliament has also been reduced. Seats will be \nallocated by proportional representation, rather than the winner take \nall strategy which favored the Golkar party.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor legislation introduced by Senator Robert \nTorricelli which supports these efforts of the Indonesian government to \nachieve a real and peaceful transition to democracy. This bill calls \nupon the government to make necessary preparations to ensure that free, \nfair and transparent national elections will occur in June and that \nthere is a strong commitment to uphold the results of them. It also \nasks all parties involved in determining the status of East Timor to \nseek an equitable and workable resolution to this issue. I have \ncosponsored similar legislation in the past which affirmed the right of \nthe East Timorese to have a referendum on self-determination, \nencouraged the Indonesian government to protect human rights and \nfundamental freedoms and urged the Indonesian political leaders to \nimplement political and economic reforms. I will continue to support \nsuch efforts in the future.\n  The reforms that the Indonesian government has implemented --however \nencouraging--do not on their own guarantee free and fair elections, nor \ndo they help to reduce the tensions related to East Timor's political \nstatus. Violence has been on the rise. The world has witnessed \nincreased hostilities in recent months among groups that have cultural \nand political interest in what the future shape of East Timor will be. \nThe Indonesian government has a responsibility to resolve these \ntensions. I believe it can begin by abandoning its plan to employ \ncivilian militias to combat violence and dismantling existing militias, \nwhose abuses are already heightening the potential for violence. The \ngovernment must help the military find means for handling violent \noutbursts effectively, without abuse.\n  Allegations of the Indonesian military's direct involvement in \ncommitting human rights abuses and perpetuating violence led me to \nsupport a restriction on U.S. arms sales and International Military \nEducation and Training (IMET) aid to Indonesia which was initiated by \nCongress in 1993. I was, and still am, concerned that the Indonesian \narmed forces might use U.S. arms, military training, and financial \nassistance to commit human rights violations against innocent \ncivilians. It remains necessary to keep these restrictions in place \nuntil it is clear that the Indonesian military is committed to \nupholding democratic principles.\n  I am encouraged that the leaders of the Indonesian military, the pro-\nIndonesia militias and the pro-Independence rebels signed a peace \nagreement on April 21, 1999 that calls for an end to the violence and a \nlaying down of arms. It also establishes a Peace and Stability \nCommission which may help to determine the process by which full \ndisarmament can occur and the political status of East Timor can be \ndetermined. These are significant steps forward and I believe lay the \ngroundwork for real stability and peace.\n  Mr. President, it must not stop there, however. The Indonesian \ngovernment--with the support and commitment of its military--must \ncontinue its dialogue with all competing factions, both those that \nsupport and those that oppose independence. Together, they must seek to \nresolve outstanding issues--such as disarmament and the question that \nwill be asked on the ballot--in the most expeditious way possible. I am \npleased that East Timor groups favoring independence from Indonesia \nhave been included in recent\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\ndiscussions regarding the future political status of East Timor. It is \nimportant for all parties to be at the table since all parties must \nultimately abide by the agreement if it is to be credible and enduring.\n  While the exact details of the tripartite negotiations that occurred \nlast month between Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. are not fully clear \nat this time, the world community will be watching closely when they \nare released. The August ballot is supposed to determine the political \nfuture of East Timor. Whether the East Timorese choose independence or \ncontinued unity with Indonesia, the voting process and the period \nfollowing the vote must be free of violence and intimidation. The world \ncommunity can play an active role in helping the Indonesian government \nsee that this happens.\n  The Administration has pledged $30 million to assist Indonesia during \nits national election. However, I believe we, and others in the \ninternational community, should do more to make sure that sufficient \nfunds are available both for a free and fair election to occur in June \nand to help the Indonesian government conduct a free and fair ballot \nfor East Timor in August. The United Nations already has agreed to send \na civilian police force to East Timor to monitor the vote. I believe \nthis is a good first step. The U.N. presence should, though, be \nsupplemented by international, non-governmental organizations, or \nequivalent Indonesian groups, which can help monitor and facilitate the \nballot process.\n  The time is now for the U.S. and the international community to focus \non Indonesia and East Timor. The national election for Indonesia is \nless than six weeks away and the ballot for East Timor is only about \neight weeks after that. I believe, as one long involved in Southeast \nAsia, that it is important for those who have interest in the future \nstability of this region to start creating a positive atmosphere in \nwhich both of these events can occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4722-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 1963, May has traditionally \nbeen designated Older Americans Month. I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank these valuable citizens and share an article that \nwas recently printed in the Des Moines Register. The author reminds us \nof the many contributions older Americans make to our communities.\n  As we prepare for one of the largest demographic shifts in the \nhistory of our nation, we as policy makers often focus on the \nchallenges presented by a graying nation. However, as suggested by \nFrancis Keith in his article, ``Celebrate the Old Folks, Iowa's \nAssets,'' it would be a shame not to take the time to recognize and \nappreciate the vital role that seniors play in our communities.\n  Today more than ever, seniors are continuing to play active roles in \ntheir communities. In my home state of Iowa, I know many seniors who \nperform both paid and volunteer work well into their later years. Their \nwisdom and experience are a valuable resource that we should not allow \nto go to waste.\n  Mr. Marion Tierney, of Des Moines, Iowa recently spoke at an Aging \nCommittee event. He is a perfect example of an older American who \ncontinues to be an active participant in his community. He made a \ncareer change half a lifetime ago because he was looking for a new \nchallenge in sales and increased earning potential. Today, at the age \nof eighty, he serves nearly 100 customers of Iowa Machinery and Supply.\n  In a highly competitive business, Mr. Tierney says hard work is the \nkey to success. He brings know-how, experience, relationships, and \ntrust to customers as he assists them in developing solutions to \nimprove their productivity through the use of his company's industrial \nproducts. He stays on top of new technology and products and retrains \nfrequently to effectively meet customer needs. In turn, his field \nexperience helps the company decide which new product lines to acquire.\n  His employer cites Mr. Tierney's willingness to share knowledge and \nexperience with younger salesmen as a major contribution to the \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Tierney is just one example of the many contributions older \nAmericans make to their communities. I hope you will join me in \nhonoring Mr. Tierney and all Older Americans for their many \ncontributions. Not just during the month of May, but all year long.\n  I ask an article regarding Older Americans be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Apr. 27, 1999]\n\n                Celebrate the `Old Folks,' Iowa's Assets\n\n                           (By Francis Keith)\n\n       In recent months there have been numerous stories about the \n     aging of Iowa. The news reporters say our older population is \n     a burden. They say that the increasing numbers of older \n     people will be a liability for all the younger people who \n     still work and pay taxes in Iowa. The graying of Iowa it's \n     called.\n       There are predictions that as this trend continues, the \n     problem of so many old people will become acute and drag the \n     state into some economic quagmire that will have a negative \n     effect on everyone living here.\n       I take a different and more positive view. I am retired, \n     over 65; I was born in Iowa, I worked my whole life in Iowa \n     and I retired in Iowa. Most of my peers and close friends are \n     over 65. Many are over 70 and some over 80. For the most \n     part, we ``old Iowans'' remain very active in our community \n     and church and we know we are an asset to the state. We pay \n     our own way and we make a contribution. We old people are a \n     renewable resource.\n       We pay property taxes and help pay for the public schools, \n     yet none of us has children still in school. We don't drive \n     as much as when we worked and chauffeured our children to \n     school and activities. Still, we pay our share of the street \n     budget and we don't wear out the roads.\n       We pay income taxes, like everyone else, on our pensions, \n     on interest earned on our savings, even on part of our Social \n     Security.\n       We don't go to jail very often. As a group, we have a very \n     low crime rate. Few of us are druggies, abuse children, \n     speed, rob banks or use excess alcohol. We don't tie up the \n     courts or fill the jails.\n       We pay our share of sales tax. We still buy things locally \n     and support the stores and shops of Iowa. We eat out more \n     often. while we may not have as much income as when we \n     worked, we have more disposable income.\n       Most of our income is fixed, which has its limitations. But \n     on the other hand, we aren't caught in economic downturns, \n     layoffs, unemployment, labor strikes and other crises of the \n     work years. Our income is limited, but dependable.\n       We know how to work. While it's true we don't run as fast \n     as we used to, we are steady and dependable and we're not \n     afraid to work. Some of us still have business interests and \n     work every day. When we do have a business, we employ Iowans \n     and contribute to the economic well-being of our state.\n       We work for free. We volunteer. We serve on boards and \n     committees of many community activities and at hospitals and \n     care centers, libraries, churches and schools. We give our \n     time; some of us almost as much as a full-time job. We baby-\n     sit our grandchildren.\n       We're a stable population. We don't move around much. Not \n     that we don't travel for fun. We do that whenever we can, but \n     we aren't job-hopping. We don't have to prove ourselves \n     anymore by buying a bigger house or a bigger car, just to \n     impress our peers. Been there, done that. We've been in the \n     rat race--we know sometimes the rat wins. We've learned to \n     rest a little, to see the world up close and far away. We \n     look at sunsets and flowers and people in a little different \n     way now. We have learned patience and tolerance and we are \n     more thankful and appreciative of little things.\n       We even contribute when we are sick, which some doomsayers \n     point out derisively as a negative of being old. Even our \n     being in the hospital more than our younger friends \n     contributes to the economy of Iowa. We keep people working as \n     nurses, therapists, lab technicians and so on. We all die \n     sometime, and for us it's likely to be sooner. Even that \n     gives a job to someone.\n       Wouldn't any state like to have a group of honest, \n     reliable, stable, sociable, tax-paying citizens who are \n     willing to work without pay, who support our local businesses \n     and who never go on strike?\n       Well, look around, Iowa, we're already here. We're your \n     retired citizens. And we're working hard to keep Iowa the \n     great state we choose to retire in.\n       We're nice people to have around. We know we're pretty \n     darned good citizens and we have our pride. We have beaten \n     the system. We have reached retirement with all its promises, \n     most of which are true. Let's celebrate all the ``old folks'' \n     in Iowa, not put them down as a liability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4722-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4722-S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JAPANESE CAR CARRIER TRADE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with our trade deficit continuing \nto grow and with Japanese vehicle manufacturers continuing to increase \nexports to the United States, I rise to remind my colleagues that \ncompetitive U.S. companies continue to be thwarted in their efforts to \nbreak down the walls of ``kereitsu'' relationships built up over \ndecades in Japan. With Prime Minister Obuchi making his first official \nstate visit to the United States, I thought it useful to review our \neconomic relationship, or lack thereof.\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  As my colleagues know, the Japanese economy has been in a recession \nfor quite some time. Unfortunately, it would appear the country has \nsought to export its way out of the problem and to continue to shield \ninefficient domestic companies from international competition. For \ninstance, just last week the Commerce Department determined that \nJapanese steel imports were being dumped by margins of up to nearly \n70%. Such actions are not acceptable. As the office of USTR recently \nsaid,\n\n       [A]s its demand for imports declines and its firms redouble \n     their efforts to sell to healthier markets abroad, the \n     effects of Japan's economic policies will continue to hit the \n     United States. In 1998, the U.S. goods trade deficit with \n     Japan reached $64.1 billion, an increase of $8.4 billion \n     (14.2 percent) from the 1997 level. . . . U.S. merchandise \n     exports to Japan fell to $57.9 billion, a decrease of 11.9 \n     percent from the 1997 level. . . . Japan is more dependent on \n     the U.S. market to absorb its exports than it has been for \n     many years. In 1998, the United States bought about 31 \n     percent of Japan's exports, the highest level since 1990, and \n     close to the all-time high of 36 percent in 1986.\n\n  It will come as little surprise to Senators who are concerned about \nour steel industry and other sectors that Japan accounted for \napproximately one-fourth of our entire trade deficit in 1998. It is a \nmistake to suppose that such huge amounts of money can continue \nindefinitely to move one way across the exchange with reciprocal \nmovement in the other direction blocked. In view of this situation, the \nUSTR said in its report: ``The United States attaches top priority to \nopening Japan's markets to U.S. goods and services.'' I trust the \nPresident will share our government's concerns in his meeting with \nPrime Minister Obuchi, and will urge him to take steps to increase U.S. \naccess to the Japanese market.\n  I also believe Japan can, and should, take additional steps to \nincrease its defense sharing burden. Let me give one example. In the \nearly 1990s, Congress and the Department of Defense recognized that \nmore needed to be done to augment our strategic sealift capacity. Our \nexperience in Desert Storm demonstrated a critical shortage of U.S.-\nflagged, U.S.-manned roll-on roll-off strategic sealift vessels. We \ntherefore undertook new construction of a fleet of military ships of \nthis type. Even with this new construction, however, there will \ncontinue to be a deficiency of lifting capacity.\n  To meet this deficiency, under the leadership of then-Senator Bill \nCohen, Congress created the National Defense Features program. Under \nthe program, U.S. companies have been invited to build vessels equipped \nwith special military features for operation in normal commercial \nservice but available in times of national emergency.\n  Under one proposal, a fleet of refrigerated car carriers would be \nbuilt in the United States for operation in the U.S.-Japan trade. In \nnormal commercial service, the vessels would carry vehicles to the \nUnited States and refrigerated products to Japan. In times of national \nemergency, the vessels would carry tanks, heavy trucks, and other \nmilitary equipment, as well as substantial amounts of live ammunition.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding support from the Congress and the \nSecretary of Defense, the project has met with no interest or actual \nresistance in Japan. This is particularly disturbing because \nimplementation of the project would, at no economic cost to the \nGovernment of Japan, enhance the mutual security of our two nations. \nEspecially at a time when the Government of Japan wishes to play a \ngreater role in advancing shared defense objectives, I am disappointed \nthat it has not given more serious attention to this proposal.\n  I hope the Administration will continue to press the Government of \nJapan to take steps to reduce our trade deficit and enhance our mutual \nsecurity. I also hope the Government of Japan will use the occasion of \nthe Prime Minister's state visit to make further commitments to doing \nso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4723-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMEMORATING BRANDON BURLSWORTH\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is not often that I rise to \nspeak about specific individuals, but the individual I want to talk \nabout today was a man of extraordinary character, Brandon Burlsworth.\n  Last Wednesday, I was saddened to learn about the tragic and untimely \ndeath of Brandon Burlsworth. Brandon was only 22 years old when a car \naccident ended his life. While his time on this earth was short, his \nimpact on our world will be long lasting. Brandon was a hero to the \ncommunity of Harrison, the Razorback family, and the entire state of \nArkansas.\n  Brandon lived the kind of life that would make any parent proud. He \nled a wholesome life, and was a devout Christian who used his faith and \nstrong work ethic to become a success in every facet of life.\n  Brandon was not a highly recruited athlete coming out of Harrison \nHigh School. Several small colleges expressed interest in him, but \nBrandon had his sights on walking on at Fayetteville and becoming a \nRazorback. While the odds were long, Brandon worked hard and not only \nmade the team, but went on to start for the Razorbacks for three years. \nLast year, he earned All-American honors, while leading Arkansas to the \nSEC West Co-Championship and a berth in the Citrus Bowl. Last month, \nthe Indianapolis Colts selected Brandon in the third round of the \nNational Football League draft.\n  Not only was Brandon a disciplined player on the field, he was an \noutstanding student in the classroom as well. Brandon earned a \nbachelor's degree in marketing management and a master's in business \nadministration, all in 4\\1/2\\ years. In addition, he was a three time \nmember of the SEC Academic Honor Roll.\n  Today, newspapers and newscasts are often filled with stories about \nathletes and their brushes with the law. Brandon became a symbol of how \nstudent athletes should conduct themselves. The manner in which he \nconducted himself on and off the field will be Brandon's legacy. He was \na young man of great character and dedication. While I recognize that \nwords alone provide little comfort in times such as these, I hope that \nBrandon's family knows how many lives this young man has \ntouched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/04/senate-section/article/S4723-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.
