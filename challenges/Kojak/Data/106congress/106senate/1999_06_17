Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I today introduce a \nresolution which asks that June 20, Father's Day, be further designated \nas ``National Father's Return Day.'' The purpose of this resolution is \nto highlight the fact that fathers are needed in the family.\n  I heard Governor George Bush speak this past weekend in New \nHampshire, and one of the things that really resonated with me was that \nhe said the most important job we have is not being a Governor or being \na Senator or being head of an assembly line or working at a restaurant; \nthe most important job we have is to be good moms and pops. That is \nabsolutely true. Unfortunately, in our country today, one out of every \nthree children is currently in a household without a father. That has a \ndevastating impact on the manner in which these children perceive life \nand the manner in which these children are raised.\n  We all know that in this time of difficult economic activity, where, \nunfortunately, it does take two parents working to raise a family in \nmany households, there is great stress on the family to begin with and \nthere is always the question of enough family time. There is always the \nquestion of having enough time to be with our children and have our \nchildren get from their parents the values and the ideas that are so \ncritical.\n  Coupled with the fact that so many children are being raised in \nhouseholds where there is no father, it is absolutely critical that we \nrefocus ourselves on the importance of the father in the household and \nthat we say to those fathers who maybe have left the household and are \nnot spending the type of time they should with their children, who are \nnot coming back as regularly as they should or not taking the extra \ninitiatives, the extra time it takes to be with their children during \nperiods when it is convenient for both the mother and the father: Think \nabout this, think about what you are doing, and think about your \nobligations as a father.\n  So this initiative which we put forward today, this resolution to \ndesignate June 20 as National Father's Return Day, has as its purpose \nto highlight this fact and to say to fathers throughout our Nation, \nthink about your opportunity as a father, not only fathers outside the \nhome but fathers who are still in the nuclear family,\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\nthink about your responsibilities and make sure you are living up to \nthat obligation, because as a Nation I think we must all understand we \nare never going to be able to be a nation of values, a nation of moral \nstrength, a nation of purpose, unless we give our children, the next \ngeneration, a sense of purpose, a sense of values, and a sense of moral \nstrength. The father plays a major role in accomplishing that.\n  So this resolution, which I will not read in its entirety, although \nit is an excellent resolution, I must admit, has as its resolve clause:\n\n       Be it Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that the creation of a better United States \n     requires the active involvement of fathers in the rearing and \n     development of their children;\n       (2) urges each father in the United States to accept his \n     full share of responsibility for the lives of his children, \n     to be actively involved in rearing his children, and to \n     encourage the emotional, academic, moral, and spiritual \n     development of his children;\n       (3) urges the States to hold fathers who ignore their legal \n     responsibilities accountable for their actions and to \n     pursue more aggressive enforcement of child support \n     obligations;\n       (4) encourages each father to devote time, energy, and \n     resources to his children, recognizing that children need not \n     only material support, but also, more importantly, a secure, \n     affectionate, family environment.\n       (5) urges governments and institutions at every level to \n     remove barriers to father involvement and enact public \n     policies that encourage and support the efforts of fathers \n     who do want to become more engaged in the lives of their \n     children;\n       (6) to demonstrate the commitment of the Senate to those \n     critically important goals, designates June 20, 1999, as \n     ``National Father's Return Day'';\n       (7) calls on fathers around the country to use the day to \n     reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's \n     lives, to spend National Father's Return Day with their \n     children, and to express their love and support for them.\n\n  Then it requests that the President issue a proclamation calling on \nthe people of the United States to observe National Father's Return Day \nwith appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  I certainly appreciate the chance to participate in this resolution, \nwhich was the idea and the initiative of the Senator from Connecticut, \nwho has so many good ideas in the area of trying to improve family \nvalues in our Nation.\n  So it is a pleasure for me to join with him on this resolution, to be \na cosponsor of this resolution, and participate in offering it today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7162-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for most of us, Father's Day, which of \ncourse is this coming Sunday, is a special day of love, family, \nappreciation, a customary time for giving ties and, if you will allow \nme, for renewing ties of a different sort. But for a staggering number \nof American children, there will be no ties of either kind to celebrate \nthis Sunday. The sad reality is that an estimated 25 million children--\nmore than 1 out of 3--live absent their biological father, and 17 \nmillion kids live without a father of any kind. About 40 percent of the \nchildren living in fatherless households have not seen their dads in at \nleast a year; and 50 percent of children who don't live with their \nfathers have never stepped foot in their father's home.\n  This growing crisis of father absence in America is taking a terrible \ntoll on these children who are being denied the love, guidance, \ndiscipline, emotional nourishment, and daily support that fathers can \nprovide. As dads disappear, the American family is becoming \nsignificantly weaker and less capable of fulfilling its fundamental \nresponsibility of nurturing and socializing children and conveying \nvalues to them. In turn, the risks to the health and well-being of \nAmerica's children are becoming significantly higher.\n  Children growing up without fathers, research shows, are far more \nlikely to live in poverty, to fail in school, to experience behavioral \nand emotional problems, to develop drug and alcohol problems, to be \nvictims of physical abuse and neglect and, tragically, to commit \nsuicide. It is, of course, not just those children individually who are \nsuffering but our society as a whole. Many mothers and fathers are so \nbusy today that they are less involved in their children's lives than \nin the past. But this absence is particularly consequential when it \ncomes to fathers, for they play such a critical role in socializing and \nproviding boundaries to children, particularly to boys.\n  The devastating consequences of father absence for communities--and \nparticularly urban communities--has been broadly documented in a report \nreleased just this week by the Institute For American Values and the \nMorehouse Research Institute. The report was titled ``Turning the \nCorner on Father Absence in Black America.'' It was discussed in a \npowerful column by Michael Kelly, which appeared in Wednesday's \nWashington Post.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entirety of Mr. Kelly's column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A National Calamity\n\n       So now we are four, as along comes Jack, 8 pounds, 4 \n     ounces, to join Tom, who for the record welcomes this \n     development; and now I know what my job will be for the \n     remainder of my days. I will be the man sitting behind the \n     driver's wheel saying: Boys, listen to your mother.\n       This is a good job, and one of the better things about it \n     is the nice clarity it lends to life. Fathers (and mothers) \n     relearn that the world is a simple enough place. They \n     discover that their essential ambitions, which once seemed so \n     many, have been winnowed down to a minimalist few: to raise \n     their children reasonably well and to live long enough to see \n     them turn out reasonably okay. This doesn't seem like a great \n     deal to ask for until you find out that it is everything to\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\n     you. Because, it turns out, you are everything to them.\n       We know this not just emotionally but empirically. We \n     know--even Murphy Brown says so--that both fathers and \n     mothers are essential to the well-being of children. \n     Successive studies have found that children growing up in \n     single-parent homes are five times as likely to be poor, \n     compared with children who have both parents at home. They \n     are twice as likely (if male, three times as likely) to \n     commit a crime leading to imprisonment. They are more likely \n     to fail at school, fail at work, fail in society.\n       What, then, would we say about a society in which the \n     overwhelming majority of children were born into homes \n     without fathers and who grew up, in significant measure, \n     without fathers? We would say that this society was in a \n     state of disaster, heading toward disintegration. We would \n     say that here we had a calamity on a par with serious war or \n     famine. And, if that society were our own, we would, \n     presumably, treat this as we would war or famine, with an \n     immediate and massive mobilization of all of our resources.\n       Of course, this society is our own. Of black children born \n     in 1996, 70 percent were born to unmarried mothers. At least \n     80 percent of all black children today can expect that a \n     significant part of their childhood will be spent apart from \n     their fathers.\n       Millions of America's children live in a state of \n     multiplied fatherlessness--that is, in homes without fathers \n     and in neighborhoods where a majority of the other homes are \n     likewise without fathers. In 1990, 3 million children were \n     living in fatherless homes located in predominantly \n     fatherless neighborhoods--neighborhoods in which a majority \n     of the families were headed by single mothers. \n     Overwhelmingly, those children were black.\n       These figures, and most of the others that follow, come \n     from a report, ``Turning the Corner on Father Absence in \n     Black America,'' released to no evident great concern this \n     week by the Morehouse Research Institute and the Institute \n     for American Values.\n       As the report notes, things were not always thus. In 1960, \n     when black Americans lived with systemtic oppression, 78 \n     percent of black babies were born to married mothers, an \n     almost mirror reversal of today's reality. In the 1950s, a \n     black child would spend on average about four years living in \n     a one-parent home. An estimated comparable figure for black \n     children born in the early 1980s is 11 years. According to \n     the research center Child Trends, the proportion of black \n     children living in two-parent families fell by 23 percentage \n     points between 1970 and 1997, going from 58 percent to 35 \n     percent.\n       The disaster of black fatherlessness in America is part of \n     a larger crisis. In every major demographic group, \n     fatherlessness has been growing for years. Among whites, 25 \n     percent of children do not live in two-parent homes, up from \n     10 percent in 1970. Overall, on any given night, four out of \n     10 children in America are sleeping in homes without fathers. \n     (True, in the past few years, the number of out-of-wedlock \n     births has begun to fall, but that trend is too nascent and \n     too modest to much affect the situation.)\n       Some people think all of this matters. One is David \n     Blankenhorn, a liberal organizer who learned realities as a \n     Vista volunteer and who 11 years ago founded the Institute \n     for American Values, co-author of this week's report. It is \n     Blankenhorn's modest suggestion that fathers are necessary to \n     children, that their abdication on a large scale is \n     calamitious to the nation and that the people who run the \n     nation should do something serious about this.\n       The man who currently runs it is not a factor here; he does \n     not do serious. What about the men who would run it? Al Gore \n     says nothing; he is too busy fighting the loss of green \n     spaces in Chevy Chase. Bill Bradley preaches about racism but \n     is silent about the ruination of a race. George W. Bush is \n     full of compassionate conservatism, but he won't say quite \n     what that is. And so on. History will wonder why America's \n     leaders abandoned America's children, and why America let \n     them do so.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to say just a few words on the \njarring statistics from that report and column for my colleagues. Of \nAfrican American children born in 1996, 70 percent were born to \nunmarried mothers. At least 80 percent, according to the report, can \nexpect to spend a significant part of their childhood apart from their \nfathers.\n  We can take some comfort and encouragement from the fact that the \nteen pregnancy rate has dropped in the last few years. But the numbers \ncited in Mr. Kelly's column and in the report are nonetheless \nprofoundly unsettling, especially given what we know about the impact \nof fatherlessness, and indicate we are in the midst of what Kelly aptly \nterms a ``national calamity.'' It is a calamity. Of course, it is not \nlimited to the African American community. On any given night, 4 out of \n10 children in this country are sleeping in homes without fathers.\n  At the end of this column, Michael Kelly asks: How could this happen \nin a Nation like ours? And he wonders if anyone is paying attention.\n  Well, the fact is that people are beginning to pay attention, \nalthough it tends to be more people at the grassroots level who are \nactively seeking solutions neighborhood by neighborhood. The best known \nof these groups is called the National Fatherhood Initiative. I think \nit has made tremendous progress in recent years in raising awareness of \nfather absence and its impact on our society and in mobilizing a \nnational effort to promote responsible fatherhood.\n  Along with a group of allies, the National Fatherhood Initiative has \nbeen establishing educational programs in hundreds of cities and towns \nacross America. It has pulled together bipartisan task forces in the \nSenate, the House, and among the Nation's Governors and mayors. It has \nworked with us to explore public policies that encourage and support \nthe efforts of fathers to become more involved in the lives of their \nchildren.\n  Last Monday, the National Fatherhood Initiative held its annual \nnational fatherhood summit here in Washington. At that summit, Gen. \nColin Powell, and an impressive and wide-ranging group of experts and \nadvocates, talked in depth about the father absence crisis in our \ncities and towns and brainstormed about what we can do to turn this \ntroubling situation around.\n  There are limits to what we in Government can do to meet this \nchallenge and advance the cause of responsible fatherhood because, \nafter all, it is hard to change people's attitudes and behaviors and \nvalues through legislation. But that doesn't mean we are powerless, nor \ndoes it mean we can afford not to try to lessen the impact of a problem \nthat is literally eating away at our country.\n  In recent times, we have had a great commonality of concern expressed \nin the ideological breadth of the fatherhood promotion effort both here \nin the Senate and our task force, but underscored by statements that \nthe President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services have made on this subject in recent years. Indeed, I \nthink President Clinton most succinctly expressed the importance of \nthis problem when he said:\n\n       The single biggest social problem in our society may be the \n     growing absence of fathers from their children's homes \n     because it contributes to so many other social problems.\n\n  So there are some things we can and should be trying to do. I am \npleased to note our colleagues, Senators Bayh, Domenici, and others \nhave been working to develop a legislative proposal, which I think \ncontains some very constructive and creative approaches in which the \nFederal Government would support financially, with resources, some of \nthese very promising grassroots father-promotion efforts, and also \nencourage and enact the removal of some of the legal and policy \nbarriers that deter men from an active presence in their children's \nlives.\n  Another thing I think we can do to help is to use the platform we \nhave on the Senate floor--this people's forum --to elevate this problem \non the national agenda. That is why Senator Gregg and I have come to \nthe floor today. I am particularly grateful for the cosponsorship of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, because he is the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Children and Families. We are joined by a very \nbroad and bipartisan group of cosponsors which includes Senators Bayh, \nBrownback, Mack, Dodd, Domenici, Jeffords, Allard, Cochran, Landrieu, \nBunning, Robb, Dorgan, Daschle, and Akaka. I thank them all for joining \nin the introduction of this special resolution this morning, which is \nto honor Father's Day coming this Sunday, but also to raise our \ndiscussion of the problem of absent fathers in our hopes for the \npromotion of responsible fatherhood.\n\n  Senator Gregg indicated this resolution would declare this Sunday's \nholiday as National Fathers Return Day and call on dads around the \ncountry to use this day, particularly if they are absent, to reconnect \nand rededicate themselves to their children's lives, to understand and \nhave the self-confidence to appreciate how powerful a contribution they \ncan make to the well-being of the children that they have helped to \ncreate, and to start by spending this Fathers' Day returning for part \nof the day to their children and expressing to their children the love \nthey have for them and their willingness to support them.\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n  The statement we hope to make this morning in this resolution \nobviously will not change the hearts and minds of distant or disengaged \nfathers, but those of us who are sponsoring the resolution hope it will \nhelp to spur a larger national conversation about the importance of \nfatherhood and help remind those absent fathers of their \nresponsibilities, yes, but also of the opportunity they have to change \nthe life of their child, about the importance of their fatherhood, and \nalso help remind these absent fathers of the value of their \ninvolvement.\n  We ask our colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution, and \nadopting it perhaps today but certainly before this week is out to make \nas strong a statement as possible and to move us one step closer to the \nday when every American child has the opportunity to have a truly happy \nFather's Day because he or she will be spending it with their father.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nTorricelli, is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7164-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7164-S7166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CHILDREN'S LEAD SAFE ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in our constitutional government, it \nis the Congress that is entrusted to reflect both the desires of our \npeople and it was envisioned that it is this Congress that would be the \nmost responsive to immediate public need.\n  But there has arisen in recent years both a frustration with the \nCongress and a tendency to rely upon other institutions. Patterns \nemerged in the fight against tobacco and the health care crisis that \nhave come from citizens, aggrieved parties who have relied upon the \nFederal courts to redress their grievances. Indeed, the same pattern is \nnow occurring with regard to the problems of gun violence and the \ninability of Congress to respond to the legitimate needs of controlling \nthese dangerous weapons in their design and in their distribution, \nleading citizens to, once again, rely upon the Federal courts.\n  I rise today because there is now a third rising frustration with the \nAmerican people that is leading them to the Federal courts rather than \nto the Federal Congress. I am addressing the problem of lead poison.\n  Victims of lead poisoning are suing corporations that have \nmanufactured this paint before its residential use was banned in 1978, \nrecognizing that lead today is the leading health hazard to children in \nmany communities around America.\n  Despite all of our efforts in the last 20 years to ban lead paint to \nprotect American children, there are still estimated to be 890,000 \nchildren in America who suffer from elevated levels of lead poisoning \nin their blood. This lead poisoning in America's children leads to \nphysical impairment, mental impairment, and severe behavioral problems \nin children. In extreme cases, this leads to comas, mental retardation, \nbrain damage, and even death.\n\n  In 1992, the Congress made a commitment to our children. It was our \ncollective judgment we would mandate that States test every child under \n2 years of age in America, using Medicaid, to determine the level of \nlead poison. This mandatory screening would limit the dangers of lead \nto children with the highest risk of exposure. We felt confident, \nbecause 75 percent of the highest risk children were already in Federal \nhealth care programs.\n  There was a recognition that these children were five times more \nlikely than other children in America to be exposed to lead and to have \nthese potential impairments because they lived in older housing and \nwere less likely to have access to health care. The fact of the matter \nis that, despite 20 years of congressional good intentions and this \nmandatory program through Medicaid, children in America are not being \nprotected. A recent GAO report indicates that two-thirds of children on \nMedicaid have never been tested for lead. Over 400,000 children with \nhigh lead in their blood are unidentified, and these children need our \nhelp.\n  Just like in the tobacco cases, and now with the gun cases, citizens \nare frustrated. The Congress expressed good intentions. It legislated. \nBut there is no response. Indeed, citizens now are left with the \nthought of having nothing happen, or to pursue their grievances in the \nFederal courts. The Congress has not provided an answer. That is why \nSenator Reed and I have introduced the Children's Lead Safe Act, S. \n1120.\n  This legislation would ensure that every Federal program which serves \nchildren at risk in our country is testing them for lead. We are not \nasking. We are not hoping for the best. We are requiring an answer, and \nthat every child in a Federal program today--Head Start and WIC--be \ninvolved; ensuring that we know whether or not these children have high \nlead levels; recognizing that every day that goes by and that every \nyear of development of these children leaves them at risk for brain \ndamage, developmental problems, or even death.\n  Our legislation requires that WIC and Head Start centers determine if \na child has been tested. It guarantees that Medicaid contracts \nexplicitly require health care providers to adhere to Federal rules for \nscreening and treatment. It requires that States report to the Federal \nGovernment the number of children on Medicaid who have been tested. At \nlong last, we will require the testing, ensure there is funding for the \ntesting, and then finally know how many children are at risk and the \nnature of their risk.\n  This legislation will also ensure that States and Federal agencies \nhave the resources. This is not a mandate without a financial \nalternative. Reimbursement to WIC and Head Start will be provided for \nscreening costs; and, indeed, we go further and create a bonus program \nto reward States for every child screened above 65 percent of the \nMedicaid population. But, indeed, screening, reimbursement for \nscreening, and mandatory screening is only part of what Senator Reed \nand I would provide.\n  Finally, we will do this: expand Medicaid coverage to include \ntreatment for lead poisoning. If we identify a child who has an \nelevated lead poisoning level, that child is given immediate treatment \nbefore brain damage, paralysis, or learning disabilities become \npermanent.\n  Second, we improve information on lead poisoning so parents who live \nin older housing in our older cities where the risk is greatest know \nhow to identify the dangers, change the living environment, and deal \nwith the problem. We encourage the CDC to develop information-sharing \nguidelines to health departments, drug test labs, and official health \nprograms.\n\n  These are all part of a comprehensive program to fulfill the promise \nthat this Congress made 20 years ago to deal honestly with the problem \nof lead poison: Inform parents, give health care alternatives, assure \nthat children in programs such as WIC and Head Start actually are given \nthe screening that they know is necessary and that they deserve.\n  I hope the parents and advocacy groups which are now going to the \nFederal courts on the well-beaten path of tobacco advocates and gun \ncontrol advocates before them can now have confidence that this \nCongress will not wait on the sidelines in frustration, recognizing \nthat a program we implemented 20 years ago is not working; we are now \ndemanding and providing the resources for a mandate that, indeed, can \nhave meaning for the life of these children and for their parents.\n  I urge our colleagues to recognize the advantages of S. 1120. I hope \nMembers join with Senator Reed and me in offering this worthwhile and \nimportant program to deal with lead poison.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Torricelli, to discuss the issue of childhood lead \npoisoning and discuss the legislation we introduced.\n  Over the last 20 years, the United States has made significant \nprogress in reducing lead exposure, particularly among our children. We \nhave enacted bans on lead-based paint, lead solder in food cans, and \nthe deleading of gasoline. As a result, blood lead levels in the United \nStates have decreased by 80 percent. That is good news.\n  However, what is not good news is the fact that there are an \nestimated\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\nnearly 1 million preschoolers who have excessive lead in their blood, \nmaking lead poisoning one of the leading childhood environmental \ndiseases, if not the most significant environmental disease that \naffects children today.\n  Today, lead-based paint in housing is the major source of this \nexposure to our children. It has been estimated that approximately half \nof America's housing stock, roughly 64 million units, contain some \nlead-based paint. Twenty million of these homes contain lead-based \npaint in a hazardous condition--paint which is peeling, cracked, or \nchipped.\n  Children typically get exposed to this, and young children \nparticularly, while playing on floors that have minute particles of \nlead, from opening and closing windows, particularly old windows, \nbecause of the paint in the runners which crack when the window is \nopened or closed. Thousands of particles of lead are set off in the \natmosphere, and children ingest these particles.\n  Children also ingest lead in backyards in older neighborhoods where \ncars were worked on 20 years before but in the ground there are still \nsignificant quantities of lead.\n\n  This is particularly a problem in my home State of Rhode Island, \nbecause we have a rather old housing stock; 43.7 percent of our houses \nand homes were built before 1950 when lead paint was ubiquitous; it was \nused everywhere. HUD estimates that 80 percent of pre-1950 homes used \nlead paint. There are only five States that have a higher percentage of \nolder homes--those built before 1950--than Rhode Island. In Rhode \nIsland this is a significant problem.\n  Nationally we have found that 1 in 11 children has elevated blood \nlevels. In Rhode Island it is one in five. Nationally this is still a \nproblem. This is not just an issue that pertains to the Northeast or to \nsome parts of the country. It cuts across every sector of this great \nNation.\n  Another example from the Rhode Island experience: In 1998, 15,000 \nRhode Island children entering kindergarten had their blood levels \nscreened; 3,000 of these children had elevated lead in their blood \nsystems. That is an unacceptable percentage. We would like to see zero \nelevated lead levels but certainly not 3,000 out of 15,000.\n  The impact is unfairly borne by minority children, low-income \nchildren. African American children are five times more likely than \nwhite children to contact lead poisoning. In Rhode Island, 14 percent \nof white children screened in 1998 had elevated lead levels, 36 percent \nof African American children, and 29 percent of Hispanic children. This \nis an environmental disease that is correlated highly with low income. \nPoor housing unduly affects minority children throughout the country.\n  We also know that exposure to lead leads to health problems for \nchildren. It also has a profound impact on their educational \ndevelopment, because lead will attack the central nervous system and \nupset cognitive functions. It is a pernicious disease which will lead \nto impairment of educational ability and intellectual ability.\n  One of the ironies of our program is that we spend very little \nrelative to lead problems, but we are spending millions and millions \nand millions on special education. In fact, there is not one of my \ncolleagues who has not heard his or her local school superintendent or \nthe Governor say: We have to support special education; we have to \nreduce these costs. We can if we have a health care system that reacts \nand screens for lead in children.\n  These lead-affected children are more likely, because of educational \ncomplications, to drop out of school. In fact, it has been estimated \nthat they are seven times more likely to drop out of school if they \nhave elevated blood lead levels. We continue to pay for special \neducation through dropouts, through young people who do not have the \nskills to participate fully in our economy.\n  It is our responsibility to do something. As my colleague, Senator \nTorricelli, mentioned, we have in the past instructed all the Federal \nhealth care programs to screen children and to treat children, but we \nhave not been able to measure up to the task we have given them. We \nhave not been able to effectively screen all the children. Certainly we \nhaven't been able to treat all these children.\n  We do have solutions: First, we have to make parents more aware, and \nalso we have to insist upon comprehensive screening and treatment for \nchildren who are at risk.\n  In January 1999, the General Accounting Office reported that children \nin federally funded health care programs such as Medicaid, WIC \nprograms, and the Health Centers Program are five times more likely to \nhave elevated blood levels than children who are not in these programs. \nThe report also found--this is substantiated by what Senator Torricelli \nsaid and underscores the need for action now--that despite longstanding \nFederal requirements over 20 years, two-thirds of the children in these \nprograms, more than 400,000, have never been screened at all, even \nthough it is our policy that they all should be screened--400,000 \nchildren.\n\n  Our legislation, the Children's Lead Safe Act, will ensure that all \npreschool children who are enrolled in Federal health care programs who \nare most at risk for lead poisoning are screened and receive \nappropriate followup care. We know that early detection of lead \nexposure is critical to the success and the health of that child.\n  We also know that unless you screen the child, you will not know if \nthat child requires extensive follow-on care. If we do the screening, \nas for years we have said we must, we will go a long way toward taking \nthe first step in reducing this problem, finding out who is exposed, \nand getting those children into appropriate care.\n  We want to ensure there are clear and consistent standards for the \nscreening, that we don't have a hodgepodge of different standards, that \nwe have a program that is sensitive to the latest scientific \ninformation.\n  In addition to comprehensive screening, we are also going to insist \non clear and consistent standards that will be applied by every health \ncare provider who is screening these children.\n  Another aspect of the legislation is to have a management system in \nplace that follows these children.\n  As an aside, I had an interesting conversation just a few weeks ago \nwith a physician from Los Angeles who is an expert in asthma, which is \nanother environmental childhood disease of significance. He has created \na special program with a mobile laboratory which goes to each school. \nOne of the key factors for the success of his program is that not only \ndoes he treat the child, but there is an elaborate information system \nto follow the course of that child. In fact, what he found is that \nwithout this elaborate followup, this information system that can \nmonitor the results and the progress of children, initial treatment is \nseldom effective.\n  If we begin to insist upon comprehensive screening, as we have said \nwe wanted for 20 years, if we go ahead and require that there be \nuniversal screening standards that are applied everywhere, if we have a \nsystem of information that will follow these children and ensure that \nthey get the care, and ultimately we provide the resources for the \ncare, we can go a long, long way to do what we have wanted to do for \ndecades, to ensure that every child in America is not exposed to lead \nand, if they are, they are treated properly and effectively.\n\n  If we do these things, the payoff is going to be dramatic. We are \ngoing to have healthier children. We are going to have children who are \nmore able and willing to learn. We will, I hope, reduce the dropout \nrate because, I remind my colleagues again, a child with elevated lead \nblood levels is seven times more likely to drop out.\n  In sum, we are going to be able to spare children from a disease \nwhich is entirely avoidable. That is why we are so enthusiastic about \nthe legislation we are proposing. Both Senator Torricelli and I believe \nthis is a sensible, efficient way to do what we all want to do. We also \nbelieve in the long run--and I know this is said about so much \nlegislation, but this certainly must be the case--this will be saving \nnot only the children but will be saving dollars in special education \nand in dropout prevention.\n  In many ways we are paying right now for a problem that not only \ncould be addressed but effectively resolved. So I encourage all my \ncolleagues to\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\njoin us to ensure our legislation becomes law and that an unnecessary \ndisease affecting children, the No. 1 environmental disease affecting \nchildren in this country, can be eradicated and will go the way of many \nother childhood diseases because we took action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is interesting. Prior to my speech, the \nSenator from New Jersey and the Senator from Rhode Island talked about \nlead poisoning and public health. The Senator from Maine has discussed \nMedicare, and now I want to discuss the Patients' Bill of Rights. There \nhave been three speeches in a row on health care. It sounds like a \npretty important issue to me.\n  Frankly, for many Americans, it is the most important issue. But the \nsad reality is that the Senate spends a lot of time on speeches when it \ncomes to health care and almost no time when it comes to debating \nlegislation to make things better.\n  If you are watching this proceeding or are within the sound of my \nvoice and you can say in the last year I had a problem in my family \nwith health insurance coverage or I know someone in my family who did, \ndo not believe you are in the minority. In fact, almost 50 percent of \nAmericans say they have had problems with their managed care health \ninsurance.\n  What kind of problems? Coverage. If there is a problem, a medical \nproblem, will the managed care policy cover it with the care that is \nnecessary, or do you have to go out and hire a lawyer?\n  On the question of emergency room access, if you belong to a managed \ncare plan, they might tell you, incidentally, you are supposed to go to \nSt. John's Hospital and not Memorial Medical Center and you find \nyourself in a predicament where Memorial Medical Center is closer to \nyour home in an emergency situation, you better check your policy. You \nmight have just done something, by going to the wrong hospital, in the \nview of that insurance company, that is going to cost you and your \nfamily some money. That should be changed.\n  Basically, an individual in a family situation who has a medical \nnecessity, a kid who has fallen down with a broken arm or something \nvery serious should not have to fumble through the glove compartment to \nfigure out which hospital to go to for emergency care. That is \nsomething we need to address.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights proposed by the Democratic side is an \nattempt to try to address obvious inadequacies when it comes to health \ninsurance and health care in America. I have given a couple of \nexamples--coverage under a health insurance policy and the question of \nwhich emergency room you can use. There are many others.\n  For instance, most people believe when they sit down in the doctor's \noffice, the doctor is being honest with them, the doctor is telling the \ntruth, the doctor is giving his or her best medical judgment. In fact, \nthat relationship and that conversation is really so honored in law, \nthat in a courtroom it is considered a confidential relationship--the \ndoctor-patient relationship. Yet, what has happened is there is another \nparty in the room, although invisible. That other party is a bureaucrat \nfrom an insurance company. Many doctors, when they lean over the table \nand say, you know, I think this is what your son needs, or this is what \nyour wife will need, are not giving you their best medical advice. They \nare telling you what the health insurance company will pay for and what \nit will not pay for.\n  One of the things we address in the Patients' Bill of Rights is \nending this physician gag rule. Please, in America, allow doctors to \npractice medicine. Do not let clerks and insurance companies make \ncrucial medical decisions.\n  The Illinois State Medical Society invited me several years ago to \naccompany a local doctor in Springfield, IL, to a hospital and spend a \nday making rounds. I was a little nervous about it because, frankly, I \ndo not have any business in a hospital room unless I am being treated. \nBut they invited me, and it turned out that most of the patients were \nhappy to see a politician wandering around with their doctors.\n  But the thing that was an eye-opener at St. John's Hospital in \nSpringfield was when the doctor I was accompanying decided he wanted to \nkeep a patient in the hospital over the weekend. The lady was in her \nsixties. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor that was causing her \ndizziness. She lived alone.\n  The doctor said: I'm afraid that if she went home over the weekend \nbefore the Monday surgery to remove the tumor, she might fall down and \nhurt herself. We would have to postpone the surgery. I want to keep her \nin the hospital so we can take care of her and watch her, and then on \nMonday perform the surgery.\n  I am a layman, but that sounded perfectly reasonable.\n  Before he could make that decision, though, he had to get on the \nphone and call a clerk at an insurance company in Omaha, NE. You know \nwhat the clerk said? ``No. Send her home. Tell her to come back Monday \nmorning for the brain surgery.''\n  This doctor could not believe it. He stood at this nurse's station, \non that same floor, arguing with that clerk for half an hour. Finally, \nhe slammed the phone down and said: I'm keeping this woman in the \nhospital. We'll appeal this later on.\n  What that doctor faced is repeated every day all across America where \npeople who are sitting with these books of insurance regulations are \nmaking the decisions--the life-and-death decisions--that we count on \nwhen we take ourselves or our family in for medical care.\n  This has to come to an end. It has to change. We have to say, \nbasically, that health insurance in this country is not going to be \ndriven just by the bottom line in reducing costs, but by the top line \nof quality medical care; we are not going to take health care away from \nthe professionals and give it to the insurance bureaucrats.\n  There is legislation pending before the Senate which engages this \ndebate, which says this, the greatest deliberative body in America, is \ngoing to come down and debate, once and for all, how to make it right \nfor American families. That bill is mired down in the process and \ncannot be brought to this floor. As a result, we stand before you \ntoday--and I know Senator Dorgan is going to address this as well--in \nfrustration.\n  What is it we are doing here that is more important than making sure \nhealth insurance and health care in America is of the highest quality? \nWe spent 5 days, 5 legislative days, debating the protection of \ncomputer companies. Well, it is an interesting challenge in terms of \nliability and their protection. Can't we spend 5 hours debating whether \nor not 150 million American families have health insurance protection? \nIsn't that worth our time and our debate?\n  Oh, there are differences of opinion here. I see things one way and \nsome on the other side may see it another, but that is what the \nlegislative process is about. Yet, we cannot seem to bring it to the \nfloor so that we can have an honest debate to help America's families.\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\n  The other day I called on the Senate majority leader, the Republican \nleader, Trent Lott, to call up this bill before the Fourth of July. We \nhave the bill out there. We know what the issues are. Let's have the \ndebate. Yet, he was not sure he could. I hope he changes his mind. I \nhope those who were listening to this speech, and others, will decide \nthat it is worth calling their Senators and their Congressmen and \ntelling them: Yes, do something about health insurance.\n  Incidentally, in the case I mentioned earlier, where that insurance \ncompany clerk told the doctor to send the lady home, that if that clerk \nguessed wrong, and that lady went home, fell down the stairs and had a \nserious injury, do you know who is liable for that? Do you know who \nwould have to answer in court for that insurance clerk's decision? The \ndoctor--not the insurance company, the doctor.\n\n  That is what is upside down, because in America we are all held \naccountable for our actions. But by a quirk in the Federal law, health \ninsurance companies--many of them are not held accountable for their \nconduct, not held accountable for their decisions.\n  Are the doctors upset about this? Are hospitals upset? Wouldn't you \nbe if you wanted to do the right thing for the patient, and the \ninsurance company makes the decision, a wrong one, the patient is \ninjured, and the person sued ends up being the doctor or the hospital?\n  Frankly, in this country we are all held accountable for our actions. \nWhy should health insurance companies be any different? If they knew \nthey had to answer for their decisions, I think they would make better \ndecisions. I think they would be more sensitive and more responsive. \nThat is one of the key areas of disagreement between Democrats and \nRepublicans on this bill.\n  Should it be debated? I think so. I would like a vote on it. Let's \ndecide whether health insurance companies shall be held accountable \nlike every other company in America. For some reason, the leadership \nhere in the Senate does not want us to debate this issue. That is a sad \nreality.\n  They have come up with a bill, incidentally, which really only covers \na third of Americans who are covered by health insurance. So many other \nAmericans just do not have a chance.\n  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. If you worked \nfor AT, you would be covered by the Republican bill; General \nElectric, covered by their bill; Wal-Mart, covered by their bill. But \nother small business employees would be left behind to fend for \nthemselves. Family farmers--I have a lot of them in Illinois--they pay \nfor their own insurance, they pay a lot for it; they would not be \nprotected by the Republican bill. Public school teachers, policemen, \nwomen firefighters, in fact all State and local employees would not be \ncovered by the bill that is being proposed by the Republicans.\n  This is worthy of a debate. Are we going to have a Patients' Bill of \nRights that helps all Americans, or are we going to slice off a third \nof them and say: Well, we're worried about you; we're not worried about \nyour neighbor?\n  That is worth a debate. That is worth a vote. What is holding this \nup? It is a decision by some that, before we take this issue under \nconsideration, there has to be an agreement to limit the number of \namendments. The Democratic leadership is prepared to limit those \namendments. Let's bring it down to a 5-day debate or a 6-day debate. \nLet's go at it, and go at it seriously.\n  Yet, I think the underlying reason for the delay is something more \nserious. There is an old friend of mine and former boss, State Senator \nCecil Partee of Chicago, IL, who used to say: In politics, for every \ndecision there is a good reason and a real reason. Well, the good \nreason is the time of the Senate. The real reason is that many Senators \non the other side of the aisle don't want to be forced to vote on some \nof these tough questions. The insurance companies tell them to vote one \nway, and they know that when they go back home they cannot explain that \nvote. That, to me, is the bottom line.\n  I mentioned the other day in debate a former Congressman, now passed \naway, a great friend of mine, Mike Synar, who was a Congressman from \nOklahoma. He said: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a \nfireman. If you don't want to vote on tough issues, don't be a Member \nof Congress.\n  These are tough issues, but they are important issues. The American \npeople deserve our best judgment in bringing this debate forward in a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, to bring it to the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Do you remember the debate on gun control? A lot of phony amendments \nwere considered for a week. Finally, they were rejected and a real bill \nwas passed. It is important to do the same thing with the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to extend my time by 5 minutes. I \nsee no one else on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is expressed by the Chair as a \nMember of the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will then, at the end of morning \nbusiness, ask that morning business be extended if necessary.\n  I have waited to listen to my friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nand to add my voice to this call for a debate on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. What is the Patients' Bill of Rights? And why is it necessary?\n  The Senator from Illinois just described the invisible partner in the \ndoctor's examining room or the hospital room. I want to read about this \ninvisible partner because I think it is quite interesting.\n  A couple of years ago, we had a hearing here in the Congress on the \nHouse side. Late in the day, long after the television cameras had been \npacked up and the lights had been turned off and the crowd had left, a \nwoman came to testify. I want to read part of her testimony. She was a \ndoctor. She said:\n\n       My name is Linda Peeno. I am a former medical reviewer and \n     medical director for three managed care organizations. I wish \n     to begin by making a public confession: In the spring of \n     1987, as a physician, I caused the death of a man.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Although this was known to many people, I have not been \n     taken before any court of law or called to account for this \n     in any professional or public forum. In fact, just the \n     opposite occurred: I was ``rewarded'' for this. It brought me \n     an improved reputation in my job, and contributed to my \n     advancement afterwards. Not only did I demonstrate I could \n     indeed do what was expected of me, I exemplified the ``good'' \n     company doctor: I saved a half million dollars!\n       Since that day I have lived with this act, and many others, \n     eating into my heart and soul. For me, a physician is a \n     professional charged with care, or healing, of his or her \n     fellow human beings. The primary ethical norm is: do no harm. \n     I did worse: I caused a death. Instead of using a clumsy, \n     bloody weapon, I used the simplest, cleanest of tools: my \n     words. The man died because I denied him a necessary \n     operation to save his heart. I felt little pain or remorse at \n     the time. This man's faceless distance soothed my conscience. \n     Like a skilled soldier, I was trained for this moment. When \n     any moral qualms arose, I was to remember: I am not denying \n     care; I am only denying payment.\n\n  This from a doctor who served in a managed care organization, making \nthe decisions about whether a patient and a doctor can continue to \nreceive and provide care. That is the invisible presence in that \nhospital room--someone 1,000 miles away making a decision about profits \nand losses. This woman says: As a doctor, I caused a man's death and \nwas rewarded for it.\n  Is this the way medicine should work? The Patients' Bill of Rights \nsays no. Our bill says that every patient in our country, has the right \nto know all of their medical options, not just the cheapest treatment \noptions. Today many doctors are gagged, told by the managed care \norganization, you dare not tell that patient what their range of \nmedical options are, because we will not provide coverage for some of \nthe more expensive ones, even though they might be the option that \nsaves that patient's life.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights says let's correct that. Our Patients' \nBill of Rights says, when someone is in need of an emergency room and \nneeds medical treatment on an emergency basis, they have a right to get \nthat care.\n  Not all managed care organizations say that is the case. Jacqueline \nLee was hiking in the Shenandoah mountains. She tripped and fell off a \n40-foot cliff. She had serious injuries from that\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\nfall--fractures in her arms, pelvis, her skull. She was unconscious. \nShe was airlifted by helicopter to an emergency room, unconscious, with \nfractures in many bones in her body. The HMO said it would not pay the \nmore than $10,000 in hospital bills for Jacqueline Lee because she \nhadn't gotten prior approval for her emergency room treatment.\n  Think of that. Here is a woman hauled in on a gurney unconscious to \nan emergency room. The HMO says: Well, we won't pay that bill because \nyou didn't get prior approval for emergency room treatment.\n  Is there a need for a Patients' Bill of Rights? Is there a need to \ncorrect this kind of thing? Of course there is.\n  Now, the Republicans say: We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. Yes, \nthey do; they sure do. Their Patients' Bill of Rights covers some \nAmericans, covers about 48 million Americans. But there are 113 million \nAmericans who are not covered by their Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked the question: Why can't we bring the \nbills to the floor and have a debate? The answer is, because some want \nto control every nuance on the floor of the Senate. They want to \ncontrol who speaks, when they speak, whether you can offer an \namendment, what your amendment says. We have put up with that for far \ntoo long.\n\n  Speaking only for myself, we are done putting up with it. This is not \nthe way the Senate works. The Senate doesn't have, as the House does, a \nRules Committee that becomes the prison for all the amendments and then \nthe warden decides which amendments get let out the door. That is not \nthe way the Senate works.\n  I have just prepared an analysis of how the Senate has been handling \nthese issues in recent years, compared with the history of the Senate. \nIt is very interesting. Lately, the strategy is to bring a bill to the \nfloor and do what they call ``fill the tree,'' so Senators can't offer \nany amendments. The only way you can offer an amendment is if the \nmajority leader says: Let me see your amendment. If I like it, you get \nto offer it; if I don't, you can't offer it.\n  That didn't happen in the past in this Senate. That is not the way \nthe Senate works. Somebody needs to tell the folks who run this place \nthat we are not going to let them continue to run the Senate that way. \nWe demand that the Patients' Bill of Rights be brought to the floor of \nthe Senate, and we demand the right to offer our amendments. We demand \nthe right to debate them. We say to those who seem to want to keep the \ndoors locked on good public policy issues like this: If you intend to \nkeep doing that, then you are not going to do much business around \nhere.\n  While folks are brought into emergency rooms unconscious and told by \nHMOs: We won't pay because you didn't get prior approval, we are told \nwe can't correct it with a Patients' Bill of Rights. While we have \ndoctors who come to testify before the Congress and say: I am \nresponsible for the death of a person because I withheld treatment and \nI was rewarded for it under the current system, we are told we don't \nhave the time on the floor of the Senate to bring up a Patients' Bill \nof Rights, or, if we do have the time, we are going to demand that you \nget preapproval for your amendments by someone on the other side of the \naisle who puts forward a bill that is just a shell.\n  This Senate is sleepwalking on important issues. We ought to do much \nbetter for the American people than to sleepwalk on issues dealing with \nhealth care and the Patients' Bill of Rights and education and so many \nother important issues.\n  I will come tomorrow to the floor to talk about the farm crisis. This \nCongress is sleepwalking on the farm crisis as well.\n  I would like to say to my friend from Illinois, the Patients' Bill of \nRights should have been passed by the last Congress. We have been more \nthan patient on this issue.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois--I would be happy to entertain a \nquestion about the delay here--it seems to me there has been plenty of \ntime to do this. There is just not the will by some to want this to \ncome to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I really have two questions.\n  First, related to the fact that we both have large rural populations \nin our State, as the Senator from North Dakota understands, the tax \nlaws do not help family farmers pay for their health insurance as they \nshould. We have worked together to try to have full deductibility of \nhealth insurance. The family farmer, self-employed person trying to get \nhealth insurance coverage has to pay more out of pocket than anyone who \nworks for a corporation, for example, because of our tax laws.\n  We have the Republican version of this issue, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, which doesn't cover these same family farmers and give them \nprotection. So they pay more for their insurance, higher premiums. They \npay more out of pocket for it and don't get protection from the \nRepublican Patients' Bill of Rights, whereas the Democratic Patients' \nBill of Rights provides this protection.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might also make the point, the Congress has already \nsaid Medicare and Medicaid patients will get basic protections. Members \nof Congress get this protection in their own health care program. If it \nis good enough for all of those interests--and it is, and necessary--\nwhy is it not good enough for the 113 million Americans whom the \nRepublicans say ought not get this help with their Patients' Bill of \nRights?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to utilize the \nremaining time on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7168-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7168-S7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOCIAL SECURITY LOCKBOX\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged by what my friends on the other side \nhave said. On an issue they wouldn't let us talk about yesterday--that \nis called Social Security--they talk about wanting to get things to the \nfloor and get it done--yesterday every one of them voted against moving \nforward with the lockbox to do something with Social Security. It is a \nlittle bit incongruous with what they are saying today. That is one of \nthe real major issues we need to talk about.\n  I might add, over the last couple of years there has been a Patients' \nBill of Rights on the floor. It has been offered. The reason it hasn't \ngone anywhere is because the other side has to have amendments that \nhave no relevance to the bill, and go on and on. If they would like to \npass something, I suggest to them we put something out there, stick to \nthe issue and do it. I see they have disappeared.\n\n  Let me talk about Social Security. It seems to me it is one of the \nthings we are focused on; it is one of the things that is on our \nRepublican list to complete this year. We are probably not going to \nreform Social Security in this session, so we do need to make a move, \nand the move is the lockbox--to take the surplus that is now all Social \nSecurity that comes in this year and seek to ensure that it is used for \nthat purpose. For a very long time, this has not been the case. The \nmoney that has come in for Social Security, of course, has been put \ninto Government securities, and has been spent for other things. For \nthe first time in 25 years, we have a surplus, even though it is Social \nSecurity. So it is time, I believe, to do something to put that money \naside for the purpose for which it is extracted from you and me as \ntaxpayers.\n  Is the lockbox the ultimate solution? Of course not. But it is a way \nfor us to control what that money is used for, to stop the idea, which \nthe President supports, of $158 billion in expenditures on other issues \nusing Social Security money.\n  Everyone knows that we have to do something if we intend to have \nSocial Security in the future for the young people who are now starting \nto pay, as well as paying the beneficiaries that we now have. It wasn't \nmany years ago that Social Security was thought to be the third-rail \npolitics and nobody could touch it, otherwise they would be dead. Now \nwe come to the realization that if we want to continue this program \nover the years--particularly so young people beginning to pay and who \nhave many years to look forward to will get some benefit--we have to do \nsomething. The sooner we do it, the less\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\ndrastic the change will have to be. I think most everyone would agree \nthat is a fact.\n  In the year 2014, Social Security will begin to run a deficit. So we \nneed to look forward to that time. The options are fairly easy to \nunderstand. One, of course, is that you could raise taxes. I don't know \nof many people, given the 12 percent of our payroll that we now pay, \nwould want to increase that. For many folks in this country, Social \nSecurity withholding is the highest tax they pay, and it is a \nsubstantial one. The other, of course, is to change the benefits, \nchange the age, and do those kinds of things. There may be some \ntinkering with that, but basically the benefits will not be changed.\n  It leaves a third option, which I think is a good one, and that is to \ntake the money that we have paid in--each of us--a certain percentage \nof that becomes an amount of money that is in our account, and it can \nbe invested in equities, which returns a higher yield. That is really \nthe third option that we need to look at. The opportunity to do that is \nprobably somewhere ahead of us. So the lockbox, then, becomes the \nimportant thing now--to put that money aside so that we don't spend it.\n  There are, in my opinion, other reasons for doing that as well. This \nis one of the big debates here, as you can tell by listening just a few \nmoments ago. There are those who want more and more Government \nspending, and others would like to restrict the size of the Federal \nGovernment, to move more of the decisions back to counties and States \nand individuals. That is the debate--a legitimate debate between those \nwho want more taxes and more spending and those who would like to have \na smaller Government, to bring it down to only those essential things. \nWhen you have a surplus, that is very difficult to do.\n  So if we are talking about maintaining a budget, which we are very \nproud of, having spending caps, in which the budget ceiling has been \nthe largest contributor to having a balanced budget, if we are \ninterested in doing those things, those are all part of setting aside \nthis Social Security money. Over time, hopefully, in the future, as \nthis surplus extends not only to Social Security, but to the regular \noperational budget, we will have an opportunity to have some tax reform \nand to return some of this money to people so they can spend it for \ntheir families, so they can spend it to do some of the things our \nfriends were just talking about a few moments ago.\n  I think it is very important that we take it up. We have voted three \ntimes now to move forward with the lockbox. We asked to be able to go \nforward with this. Each time our friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave said no. Everyone on that side of the aisle voted no yesterday. \nThey said, no, we don't want to set the money aside, but they are up \ntoday saying here is where we want to make new expenditures of billions \nof dollars. There is something incongruous about that. We need to make \nsome decisions about where we are.\n  I think Republicans have four pretty well-defined goals we are \nworking toward. One is Social Security--not just to say save Social \nSecurity, as the President has said, and not do anything, but to \nactually do something.\n  Two is to do something about education. We have moved forward to do \nthat. We have the Ed-Flex Program, for one, that has moved decisions \nback to the schools boards and the States and counties where they ought \nto be for educational decisions.\n\n  We are talking about tax reform. We need to have tax reform. I \nnoticed last night somebody did a study of the whole world, and we are \nthe second highest in the world on estate taxes, topped only by Japan. \nIt is time that we did some tax reform and some of those things. Then \nsecurity, of course, for the benefit our country, we have done a great \ndeal on that, in strengthening the military.\n  I hope we will stop just talking about these things and actually do \nsomething. I'm talking about going forward with issues. We had a chance \nyesterday to go forward with an issue, and we had 45 votes against it. \nI hope we can move forward. One of the most important items in this \ncountry is Social Security, and the first step would be lockbox.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7169-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7169-S7170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOCIAL SECURITY LOCKBOX\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't know how much time is left in \nmorning business, but I will use whatever leader time is required. I \nwant to have the opportunity to respond to my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, about some of the comments he made with regard to the \nSocial Security lockbox and a couple of other issues he has mentioned. \nHe mentioned Democrats' unwillingness to support the efforts to bring \nup the Social Security lockbox. Let me make sure that everyone \nunderstands we are very desirous of having the opportunity to have a \ngood debate about the lockbox.\n  It is particularly propitious that probably the master of Senate \nprocedure is on the Senate floor, because I want to talk just a moment \nabout the difference, which is more than just a semantical difference, \nbetween a cloture vote that is designed to stop amendments and a \ncloture vote that is designed to stop a debate, a filibuster. There is \nno filibuster going on here. A filibuster is actually designed to bring \ndebate to a close. When 60 Senators have voted accordingly, we have \ntime remaining and then, ultimately, there is a final vote. There is a \nbig difference between bringing the debate to a close and offering \ncloture motions and proposing that the Senate preclude the opportunity \nfor Senators to offer relevant amendments.\n  That has been the case on the Social Security lockbox from the very \nbeginning. For whatever reason, our Republican colleagues continue to \nbelieve that what the Senate needs is a rules committee. Every day in \nthe House Rules Committee, decisions are made based upon the content of \namendments, which amendments are appropriate and which amendments are \nnot. The Rules Committee makes that decision, and then the rule is \npresented to the House Membership. They vote on whether they accept the \nrule or not. Based upon the content of those amendments, they make \ndecisions as to whether or not there will be amendments to a certain \nbill. In their wisdom, the Founding Fathers chose not to allow the \nSenate to be bound by such constraints, that a Senator, with all of his \npower and authority and responsibility, ought to have the right to come \nto the floor and offer an amendment. But what our Republican colleagues \ncontinue to insist upon is that they act as an ad hoc rules committee. \nThey want to see our amendments first. They want to approve our \namendments first. And only then will they allow our amendments to be \nconsidered once they have been given their approval.\n\n  I ran for the Senate in 1996 because I wanted to be able to be a \nSenator, not a House Member. I want to be a Senator, and I want all the \nresponsibilities and privileges and rights accorded to me as a Senator \nfrom South Dakota. That means the ability to offer an amendment.\n  On the lockbox, it is very simple. Whether you agree or not, we think \nthe Medicare trust fund and the Social Security trust fund ought both \nto be locked up; we ought to treat them the same. We are dealing daily \nwith the viability of the trust fund on Medicare, and if we can't \nensure that viability of that trust fund, then I must say we haven't \ndone our job.\n  We are saying, as Democrats, give us the right to offer an amendment \non Medicare. Let's lock up that lockbox as well, and let's have a good \ndebate about whether that makes good public policy or not. That is the \nissue.\n  The Republicans come to the floor; they file cloture to deny us the \nright to offer an amendment on Medicare--I must say also, to deny us \nthe right to offer amendments that really mean lockbox when we say that \nis what we want.\n  They have a provision in their bill. I must say, it is amusing to me, \nbut it says it is a lockbox unless we say we are for reform, and in the \nname of reform we can unlock the box, including privatizing Social \nSecurity. They have that in their bill. They want to be able to \nprivatize Social Security, and they want to be able to ensure that, \neven if they have now voted for a lockbox, in the name of reform they \ncan unlock it\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\njust by saying: We want to offer a reform amendment, and we will so \nunlock the box.\n  I am puzzled by the admonitions of our colleagues. I am sorry the \nSenator from Wyoming is no longer on the floor, because I really hope \nwe can set the Record clear. Democrats want to vote on a lockbox. But \nwe want that lockbox to mean something. We want it to include Medicare, \nand we want the right to offer amendments to do just that.\n  That is what this debate is about. There is a difference on a cloture \nvote between ending a filibuster and denying Senators the right to \noffer amendments.\n  We will continue to fight for our rights, regardless of the issue and \nregardless of how much concern it may bring to some of those on the \nother side who seem to be determined to lock us out.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is here. He is \nanxious to begin the debate on a very important bill.\n  I am hopeful we can pass this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7170-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 1664, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1664) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for military operations, refugee relief, and \n     humanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo, \n     and for military operations in Southwest Asia for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this measure is not at the moment covered by \nany time agreement, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is an appropriations bill. I believe Mr. Stevens \nat some point in the afternoon will be on the floor to manage the bill. \nMr. Domenici, who is very deeply involved in this bill as well, and who \nis on the Appropriations Committee, will be on the floor and will, as \nbetween himself and Mr. Stevens, manage the bill. I am not managing the \nbill, but until one of those Senators comes to the floor, I have a few \nthings I can say about it.\n  First, I thank the majority leader for making it possible for us to \ntake up this bill at this time. I also thank the minority leader for \nhis cooperation in that regard.\n  I thank the majority leader for keeping his word with respect to \ncalling up this matter. I will have possibly a little more to say about \nthat later, so I will explain what I mean in having said that.\n  I thank Mr. Stevens, who was chairman of the Senate side of the \nconference, which occurred on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill a few weeks ago. I thank the House chairman of the conference, Mr. \nBill Young of Florida, for his many courtesies that were extended upon \nthat occasion, and for his fairness in conducting the conference, and \nfor his cooperation in helping to work out a way in which we could at \nthat point let the emergency supplemental appropriations conference \nreport be on its way and be sent back to the House and Senate for \nthe final consideration of both of those Houses. I thank him for his \nefforts in bringing about an agreement whereby that emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill was let loose--if I may use that \nterm--from the chains which at the moment had it locked in an impasse \nin conference.\n\n  The provision in this bill, which is before the Senate, and in which \nI am very interested, is what we refer to as the ``steel loan guarantee \nprovision.'' There is a similar provision which Mr. Domenici was able \nto include in the bill, and it is similar to the steel loan guarantee \nexcept that it has to do with oil and gas. It provides a loan guarantee \nprogram for the oil and gas industry. He will more carefully and \nthoroughly explain that part of the bill later on.\n  Both of these provisions had been included in the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Both of these provisions were in the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill when it passed the Senate. \nSenators had an opportunity, when the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill was before the Senate, to offer amendments to the \nsteel loan guarantee language and to the oil and gasoline guarantee \nlanguage. Senators had that opportunity.\n  No amendments were offered to those provisions when that bill was \nbefore the Senate. Those provisions were put into that bill when that \nappropriations bill, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \nwas marked up in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Therefore, those \nprovisions, as I have already said, were included in the bill when it \nreached the floor, when it came before the Senate. The Senate passed \nthe bill. No amendments were offered to those provisions at that time.\n  That bill went to conference with the House in due course. It was a \nperiod of several weeks before the House-Senate conference took place \non that bill. When the conference did occur, these two provisions--the \nsteel loan guarantee provision and the oil and gasoline guarantee \nprovision--were gradually put off until the very end of the conference.\n  The conference on that bill lasted for several hours over a period of \n3 or 4 days. But it was the wish of both Chairman Young and the \nchairman of the Senate conferees, Chairman Stevens, to delay \nconsideration of those two parts of the bill until other matters in the \nbill, other differences between the two Houses, had been resolved. As a \nconsequence, as I say, it was toward the very end that we finally got \naround to those two provisions, the loan guarantee provisions.\n\n  In the conference, a vote occurred on the steel loan guarantee \nprovision late one evening. I think the vote really occurred after \nmidnight, so it was 12:30 or 1 o'clock in the morning of the next day \nthat we finally voted on the steel loan guarantee provision, which had \nbeen written in the Senate Appropriations Committee, which had come \nbefore the Senate, which had been adopted by the Senate.\n  When that vote occurred, all of the Democratic conferees on the House \nside voted to accept the steel loan guarantee provision which was in \nthe Senate bill; three of the Republican House conferees voted to \naccept the steel loan guarantee provision. So by a vote, I believe, of \n13-10, the conference adopted the steel loan guarantee provision.\n  The next day when the conferees met, a motion was made to reconsider \nthe vote that had occurred the previous late evening and the motion to \nreconsider carried. Two of the Republican House Members of the \nconference switched their votes from the previous position of \nsupporting the steel loan guarantee to their new position of opposing \nthat guarantee. As a consequence, my steel loan guarantee provision \nlost, I think, by a vote of 12-11. It lost by one vote.\n  An impasse prevailed. Senator Domenici's oil and gas loan guarantee \nprovision had been rejected by the House conferees; on the second vote, \nthe steel loan guarantee provision, which I had authored, was rejected \nby the House conferees. There was an impasse. The House conferees \nwouldn't give and the Senate conferees wouldn't give.\n  Therefore, rather than see the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill die in conference, I suggested we have a recess and try to work \nout an agreement whereby we could find a way to let that emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill fly with its wings out of the \nconference, go to the President's desk. In that bill, there were \nappropriations for the military in Kosovo, there was a pay increase for \nthe military, and there were various and sundry disaster relief \nprovisions which were intended to help people in South and Central \nAmerica and in the United States, as well--American farmers and so on. \nIt was certainly not my desire to kill that bill; it was not my desire \nto delay.\n  I said: Let's have a recess, Mr. Chairmen--addressing my remarks to \nthe two chairmen--let's have a recess and see if we can't work things \nout.\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\n  We had a recess and met down below, on the next floor of this \nChamber, where we stand now. I met in the Appropriations Committee room \nwith the House chairman, Mr. Young, the Senate chairman, Mr. Stevens, \nbeing present, along with the House minority, the ranking member of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, being present, and with the \nSenate minority or ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, myself, being present, together with a couple of other House \nMembers representing the majority and the minority and a couple of \nother Senate Members representing the majority.\n  It was there that we agreed to take our hands off the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill and let it go to the President and be \nsigned. We wanted a commitment that these two provisions which had \nworked their way through the legislative process, coming before the \nSenate, going to conference, be given a chance to pass and become law \naside from the emergency appropriations supplemental.\n\n  I talked with our majority leader, Mr. Lott, and our minority leader, \nMr. Daschle. They both agreed that it was very important to let the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill be on its way and that they \nwould help me and Mr. Domenici soon get a freestanding appropriations \nbill up before the Senate which would have in it the steel loan \nguarantee provision and the oil and gas loan guarantee provision.\n  With that assurance from the two leaders here, I proceeded to ask Mr. \nYoung, the chairman of the House conferees, if he and Mr. Obey and Mr. \nCallahan, a Republican member of the House conference, could proceed to \ntalk with the Speaker of the House and get a commitment out of the \nSpeaker that would let us deal with a freestanding appropriations bill \nthat would give these two provisions I referred to a chance for \nconsideration in both Houses, and hopefully for passage in both Houses.\n  The Speaker committed himself to calling up the bill within 1 week if \nit came over from the Senate; committed himself, secondly, to \nappointing conferees in the normal fashion so that there would not be \nstacked conferees; committed himself, thirdly, to having a vote on a \nconference report on the measure promptly.\n  With those commitments, we let the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill fly on its way to the White House and the Oval \nOffice where it was signed into law.\n  Now came the time for the leadership and the Senate to keep its \ncommitment. It did. That is what I was referring to when I thanked the \nmajority leader a few minutes ago for having kept his word. He and Mr. \nDaschle kept their word. Of course, as we all know, the main \nresponsibility and power rests with the majority leader in the Senate \nin things of this kind. Mr. Lott arranged for us to call up this bill, \nhave this bill before the Senate now. Cloture was invoked on it last \nFriday by an overwhelming majority, 71-28, on the motion to proceed. \nThe motion to proceed was then adopted by voice vote. So the bill is \nbefore the Senate this afternoon.\n  I see my good colleague, Mr. Domenici, is on the floor, ready to \nproceed. Let me just add one or two things.\n  Having made the explanation here as to where we are, how we came to \nbe here, let me say that because of the circumstances which have been \nobtained from the beginning and which I have outlined and which \nresulted in the two provisions in this bill having already been before \nthe Senate, having passed the Senate, without amendment in the Senate, \nI would hope there would be no amendments to this bill by the Senate \ntoday.\n  The Senate has already had its chance to make a run at these two \nprovisions. Senators have already had their chances to offer amendments \nto these two provisions when they were before the Senate in the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. Now the majority leader has \ncarried out his commitment of helping to get the bill up. The minority \nleader has carried out his commitment. I hope we will have the support \nof the two leaders, but they have carried out the spirit of their \noriginal commitment.\n  Now the commitment by the Speaker remains. But he didn't make a \ncommitment to this bill if it is loaded down with a lot of amendments \nwhen it goes back over there. He did not make any commitment on that \nscore. Whatever we put into this bill, whether it be nongermane or \ngermane, he made no commitment on that kind of thing. He made a \ncommitment with respect to these two provisions, the steel loan \nguarantee and the oil and gas loan guarantee.\n  I want the Speaker to keep his commitment, but I want him to be able \nto keep his commitment. I don't want us to load this bill down with \nnongermane amendments and send them back over there. We can't expect \nthe Speaker to keep his commitment on that kind of thing, because he \ndidn't make any such commitment. He only made a commitment with respect \nto these two provisions. That is not saying that the two provisions \ncannot be improved. Perhaps they can be. And I may support an \nimprovement. I think, if they were improved upon, the Speaker would, I \nhave a feeling--I haven't talked with him--would still feel that came \nwithin his commitment. But we can't bring in an amendment by every Tom, \nDick, and Harry and add it and let it run the gamut of whatever the \nsubject matter may be, nongermane, and expect the Speaker to take this \nbill up within 3 days, or whatever it was, promptly after it goes over \nthere.\n  So help us to help the Speaker to keep his commitment. I urge all \nSenators to be conscious of the facts as I have attempted to state them \nand see that we have an obligation. I think the Senate has an \nobligation, having passed these two provisions once, and in the face of \nlosing my grip on the emergency supplemental appropriation bill. I had \nthat bill in these two fists, and so did Mr. Domenici. We didn't want \nto kill that bill. But we let that bill go, as we should have done. \nAfter all, we are all interested, first of all, in our country, and we \nwant to see legislation passed that is in the best interests of our \ncountry. Senator Domenici and Senator Stevens and I, and other Senators \non the conference, came to that conclusion. We did the right thing.\n  Now I think Senators have some obligation. I understand their rights. \nSenators have a right to offer any amendments they want. There is no \nrule of germaneness in the Senate with respect to circumstances as they \nprevail at this moment. But it seems to me there is an unwritten \nobligation on the part of Senators to play fair, and to play fair here \nis to let our provisions be debated, and if they can be improved upon, \nfine. But let's not muddy the waters by offering amendments that are \nnot germane, because when we do that, as I say, we can't expect the \nSpeaker just to take anything we send over there and let his commitment \nearlier govern his actions.\n  I think that is about all I have to say at the moment. I will have \nmore to say on the steel loan guarantee provision later. Mr. Domenici, \nas I have already indicated, can far better explain the somewhat \nsimilar loan guarantee on the oil and gas provision.\n\n  I do have a luncheon I am supposed to attend. I am supposed to speak \nthere now. I have discussed this with my friend. Senator Domenici has \nindicated that, if he can, he would watch the floor and help me to be \naway a little while. He has to be away some, too, as does Mr. Stevens.\n  Having said that, I thank all Senators for listening. I thank my \nfriend from New Mexico, who is a valiant comrade and colleague and \nformidable opponent and a very worthwhile and desirable supporter. I \nprefer to be on his side rather than not. I thank him for all of the \ncourtesies and considerations that he has given to me in this bill, as \nwell as in thousands of other instances in which we have worked \ntogether.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, could I have \na little exchange so we could make the case that is very important, the \ncase that the Senator just made?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The urgent supplemental that passed the Senate, and the \nsupplemental that included the Byrd-Domenici guarantee program, was not \na frivolous supplemental.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was a big, powerful, tough supplemental, and urgent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right. Exactly.\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why? Because the President asked for $6.5 billion to \nreplenish funds for the Kosovo engagement, which was being taken--by \noperation of law, nothing illegal about it--from other military needs. \nThat is the way these things happen. The request was: Help us replenish \nit; give us the money.\n  Now, the point you have made is, we were in conference over that bill \nto which the Senate had seen fit to add $6 billion more for defense \nbecause we were so worried about preparedness, operational maintenance, \nand spare parts. So it was not just $6.5 billion urgent for defense; it \nwas almost $12 billion.\n  Now, what you have said, my friend from West Virginia, you said we \nhad a right, as conferees--and we had support--to say, let's get our \npart of this decided in this conference. And what would have happened? \nWe could still, perhaps, be locked up in conference and the urgent \nmoney would be yet not decided upon, which funding, in fact, has \nalready been signed by the President and is operating to help our \nmilitary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We decided, at the request of our chairman, Senator Ted \nStevens, to find a way to let that urgent bill go and relinquished our \nright to bring that back in disagreement, if we wanted, and have some \nmore votes on the issue.\n  I have done that in my life. The Senator has done it a number of \ntimes: OK, we are going back to the bodies again and vote again. They \nwould have had to have voted on our amendment there.\n  Mr. BYRD. Precisely, they would have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They would under law, under the rules. We said we would \ngive that up, provided--and you stated the proviso. The proviso was \nthat we be here today, just as we are, with this bill freestanding. We \nnow have it here properly, over long threats for long debates, because \nthe Senate overwhelmingly said: Let's get on with it; even if we don't \nvote for it, we want to get on with it.\n  So it's urgent that everybody know it's here again with the Senate \nalready having voted for it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They voted for that bill, with large, large support, \nwhich had our amendments on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So the Senate already voted for this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then it is over there in conference. We have a right to \nkeep it there.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a full-blown argument between the House and \nSenate. We said, no, the defense money is more urgent. That was the \nnational interest.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we said, OK, we will do that, but we ought to have a \nvote someday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is why we are here, and that is why you are \nsaying: Why do we have to have so many votes on items that are not \ngermane to this bill? This is completing a job that was started in the \nSenate and it broke off in the conference in the interest of a bigger \nproblem--to wit, adequate funding of defense--but we had a commitment \nwe would get a vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not saying we had a commitment that it would pass. \nThat is our job, with the help of Senators.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not suggesting the leader or anybody said there \nwould be no amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are talking about what is next, what is fair, what \nis the follow-on to what we did, remembering all the time that whatever \narguments are made, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. It did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. With these two guarantees in it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield the floor, but may I say before yielding that \nthe bill that is before the Senate is here through orderly procedures, \nit having been reported from the Senate Appropriations Committee in due \ncourse, and that is where we are now. I thank the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I have sought recognition to support \nthis bill, because I believe that a real need has been shown for these \nloan guarantees, certainly for the steel industry, and I believe for \nthe oil and gas industry as well.\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Domenici have outlined the procedures which \nwere followed in the Appropriations Committee, and I was part of that \nconference. The conference worked one night until past midnight, and \nthis provision was the subject of debate.\n  Coming in the Senate bill, the House of Representatives accepted it \nafter some substantial consideration, and then, as has been specified, \nsome votes were changed. The Speaker of the House of Representatives \nwas not pleased with this provision. The House of Representatives then \nchanged its position after having agreed to this amendment. Then we \nwere faced with a very difficult problem of a stalemate as to what \nwould happen with the Senate insisting on this provision and the House \nopposing it. We were faced with the need to get this emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to finance the military operations in \nKosovo.\n  The meeting finally eventuated in a very small session in S-128 \ndownstairs where Senator Stevens was present, Senator Byrd was present, \nand I was present representing the Senate. There were a few of the \nHouse Members. It was a very tough bargaining session.\n  Senator Byrd finally agreed, in the interest of moving the bill, and \nwe all agreed, to take this particular amendment off in order that the \nprovisions as to financing the military operation in Kosovo could go \nforward. The arrangement was made that this other legislative vehicle \nwould be available to bring the bill back up for consideration by the \nSenate.\n  Senator Domenici has just outlined the absence of a commitment on the \nvote, and I think that is, candidly, a generous position. There is a \nbasis for contending that this amendment should be placed in the same \nposition where it was prior to being taken off the earlier bill. If \nthat is to be so, then this amendment will be agreed to and it will go \nback as the Senate's position for a conference with the House, with the \nHouse having first accepted it and then having rejected it.\n  Whatever may eventuate in this Chamber today obviously remains to be \nseen in accordance with our rules.\n  On the merits, I believe that is a sound proposal. The steel industry \nhas been very hard hit over the past several decades with dumped and \nsubsidized steel coming into the United States. The dumped steel ought \nnot be tolerated. It is against our trade laws. It is against \ninternational trade laws. But, the dumping continues in great volume.\n  That dumping has, in the immediate past, cost the jobs of thousands \nof steelworkers and caused tremendous lawsuits to the steel industry, \nwhich is a threat not only to the economy and to jobs and to profits, \nbut also a threat to national security.\n  It is one thing to have dumped steel coming from Russia at the \npresent time where the Russian economic situation leads them to sell at \nvirtually any price to get dollars, but if a national emergency arises, \nare we going to get steel from Russia?\n  We have dumped steel from Brazil, from Korea, from Japan, and other \ncountries. In times of national emergency, are we going to rely on \nthose other countries as a source of supply?\n  The steel industry once had some 500,000 workers and was an enormous \nindustry in the United States. Over a period of time, that number has \ndwindled down to about a third--less than a third, actually--about \n150,000 workers. The steel industry has capitalized with some $50 \nbillion to be very competitive. But you cannot compete against dumping. \nYou cannot compete against a seller who will sell at any price. That is \nwhy the steel industry is in the very serious condition it is today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield \nwithout--well, I guess the Record will have to show an interruption.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia for any \npurpose under any circumstance.\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. He is \nalways a gentleman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I retain my right to the floor. I had a lengthy debate \nwith Senator Byrd about that many years ago when you had to retain your \nright to the floor. Senator Bayh has been patient, and I am glad to \nyield unconditionally.\n  Mr. BYRD. I merely want to thank the distinguished Senator for his \nsupport in this matter. He comes from a State and represents people who \nare very much like my State and my people. He understands the problems \nof the steel industry and the fact that many steelworkers have been \nlaid off, others have lost their jobs permanently.\n  I have to leave to be elsewhere for an hour or so. I will not be able \nto listen to the Senator's speech. That is why I interrupted him, to \napologize for not being here to hear his speech, but to thank him for \nspeaking, thank him for his support in this matter, and also to express \nmy exceedingly high regard for him as a Senator, as a gentleman, and as \nsomeone who is dedicated, sincere, conscientious, and always courteous \nand helpful.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nthose kind remarks. Our seats are pretty close on the Senate floor as \nevident if the television picture catches both of us, and I am sure it \nwill. I walk over very frequently to confer with Senator Byrd on \nconstitutional issues. Occasionally, he calls me his attorney general. \nHe just gave a nod in the affirmative----\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely, I admit to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I only got to be a district attorney. Senator Byrd and I \nhave a long, unguarded border with southern Pennsylvania and northern \nWest Virginia. We intend to keep it that way, especially if we can keep \nthe steelworkers employed.\n  I will be relatively brief, and I know the Senator from Indiana is \nwaiting to speak and the Senator from New Mexico. The Senator from New \nMexico has spoken. If I know his practice, he may speak again. There \nmay be some additional occasion.\n  We have had a very grave time in the steel industry with the loss of \njobs. This is a relatively modest proposal. It is a loan guarantee \nproposal, and the borrowers have to provide collateral. The borrowers \nhave to pay the fees.\n  I believe this program can be administered in a way that the loan \nguarantees will not be called into play. That, of course, is a \nspeculative matter. The reality of the situation is, if the companies \ncannot borrow commercially and have to have a loan guarantee, there is \nsome element of risk. But I believe that is a fair proposition.\n  The loan guarantee has been structured in a way to provide for \ncollateral; that is, assets will have to be put up by the borrowing \ncompanies. Collateral means to fall back on if the borrower defaults; \nthe collateral can be used to satisfy the loan.\n  The payment of fees is another provision to save the Government of \nthe United States costs. The situation has been recognized by the House \nof Representatives when it voted in overwhelming numbers, close to 290 \nvotes, in favor of the steel quota bill; less than half of that in \nopposition.\n  I have pressed legislation over the years which would provide for an \nequitable remedy to stop dumped goods from coming into the United \nStates. In the early 1980s I had a legislative proposal to provide for \ninjunctive relief, where the injured party could go into court and get \nrelief within the course of a few weeks instead of many months or even \nyears, which we now have under the procedures of the International \nTrade Commission. That legislation is pending now. It has been revised \nto provide for duties instead of injunctive relief to be GATT \nconsistent.\n  I believe the companion provision here offered by Senator Domenici on \nloan guarantees for the oil and gas industry is solid, especially for \nthe small producers who have had a very difficult time.\n  Years ago, my father had a used oil field supply business in Russell, \nKS. It really was a junkyard. At that time I had some experience with \nthe small producers in the oil patch. I know that they have difficult \ntimes, too, and that this loan guarantee program makes sense there as \nwell.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana for awaiting my recognition here. I \nthank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for his very persuasive \nremarks. This is a major industry in both of our States. We both share \na commitment to dealing with this issue. So I appreciate your \nleadership very much, I say to Senator Specter.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee Act. I would like to begin by commending our colleague, \nSenator Byrd, who had to leave for just a brief period of time for \nother pressing matters. I commend him for adopting an approach that is \nnot just good for West Virginia, not just good for the steel industry, \nbut good for the Nation.\n  Senator Byrd's dedication to doing what is right for America, and not \njust the narrower parochial concerns, was evidenced very clearly in the \ncolloquy we heard between Senator Domenici and Senator Byrd in which \nSenator Byrd was going to accommodate the national interests in \nallowing a supplemental appropriations bill to go forward at a time our \nNation was involved in military action abroad. That is indicative of \nhis lengthy record of national leadership.\n  As further evidence that the approach favored by Senator Byrd and \nSenator Domenici, and others of my colleagues, is the correct approach, \nI am pleased to identify several Governors who have written to endorse \nthis legislation. The list will demonstrate that it has broad regional \nsupport from the East to the West, from the North to the South. Not \nonly my own Governor of the State of Indiana, but the Governor of \nMaryland, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Governor of Illinois, the \nGovernor of West Virginia, the Governor of Iowa, the Governor of Utah, \nand the Governor of South Carolina have written to express their \nstrong, unequivocal support for taking immediate action to address this \nvery critical situation.\n\n  Likewise, I urge that this bill be passed expeditiously and without \namendment. We have a crisis on our hands. It is very important that we \nnot get bogged down in other extraneous matters but that we move this \nlegislation forward unencumbered.\n  I sometimes wonder what citizens think when they view us at our work \nhere. We have prerogatives, of course. We have rights, of course. But \nit is important at this time, with the situation in the oil and gas \nindustry, with the situation in the steel industry, that we move this \nbill forward cleanly and expeditiously and, I for one would hope, \nwithout amendment.\n  I know something about this issue, having served as Governor of my \nState for 8 years and now in the Senate. Indiana happens to be the \nlargest steel-producing State in the United States of America, \nproducing more tons of steel than any of our 49 sister States. We \ncurrently have approximately 30,000 working men and women employed in \nthe steel industry in Indiana. These are good-quality jobs, with high \nwages, high benefits, the kind of employment around which you can raise \nand support a family and a decent quality of life.\n  Many communities in our State, particularly in northwest Indiana, are \ndependent upon the health and vigor of this industry for their very \nlivelihoods. The last 20 years or so have not always been good times \nfor the steel industry across our State or across our country. In my \nState alone, over the last 20 years we have seen tens of thousands of \njobs disappear. Our market share has shrunk. Perhaps some of this was \ninevitable, but perhaps some was not.\n  There was a point in time when the industry had to acknowledge its \nfair share of the blame for the state of affairs. They perhaps had been \ntoo complacent, had not made the investment in the latest technology \nand equipment to be world-class competitive. But those days and those \narguments no longer apply.\n  This industry and the workers who labor within it have invested \nhundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, in the very \nlatest kinds of equipment, the latest technology. If you\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\ntour the steel mills across our State, and elsewhere, they are state of \nthe art, world class, world competitive. We are in a position today \nwhere we can produce steel of the highest quality, at an \ninternationally competitive price, if it is fair competition.\n  But, as we all know, since last year the competition has been \nanything but fair. Given the collapse of currencies across Southeast \nAsia, many of those countries were desperate--desperate to export their \nsteel and to gain hard currency under any terms, in any circumstances. \nA flood of illegal--and I stress ``illegal''--imports began to come \nacross our shores.\n  Just this week, our Government has indicated that Japan has been \ninvolved in illegal trade practices. And there were other countries \ncited for this activity before that. This is just the latest evidence \nof the kind of unfair and illegal trade competition we have been facing \nsince at least last year.\n  The consequences have been very damaging. We have had several \ncompanies go out of business, thousands of jobs lost; and once these \ncompanies shut their doors and close down, once their jobs are lost, in \nall likelihood they will be permanent losses to our economy, with \nconsequences to these families and these communities that go way beyond \nthe economic toll.\n\n  This legislation is a balanced approach to dealing with this problem. \nIt is fair to taxpayers, because the costs are offset with reductions \nelsewhere. It requires the loans to be repaid in only 6 and a half \nyears, which is a relatively short period of time for major loans of \nthis nature. There is a panel established to scrutinize every loan \nbefore it is given to make sure that the recipients are creditworthy \nand, in fact, that the taxpayers will be ultimately repaid.\n  Before closing, I will say just a couple more words about this bill \nbecause, as I mentioned, the consequences are national. In my own mind, \nthey deal with trade and other industries as well. I personally believe \nthat free and fair trade and competition is good for our country. It is \ngood for consumers--with higher-quality, lower-cost goods at their \ndisposal. It is good for our economy, because it forces us to be \ncompetitive and productive. In the long run, it leads to the most \nefficient allocation of resources.\n  But when trade is illegal, when other countries undertake steps that \nare not fair, are not just, and, any economist would say, in the long \nrun do not lead to an efficient allocation of resources or a good deal \nfor consumers or working men and women in this country, that is the \nkind of thing where we must take a stand.\n  If I am to go back to the citizens of my State and argue why free \ntrade is in our best interest, it must go hand in hand with vigorous \nenforcement of current law and helping those industries that have been \ntargeted by illegal activity. I emphasize that the pernicious effects \nof this illegal dumping will last a long time after the dumping has \nstopped.\n  Many of our companies have been permanently weakened. If we do not \ntake these steps to allow them to get back on their feet, to allow them \nto overcome the consequences of this sort of illegal activity, who can \nsay who will be next? Quite possibly, one of our foreign competitors \nwill say: I'll pay a few fines in the short run, bear that short-run \ncost to permanently, in the long run, weaken American competitors.\n  That is not right. This loan guarantee program will allow these \ncompanies that have been harmed by this illegal activity to get back on \ntheir feet, to regain their competitive standing, so that we will have \nfree and fair competition moving forward.\n  So, in conclusion, this is a bill of national consequence, not just \nto any one State or region; its interests go way beyond the steel and \nnatural gas and oil industries to affect literally the long-term well-\nbeing and competitiveness of the American economy as a whole. That is \nwhy I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation, to do it \nnow, and to do it without amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for your patience, your time. I thank \nSenator Domenici for his leadership on this issue, and many others as \nwell.\n  I am now pleased to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the first time I have had a \nchance to say this on the floor, but while you were in the House \nserving in various positions, there was a Senator here with the same \nlast name as the junior Senator from Indiana--Birch Bayh. He sat right \nover there.\n  Many a time we were on the floor arguing, debating, sometimes \nagreeing, sometimes disagreeing. So he can read it in the Record, I say \nto my good friend, former Senator Birch Bayh, he did a great job in \nproducing such a son. He was always so proud of him, telling me about \nhim. I am very pleased I have a chance to serve with him. I look \nforward to that, because I think he has a marvelous, level head, and \nvery good common sense. I say that as if that is an exceptional quality \naround here. I didn't mean to say that. If that is what I said, it is \nOK.\n  Mr. BAYH. The Senator could not have given me higher praise, Mr. \nPresident. For that, I am personally and eternally grateful. It has \nbeen a privilege for not only me but for my family to serve with you. \nYou have always been a man of decency, courage and honesty. For that, \nwe are very grateful. I look forward to serving with you for many \nyears. On behalf of both my father and myself, I thank you for your \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to put the word out, \nDemocrat or Republican, whoever has amendments, this bill is subject to \namendment. Senator Byrd has expressed the desire that we try to keep it \nto germane amendments, but that is not the rule. It is up to Senators. \nI am here on the floor. While many may think I don't have to eat, \nbecause other Senators are slimmer than I, and could probably go \nwithout lunch more often, I would like to be working. I hope we have \nsomething to do. I urge that people get their amendments to the floor \nand start discussing them. There are a number of them that we want to \ntalk about, with Senators Gramm and Nickles, whenever they are prepared \nto discuss items with us.\n  I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I do have a few \nminutes I could use up with some comments about oil and gas, this bill, \nbut I truly ask, if there are no Senators that want to offer amendments \nor speak, I will send word to the leader that we should have a recess \nfor a few minutes to see if we can get some amendments to the floor. In \nany event, somebody will be here one way or another waiting.\n  Before I finish and ask that my request for a quorum call be \nannounced, I note the presence of the junior Senator from Alabama. I \nwonder if he would want to comment on something.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to comment on the bill, but if we could \nhave a few minutes for a quorum call, that would be good.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You may have as much time as you like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Senator \nDomenici is managing the time. Are we ready to hear a statement from \nSenator Sessions and waiting on an amendment to be offered?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are no time limits, I say to the Majority Leader. \nWe were waiting for amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I encourage Senators who are working on amendments to come \nto the floor. I know of two or three amendments that are being \nprepared. Perhaps one of them could go ahead and be offered. There is \nat least one that would be pretty simple. It would be to strike the \nemergency provisions. So it doesn't take a lot of preparation. We could \ngo ahead and continue to make progress.\n  We need to finish this bill today. If we do not get our work done \nduring the daylight hours, we will be here tonight. That is OK, if we \nhave to do it, but if it is not necessary, it would be preferable we \nwork during the day. I know the Senate likes to return to its nocturnal \nhabits, but I hope that will not be the case. If there are two or three \nor four good amendments to be offered, let's bring them out on the \nfloor. Let's have an hour debate, and let's vote. Then let's get to \nfinal passage on this issue.\n  I am glad that Senator Sessions is here and Senator Domenici. I know \nwe\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\nall need to get a bite to eat. If we could keep this moving along, I \nthink it would save us some time tonight. I thank our colleagues for \ntheir cooperation.\n  I will go and make a call to Senators that I know have amendments. I \nurge them to come on out and have the amendments offered, and then we \ncould make some progress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished leader. I am trying very hard \nto stay here and do my part, and I hope Senators will heed his \nadmonition. We would like to finish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think we need to make a couple of things \nclear today about the bill before us and why it is so important to so \nmany people.\n  First, I am a strong supporter of free trade, trade that is free and \nfair. I believe this bill is completely consistent with those basic \nprinciples. But while we engage in free and fair trade, many countries \nin the rest of the world do not abide by those same principles. We have \ntrade laws to address this, but, as the distinguished Chair knows, they \nare slow to address the kind of serious economic injury that faces many \ncompanies and communities in America.\n  We can't afford to lose more industries to illegal trade practices, \nparticularly the two we propose to offer short-term support to today: \noil and gas and steel.\n  Second, I believe this is a reasonable response to a terrible crisis \nthat threatens more than just companies but whole communities across \nAmerica. This bill does not propose quotas. Indeed, it is GATT legal, \nand it is intended to provide only a short-term loan guarantee.\n  This is not some radical idea. Federal loan guarantees are used every \nday in the farm industry, the housing industry, the small business \ncommunity, and for foreign countries. So let's be clear about how \nanathema this is to our free trade principles, because we do this all \nthe time.\n  Third, this program is not a Federal handout or Federal grant or \nFederal award or Federal subsidy which Congress provides daily and, I \nmight add, to millions of companies and organizations and industries in \nthis country. It is a short-term loan guarantee program that provides \nthat every dime--yes, every dime--is paid back. Contrary to some \nrepresentations, the risk of the default is not that great, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office. Based on these calculations of \ncost, however, the program has also been completely offset.\n  Finally, I think it needs to be reemphasized that this program is not \ngoing to solve long-term problems that may face some companies in this \nindustry. That is not what this is about. It is about trying to \nminimize the serious economic side effects that illegal trade practices \nhave exacted on several companies in the steel industries. If this \nprogram helps one company get through this tough time until our trade \nlaws address these illegal practices, and if it saves one community in \nAmerica, it will be worth it.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe Americans deserve to be treated fairly--and \nnot inordinately suffer the consequences of our inability to minimize \nand protect against continuous and systematic illegal trade practices \nof other countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this short-term loan guarantee \nprogram, and I thank the Senators from West Virginia and New Mexico for \ntheir leadership in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior \nSenator from Alabama as we support this piece of legislation that I \nbelieve will help the American steel industry. It is not an industry \nthat has stuck its head in the sand, that has failed to modernize, that \nis not competitive. The steel industry has gone through very difficult \ntimes and has, in fact, been able to make itself competitive and is \nable to sell steel products in this country cheaper than foreign \nimports can be sold here. That is good for America because it means \nthat Americans are working to produce that steel. It is an important \nthing for this country.\n  I really want to say that I have visited Gulf State Steel in Gadsden, \nAlabama, where my wife grew up. It is the largest employer there, 1,800 \nor so people. I have visited there at least three times and I felt the \nfire in that furnace. I met with the people who work there. They are \nproducing steel at world class competitive prices, and they are \ncontinuing to get better. They are going to continue to get better. But \nwe have had this circumstance of a crisis around the world in foreign \ncountries, desperate for American dollars, and they have sold their \nsteel here below cost.\n  You may say, well, that helps the automobile industry, or whatever. \nMaybe you could make that argument. It is an economic argument that \npeople like to make. But I suggest, and believe strongly, that what is \nhappening is we have a potential in this period of dumping to destroy \nsignificant segments of our steel industry, which will in the future, \nand soon, be competitive again. Do you see what happened? Through these \ncut-rate imports, sold below cost, it can sink companies like Gulf \nState Steel. They are struggling to survive. Many of these people have \nbeen working at that steel mill for many, many years. Some of them are \nchildren of people who worked there. If they weren't competitive, OK; \nbut they have been competitive. They have made the needed changes, and \nthis short-term dumping has the ability to sink those companies. This \nloan program, I believe, will deal with that.\n\n  There is no doubt that dumping has occurred and that it has \nmaterially injured this industry. There is no doubt that the Clinton \nadministration knew that illegal dumping was occurring, and they failed \nto take the kind of decisive action that would have ended the problem \nmonths ago. So I am offering my support for this bill, which will take \na modest step toward helping steel companies and small oil and gas \ncompanies who have been victimized by illegal dumping.\n  The Department of Commerce has determined that illegal dumping of \nsteel into the U.S. market began in 1997. During the fourth quarter of \n1997, there were 7 million tons of steel imported. But within a year, \nthat number had totaled 11 million tons, which is a 55 percent \nincrease. Is that explained because of some technical breakthrough by \nforeign competitors that reduced their costs? Did American steel \ncompanies who have been on the cutting edge of efficient production \nsuddenly revert to outdated production methods? Did U.S. steelworkers, \nwho produce more steel per worker than any other in the world, lose \ntheir edge? The answer is no.\n  U.S. steelworkers and companies did not lose a share of the market \nbecause of inefficiency or a sudden improvement in the competitors' \nefficiency. The steel that came into our market was below production \ncost prices because countries like Russia, Brazil, Japan and Indonesia \nwere subject to a currency crisis and needed U.S. dollars. Because the \nadministration had a history of not enforcing these trade laws, \nsometimes as a back doorway to implement foreign policy goals, our \noverseas competitors saw an opportunity to dump steel and get this hard \ncurrency. Unfortunately, our foreign policy goals came at the expense \nof steelworkers and their families. Despite repeated calls from \nCongress, including myself, there has been an insufficient response to \ndate.\n  Even in the face of indisputable evidence that dumping was occurring, \nwe have not stopped the wave of illegal imports flooding our shores. In \nNovember of 1998, the U.S. International Trade Commission, an \nindependent commission that examines illegal trade practices, \ndetermined that dumping as defined in that agreement was in fact \noccurring. It was not until 4 months later, and over a year after the \nproblem was first identified, the Department of Commerce finally began \nto enforce\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\ntrade laws and placed a tariff, a preliminary dumping margin, on steel \nimported for Brazil and Japan in February of 1999. This enforcement \naction was narrowly focused and left out some of the biggest countries, \nsuch as Russia, which were found to be dumping steel on the U.S. \nmarket. Adding insult to injury, the Secretary of Commerce entered into \na suspension agreement with Russia. The practical effect of this was to \nend the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission's \ntrade investigations of Russia. It did nothing to discourage future \ndumping by Russia or any other country. In fact, the suspension \nagreement may have actually rewarded Russia for its illegal trade \npractices by sending the stark message that there is no adverse \nconsequences for committing or attempting to commit trade crimes \nagainst the United States. The worst that may happen if you commit \ntrade crimes against the U.S., under this climate, is a polite request \nthrough a suspension agreement to please stop.\n\n  The administration's actions have been too little too late. The \nsuspension agreement should be viewed as an ineffective method. This \naction will undoubtedly lead to additional dumping by other countries. \nThousands of good jobs in this country have already been lost. The \npattern of poor action and inaction taken by this administration will \nundoubtedly set groundwork for future job losses and create a crisis \nthat we need to be concerned about.\n  The United States must not sit idly by and allow its economic \nstrength to be damaged by consistent, unfair trade practices. We must \nrespond to that. In Alabama, there are a number of steel companies that \nhave been injured. Gulf State Steel, as I mentioned, in Gadsden has \nbeen directly impacted by imports. As a result, employees and families \nhave been faced with increasing uncertainty about the future of their \nvery facility. The production methods used and the caliber of the \nworkforce at Gulf State and other steel plants--many of them are in \nAlabama--make this industry one of the most efficient in the world. \nAlabama steelworkers can compete effectively with other countries in \nthe United States and indeed throughout the world. The current \nfinancial problems faced by our domestic steel makers are not the \nresult of poor management, outdated equipment, or an underskilled \nworkforce; rather, it is the direct consequences of illegal dumping of \nforeign imports into the United States. If Gulf State Steel was to \ncease operations as a result of illegal dumping, it would force \ndismissal of nearly 2,000 workers. According to an economic impact \nstudy conducted by Auburn University, the economic impact of a plant \nclosing would be staggering to Etowah County, which has already seen \none plant close of 1,300 people. Direct job losses would exceed 1,800 \nworkers. Indirect job losses would total 3,020. Statewide job losses \nwould total 4,820, and the overall economic impact on Etowah County \nwould exceed $300 million. This is just one example of the crisis \ndozens of steel companies now face throughout the United States.\n  The steel, oil and gas loan bill we are considering today is a modest \nsolution to assist these companies that have been already injured by \nillegal trade practices.\n  It is not a handout. It is not corporate welfare. It is a loan \nprogram designed to give these companies which might otherwise be faced \nwith bankruptcy--some are faced with bankruptcy right now--an \nopportunity to recover the damages they have suffered at the hands of \nunfair trade practices.\n  While this bill would authorize a highly qualified board to offer \nheavily secured loans to the distressed owing up to $1 billion, it will \nnot cost $1 billion. The Congressional Budget Office has put the total \ncost at $247 million. The Congressional Budget Office takes into \naccount the fact that some companies which might receive loans have \nbeen damaged beyond the point of recovery, which could result in some \ndefaults. But the cost of inaction is much greater. In Etowah County \nalone, Auburn University's economic study put the cost of bankruptcy \nfor just this one steel company at over $300 million. This figure \ndoesn't even account for the tremendous social costs associated with \nthe loss of jobs and income to families employed by this company.\n  I want to say I support free trade. I do not believe in providing \nunjustified economic assistance to companies. I don't believe in \nerecting unwise and unjustified trade barriers.\n  This bill would not hurt free trade. It would instead provide modest \nassistance to the companies and their employees who have been injured \nby the rampant proliferation of illegal trade practices that we have \npermitted to occur, and that this administration has permitted to occur \ntoo long.\n  I believe that we have a situation much akin to maybe people on the \nedge of water, a body of water. The water doesn't reach their level, \nand they have been able to survive and live for a long time. But a \ngiant wave comes along one time, and the wave hits them with such an \nimpact that they are knocked down and they are destroyed. We have had a \nwave of illegal imports. It has been declared by an agency to be \nillegal. That wave that hit our country has destabilized and undermined \nthe strength of a number of different steel companies and, therefore, \njeopardized the jobs of many Americans and incomes to the country.\n  When you are in bankruptcy, it is hard to get a loan. It is hard to \nget financing if you are in bankruptcy, or on the verge of it. So this \nwould allow these companies to get this income to continue to operate.\n  Once we end the dumping, we are going to be back to a circumstance in \nwhich they can continue to operate and make a profit, as they were \nbefore this occurred.\n  I believe it is justified.\n  I see the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who has worked \nso hard, and Senator Domenici and others. I am pleased to support him \nin this effort. I believe that somehow, some way, when this thing is \nover, we will have been able to provide some assistance to these \ncompanies to enable them to survive and continue to be productive \ncontributors to our Nation's economy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I also thank the very \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, for his comments and \nfor his work on this bill. I thank, as well, Mr. Shelby, the senior \nSenator from Alabama, for his support and for the work that he has \ncontributed to this legislation.\n  I feel very good about having their support. They are both very able \nSenators, and they are utilizing their talents in the best interests of \nthe Nation in supporting this legislation.\n  American steelworkers earn their daily bread by the sweat of their \nbrow. That is in accordance with the edict that was placed upon man \nwhen God evicted Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Steelworkers are \nearning their daily bread by the sweat of their brow amid the glow of \nproductive glass furnaces filled with molten steel. American fortunes \nwere built on their backs. Their collective might forged a national \ndefense and a national economy second to none.\n  Today, after almost 20 years of downsizing and rightsizing and \nmodernizing, just 160,000 steelworkers are employed in state-of-the-art \nAmerican steel mills, compared to some 400,000 --400,000--in 1980. The \nindustry, which retooled to adapt to international market changes, is \nnow a world class--a world class--competitor, even while adhering to \nhigh U.S. safety, labor, and environmental standards. But the ranks of \nAmerican steelworkers, it appears, are in danger of future cuts that \ncould undermine their ability to support U.S. priorities.\n  This situation is not, as some would have us believe, due to a \nfailure of the steel industry to economize or to increase efficiency. \nAmerica's steel industry serves as a model in the art of modernizing to \nenhance competitive prowess. America's steel producers have sacrificed, \nthey have trimmed, and they have automated, investing nearly $60 \nbillion in the process. In return, they have been forced to compete on \na playing field that is tilted--tilted--by the weight of the unfair and \nillegal trade practices of foreign competitors.\n  Last year, a record 41\\1/2\\ million tons of cheap and illegally \ndumped steel\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nflooded the U.S. market. Piles of this foreign-made, below-cost steel \namassed at our ports. It drove U.S. producers to drop prices, to impose \nlayoffs, to shut down furnaces, and to slow down production.\n  Those cold mounds of steel represented an 83-percent increase in the \namount of steel imported into this country--83 percent over the 23 \nmillion tons, on average, imported in each of the previous 8 years.\n  Contrary to some reports, this Congress was notified of signs of a \npotential flood of both legal and illegal steel imports in January \n1998. I, in conjunction with the Senate steel caucus leadership, have \nworked during this year and a half to lay a foundation that would \nprovide meaningful help to the U.S. steel industry. The chairman of \nthat steel caucus is Senator Specter, and the ranking member, or vice \nchairman, is my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Jay Rockefeller. \nI have joined the Senate steel caucus in writing numerous letters to \nthe administration and in holding hearings and discussions to provide \ntestimony about the impact of the crisis.\n  I commend Mr. Specter and my colleague, Mr. Rockefeller, on the work \nthat they have done.\n  Although prices for steel have been dropping below domestic \nmanufacturers' costs to produce due to the flood of imports, the U.S. \nmarket still offers an outlet for surpluses generated by very sharply \ndepressed demand in Asia and elsewhere. A poor market is better than no \nmarket, so rather than idle their own furnaces and mills, foreign \nexporters are flooding the U.S. market. The United States was the \nprincipal destination in 1998 for Japanese-finished steel mill exports \nthat were diverted from the depressed Asian market--to the tune of 4.2 \nmillion tons of the 4.7 million tons that Japan had exported to Asia \njust 1 year earlier.\n  In 1996, Japan exported just 18,190 net tons of hot-rolled sheet \nsteel to the United States each month, on average, a modest increase \nover 1995. But, in 1997, that figure of 18,000 net tons rose to 43,095 \nnet tons each month, on average.  From January through September 1998, \nthat average monthly figure had skyrocketed to 192,812 net tons. Over \nthe same period, however, the value of each ton of Japanese hot-rolled \nsheet steel fell, from $460 a ton in 1995, to $409 in 1996, to $367 in \n1997, to $295 a ton in 1998. At the same time, Japan's domestic market \nremains virtually closed to foreign steel, allowing Japanese steel \nmills to command unusually high prices at home.\n\n  A similar story can be told in the case of Russian hot-rolled sheet \nsteel. In 1995, the average monthly import volume was 46,661 tons. In \n1996, that figure had climbed to 67,587 tons per month. In 1997, it was \n165,268 tons per month, and from January through September 1998, the \naverage monthly import volume of Russian hot-rolled sheet and plate-in-\ncoil steel was 286,311 tons. At the same time, the price per ton fell \nfrom $316 in 1995 to just $240 in 1998. That is a lot of cheap steel to \nabsorb, and that is just one particular type of steel product.\n  Our government's response to this threat was to handle cheating--\ncheating--foreign competitors with kid gloves due to concerns that the \neconomies of those foreign nations have been in distress.\n  Now, who pays our way here? Who pays the fare for our trip from \nSophia, WV, to Washington, DC? Who pays the fare from Arkansas to \nWashington, DC? Who pays the fare from Kansas, for those who represent \nKansas in the Congress, to Washington, DC? Not those foreign \ncompetitors, I can assure you, as far as I am concerned. They don't pay \nour way. They don't pay our fare. They don't pay us. We are not on \ntheir payroll. The people of West Virginia send me here, and the road \nthat leads to Washington leads back home.\n  I am going to be first, last, and always interested in the people of \nour own Nation who look to us for leadership, look to us to help them \nwith their problems--not the foreign competitors.\n  The argument has been made that caution must be exercised so as not \nto push these teetering economies over the edge. I understand concerns \nabout the intertwined economies of an increasingly global marketplace, \nbut my heart will not bleed for cheaters. My heart aches for those \nAmerican men and women who have worked and sacrificed and followed the \nrules, only to have their futures and the futures of their families, \ntheir communities, and their steel industry thrown into question.\n  The illegal dumping of steel on American shores is real. It is not \nimaginary. It is not something we are just dreaming about. It is not \nsomething we are seeing visions about. It is real. The crisis does \nexist.\n  Our domestic steel industry has been seeking remedy through \nantidumping and countervailing trade cases. The Commerce Department has \nruled on or is investigating cases against Japan, Russia, Brazil, South \nKorea, France, Italy, India, and Indonesia. On June 11, just last \nFriday, the International Trade Commission, by a 6-0 ruling, found that \nimports of dumped hot rolled steel from Japan are ``materially injuring \nor threatening material injury'' to the U.S. steel industry.\n  Based on this determination, duties will be retroactively applied to \nimports from Japan that enter the United States after February, 19, \n1999, but the international trade system established to help domestic \nmanufacturers recover from trade-induced damage has thus far failed our \nsteelmakers. The process is too painfully slow.\n  When I was a boy I read a book, ``The Slow Train Through Arkansas.'' \nWe are talking about a slow process here, and it has failed our \nsteelmakers. The process is too painfully slow to avert long-term \nfinancial disaster for many U.S. steel mills.\n  One of the opponents to this bill said the other day: Well we have a \nprocess here.\n  Yes, we have a process. I am saying it is too painfully slow to avert \nlong-term financial disaster for many U.S. steel mills.\n  That is why we have come to the floor with this bill, this provision \nthat will help in the short-term. Damage must be done before a case can \neven be filed. Now, that is the process; damage must be done before a \ncase can even be filed, and the investigation and the adjudication \ntakes months.\n  Even if our steel companies succeed in getting our trade laws to \nsupport them by levying tariffs on unfair competitors or otherwise \nreducing their attempts at undercutting our domestic market, these \nsteel mills will not receive any of those tariffs to make up for their \nlosses or to help out their workers. The damage has been done. The \ndamage has been done.\n  At best, they will get an eventual reduction of illegal imports that \nwill allow them to compete in their own country, at least until some \nother nation decides to flood our markets. It is not fair. It is not \nright. It is not right for our steel industry. It is not right for our \nsteelworkers. It is not fair to our steelworkers. Nor will communities \nthat are hard hit by layoffs and threats of layoffs receive any direct \ncompensation from the tariffs that are paid by illegal dumping. The \ndamage has been done.\n  The little community of Weirton has been hard hit. The Weirton Steel \nCompany employed 14,000 men and women a few years ago; today, it is \ndown under 5,000. The Weirton Steel Company is the lifeblood of \nWeirton, WV. Without it, the community would be dead, dead, dead!\n  There are other communities. But these communities, as I say, that \nare hard hit by layoffs--and there have been additional layoffs at \nWeirton; 800 steelworkers laid off since last November because of this \nillegal dumping of below-cost steel into American ports by those \nforeign countries that wave their nose at the trade laws. Communities \nhard hit by layoffs and threats of layoffs will not receive any direct \ncompensation from the tariffs paid by illegal dumpers. Now, that is the \nprocess. They say, well, let the process work.\n\n  The recent years of uncertainty that deterred people from buying \nhouses, buying cars, buying anything they might have to finance longer \nthan their job might last, no one can make up for those kinds of losses \nthat ripple through a community, affecting jobs, affecting lives that \nare directly linked to a steel mill paycheck.\n  This crisis may not be abating, as some would have us believe. \nForeign steel markets are not yet rebounding to their previous levels, \nand oversupply remains very high. Nearly all of the recent import \ndeclines are due to antidumping cases against just three countries. \nHistorically, such cases have\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\neventually caused increased imports from other exporters and for other \nsteel products. We have seen that in this instance, as well.\n  When the Commerce Department investigates import surges of a \nparticular type of steel from a single source, that exporter \ntemporarily cleans up his act. You see, he gets religion fast. He \ncleans up his act with regard to that particular type of steel. But he \nmakes up for it. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is \ndoing in that case. While he cleans up that act, he makes up for it by \nflooding the U.S. market with a different steel product that is not \nunder investigation, or another nation steps in to fill the opening \nprovided by tariffs placed on a foreign competitor.\n  So no sooner is one dog leashed than another dog is on the attack. \nFor many months, manufacturers and steelworkers lobbied and protested \nand cried: ``Help me, Cassius, or I sink!''\n  They protested and tried every conceivable approach to draw the U.S. \nGovernment's attention to their plight, and their pleas were met by \ndawdling and disbelief.\n  We cannot afford to continue hemming and hawing, as the fires die \ndown in the blast furnaces at Weirton, WV, or in Illinois or Indiana or \nMissouri or Alabama or Pennsylvania or Ohio. This is an emergency. That \nis why it was put into an emergency appropriations bill. It requires \nurgent action. We have responded to emergencies in other industries and \nin other nations; why can we not respond to a critical situation in our \nown steel industry?\n  Do you remember the story of Joseph and Mary, who went from Nazareth \nup to Judea to pay their taxes? They went to Bethlehem. Their baby was \nborn and wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger. Why was it \nlaid in a manger? Because there was no room at the inn. There was no \nroom for the baby at the inn. It had to be laid in a manger because \nthere was no room for Joseph and Mary and the baby at the inn. No room \nat the inn. So to the steelworkers, there is no room for the \nsteelworkers at the inn, no room at the inn.\n  This crisis cannot be merely dismissed as a West Virginia matter, as \nsome sought to do earlier. I know the word went around, well, this is \njust to help workers in West Virginia; this is just to help Senator \nByrd from West Virginia. That is not the case. That is not the case.\n  So this crisis cannot merely be dismissed as a West Virginia matter. \nThis is a national matter. It affects Kentucky. It affects Virginia. \nWhen one industry hurts in this country, the whole country hurts. When \nsteelworkers are thrown out of jobs, there is a great ripple effect. \nWhen jobs are lost in Indiana and Illinois and West Virginia, it hurts \nin Kentucky. It hurts in Virginia. This is a national matter involving \nan industry that stretches across the Nation.\n\n  When you see those television pictures of the tanks in the Balkans, \nthose tanks are not made of pasteboard. They are not made of nylon. \nThey are not made of plastic. They are made of steel. I know what it is \nto weld that steel, having welded in the shipyards in World War II. It \nwas this mighty country with its steel mills and its experienced \nsteelworkers and its efficient steel companies that made the ships to \ncarry the manpower and the weaponry to Europe in World War I and in \nWorld War II. Let another war come. We will send tanks of pasteboard?\n  The ill effects that have been visited upon this industry loom in \nUtah, Illinois, Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama, \nCalifornia, and other States. It touches the lives of all Americans. \nJust read the newspapers and the trade publications from around the \nNation.\n  Bankruptcy looms for Gadsden, AL, based Gulf States Steel. Last \nmonth, Laclede Steel shut down its Alton, IL, pipe and tube plant, \nputting 200 employees out of work because of high levels of imports.\n  In April, FirstMiss, a Pennsylvania steel producer of high-grade \nspecialty steel, announced plans to shut down, putting 140 people out \nof work.\n  These are Americans. These are people of flesh and blood, just as you \nand I are flesh and blood.\n  Geneva Steel Company of Vineyard, UT, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy \nin February, citing the surge in steel imports as the cause of its \nfinancial distress. Geneva Steel employs roughly 2,400 workers in Utah \nmaking hot-rolled and plate steel. In December 1998, Geneva officials \nhad conceded that they would be unable to make January's interest \npayments on senior notes.\n  Bethlehem Steel officials announced in January that the steel import \ncrisis caused them to decide to close two plants--in Washington, PA, \nand Massillon, OH--and eliminate a total of 540 jobs. Not surprisingly, \nno buyer could be found for the Massillon mill, given the poor market \nprospects.\n  In November 1998, Bethlehem Steel temporarily shut down facilities in \nBurns Harbor, IN, and Steelton, PA; it cut back shifts at facilities in \nSparrows Point, PA, and idled production lines in Coatsville, PA, that \nemployed 1,000 people, all because of unfair, illegal competition from \nimported steel, and unfair competition from foreign countries.\n  The Scriptures say that charity begins at home. We don't want \ncharity. We simply want a fair, level field so the American \nsteelworkers, whose efficiency is as great or greater than that of any \nother workers in the world, can make their way, can earn by the sweat \nof their brow their daily bread.\n  I have been in the Senate 41 years. I have never turned my back on \nany other State or any category of people in this country who are hard \nup and who are out of work and who need help in order to earn their \nbread by the sweat of their brow.\n  Whether it is in my State or not, if it is somewhere else in America \nthat an industry, that the farmers need help, that the farmers need \nloans, that the homebuilders need loans, I am here to help, always have \nbeen. I do not say it does not help my people. I do not say that. The \nchain is as strong as its weakest link. I say help them if it is on the \nwest coast, if it is on the east coast, if it is in the North or the \nSouth--wherever. If it is America, count me in.\n  In November, LTV officials announced that the company would \npermanently close some operations at their Cleveland Works facility, \neliminating 320 jobs, because, in part, of dumped imports. The previous \nmonth, LTV had temporarily laid off an additional 320 workers on a \ndifferent production line. U.S. Steel also cut back operations in \nNovember, laying off several hundred of the 850 workers at the \nFairless, Pennsylvania, plant. These are not West Virginia plants, but \nif it hurts Pennsylvania; it hurts me; it hurts West Virginia.\n  National Steel announced the idling a blast furnace producing 1.1 \nmillion tons of iron at its Great Lakes Division last October, reducing \nthe steelmaking capacity there by 25 to 30 percent. Last September, \nCalifornia Steel Industries reported that it had lost 15 to 20 percent \nof its sales volume, and had reduced production operations \nproportionally. Also last September, Illinois-based Acme Metals, \nIncorporated, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, halting \nproduction at a new, $370 million slab caster designed to take \nadvantage of its high-quality blast furnace operations while linking it \nto low-cost, mini-mill style casting and rolling equipment. So much for \nmodernizing to remain competitive! We have done it. The steel industry \nhas done it. They have modernized the steel mills. The lesson steel \nmakers have learned is that their investment decisions to remain modern \nand efficient can be undercut at any time by foreign producers driven \nby their own interests, or subsidized by their own governments, to \nincrease their market share by driving under the domestic competition.\n  I could go on, but I think I have made my point. These American steel \ncompanies are suffering not only from the kind of depressed export \nmarket that has led the administration and this Congress to provide \nemergency relief to our Nation's farmers, but also from unfair, below-\ncost imports that are squeezing our steel industry out of our domestic \nmarket. Why is it this Congress can so readily support funding for \ndirect low-cost loans to farmers--and I am for that--in order to help \nthem survive the tough times, but some Members balk at providing loan \nguarantees to allow an equally critical industry--one that is necessary \nto maintain a robust defense as well as a robust economy--to obtain \nmarket rate loans to restructure debt and tough out a battle against \ndepressed\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nmarkets and unfair competition? I confess that I simply do not \nunderstand this logic.\n  Help the farmers. We have heard that cry from the steeple tops, and \nmy vote has been there. I do not have large farms in West Virginia, but \nwhen the call comes to help the farmers, my vote has been there. I have \nnever opposed help for all the farmers.\n  I have been on the Appropriations Committee 41 years, Mr. President. \nYou do not find me opposing aid to farmers just because West Virginia \ndoes not have big farms. Why provide loans and grants for foreign \ngovernments? What is the logic in the U.S. Government providing loans, \ndirect loans in many instances, guaranteed loans and grants to people \nin foreign lands, foreign governments? Why help them, when there is no \nroom at the inn for American steelworkers?\n  Think of it. I would be ashamed--ashamed--to deny our own people when \nwe do not deny foreign governments. I have a list of the direct loans. \nI have a list of the guaranteed loans. I have a list of the outstanding \nloans to foreign governments. And then a Senator will stand in this \nChamber and vote against guaranteed loans for an American industry, the \nsteel industry, steelworkers, steel families. I know some Senators do \nnot like to hear it, but listen to me. If you do not hear me, you will \nhear from them, the people for whom there is no room at the inn.\n  Opponents of this loan guarantee program would have us believe that \nthis is an excessively costly solution to a nonexistent problem. It is \nneither. The loan guarantee program outlined in this bill would provide \nqualified steel producers access to loans through the private market \nthat are guaranteed by the federal government in the same way that the \nfederal government now guarantees loans made to homebuilders, farmers, \neven foreign governments. These guarantees are needed because banks, \nseeing the same flood of low-priced imported steel, are not willing to \nmake loans or restructure existing debt when their collateral--the \nsteel made and sold by the borrowers--is so devalued. both the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, \nacting under the credit reform provisions of the Budget Enforcement \nAct, have calculated the budget authority estimates of this program at \nonly $140 million, reflective of the fairly low risk of default and the \nvalue of the potential collateral to be offered. This cost, as has been \nstated time and again, is fully offset.\n  The steel loan guarantee program will be established and administered \nby a distinguished board of directors--namely, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Commerce, who \nwill serve as chairman of the board. This board will be given \nflexibility to determine the percentage of the federal guarantee, the \nappropriate collateral, as well as the loan amounts and interest rates.\n  This board will disburse loans of not less than $25 million, subject \nto a waiver, and not more than $250 million to any one company, and the \ntotal amount of all guarantees will not exceed $1 billion. As the loans \nare paid off, funds will become available for additional lending. All \nloans, however, must be repaid within 6 years, with interest.\n  This loan guarantee program is GATT-legal. We are still playing fair. \nWe are not subsidizing our steel industry. We are not undermining \nsomeone else's domestic steel industry by dumping steel at below \nproduction cots. This program would operate within the international \ntrade rules.\n  This emergency loan guarantee program is an important tool to help \nthese companies deal with the immediate effects of this crisis as they \npursue their legal cases and as other legislative remedies are being \nconsidered. By itself, this program will not solve this crisis, but it \nis needed to ensure that these companies can make it through some very \ntough times and keep their employees--our fellow citizens--working.\n  Which of you, the Scriptures say, if your son asks for bread, will \ngive him a stone? Which of you, being a father, if your son asks for \nfish, will give him a serpent? Which of you, if your son asks for an \negg, will give him a scorpion?\n  When I say to Senators, these steelworkers are our fellow Americans, \nour fellow citizens, they are asking for the opportunity to earn their \ndaily bread, in the sweat of their brow, are we going to give them a \nstone?\n  So, what do we have to lose here by ensuring that funding is \navailable for a crisis that our own Department of Commerce verifies is \nupon us? If the money is not needed, not one red cent will be dispersed \nfrom the Treasury. But if we do not act, and steel companies start to \ngo under, you can bet that we will not be able to act quickly enough to \nsave some of those companies, some of those jobs, and some of those \nsteel towns that will be pulled under by the rip current of our failure \nto respond.\n  It cost us at most $140 million to act decisively now to avert a \ncrisis that is within our shores. Our failure to act will surely cost \nus much more as a nation. I speak not only of the tangible costs of \ninaction--in increased unemployment, cuts in services, and bank losses, \nin addition to increased spending for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, \nhousing assistance, child care assistance, community adjustment \nassistance, worker adjustment assistance, and so forth, but also of the \nintangible costs. What does it mean if we let our steel industry fail? \nWhat does it mean if we allow it to be sliced away mill by mill by mill \nuntil only the biggest survive? What does it mean for our future to \nhave another critical defense component delivered from a ship arriving \nfrom distant shores? Ships from distant shores will bring the steel. \nCan our space launch capacity be held hostage to specialty materials \nand components produced overseas? Can a new stealth bomber still be \nproduced without a foreign partner?\n  What does it mean when we let trade theory or consideration for \nforeign trading partners allow us to tie our own hands and let foreign \ncompetitors unfairly or illegally pull the rug out from under American \ncitizens? Should American steelworkers and their families go on \nunemployment or even welfare in order to allow foreign steelworkers to \nretain their jobs? I do not think so.\n  I think our people should come first, as far as I am concerned. This \ncountry has been very charitable to the rest of the world. This Nation \nhas helped other nations when disasters came upon them. This Nation has \nhelped other nations to rebuild after destructive wars. But we should \nnot ask this Nation to give up its industries and ship those industries \noverseas. We should not ask our steelworkers to give up their jobs in \norder that steelworkers somewhere else, thousands of miles away, across \nthe deep waters, may have their jobs.\n  The people who send us here place a trust in us. Those who send us \nhere can bring us back home. They ought to bring us home if we do not \nlisten to their pleas. They place a trust in us that we will stand for \nissues important to them, their lives, and their livelihood.\n  I cannot, in good conscience, turn my back on America's steelworkers, \njust as I cannot turn my back on the oil and gas workers. And I cannot \nturn my back on the farmers in this country. But I hope that each of \nyou will not turn your back on our steelworkers. The time will come \nwhen you may come to my door, saying: I need your help. I may have that \nrollcall on how you voted when the steelworkers needed your help, when \ntheir families needed your help in order that they might have bread to \neat, clothes to wear, and the other necessities of life. Let's not \nforget we have to help one another.\n  The questions for every Member of Congress are these: do we care if \nwe have a domestic steel industry? Does it matter? Or should we throw \nin the towel and allow foreign competitors to chip away at our steel \nindustry until we are forced to depend on foreign steelmakers for our \nevery steel need in the next century? Let us not dither. Let us not \nbelieve there is no problem here. Let us not play politics.\n  Let's leave philosophy to Socrates and to Plato and the other great \nphilosophers. Let's tend to things closer to home. Let us act. I urge \nthe adoption of this legislation.\n  My colleague, my friend, Pete Domenici, who is on the floor at the \nmoment, who represents the great State of New Mexico, will speak for \noil and gas. I fully support him--fully support him. What affects his \noil and gas\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nindustries affects me and my people, affects West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I first say to our colleagues that Senator \nNickles and I, who are on the other side of this issue, have been at \nthe Finance Committee where we have been holding a hearing on Larry \nSummers, who has been nominated to be Secretary of the Treasury. As a \nresult, it has taken until now for us to get the opportunity to \nparticipate. Because this is the most significant confirmation since \neither one of us has been on the Finance Committee, we did not have the \nluxury to miss that hearing. So if we have inconvenienced our \ncolleagues by being late, I apologize.\n  I also say that one of the things that is always hard about our \nbusiness--and our business is a noble business; it is American \ndemocracy at work--is that you do not get to choose your allies.  If I \nhad an opportunity to choose my allies based on their ability and \nknowledge and persuasiveness, I would never undertake any battle where \nI did not have Senator Byrd and Senator Domenici on my side. The \nproblem is that when the Lord handed out ability, He did not distribute \nbasic philosophy and values and also a reading of the facts in the same \nway He distributed ability, at least from this Senator's own point of \nview.\n\n  I find myself, which happens from time to time and never creates \nhappiness on my part when it does, fundamentally disagreeing with two \nof our most able Members and two Members of the Senate for whom I have \na deep affection and a deep respect.\n  What I would like to do today is the following: I would like to try \nto outline the changes that I believe should be made in the bill. Let \nme make it clear that I am not for this bill. I see this as harkening \nback to another day, the days of the Carter administration, where we \nwere basically trying to engage in industrial policy. I will talk more \nabout that in a minute.\n  But if we are going to pass the bill, there are some things we should \ndo--and I hope we will do--that could dramatically improve the bill. So \nwhat I would like to do today is talk about those amendments and try, \nfor the convenience of our colleagues, to outline the amendments that I \nsee that we would present today.\n  I can't speak for any other Member of the Senate. There may be \nothers, besides Senator Nickles and I, who have been working on these \namendments together, who would want to come over and offer amendments. \nBut to sort of give an outline, I would like to go through and outline \nwhat I think is wrong with the bill in terms of what could be improved \nby amendment. I would like to talk about each of those amendments and \ntry to explain why they make sense so everybody would sort of get the \nlay of the land of the battlefield that we are likely to contest today \nand vote on today.\n  I would then like to try to talk about the problem in the steel \nindustry, because Senator Byrd has spoken with such passion and \nconviction that, if you are going to oppose what he is trying to do, \nyou have an obligation to explain why you disagree. So I will try to at \nleast give you the view through the lens that I have in looking at this \nproblem as to where I am coming from and why I think as I do.\n  Then it would be my proposal to either offer the amendments that I \nhave outlined and simply have them there so anyone could debate them \nor, if Senator Nickles comes over, then we could go back and forth. But \nit is not my objective to try to delay the process. It is pretty clear \nwhat I would like to at least have the Senate make a decision about \ntoday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I need to get consent on behalf of the leader. It will \ntake 30 seconds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nbe agreed to en bloc and that the bill, as thus amended, be considered \nas original text for the purpose of further amendment, provided further \nthat no points of order will have been waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now that I have the floor, I wonder if my friend will \nengage in a little discussion with me for a moment. I think the \napproach you have just spoken of will be a good one for the Senate.\n  I am somewhat familiar--I will be more familiar when you are finished \nwith your discussion of your four points--with what kind of amendments \nyou are seeking. I believe it is possible we could sit down with \nSenator Byrd and work on all of those amendments. Some of us have been \nthinking about some of those amendments, even without you offering \nthem; and some of them make eminent good sense to me.\n  So if you will do that, if you will discuss them, I am certain that \nunless there are other Senators beyond you and Senator Nickles, what \nyou are talking about, even if we do not agree, we are not going to be \nhere late tonight on those, if we can get them done. The question is, \nare there others? And we don't know about that. There may be; there may \nnot be.\n\n  It may be that we cannot vote on some of these because of some other \nmatters that are beyond our control. But I do not think we need time at \n10 tonight to debate the ones you are talking about. We will understand \nthem very soon, and we will start working with you and see what we can \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank Senator Domenici and say, in complying with his \nwishes, that what I will do is simply go through and talk about four \nareas that I think we need to work on to improve the bill. Then I want \nto talk a little bit about the underlying amendment and about steel and \nabout my different perspective on the problem than Senator Byrd has.\n  First of all, this bill has an emergency designation in it. What does \nthat mean? What it means is this bill will be exempt, because of that \nemergency designation, from the budget caps that we set out in law and \nthat we reinforced when we adopted the budget this year. To the degree \nto which that emergency designation allows us to spend beyond the cap, \nthat expenditure will take money away from the budget surplus, every \npenny of which is Social Security trust fund money.\n  The way the bill is written, it is written in such a way that it does \nmake some effort to try to deal with the cost of the program. In doing \nso, it is not effective, because it doesn't lower the spending caps to \npay for this bill.\n  My first objection--without getting into all of the delicacies of the \nbudget which aren't really important to this--is the following: We have \na surplus today in terms of the books of the Government. But we do not \nreally have a surplus in the sense that if we had to keep our books \nlike the private sector does, where we had to take into account all the \nliabilities that we are incurring by guaranteeing Social Security \nbenefits in the future, if we had to use what accountants call \n``accrual accounting,'' we would be running a huge deficit. It creates \na problem because now, as virtually everybody in America, I hope, \nknows, we are collecting more in Social Security taxes than we are \nspending on Social Security, so we are running a surplus and the Social \nSecurity trust fund would tend to grow as a result of that surplus.\n  But much to my distress, and I believe it would be distressing to the \nAmerican people, if everybody understood it, it seems like weekly we \nspend more money, every penny of which comes out of Social Security, so \nthat effectively we are plundering Social Security to pay for other \nprograms.\n  Now, you can argue the merits or the demerits of this loan program. I \nwill tend to argue the demerits. But even if you thought this program \nhad great merit, I think it is bad policy, and wrong, to take the money \nout of Social Security to pay for it.\n  So the first effort that Senator Nickles and I will undertake is that \nthere is a budget point of order in the budget against any emergency \ndesignation for non-defense discretionary spending, when that \ndiscretionary spending would, in this case, take money out of Social \nSecurity.\n  So the first thing we intend to do, or at least we intend at some \npoint during this process, is to raise that budget point of order to \nstrike the emergency designation out of this bill.\n  Let me make two points about that. No. 1, it won't kill the bill. \nWhat it will\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nsay is: You have to pay for the bill, because every penny you spend on \nthese loan guarantees is money that you are not going to have to spend \non something else. If we do not strike the emergency designation, then \nthe money we spend on the loan guarantees will basically come out of \nSocial Security; and since we have on several occasions, and will \nagain, be debating whether or not to put the Social Security money in a \nso-called lockbox, I can't, in good conscience, keep voting to say we \nare putting it in a lockbox when we keep turning around and spending \nit.\n  I have a little bit of trouble taking a position one day that we are \nprotecting Social Security money and, a day or two later, supporting \nspending it.\n  So the first issue we need to deal with is the issue of whether we \nshould eliminate any possibility that this money would come out of \nSocial Security. We can do that by raising the point of order that the \nbill has an emergency designation, and if that is successful, or if an \nagreement should be reached to simply take the emergency designation \nout, then any money this bill spends is money under the spending caps \nthat can't be spent on anything else.\n  So if we are successful there, what we will have done is, for all \nthose who believe this bill is a very good idea, or even a good idea, \nwe will have set up a situation where it has to be paid for. I believe \nthat is prudent public policy, and I think it should be done.\n  The second amendment we would be offering is an amendment to change \nthe makeup of the board that will be making the loans. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, and anybody else who is following this debate, that the \nreason these loan guarantees cost money is that we don't expect some of \nthe loans to be repaid. The whole reason this loan guarantee package \ncosts money--the reason we expect it to cost $140 million--well, that \nis the steel number. One of the reasons we expect this program, in \ntotal, to cost $270 million over the next 2 years is that we expect \nmany of these loans not to be paid back.\n  That recognition leads to three changes we want to make in these \nloans, and they are the other three amendments.\n  No. 1, we don't think these loans ought to be made by the Secretary \nof Labor and the Secretary of Commerce. We believe we should have a \nboard that is made up of people who have expertise in finance and who \ncan guarantee two things: One, that we maximize the chances that the \ntaxpayer will be paid back--I don't know how anybody can object to \nthat--and, two, to the maximum extent we can, that we take politics out \nof the decisionmaking.\n  So a proposal we will make will be a proposal to change the board \nthat will end up making the loan and overseeing the credit transaction, \noverseeing the payment of the loans when they are due, and the \ncollection of the principal and interest. Rather than having the \nSecretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce, we would propose to \nhave the chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank and the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and then have them, \ntogether with the Secretary of the Treasury, giving us a three-person \nboard, all of whom will have expertise in finance and loans and \ninvestments.\n  So that we can try to achieve two objectives, both of which are \nimportant: No. 1, try to make the loans in such a way that we maximize \nthe chances that they are going to be paid back, because that saves the \ntaxpayers money. Secondly, to the maximum extent possible, we don't \nwant politics to play a role in who gets these loans if you want them \nmade. It is one thing to say they should be made, but it is another \nthing, I think, to set up a structure where we are almost guaranteeing \nthat the announcements of these loans will be political announcements \nrather than financial decisions that are made where the board \nrepresents, in a fiduciary way, the interest of the American taxpayer.\n  So the second amendment we will undertake will be to change the \nmakeup of the board to go to Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Bank, as the effective chairman of the board; and then we will \nhave the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nSecretary of the Treasury serving on the board. I think by doing that \nwe will maximize the chances of achieving our objective of maximum \nfiscal responsibility and minimum politics.\n  A third amendment we will offer is an amendment having to do with the \nmaximum guarantee of a loan. It is virtually unheard of for the \nGovernment to guarantee 100 percent of the loan, because by \nguaranteeing 100 percent of the loan, we take any risk away from the \nlender. If the lender is not responsible for any portion of the loan, \nthe lender has no effective monetary interest in trying to see that the \nborrower has the ability to pay it back--has both the capacity and the \nwill. In virtually every program in the Federal Government that I am \naware of, loan guarantees are such that the Government does take on \nsome of the risk in order to encourage lenders to lend, but it always--\nin virtually every case--leaves the lender with some residual risk, to \ntry to encourage them to be responsible.\n\n  The proposal we will make is that no loan will ever be guaranteed for \nmore than 80 percent, so that anybody who is making this loan will have \nto incur a risk of 20 percent. Needless to say, if you are making a $10 \nmillion loan and you are going to have to eat $2 million of it if it is \nnot paid back, you are going to be a lot more judicious in making the \nloan than if somebody else is going to absorb the entire $10 million of \nloss if it is not paid back.\n  So I think this is simply a good Government amendment. Again, if you \nbelieve these loans should be made, then they should be made in a way \nthat doesn't take money from Social Security, which has an oversight \nboard made up of people who have fiduciary responsibility, and who have \nthe expertise and knowledge related to it, and who won't be political; \nand, finally, the loans themselves should be such that the actual \nlender has some stake in the loan being paid back.\n  The fourth amendment we will offer today will be an amendment aimed \nat the minimum loan level. For some reason--and I don't understand it--\nthe authors of this amendment have put a minimum on the amount of loan \nthat could be made. The minimum is quite large.\n  So the net result of that, it seems to me, would be to tilt the \nlending toward specific would-be borrowers and to arbitrarily take \nloans away from small companies that might qualify but that might not \nbe either willing or able to borrow the minimum amount.\n  So the fourth amendment we propose offering today would be an \namendment that says we will strike the minimum amount and then we will \nlet the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Board \ndecide, based on the applications that are available, who has the best \ncreditworthiness, not who would be the biggest borrower.\n  So those are the four issues that, it seems to me, there should be \nrelatively little debate about.\n  No. 1, don't take the money out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  No. 2, appoint a board of people who know something about lending and \nwho will be good stewards of the taxpayers' money and who won't play \npolitics in making the loans.\n  No. 3, don't guarantee 100 percent of the loan.\n  When a bank is making a loan, require them to undertake some of the \nrisk. After all, they are going to get the benefits of the interest \npayments.\n  We propose not guaranteeing more than 80 percent of any loans. The \nadditional advantage of that is that we could lend more money. If you \nthink this lending is a good idea, then I don't see how you could be \nagainst spreading it more widely.\n  Finally, we strike the provision of the bill that sets the minimum \namount, since there is no logic to saying that we will not lend to \nsmall business.\n  I mean, if there is any modern entity that has taken on the same \npolitical appeal that Thomas Jefferson's independent farmer had in \n1800, it is a small independent businessperson.\n  If you think making these loans is a good idea, how can it make any \nsense to deny those loans to small business?\n  Those are the four amendments that we would like to deal with today. \nThere are other amendments we are\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nlooking at, but these four are so clear-cut and so necessary that I \nwanted to put them out on the table early this afternoon.\n  It is my understanding that perhaps Senator Domenici and Senator Byrd \nwould want to sit down and talk about these. I think the sooner we can \ndo that, the sooner we can start moving.\n  Finally, I want to respond to Senator Byrd on the steel issue in \nexplaining how I see it so differently.\n  It is an interesting thing to me. The longer I live, the more I \ndiscover that when people disagree with you, there are almost two \nreasons. There is generally one of two reasons why they do, and \nsometimes both reasons. One is they have a different lens through which \nthey see the world and view things and value things, and that leads to \na different conclusion. Our founders, Jefferson, for example, \nrecognized that good people with good intentions come to different \nconclusions.\n  But a second reason that people often differ is a different \nperception of the facts.\n  Let me just talk for a minute about the facts and why I believe that \nthere will be disappointment if these loans are made, and why it is \nlikely that to the extent that if the problem was real, it probably \nwould not be solved by these loans.\n  Second, I want to argue that at least in terms of steel--I wish I \ncould say the same about oil and gas--but at least in terms of steel I \nbelieve that the crisis is past.\n  Let me try, without holding my colleagues up, to just simply run \nthrough this real quickly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield to me for a moment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I want the Senator to know that more times than \nnot this past year we have been on the floor on the same side. There is \nan interesting result, which I will not share with anybody when that \nhappens.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We always win.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But, on this one, I had a different view. I think \nbefore finishing today, by working with Senator Nickles and Senator \nByrd we can bring this closer to some of the basic concerns.\n  We will not get around to the notion that we will make guaranteed \nloans. In any event, we can't do that, but that would mean we give up \nour fight, I think, on some other issues. We can make the lending of \nthem more objective--make it so there is a little bit of risk the \nborrower takes, and also we will discuss with Senator Byrd the makeup \nof the board. I can't say much about that. We have to talk about it.\n\n  I am going to go to an appropriations meeting, and I will be back in \n15 or 20 minutes. I know Senator Nickles is here. I shared the same \nconcerns with him. I understand he agrees not to offer amendments. We \nwill have a meeting with Senator Byrd, and we will see what we can do \nabout the Senator's amendments. I don't know about other amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  I wonder whether or not Senator Domenici is going to come back and \nspeak. I wonder whether Senator Nickles wants to speak. I wonder if I \ncan address the Senate, after Senator Nickles and Senator Domenici, and \nbe allowed to speak on this bill.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, how long does the \nSenator intend to speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Go ahead of me. I have already spoken once. Let's \nchange the order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. After the Senator from Texas and the Senator from \nOklahoma, I follow?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to explain why I look at the \nsteel problem and see it so differently than our dear colleague from \nWest Virginia.\n  First of all, let me just review the facts that nobody disputes.\n  In 1980, we had 459,000 Americans who were employed in the steel \nindustry. Today, we have 163,000 Americans employed in producing steel. \nSo employment between 1980 and 1997 declined from 459,000 to 163,000 \npeople.\n  If you just looked at that number, you would say, well, domestic \nsteel production must be just falling completely through the floor; \nthat we must have a disaster in the domestic steel industry.\n  The plain truth is that while employment fell from 459,000 \nsteelworkers to 163,000 steelworkers, the production of steel in the \nUnited States actually went up by 56 percent. In fact, on average, \nsince 1980 we have seen about a 9,000-job-a-year decline in the number \nof people working in steel production. Because of technological change, \nwe are using fewer workers to produce more steel.\n  The complaint that is being lodged where it is being demanded first \nthis week that we have the government guarantee loans to the steel \nindustry and then next week where we impose a quota on steel imports \ntriggering a trade war--remember, we have 40 people using steel in jobs \nfor every one person making steel--all of that legislative effort is \ndue to a belief that we lost 10,000 jobs this year in the steel \nindustry. We have lost 9,000 a year every year since 1980.\n  One of the reasons, despite all of this talk about the rush of \nimports and unfair trade practices, that the steel industry has never \nfiled a section 201 claim is in part because of an inability to \ndemonstrate that the problem is imports.\n  In fact, in 1997 when we had the surge in imports, we had the largest \ndomestic steel production in American history. In fact, in 1997 we \nproduced 105 million tons of raw steel, which is an all-time record in \nsteel production.\n  Why did imports surge in 1997 when domestic production was at an all-\ntime high, where in fact some analysts believe that we had overcapacity \nutilization in 1997? What happened was the economy was exploding, for \nwhich we all rejoice. We were creating 7,500 jobs a day, which still \ncontinues to this day. Thank God. As a result, people are buying cars \nat record rates, people are building houses at record rates, and we are \napproaching 70 percent of Americans who own their own homes. They are \nbuying refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers. All of those \nproducts use steel.\n\n  We had a record level of domestic production and a record level of \ndemand. What happened? We imported steel to fill the gap.\n  I think it is also important to note that in 1998, the last year \nwhere we have records, production was still near an all-time record \nwith 102 million tons. In fact, the steel industry earned profits in \n1998 of $1.4 billion.\n  I am not complaining about that. If I could snap my fingers and make \nthose profits $10 billion or $14 billion, I would do it --or $140 \nbillion. I don't have any objection to profits.\n  But the point I want to make is that in this period where the \nargument is being made that steel is collapsing and that we are being \ndrowned by imports, other than on wire rod, no steel company in America \nfiled a 201 complaint about imports producing a loss of business for \nthem, or costing jobs in their industry.\n  When they don't file the 201 complaint, it suggests that they didn't \nhave a case.\n  Here is the point I am making: 9,000 jobs a year have been eliminated \nbecause of technological change where production has grown by 56 \npercent. We are having the greatest economic boom in American history. \nWe are creating 7,500 jobs a day. We have towns, and I'm very grateful \nthat my hometown is one of them, where university students go after \nclass to have a beer, and they have impressment gangs who come around \nand try to drag them off to factories.\n  We are creating 7,500 jobs a day. In the name of 10,000 jobs that \nwere probably lost because of technological change, we are being called \nupon to go back to the 1970s, to the policy of Jimmy Carter, and have \nthe Government start lending money where we are guaranteed in advance \nwe will lose $270 million on the loans upfront. Of course, the default \nwhen Jimmy Carter was President was 77 percent. If we had that kind of \ndefault rate, the loss would be many times the $270 million.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n  We are creating more jobs in a day and a quarter than we are talking \nabout, and we are jeopardizing those jobs by getting Government in \nexactly the kind of situation we are begging the Japanese to get out \nof: Getting America into crony capitalism, where we are trying to \ninstitute industrial policy, where Government is making decisions \ninstead of the credit markets.\n  Second, we are getting ready next week under exactly the same heading \nto debate a provision that would literally start a trade war which \ncould destroy millions of American jobs when there is not hard evidence \nthese jobs have been lost because of imports.\n  Finally, as if all that were not enough, if the problem really \nexisted, it has already been solved. American imports of steel have \ndeclined 28 percent since November of 1998. Russian imported steel is \ndown by 96.6 percent; Japanese steel is down by 74.4 percent; Brazilian \nimports are down by 24.4 percent; and Korean imports are down by 46.8 \npercent. Imports from all countries are down dramatically.\n  Even if this was a problem, as normally happens in these political \ndebates, we are a year late.\n  I am sympathetic to this problem. I am very sympathetic because my \nState is affected by these problems. The point is, we are not going to \nfix these problems by having the Government come in and lend money to \nan industry as it did when Jimmy Carter was President.\n  Some people said the other day that when Jimmy Carter was President, \nwe had to do it because the inflation rate was in double digits and \ninterest rates were at 21\\1/2\\ percent. That is true. But were \ninflation rates in double digits and interest rates 21\\1/2\\ percent \nbecause we had Government trying to run the economy? Isn't that what we \nchanged in the 1980 election?\n  I don't want to go back to the policies of the Carter administration. \nThis is 1999. That is why I am not for this provision. It is not \nbecause I'm not sympathetic to someone who lost a job in the steel \nindustry. If that job was lost due to technological change--and the \nevidence is pretty overwhelming that it was--do we benefit anybody by \nlending money when we know that a substantial default on the loans will \noccur?\n  It seems to me what we need to be doing is to try to promote economic \ngrowth where people can find jobs and, hopefully, better jobs than they \nlost. When you have technological change in one industry that \neliminates jobs and you have new technology in others, that creates \njobs.\n  This is a tough issue. It is always easy and, I think, always \ntempting to try to say if anybody in America loses a job for whatever \nreason that the Government ought to do something about it. I remind my \ncolleagues that in a day and a quarter we create more jobs in the \nprivate sector of the economy with the economic policies of open trade \nand private capital allocation and basic free enterprise; we are \ncreating more jobs in a day and a quarter than anyone is claiming that \nsteel has lost in the last year.\n\n  We have to weigh this point. Isn't it distinctly possible under those \ncircumstances that we could lose more jobs by starting a trade war or \ngetting Government into industrial policy than we will save by doing \nthose two things? Then those jobs might be lost anyway as a result of \ncontinued technological change.\n  It is because I am concerned about working Americans, it is because I \nam concerned about keeping this recovery going, it is because I want to \nkeep creating 7,500 jobs a day that I am not for these loan guarantees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nTexas. I hope his speech is one that all Members of the Senate have \nlistened to. I happen to agree with him, I think this bill is a \nmistake.\n  I spoke on this bill. We only had 5 minutes before we voted on this. \nThe first debate we had on this was actually 10 minutes for the \nproponents, 10 minutes for the opponents. That was the only debate we \nhave had on the floor of the Senate. That was on a motion of cloture. \nFor people who don't know what that is, it is a motion to proceed to \ndebate the bill.\n  I told the proponents of the bill, Senator Byrd and Senator Domenici, \nI will object to the bill; I will debate against it; I will offer \namendments against it. However, I will not filibuster it. If they get \ncloture, they get cloture.\n  They got cloture. I lost. I happen to think I was right on the issue.\n  I will follow through. I said I would amend it. I told Senator Byrd I \nwould not offer a bunch of dilatory amendments. I will not go into \nextraneous matters. I will try to make a bad bill better. I don't think \nthis is a good bill. I don't think it should pass. I don't think it \nshould become law. I will work to see that it doesn't. This is one step \nin the process.\n  Let me say why I think this is a bad bill. I have great respect for \nSenator Byrd and Senator Domenici. They are very effective legislators. \nThey have convinced a lot of people we should move forward. My \ncompliments to them. I don't happen to think they are right on this \nbill.\n  Looking back at loan guarantees, the last time we did this we \nactually ended up having net loan guarantees of $290 million and \ndefaulted on $222 million. That is a default rate of 77 percent. That \nmeans taxpayers had to write a check for $222 million out of a total \nloan guarantee of $290 million. That is a terrible, terrible failure.\n  I will mention a couple of things. That is a failure by my words, but \nit is a failure according to Members of previous administrations.\n  I will just give you a couple of comments:\n\n       Less than a decade later, all 5 loans [talking about steel \n     loans] are in default.\n\n  And the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, in \nan internal memorandum notes:\n\n       By any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to \n     be considered a failure. The program is an excellent example \n     of the folly inherent in industrial policy programs.\n\n  They are exactly right. Other countries do not do this. They believe \nin the private sector. We believe in it. We believe in developing \nprivate capitalism. Let bankers take risks, have investments, have the \nright to succeed and the right to fail.\n  Now we are on the floor of the Senate and we say, wait a minute, not \nin steel or not in oil and gas; those are two vital industries. I agree \nthese are vital industries, but I do not think this bill will help them \none iota. It did not help in 1978 and 1979. It cost taxpayers millions \nof dollars; it was a boondoggle, it was a failure. Why should we repeat \nit? We know better.\n  I am sympathetic when people say we have lost jobs and these are \nreally tough times. I will tell you, it is a lot tougher in the oil \npatch than it is in the steel industry, and I think that is the reason \nSenator Domenici offered his amendment. The oil patch lost 50,000 jobs; \nthe steel industry lost 10,000. But I do not think this is the right \nsolution to help the oil patch. If I did, I would support it. I have \nbeen pretty supportive of the oil patch in my tenure in the Senate, but \nGovernment loan guarantees is not the solution.\n  I have talked to our producers. I have talked to the people. They do \nnot want it, they do not need it, and it will not help to have a \nGovernment loan guarantee. It will not help. That is not the solution.\n  Not everybody in the oil patch and not everybody in the steel \nindustry is losing money. There are 16 big steel companies, 12 of which \nare profitable. A lot of them do not even want it. A lot of them do not \nneed it. What will they do, if one company gets a loan guarantee and \ngets a subsidized low-interest loan, say, at 6 percent and they are \npaying 9 percent? They will say: Wait a minute, we are in a competitive \nfield. How in the world can we allow this company, a competitor, to go \nout and borrow money with the Government guaranteeing it? They get a \nlot better interest rate. We are competing with them. When they are \ndoing it, we had better do it.\n  So we are, in effect, going to give U.S. Steel or Bethlehem Steel a \nloan guarantee? Those are companies that are probably doing fine, and \nthey probably do not want this. I doubt they do. I hope they do not. \nAre they going to let their competitors go in and get a competitive \nadvantage? So maybe there will be a race to grab some of\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nthis money. We should not be exposing taxpayers to that kind of risk.\n  We should not be circumventing the marketplace. We know the Secretary \nof Labor, Alexis Herman, is a great lady. I have great respect for her. \nBut I don't think she knows better than bankers in the United States \nwhether a loan should be made or not; or, for that matter, the \nSecretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Treasury. This bill says \nthey know better, frankly, than all the bankers, all the capitalists in \nthis country. The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury would be making the loans for a billion \nand a half dollars. They are going to guarantee, the Federal \nGovernment, we will back that loan up. If it fails, we will write a \ncheck. That is what this bill does.\n  You cannot say the bill is without cost. It has been estimated the \nbill could cost taxpayers $270 million. That is not an insignificant \namount of money. That is a guess. That is an absolute guess. If we have \ndefault rates like we had 20 years ago, it will be over a billion \ndollars Uncle Sam will be writing a check for. I do not have a great \ndeal of confidence the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Commerce \ncan make the right decisions.\n\n  This bill has a provision that allows the Government to guarantee \nbasically 100 percent of the loan. That doesn't make any sense. When \nyou get into a loan guarantee, most of our Federal programs guarantee \n70 percent, 75 percent, 80 percent, in some cases 90 percent. Almost \nall small business loans are guaranteed at 90 percent or less. This \nbill says there can be 100 percent. What sense does that make?\n  I mentioned that we are going to offer some amendments to make some \nchanges. I am hopeful the sponsors of this legislation will support us \nin an effort to adopt those changes. Let me just go over some of the \namendments I think will make a bad bill less bad. It still will not \nmake it, in my opinion, worthy of passage, but as I told the sponsors, \nI am not going to filibuster the bill indefinitely. I am going to offer \nsome germane amendments.\n  One will be to change the composition of the board. Instead of having \nthe Labor Secretary and the Commerce Secretary and Treasury Secretary \nmake these decisions, the Treasury Secretary would be a member of the \nboard, and he would serve as chairman--in addition the Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission would serve. They would replace \nthe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce.\n  It does a couple of things. It gets politics out of it for a lot of \npurposes. The SEC and the Fed are not as politically in tune as a \nCabinet-level Secretary. I think it offers a little more balanced \nbusiness perspective. I think it would complement the board and make it \na better board. So that would be one amendment. Hopefully, it will be \npassed.\n  Another amendment would be to establish an 80-percent maximum loan \nguarantee. Instead of having a 100-percent loan guarantee, the maximum \nwould be 80 percent. So the Federal Government, if this board says okay \nto a steel company or an oil company, we are going to lend up to $100 \nmillion, the maximum exposure of the Federal Government on that $100 \nmillion loan will be $80 million. That means a private financial \ninstitution which is lending the other $20 million has something at \nrisk, and if it fails, they will lose a little bit of money too. It \nwill make people a little more prudent when they start applying this \nidea of using Government money or Government guarantees. So, hopefully, \nthat will pass.\n  We have another amendment that would strike the minimum loan levels. \nSome people say: Why did you have the board set up? We did not pass \nthis bill. It passed the Senate one time but not with a direct vote. It \nnever went through any authorizing committee. It did not go through the \nBanking Committee in the House or the Senate. No one has looked at it. \nBasically, this has been crafted and it really has not been \nscrutinized. I think we are pulling out some of the deficiencies of the \nbill.\n  One of the deficiencies in the underlying bill says we will have \nminimum loan levels. In steel, the lowest, smallest loan they could \nmake would be $25 million. Small steel companies, don't apply. This is \nfor big steel. In other words, the loan levels in this package--as \ndrafted, would have to be between $25 million and a maximum of $250 \nmillion. That is what the Federal Government guarantees. It would not \nguarantee a $10 million loan or a $5 million loan. We want to strike \nthe minimum levels for both steel and oil and gas.\n  It says, for iron ore, the minimum level was $6 million; oil and gas, \nthe minimum level loan guarantee would be $250,000. I probably have \nmore small producers in my State than any State, with the possible \nexception of Texas, and why in the world would we have a Federal loan \nguarantee program? But, oh, if you can't borrow at least a quarter of a \nmillion dollars, don't apply. Does that make any sense?\n  We have thousands of producers in our State. Frankly, most of our \nwells produce about 2 barrels a day, 2.5 barrels a day. If we are going \nto help people, are we really going to say, you have to be pretty big \nbefore we are going to help you? I don't think that makes sense. So we \nare going to have an amendment to strike the minimum loan levels. I \nthink that would be important.\n\n  One other amendment I hope and expect we will be successful in \npassing, would be to strike the emergency spending designations in the \nbill or make a point of order that emergency spending does not lie. I \nhope, if anybody in this body is going to make statements such as ``we \nwant to protect Social Security, and we don't want to spend those \nSocial Security revenues,'' they better support this amendment. Because \nI want to make sure everybody understands, when we are talking about \nstriking the emergency section, what it means. If you have the \nemergency section in there, it means the budget doesn't apply. It means \nwe are going to add that amount of money to the caps. It means you are \ngoing to be taking that money out of the surplus and, in this case, 100 \npercent of that money is the Social Security surplus. So you are \nraiding the Social Security surplus, raiding the Social Security funds \nin order to be giving loan guarantees to steel and oil and gas.\n  I do not know if that sells in Minnesota, but it doesn't sell in \nOklahoma. It is ludicrous to say we are going to have an emergency \ndesignation on this. An emergency basically means the budget does not \napply. Maybe some people do not want to have a budget.\n  We just passed a big bill for Kosovo. We declared it an emergency. It \nwas a net of $13 billion. We said it was an emergency; the budget cap \ndoesn't apply. Some people say that was wartime, it is understandable, \nand so on, even though we increased the numbers rather significantly. \nThat is one thing. Are we going to do it 2 weeks later and say that now \nwe have an emergency steel loan program; we are going to have to \ndeclare that an emergency? Are we going to have to do that every 2 \nweeks? How many times are we going to declare an emergency? If we are \ngoing to do it every 2 weeks, let's just stop the charade and don't \neven have a budget.\n  Just forget having a budget. It is not necessary. We can just \nappropriate whatever money we want to spend and see how much it is at \nthe end of the year. That, in effect, is what we are doing when we \nrepeatedly declare something an emergency.\n  We are going to make a point of order on the emergency provision, and \nI hope we will be successful. I am going to venture to say on all four \namendments, we will be successful. I expect we will be.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Domenici has communicated to us \nalready he is willing to see if we can work something out on these \namendments. It is vitally important we do so.\n  We do not really believe in this concept of industrial policy where \nthe Federal Government is going to supersede the private sector and \nmake financial decisions. Some countries try that. Communist countries \ntry it. Socialistic countries try it. Frankly, it does not work very \nwell. Look at third world growth rate and see how many jobs they \ncreate. They do not work well.\n  Why would we start doing it? We tried it 20 years ago, and it was a \ndismal failure, a total, complete failure. Basically what they are \nsaying is we want to replace the marketplace with political wisdom. It \nis a serious mistake. Again, my State has had\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\npercentagewise as big a job loss as any, and I still think it would be \na serious mistake.\n  Finally, obviously, big steel has a lot of clout. We are considering \nthis bill, and there is another bill which just went through the \nFinance Committee dealing with section 301. Then there is a bill that \nthe House has already passed dealing with steel quotas. I believe the \nmajority leader said we are going to be voting on that next week. There \nwill be a cloture vote on whether we should take it up. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on cloture and defeat the steel quota bill.\n  Today I asked Mr. Summers, who is the nominee for Secretary of the \nTreasury, what his position is on the bill. In the past, we heard the \nPresident was against it. He said his advisers will be recommending the \nPresident veto it. That is the right position. They should veto it.\n  One has to ask a couple of questions: Do you believe in GATT, the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has made it possible for \nus to have a greater economic activity worldwide? If you believe in it, \nthe steel quota bill is totally, completely inconsistent with GATT. \nTotally. Our trading partners would retaliate.\n  If you think if we pass this steel quotas bill, that it is going to \nprotect steel jobs, it will not, because there will be retaliation. The \nretaliation in many cases will be: We are not going to buy some of your \nother products.\n  You may think we are saving a few steel jobs, but the net result is \nwe are going to lose a lot more jobs throughout the economy--not a few, \na lot more--and maybe even start a real trade war. That is a serious \nmistake. We should not do that.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you believe in free trade, if you believe in \nGATT, if you believe in negotiations--that does not mean we cannot take \nretaliatory action if somebody is dumping. The administration has \nalready imposed antidumping tariffs on Brazil and Japan. There are \nproper avenues to do that. A steel quota is not one, and loan \nguarantees is not one.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendments that Senator Gramm and \nmyself, and I believe Senator McCain, will be offering shortly this \nafternoon. Maybe we can have them agreed to. If not, I hope we will \nhave votes and they will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nfinal passage on this bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to be quick because I know our dear colleague is \nwaiting. When the Senator talked about the minimum, he may have \nmisplaced a decimal point. Under this bill, the minimum loan is $25 \nmillion for steel.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The second thing I want to know, is the Senator aware that \nmining has been added to where the loans can now go to iron ore \ncompanies as well with a $6 million minimum?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did not mention that in my statement. The Senator is \nexactly right. Under the iron ore loan guarantee, the minimum loan is \n$6 million, a maximum loan of $30 million.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I congratulate the Senator. His remarks were excellent. I \nagree with every point he made, and I believe a couple of things are \nimportant. This is not going to be the last one of these we do if we do \nthis one. If we have already expanded this to iron ore, and we have \nsteel and it was expanded in committee to oil and gas, does anybody \ndoubt, if we pass this one, that 2 weeks from now, we are going to be \nback passing another one and another one and another one?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Good point.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The amazing thing is that we are getting the Government \ninvolved in allocating credit at a time when we are creating jobs at a \nrecord rate on net of 7,500 jobs a week.\n  Finally, I ask the Senator if he is aware that in a Los Angeles Times \narticle in March, it pointed out there is expansion in the steel \nindustry in that seven new plants will come on line this year, but each \none of them, very interestingly, will employ 200 or fewer people. What \nis happening is, these small companies, with a small number of \nemployees producing specialized products, are really outcompeting the \nbigger companies.\n  In looking at the assessments by Wall Street, they are bullish on \nsteel in general, and the three companies which have gone bankrupt, \nthey say have gone bankrupt because they are too highly leveraged and \nthey bet on technology that did not pay off.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Senator's comment. I was not aware of \nthe article. I am aware of the fact the steel industry as a whole is \nnot doing all that bad. I mentioned, I believe, in my comments that 12 \nout of 16 of the larger companies are all profitable. Not all \ncompanies, but several companies are profitable.\n  The Senator mentioned seven new plants. I was not aware of that. That \nis an excellent point. I do not think they are clamoring for \nWashington, DC, to give them a loan guarantee. I have not had them \nknocking on my door saying give us a loan guarantee. If they do, I \ncertainly would not want to be an investor. If somebody in the steel \nindustry is knocking on the door saying, we need the Government to give \nus a loan guarantee, that is a bad sign, poor management, and they are \nin serious trouble.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Minnesota, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to both my colleagues, actually \nsometimes coming down and waiting to speak is positive. You get to hear \npeople, as my colleague from Texas said, who see it through different \nlenses, who see it a different way.\n  What I want to do is, first of all, try to bring this debate back to \npeople and talk about it in very personal terms as it affects people in \nmy State of Minnesota. Then I want to speak to what I believe has been \na political economy argument that has been made, and I take sharp \nexception with what my colleagues have had to say.\n  As to Minnesota, believe me, the loan guarantees in this legislation \nwill be much appreciated in my State of Minnesota.\n  My colleagues also mentioned the iron ore mine operations and the \nsteel loan guarantee program sets a $30 million ceiling for iron ore \ncompanies. That is going to be particularly important to the Iron Range \nin northern Minnesota.\n  One hears a lot in the media about the Goldilocks economy we have. I \nheard some of my colleagues talk about this Goldilocks economy and how \ngreat it is; it is a booming economy, we are just humming along. For \nmany of our people in Minnesota, especially on the Iron Range in \nnortheast Minnesota, this Goldilocks economy is much too cold.\n  Already, 10,000 workers have lost their jobs due to a flood of \nillegally dumped imports. This is the worst crisis the steel industry \nhas faced since the mid-1980s when 28,000 people left the Iron Range in \nMinnesota for good. We do not want to let it happen again. That is what \nthis debate is about: people's lives, about whether or not we are going \nto see more broken lives, more broken dreams, more broken \nfamilies. Now, all these statistics that my colleagues have been laying \nout, they affect real people in real communities. The surge of steel \nimports over the past year or so threatens thousands of people in \nnorthern Minnesota because iron ore mining is the mainstay of the Iron \nRange economy.\n\n  I thought what I would do, since we have heard all these abstract \neconomic theories laid out here, is tell you a little bit about the \nIron Range, about the communities, about the people whose future we \nhold in our hands.\n  Let me repeat that. I want to talk about the people and the \ncommunities of the Iron Range, because we hold their future in our \nhands.\n  More than 20,000 jobs in northern Minnesota depend on the iron ore \nindustry, though less than a third of those workers actually work in \nthe mines. The industry purchases over $876 million in goods and \nservices annually from nearly 200 Minnesota communities, and it \ncontributes more than $1 billion annually to our State's economy. The \ntaconite production tax provides nearly $100 million annually for the \nsupport of Iron Range counties, cities, townships, and school \ndistricts, and it provides funding for economic development and \nproperty tax relief as well.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n  Most of this country's iron ore reserves are in the form of low-grade \ntaconite found on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota. There is no shortage \nof taconite. In fact, the Mesabi Range holds about 200 years worth of \npellet reserves. But the challenge has been to continue mining and \nprocessing taconite in a cost-efficient way.\n  I agree with my colleagues when they talk about the importance of \nbeing able to compete. No question about it. Back in the 1980s, the \nindustry was told they had to modernize in order to compete with \nforeign steel. And they did just that. They played by the rules of the \ngame. They poured $1 billion of investment into modernization, and they \nshed 10,000 jobs. As a result, the industry now has only 6,000 workers, \nand this industry is the world's most efficient.\n  With the boom in the national economy, some people in the Iron Range \nwere starting to hope that they could dig their way out of the debt \nthey piled up during the 1980s, make an addition to their house, save \nsome money for their kids' college education, and attend to some of the \nneeds they had too long neglected. But sadly, because of the steel \ncrisis, many of those dreams have proved to be short-lived.\n  In 1998, LTV Steel Mining Company in Hoyt Lakes, MN, was forced to \nreduce its fourth quarter production by 360,000 tons, an equivalent of \n66 jobs. Employees at US-Minntac in Mt. Iron, MN, were forced to make \nconcessions last fall to prevent 133 layoffs. Employees at EVTAC in \nEveleth, MN, now have nothing left to give. EVTAC permanently laid off \n168 employees, a quarter of its employees, when it shut down one of its \ntwo pelletizing furnaces last week. EVTAC is fighting hard to stay out \nof Chapter 11. Two other Iron Range taconite facilities, Butler \nTaconite and Reserve Mining Company, both closed under similar \ncircumstances in the mid-1980s. We do not want to go through that \nagain.\n  The workers who were laid off at EVTAC, and workers throughout the \nIron Range, and steelworkers all across the country are all looking to \nus for some help. That is where they should look. This crisis is not \ntheir fault. They were told to modernize and they did. This crisis is \nthe result of illegal dumping. Unless we want to see a repeat of the \n1980s, we must act.\n  Again, this piece of legislation, this loan guarantee is a good first \nstep, but it is only a first step. Soon we are going to be considering \nlegislation introduced by Senator Rockefeller which will provide even \nmore effective relief. I will be joining Senator Rockefeller, and other \nSenators will be joining him, Democrats and Republicans. I heard some \nof my colleagues speak to that legislation, and I want to respond to \nsome of their arguments.\n  It is unfortunate that we are in this difficult situation. We should \nhave acted sooner. U.S. trade laws and the WTO recognize the legitimate \nneed of every country to prevent extraordinary import surges such as \nthis one from destroying its industrial infrastructure and eliminating \nthousands of jobs. Under section 201--let me be bipartisan in my \ncritique--the administration could have imposed the same remedies as \nnow provided in the Rockefeller bill.\n\n  Steelworkers played by the rules when they modernized their industry, \nand steelworkers paid the price for that modernization. They made the \nsacrifice. Steelworkers also played by the rules when they asked for \nSection 201 relief. But they didn't get it. The administration was \nimplored for months to take action under section 201, and it chose not \nto do so. Now foreign steel exporters are the ones breaking the rules.\n  The question is not who is playing by the rules but, rather, which \nrules the administration chooses to apply. Now, my colleagues--as it \nturns out, Republican colleagues, though I am being critical of my \nadministration, a Democratic administration--my colleagues talk about \nhow this crisis is all the result of Adam Smith's invisible hand. But \nthat is not quite the political economy that we are looking at.\n  The administration did not hesitate to slap 100-percent tariffs on \nimports from the EU when a top campaign contributor to both parties, \nCarl Lindner of Chiquita Bananas, had a trade complaint. Lindner's \ndispute with the EU hardly even involves American jobs. It concerns \nbananas grown in Central America. But we were there for them. Now when \nAmerican steelworkers ask for existing trade laws to be applied, \nthey're given short shrift. The message this sends to American \nmanufacturing workers is that they are not a priority.\n  Moreover, this administration went the extra mile, working through \nthe International Monetary Fund, to organize bailouts for Wall Street \ninvestors when their risky investments turned sour in Indonesia, \nBrazil, Korea, Russia and Mexico. But when American steelworkers asked \nfor similar consideration under existing trade rules, they get short \nshrift.\n  So my colleagues come out here on the floor and they say this bill is \nterrible. The government getting involved in any kind of loan \nguarantees? This is the government running the economy.\n  That's hardly the case. When steelworkers say: How about some relief \nfor us, how about some consideration for us under existing trade rules, \nmy colleagues come out here on the floor and they say, this would lead \nto trade wars. This would do damage to Adam Smith's invisible hand. We \ncan't do that.\n  I didn't hear those same colleagues when it came to the IMF \norganizing a bailout for the Wall Street investors when their \ninvestments went bad in Indonesia or Korea or Russia. I didn't hear the \nsame colleagues come out and say: Oh my gosh, we have a government \ninstitution that's involved. When it's these Wall Street interests, it \nis fine. But when the workers ask for some support, it is not so fine.\n  The administration is concerned that limiting imports from Brazil, \nJapan and Russia could hurt their slumping economies. I have some \nsympathy for that argument. We should all be concerned about reviving \ngrowth in these countries. But American steelworkers are not a foreign \naid charity. They should not be asked to pay the ultimate price, to pay \nwith their jobs, for the failure of this administration's foreign \neconomic policy. And I might add--given what some of my colleagues have \nsaid on the other side--I think the failure in foreign economic policy \nis also a failure of the Congress.\n  When the Clinton administration, working through the IMF, helped bail \nout Wall Street investors in Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Korea and \nMexico, it committed public resources. It didn't ask Wall Street to \npick up the tab by itself, even though the major industrial \ninstitutional investors were by far the biggest beneficiaries of the \nbailout. The administration and some of my colleagues on the other side \nare now asking steelworkers to pay a price that they would never ask of \nWall Street.\n  I hope we can pass that Rockefeller legislation next week. I hope the \nWhite House will withdraw its opposition and sign it into law. I heard \nmy colleague from Oklahoma say that he had talked to Secretary Summers \nand he said the administration was going to veto this bill. I hope they \nwill change their mind.\n  I say to the administration, you were there for the big investors \nwhen their investments went sour in some of these other countries. You \nused public money to help bail them out. You ought to have the same \nconcern for steelworkers and working families in our country.\n  But we need to do even more than that. We need to widen our focus a \nlittle bit and address the root causes of this crisis. I heard my \ncolleague from Texas speak about what has gone wrong, and I want to \nquarrel with his interpretation of international political economy. I \nthink we should be working to change the rules of the global economy so \nthat these kind of devastating crises do not keep happening.\n  I am not worried, like my colleagues are, about these loan \nguarantees. They will make a difference to an important industry in our \ncountry and will be important to so many working families. What I am \nworried about is our failure to make some changes in this global \neconomy so we don't keep having these devastating crises happening over \nand over again. I am surprised I have not heard my colleague talk about \nthis at all.\n  The long-term solution to this crisis is restoring economic growth \naround the world. The steel crisis was precipitated by the collapse of \nglobal demand following the Asian crisis, and worsened by the economic \ncrises in Russia\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nand Brazil. Excess steel production is being dumped in the United \nStates because our country is one of the few economies in the world \nthat is growing right now. Only when we have global economic growth, \nonly when this growth revives, will foreign steel producers consume \nmore of their own steel production and find export markets other than \nthe United States.\n  Although the administration claims to be working to revive foreign \ndemand, its actions speak louder than its words. In fact, I believe its \npolicies are marching in the opposite direction. They have tended to \npromote a ``race to the bottom''--a global trade competition that \nrewards those countries that can attract foreign capital by advertising \nthe lowest labor, lowest environmental, and lowest safety standards, \nrather than raising environmental and labor and safety standards \noverseas.\n  When my colleague from Texas talks about the international economy, I \nwill simply say, no wonder we are in trouble with these trade \nagreements that don't make sure there are some environmental standards \nand fair labor standards that other countries have to live up to. What \nyou have is a situation where those countries have a workforce that \ncan't buy anything. There is no demand for what we produce.\n  Those countries tried to export themselves out of the crisis, and our \nworking families are hurt both ways. We are hurt because we can't \nexport to those countries, because the people there don't have any \nmoney to buy. At the same time, we are competing against people who are \nworking under exploitive, grinding labor conditions. This is the race \nto the bottom.\n  Why in the world has this administration not adopted a trade policy \nthat makes much more sense for working people in this country, and for \nworking people in other countries as well? Why, when my colleagues come \nto the floor, do they continue to talk about this international economy \nas if it were a level playing field? We dare not speak about any fair \nlabor standards or environmental standards or any safety standards.\n  Despite recent encouraging economic news, there is compelling \nevidence that something is fundamentally wrong with the world economy. \nFirst, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the global economy \ncannot tolerate ever-increasing inequality among countries and within \ncountries. Policies that lead to the replacement of good-paying union \njobs with jobs that pay subsistence-level wages only contribute to \ngrowing and dangerous imbalances in the global system. Widening \ninequality at home and abroad depresses the consumer demand necessary \nto fuel our economic growth. We need to encourage foreign countries to \nraise their wages and increase demand, so they can consume more of \ntheir own production and stop dumping surplus production on our \nmarkets.\n  Similarly, I believe we must reexamine the orthodox view that export-\nled development is the key to prosperity. Not everyone can rely on \nexport markets for their economic growth. The entry of subsistence-wage \nChina into global competition makes this all too clear. Somebody has to \nbuy all of those exports. For too long the United States has been the \nbuyer of last resort, absorbing excess production from all the export \npowerhouses. While cold war responsibilities obliged us to play that \nrole in the past, we cannot do this forever. If we want to have a \nmanufacturing sector  in our own country, we should aim to make exports \na complement, rather than a substitute, to healthy domestic demand.\n\n  Third, we must come to grips with the related problem of overcapacity \nand excess production. For various reasons, in industry after industry, \ngluts have developed in the world economy. The problem of overcapacity \nis now made worse by the recession and deflation in Asia, Russia, and \nSouth America. We need progrowth, stimulative economic policies to \nrestore some of that lost demand. Simply absorbing excess foreign \nproduction in the U.S. market is not a solution. We cannot indefinitely \nrun record trade deficits that hollow out American industry, put \nAmerican workers out of work, and lead to growing economic inequality.\n  Finally, I believe this administration must rethink its zealous \ncommitment to unfettered capital flows, despite the fact that this is a \ntop priority of the U.S. financial interests. Numerous economists have \nagreed that misguided Treasury, IMF, and OECD promotion of capital \naccount liberalization was an important cause of the Asian crisis. The \nenormous amount of capital sloshing around the globe at lightning speed \ninjects too much instability into the world economy, and it magnifies \nthe dangers of capital flight, which the IMF cites as justification for \nplunging Brazil and other economies into deep recession.\n  Instead of placing a priority on the interests of Wall Street \ninvestors, the Clinton administration and some of my Republican \ncolleagues should look out more for the interests of average Americans, \nsuch as American steelworkers. Its top priority should be Main Street, \nnot Wall Street. It should ignore Wall Street's demands for more IMF \nausterity overseas, which is designed to safeguard Wall Street \ninvestments but ends up creating problems that are later dumped on the \nbacks of American workers. The administration should promote worker \nrights overseas, rather than demanding antilabor changes in foreign \ncountries' labor laws--as it has done for years, to the applause of \nWall Street. And it should promote policies that reduce economic \ninequality overseas by ensuring that the growth is more broad-based and \nless lopsided.\n  By promoting more robust, more balanced growth, stronger unions, and \nmore widely shared prosperity overseas, we can help create enough \nforeign demand so that these countries can consume more of their own \nproduction and stop dumping their excess production on our markets. \nThat is the core problem. Looking out for average working people here \nin the United States and overseas is a win-win proposition.\n  We need a change in policy. Last month, our trade deficit reached \nrecord levels. Without a change in course, I am afraid this \nadministration will simply repeat the mistakes of the late 1970s and \n1980s, when over 350,000 steelworkers lost their jobs and 28,000 \nworkers left the Iron Range for good.\n  This is why I speak on the floor of the Senate, not just to support \nthis loan guarantee legislation today, which we need and which is \nimportant, but also to support the bill Senator Rockefeller will bring \nto the floor next week that I intend to be out here supporting.\n  I am afraid that this administration's solution to the global \neconomic crisis, and I am afraid given what I heard my colleague from \nOklahoma and my colleague from Texas say on the floor of the Senate, \nthat their solution to the global economic crisis will be to ask \nAmericans to continue absorbing more and more imports. Their solution \nwill be to ask--mainly unionized--manufacturing workers to look for \njobs elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, this is no solution at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of \nSenator DeWine. Does he want to speak?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would like to speak for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nto the Senator from Ohio and that I be recognized when he finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I \nwill try to be brief.\n  I rise today to support the bill my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Byrd, have brought to the floor. This \nbill has great significance in my home State, but I think it also has \ngreat significance for this country.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for this bill. Our steel \nindustry today is in trouble. Why? I think as we engage in this debate \nwe need to start at the beginning of the story.\n  To my colleagues who have risen on the floor this afternoon opposed \nto this bill, I would point out one thing that I think their comments \nhave failed to reflect; that is, we are here today because of illegal \nactivity. We are here today because of illegal dumping of\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nsteel into the United States. That is an uncontroverted fact. That is \nwhat the truth is. That is what the finding has been. Steel has been \ndumped repeatedly, month after month after month, and it has been \ndumped illegally. That has been the findings. That is why we are here \ntoday.\n  Last year, U.S. steel producers had to withstand an onslaught of \nillegally imported steel. In 1998, 41 million tons were dumped. That \nrepresented an 83-percent increase of imported steel for the previous 8 \nyears. In other words, if you took the previous 8 years and looked at \nthe amount of imported steel on the average for those 8 years, what you \nwould find is that when we got to 1998, and compared 1998 to the \nprevious 8 years, it went up 83 percent. That is a phenomenal increase \nin the importation of steel. It is no accident. This was clearly \ndumped.\n  Many steel companies are, obviously, reporting financial losses, most \nattributable to the high levels of illegal steel imports. It has been \nestimated that 10,000 Americans--10,000 workers, 10,000 families--have \nalready lost their jobs because of this illegal dumping. The \nIndependent Steelworkers predict job losses as high as 165,000, if \nsteel dumping is not stopped.\n  I introduced a bill. Some of my colleagues in the Senate have \nintroduced other bills--Senator Byrd, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Santorum. It is legislation that we will be taking up \nshortly. I believe it is time for action. All eyes of this country and \nthe world are today on the Senate. The question is, Will we respond to \nthis crisis?\n  Certainly a good first step would be the adoption of the bill before \nus, Senator Byrd's steel emergency loan guarantee program. This loan \nprogram is designed to help troubled steel producers that have been \nhurt by the record levels of illegally imported steel. For many \ncompanies, this program is the only hope they have to keep their mills \nalive and their workers working.\n  Specifically, the program would provide qualified U.S. producers with \naccess to a 2-year $1 billion revolving guarantee loan fund. In order \nto qualify, steel producers would be required to give substantive \nassurances that they would repay the loans.\n  A strong and healthy steel industry is absolutely vital to our \ncountry. It is vital to our national defense. This bill has a lot to do \nwith national defense. It is essential, if we are going to have the \nnational defense we want--if we are going to have the security we want \nin this country--that we always have a vibrant, energetic, tough steel \nindustry. This bill speaks to that issue.\n  This bill also has to do with an even bigger issue; that is, whether \nor not in this country we are going to continue to make things and \nmanufacture things and be producers.\n  There are some people who have been quoted--some people even in this \nadministration who have been quoted--saying things which would give you \nthe impression they really do not care if we produce things anymore, \nthat being a service-driven economy and an information-driven economy \nis enough. While service is good and information is good, and they \nproduce jobs, we still have to produce. We still must be a \nmanufacturing country, if we are going to retain our greatness.\n  Fortunately, today, our steel industry is a highly efficient and \nglobally competitive industry. It wasn't too many years ago that the \ncritics of the steel industry, sometimes very correctly, would \ncriticize the industry. They would say: You are fat, you are flabby, \nyou are not tough enough, you are not lean enough, you have to invest, \nyou have to modernize, and you have to do things differently.\n  As a result of that, and as a result of some very tough times in the \n1970s and 1980s, the steel industry in this country did that. They did \nit. They invested billions of dollars. They modernized. They made the \ntough and the hard decisions that they had to make to be efficient. \nYes, the workers made sacrifices as well. The unions made sacrifices as \nwell. Everyone knew they had to pull together. It was not always easy, \nbut the result is that we have a steel industry today in this country \nthat is better than any steel industry in the world.\n  If you strip away the subsidies by other countries that are \nsubsidizing their steel industries, you will find that we can compete \nwith any company in the world--with any country in the world--in the \nproduction of steel.\n  Yet, despite all of this great effort, despite this modernization, \nour steel producers face a number of unfair trade practices and market \ndistortions that are having devastating impacts in Ohio and other \nsteel-producing States. That is not just Mike DeWine speaking. Those \nare the findings that have been made.\n  I have heard about this crisis firsthand from industry and labor \nleaders. In fact, I have looked into the eyes of steelworkers, whether \nit be in Steubenville, OH, or in Cleveland, OH, or in other places. All \nthey want is a fair chance to compete and a fair chance to recover from \nthe illegal dumping that has already taken place.\n  One of the things I point out is that one of the reasons for this \nbill, despite our other bills that we hope to pass in this session, is \nthey do not in any way stop the illegal dumping that has already taken \nplace, and has taken place for well over a year. So this bill is needed \nto rectify some of the problems that have been created by this illegal \ndumping.\n  Many steel companies are in serious trouble and are in desperate need \nof immediate assistance. The short-term loans that would be provided \nunder this program will provide that very assistance without burdening \ntaxpayers, because if steel plants close, if workers lose their jobs, \ntaxpayers would be forced to pay for unemployment compensation, food \nstamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, Medicare, and on and on and on, \nall of which will certainly exceed the total cost of this program.\n  Again, the steel companies are required to repay the loan within 6 \nyears, provide collateral, and pay a fee to cover the cost of \nadministering the program.\n  I am a free trader. I believe free trade, though, does not exist \nwithout fair trade. Free trade does not mean free to subsidize. Free \ntrade does not mean free to dump. Free trade does not mean free to \ndistort the market. That is exactly what has been taking place month \nafter month after month.\n  Our trade laws are designed to enforce these basic principles. \nHowever, the current steel crisis underscores flaws and weaknesses in \nour current laws. I am, therefore, pleased the majority leader has \nindicated he has reserved time within the next several weeks to deal \nwith many of these other problems, and to look at some of the remedies, \nproposed remedies that I and some of my colleagues have proposed.\n  The House has already acted. I believe it is time for us to act. \nToday we have an opportunity to help an industry that throughout its \nlong and illustrious history has been there for our country, has been \nthere for our national defense. We should pass this bill and commit to \nadopting meaningful legislation to deal with the steel import crisis.\n\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his leadership on this \nbill, Senator Byrd for his tireless efforts, Senator Rockefeller and \nthe other members of the Senate steel caucus who have worked on this \nissue.\n  This bill will help. This bill will save jobs. This is about our \nnational security.\n  I emphasize how important I think it is as our colleagues consider \nthe merits of this bill that they remind themselves of one basic fact: \nWe are in the Senate today to consider this bill because illegal \ndumping took place and it took place month after month after month \nafter month.\n  The steel companies, the steelworkers did nothing wrong; they did \neverything right. They modernized, they made the sacrifices. They want \nthe opportunity to compete. Given that free opportunity, they will not \nonly compete, they will win.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding time to me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Under the order, I am to proceed. I note the presence \nof Senator Rockefeller and I will yield to him in 1 minute.\n  In my case, on behalf of oil patch--not Exon and Texaco; these loans \ndo not apply to them--the question has been asked: Why them? As if the \nUnited States and the Congress of the United States has not helped \nbusinesses that are in bad shape, that are regional or national in \nnature. And I have no complaints about that help.\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\n  Let me suggest that since 1993 we have, under supplemental \nappropriations as an emergency measure, appropriated $12.8 billion for \nagriculture assistance. That is not oil patch. I voted for agriculture \nand I live in a modest agriculture State. I was told that it would \nhelp, so I voted for it.\n  Natural disasters, the kind that you can hardly avoid calling a \ndisaster, but I think oil patch is a disaster. I will explain that \nfurther in my remarks following Senator Rockefeller.\n  Let me talk about natural disasters. People wonder whether emergency \ndesignations are useful in this country. In the same period of time, \n1993 through 1998, we have spent $36.1 billion for natural disasters \nwithout batting an eye. Some of them cost $5 billion.\n  We are concerned about oil patch, especially the small people whose \nbusinesses are right down at rock bottom, and the patch isn't \nflourishing so the bankers are wondering whether they should loan to \nthem. We want them to know we are concerned.\n  I will discuss the numbers. Oil patch, oil rig, oil well drilling, \nand related activities in America have lost more jobs in the past 10 \nyears than any American industry. Our dependence continues to come \ndown. We are starting to close wells off so they cannot ever be used, \nbecause they are too small and too expensive because the price is too \nlow. The companies that work them are going to go broke. We think some \nare viable and banks might look at them and say with this kind of \napproach, although the banks will have to risk something under the new \napproach, we think it might help a few.\n  We have had $36.1 billion in declared emergencies for related damage \nin natural disasters, $12.7 billion for agriculture, and some Senators \nthink it should have been double that already.\n  I have not been called upon to vote on whether that is enough or not. \nI listen when we are presented with problems and I do what I can for a \npart of America's economic sector. That is why I said if we are going \nto help steel--and I think we ought to do that; I have heard some \nwonderful Senators discuss why we should--I thought we ought to say \nsomething to the oil patch of the United States, since the same kinds \nof problems are occurring in Hobbs, NM, Eunice, NM, medium and small \ntowns in Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere, and across the oil patch States \nof this land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, in a sense what we have now is the torch being passed. \nAny number of Senators have described--and I will not, therefore, try \nto repeat any of that--how this whole steel crisis, not to mention the \noil patch crisis, has developed.\n  It started in 1997. In the history of recorded trade statistics, as \nlong as our country has been keeping trade statistics, there has never \nbeen an import surge of the magnitude, in any commodity at any time, as \nthere has been in the last 2 years in steel. It started off with three \ncountries; it is now all over the world.\n  The Secretary of Commerce put out a release saying it is wonderful \nthe steel crisis is over. I wonder where he has been.\n  We should understand that the steel crisis is deep. If you take the \nfirst quarter of 1999, the first 3 months of 1999, and compare that to \nthe worst possible months of the steel crisis, the first quarter of \n1998, last year, the total improvement which the administration keeps \ntrying to talk about--I think they know it is wrong and the \nadministration realized it hasn't done anything about this problem and \nit will be paying a price for it--the total decline from the 1998 first \nquarter to the 1999 first quarter is a total of 5 percent worldwide on \nall steel. That is going from the worst steel statistics in history and \na 5-percent decrease. That could go right back up.\n  The torch has to pass from the administration protecting our national \ntrade laws, protecting free and fair trade, to us. Now we have to do \nsomething about it because they have declined to.\n  I have been to everybody all the way up to the President and Vice \nPresident on a number of occasions. Expressions of interest but no \nresults, no action taken.\n  This affects the lives of my people; it affects the lives of people \nin many States. I hate to see that.\n  I used this analogy on the Finance Committee. Football is a rough \nsport, as is international trade. International trade is a rough sport. \nEverybody is trying to get the advantage of everybody else and \nundersell. In football, you can get hurt--any individual player, a \nlarge or small player. They have rules. That is why we have rules. That \nis why they have referees.\n  If you are a linebacker and you charge through the line and you get \nthrough and you hit the quarterback on the helmet with your elbow, you \nare penalized. You know that beforehand and you may get thrown out of \nthe game for that.\n  If you are inbounds and you are a pass catcher and you run out of \nbounds, that is no good. You jump offside, you get penalized.\n  Everybody knows the rules. The more they play the game, the more they \nknow what the rules are. That is what has kept the integrity of the \ngame, because of its predictability. Secondly, it kept a lot of people \nfrom getting their heads taken off and knees broken. Football is tough \nanyway, as is international trade.\n  So, there are rules. We have rules in international trade too. And we \nset them; the Congress set them and the administration set them in \nprevious years. It is the Trade Act of 1974. It sets out a whole series \nof these rules. The administration keeps saying we are going to abide \nby the rules; we are abiding by the rules; we plan to abide by the \nrules. Of course, they are not. So the torch is passed to us. And there \nare a couple of points there I need to make.\n  The bill is incredibly important. There is also a bill going to be \ntaken up on a cloture vote next week, on steel quotas, which is \nincredibly important. It is very important for my colleagues and their \nstaffs to understand; the vote this afternoon on this excellent bill of \nSenator Byrd and Senator Domenici and the bill next week which deals \nwith imports are totally separate and different; that if you vote for \nthis one, it does not mean it solves the import problem, or if you vote \nfor that one, it doesn't solve the financial problem that this bill \nhelps with. They are separate bills.\n  So anybody who says, I voted today for Byrd-Domenici; therefore, I do \nnot have to worry about next week because we have taken care of the \nproblem, does not understand there are two totally different subjects. \nI cannot make that point strongly enough. This one is about the \nfinances of companies that are going under, giving them a chance at \ncommercial rates, repayable--to go to banks, because they cannot now \nborrow, and to be able to borrow a little bit, to survive a little bit \nlonger--whether it is the steel mill or the oil patch. That is terribly \nimportant for the viability of those industries.\n  Then, equally important, since this bill has nothing to do with the \nimport problem which created all of this--that is what next week's vote \nhas to do with, the problem of the imports and how do we adjust the \nimport problem on a short-term basis to bring some fairness to what we \nlike to call free trade but which is practiced virtually only by us. It \nused to be practiced by Hong Kong. I don't know how they are on it now. \nBut it is practiced by nobody else in the world. So all the steel comes \ninto us: India, up 72 percent; Indonesia, 60-something--it doesn't \nmatter where you go, the numbers are up, because they know, the word is \nout, if you want to dump subsidized or underpriced steel in the United \nStates, they will take it. So it puts people out of work. It does not \nmatter to them. They will go ahead and take it.\n  That is what I call the best way to destroy the possibility of a \nnational coalition for a trading system, which I believe in. I am \nsomebody who has always voted for fast track and somebody who believes \nin engaging the world. I have worked very hard within my own State--\nwhich is not particularly an international State in its viewpoint, \nbeing landlocked in the mountains, so to speak--to make my people \nunderstand the global economy is part of their economy, we are all part \nof each other's economies, and we can sell products to other countries \nand they can invest in West Virginia, and this is all good; so we are \nall part of an international trading system.\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\n  But there have to be rules in that. If you allow the quarterback to \nhave his head given a concussion, it is very important the referee be \nthere. But the referee usually does not have to be there, because \npeople know what the price will be: You will get tossed out of the game \nor you will get a penalty of 15 yards. So all kinds of fair play is \ncarried on on the football field, because people know what the rules \nare.\n\n  Again, the torch is passed to us, and I think we have two duties. One \nis, we have to pass this excellent bill this afternoon. We should have \npassed it much earlier when it was the subject of earlier \nconsideration. Then it got done in, in conference. I am terribly glad \nSenator Byrd, my senior colleague, and Senator Domenici, have combined \nforces to help on this.\n  Frankly, it is important to combine forces sometimes on bills around \nhere, because there are only 16 States that are major producers of \nsteel. I do not know how many States produce oil, but I suspect there \nare not that many. So this is a very good opportunity for us to give \nthose companies a chance to go to the bank, to get some money to be \nable to exist for a few more months or another year or so. It is not \ngoing to do anything about the import problem, which is the real cause \nof the devastating human crisis in steel.\n  So we, as a legislature, as a Congress, have to decide, as the House \nhas already decided by an overwhelming margin, that steel is important \nto America. This is not just a question of West Virginia or Ohio or \nMinnesota or other places; this is a national crisis. Senator Domenici \nhas said, I don't know how many times: When Members on my side of the \naisle--the other side of the aisle--come up to me and say I have this \nmilk support problem, I have this farm support problem, I have this \nfood support problem, I have whatever it is, I am always there. I am \nalways there, because I believe it is as if you built the interstate \nsystem in this country and, because Pennsylvania is bigger than West \nVirginia, you made it four lanes in Pennsylvania but you only made it \ntwo lanes in West Virginia and then it went back to four lanes in Ohio. \nThat would not be very smart. No. 1, it wouldn't fulfill the work of a \nnational defense highway system. No. 2, it would cause massive traffic \njams.\n  So we understand we are all part of each other's destiny. West \nVirginia, insofar as I have been able to determine, has no oceans on \nour boundaries, but we pay taxes to support the Coast Guard. That is as \nit should be, because we have an obligation to each other, as West \nVirginia does to those who use the Coast Guard on coastal areas in \ndifferent parts of the country. So that is part of our compact in \nAmerica. It is part of our contract with each other, that when a region \nneeds help, when an industry needs help, if there is a reason and \npossibility of doing so, you try to do that.\n  This one is particularly good because it helps companies get money \nthey cannot otherwise get. The international trade situation is more \ncomplex and, in the longer run, will probably do more to solve the \nproblem, because it actually deals with the level of imports. It says \nto other nations, we are not going to be Uncle Sucker forever, or, in \nthis case, at least for a period of 3 years. It is not radical. People \nthink, what are we doing this for?\n  What is interesting is that over the years the average foreign \nimports of steel into the United States--over the last 30 years, let's \ntake it--is probably less than 20 percent. Less than 20 percent is \nusually what foreign countries export into this country, what we \ntherefore import into this country; less than 20 percent of all the \nsteel we use comes from other countries. That is the way it has been. \nThat is perfectly acceptable as a figure.\n  Interestingly enough, in the bill coming up next week, that figure \ncan range as high as 23 percent, certainly no lower than 18 or 19 \npercent. It is only for 3 years. But it is a way of saying we in \nAmerica, if we are going to get into this, deeper and deeper into the \ninternational trading system, we really do care about our rules. We \nreally do think about our quarterback's head. We think the chop \nblocking, which can break a young man's knees or legs, is wrong, and \nthere are rules about that. We actually passed those rules in the \nCongress, and the President signed them all in a previous era, and they \napply today, and we all live by them--except that we do not.\n  So, in closing, I want to say these are two distinctly important \ndecisions we are going to be making in separate weeks on separate \nbills. The one today is filled with merit. It is tremendously \nimportant. It is part of the comprehensive solution to the problem.\n  But, then again, the one next week is the one that deals with \nimports, and it is the only one that deals with imports. So we need to \ndo both of those so no Senator thinks that, because that Senator has \nmade a particular vote on one day, he does not have to face up to the \nsame situation on another day, because they are entirely different \nproblems that each bill addresses.\n  This is a matter of high urgency in the part of the country I come \nfrom. I was Governor of West Virginia for 8 years, and I dealt in 1982 \nand 1983 with 21-percent unemployment. That is not a whole lot of fun, \nwhen 1 out of every 5 people you pass does not have work. There is not \na family in West Virginia that is not accustomed to not having work or \nhas not dealt with it.\n  We are on the way back, but we are going to get knocked down if this \nsteel import crisis continues. I do not want that to happen to Ohio. I \ndo not want that to happen to Pennsylvania. I do not want to have that \nhappen to Arkansas, Utah, Texas, or any other State. I do not want that \nto happen. It does not have to happen, and it is not even a budget \nmatter. It is a matter of fair trade, fair play, rules that we have \npassed and by which we should live.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought I had reserved under my UC \nrequest my right to speak, but I was mistaken. As we called on other \npeople, I did not repeat my request. There is no unanimous consent \nagreement recognizing me. I understand the Senator from Arizona wants \nto offer an amendment, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be glad to wait until Senator \nDomenici finishes his remarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have finished my remarks, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 685\n\n  (Purpose: To restrict the spending of any money for these programs \n    until they are authorized by the appropriate Committees and the \n               authorization bill is enacted by Congress)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 685.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 48, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     amount appropriated or made available under this Act to carry \n     out chapter 1 or chapter 2 of this Act shall be available \n     unless it has been authorized explicitly by a provision of an \n     Act (enacted after the date of enactment of this Act) that \n     was contained in a bill reported by the Committee or \n     Committees of the Senate with jurisdiction over proposed \n     legislation relating primarily to the programs described in \n     section 101(c)(2) and 201(c)(2), respectively, under Rule XXV \n     of the Standing Rules of the Senate or the equivalent \n     Committee of the House of Representatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is pretty straightforward. \nIt restricts the expenditure of funds for loan guarantee programs until \nthe appropriate committees have authorized the expenditures for these \nprograms and these authorizations have been approved by the Congress.\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\n  In other words, with this amendment, we carry out what is supposed to \nbe the procedures of the Senate, and that is, before taxpayers' dollars \nare expended, they are authorized.\n  All of my colleagues know that this loan program for steel, oil and \ngas companies has been inserted into the appropriations bill, and it \nhas not gone through the authorizing committee process.\n  The legislation creates an unnecessary and unwarranted loan program \nfor steel, oil and gas industries. Once again, Congress is seizing an \nopportunity to engage in the all-too-common game of pork barrel \npolitics. The bill was originally intended to address the President's \nrequest of $6 billion for the war in Kosovo but quickly became a \nvehicle for a hasty and ill-conceived program to subsidize the steel, \noil and gas industries.\n  The bill creates a $1 billion loan guarantee program to support the \ndomestic steel industry and a $500 million loan guarantee program for \noil and gas companies. These programs will provide loan guarantees of \nup to $250 million for any domestic steel company, $10 million for any \noil and gas company that ``has experienced layoffs, production losses, \nor financial losses.''\n  I do not take lightly the value of these industries to our Nation, \nnor do I disagree that in the case of steel imports, illegal dumping of \nforeign steel has occurred. However, I question the wisdom of creating \nan emergency loan program to subsidize an industry that finds itself in \ntrouble. We set a dangerous precedent by opening the Federal Treasury \nto industries facing economic difficulties.\n  Specifically, I have three problems with this measure. There is no \nneed for these substantial loan programs. The legislation is \nfundamentally flawed, and using the appropriations process to enact \nthis measure circumvents the normal authorization process. These \nelements are common in all three loan programs. I will focus my \ncomments on the steel loan program because I believe it is the driving \nforce behind this matter and the most egregious.\n  First, I seriously question the need to create such a substantial \nloan guarantee program. During today's debate, I am certain my \ncolleagues will forewarn and have forewarned the dire consequences to \nthe steel industry if we fail to enact this legislation. As my \ncolleagues hear these predictions, I ask you to keep a few facts in \nmind.\n  In 1998, the U.S. steel industry produced 102 million tons of steel. \nThis was only slightly below the record of 1997 of 105 million tons, \nmaking it the second highest production year since 1980. This record \nproduction year resulted in earnings of $1.4 billion. Furthermore, 11 \nof the 13 largest steel mills were profitable. These numbers make it \ndifficult for me to understand the need to create a $1 billion loan \nprogram.\n  Even if there were a steel crisis, it is certainly over. Citing \nCommerce Department statistics, the White House recently stated that \nduring the first quarter of 1999, overall steel imports returned to the \ntraditional pre-crisis levels. In fact, imports were down 4 percent in \ncomparison to 1997. Again, the need for this program at this point \neludes me.\n\n  My second concern is that the bill will result in the needless loss \nof taxpayers' funds. Supporters argue that this measure is paid for \nwith budget cuts and administrative fees. They point out the program \nguarantees loans and does not actually lend money. This assertion \nignores the history of such loan programs.\n  In the mid-1970s, the Economic Development Administration operated a \nsimilar program for the steel industry. The result of that program was \ndisastrous for the taxpayers. Steel companies defaulted on 77 percent \nof the dollar value of their guarantees. An analysis of that loan \nprogram by the Congressional Research Service concluded that loans to \nsteel companies represent a high level of risk. Nevertheless, we are \npoised today to provide an additional $1 billion in guarantees. I find \nit ironic that at a time when the American public is demanding reform \nof our public institutions, we offer them the failed economic policies \nof the 1970s.\n  The measure also fails to require that losses triggering access to \nthe loans relate to the so-called steel crisis. Therefore, companies \nthat lost production as a result of the 54-day GM strike will also be \neligible for the loan program.\n  Furthermore, the program could benefit companies that suffer losses \nafter the steel crisis was over. Companies that suffer losses or \nlayoffs in 1999 or even the year 2000 are eligible for the program. \nMany of the losses suffered by steel companies are the normal result of \noperating in a competitive global market.\n  The measure also fails to set terms, conditions, or interest rates \nfor the guarantees. Instead, it leaves these critical decisions to the \ndiscretion of the board making the loans. The only guidance given to \nthe board is that the terms should be reasonable. These provisions are \nproblematic and will likely result in taxpayers guaranteeing bad loans.\n\n  Finally, I have serious concerns about how this provision was brought \nto the Senate floor. I will remind my colleagues that our forebears \nintended the Senate to be a forum for reasoned and informed debate. \nUnfortunately, some Members choose to legislate complex and \ncontroversial matters in appropriations bills. The result is a hasty \nreview of legislation with very little time to identify and discuss its \nimplications. It also denies the committee of jurisdiction the ability \nto review these important measures, which will require the commitment \nof millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  The amendment that is at the desk will restrict the expenditure of \nfunds for the loan guarantee programs until the appropriate committees \nhave explicitly authorized the expenditure for these programs.\n  Authorizing on an appropriations bill has become an all too common \nevent in the Senate. However, this is one of the most egregious \nexamples of legislating on an appropriations bill I have seen since I \nhave been in Congress. Out of the more than 20 pages of text in the \nbill, only 23 lines contain appropriations language. The rest of the \nbill goes on to authorize a $1 billion loan guarantee program for steel \ncompanies and a $500 million loan guarantee program for oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  These programs will place at risk hundreds of millions of taxpayer \ndollars. It will do so without a hearing, without testimony from those \naffected by it, and without the consideration of those who have the \nmost experience with loan guarantee programs.\n  I point out also that this legislation is complex and controversial. \nMy colleagues will offer amendments today which attempt to resolve some \nof these issues, but this process is inadequate and is not a \nsubstitution for the authorization process.\n  The appropriate authorizing committee should be allowed to examine \nthe provisions of this bill. They can most appropriately determine what \nremedies, if any, should be taken to help the domestic steel, oil, and \ngas industries. Instead, these loan guarantee programs are simply being \nrushed upon us on the Senate floor without proper consideration.\n  This amendment requires that the measure go through the normal \nauthorization process that every other measure should go through. I \nhope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  I listened carefully to the words of the Senator from West Virginia, \nwho is an individual I admire and appreciate. He is a person of great \ncompassion. I believe I share that compassion, whenever there are \nchanges or layoffs in industries that for one reason or another are \nunable to compete in what is now becoming increasingly a global \nmarketplace.\n  I also am happy to say I will support job training programs, ways for \nworkers to make a transition into other lines of business and work, \nretraining, and other public-private partnerships, of which there are \nmany in America today.\n  But there should be one lesson that the 1970s and 1980s and early \n1990s have taught us, and that is the economy of the world is \nundergoing a profound and fundamental change. We are changing from what \nonce was an economy based on the steel industry, the oil industry, the \nrailroads, the automobile industries, the product of the industrial \nrevolution, to one which is rapidly evolving into a high-tech \ninformation, technology-based economy.\n\n  I refer my colleagues to the testimony of Alan Greenspan to the Joint\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nEconomic Committee in the last few days. It is a very illuminating \ndiscussion of the transition that America's economy is undergoing.\n  This transition overall has led to the strongest economic period in \nthe history of this country. There is literally a kind of prosperity \nthat, thank God, is affecting this country which is providing jobs and \nopportunities that we literally have never seen before in our \nlifetimes. That is the good news.\n  But the bad news is there are industries which, for a broad variety \nof reasons--which we have seen throughout history, as certain \nindustries have been replaced by others--either cannot compete or there \nis not a need for the product that they manufactured.\n  I remember once visiting Pittsburgh, PA, once one of the heartlands \nof the steel industry in America, and seeing where there had once been \nsteel mills; and there were the ensuing environmental problems \nassociated with that. Now high-tech industries, that are clean \nindustries, are employing people at equal or higher salaries.\n  People in Pittsburgh went through a wrenching change. I remember in \nthe State of California, and to a lesser extent my State, when we \nstarted cutting back on defense spending in the early 1990s. Literally \nhundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs because of the cutbacks \nin defense spending.\n  Now I travel to California and see a booming economy, an incredibly, \nunbelievably, booming economy, both in my State and the neighboring \nStates. What happened? It went through a very wrenching and difficult \nexperience going from a defense-dependent industrial base to now a \nhigh-tech information technology base.\n  It was not an easy transition. Hundreds of thousands of people lost \ntheir jobs in California. But I know of no one who said: Keep spending \nthis level of defense money and prop up these industries forever, \nbecause we don't want them to lose jobs because they're going through \ndifficult times.\n  I have the greatest sympathy for any steelworker who is out of a job. \nI will do everything I can to help in retraining, in job opportunity, \nand education for those workers. But if there should be one lesson we \nlearned in the 1970s and 1980s, it is that you cannot keep industries \nin business with Government subsidies, because if they cannot compete \nwithout them, over time they will not be able to compete with them.\n  As much as I admire and respect the Senator from West Virginia, he \nand I have a profound philosophical difference of opinion about the \nrole of Government. He said we should help whatever industry is in \ntrouble. Yes, we should help, by trying to take care of the displaced \nworkers, but not by keeping obsolete or noncompetitive industries in \nbusiness when we have the ability to transition into much higher-paying \njobs and better industries that provide advancements in technological \nimprovement for all of our lives.\n  I often have the pleasure of debating my dear friend and colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, who makes an impassioned plea \nfor the textile industry in South Carolina, and bemoans, laments the \ngreat dislocation that took place there. I had the pleasure of going to \nthe BMW plant which, thanks to a great degree of effort by Senator \nHollings, located in Columbia, SC. There are more jobs, higher-paying \njobs, expanding jobs, and much better working conditions at the BMW \nplant than there were in the textile mills.\n\n  The transition is going on. The transition is going on at an even \nmore rapid pace than any of us in this body ever anticipated, and as a \nfundamental change from an industrial-based economy to one which is now \nincreasingly technological-based.\n  Those that take advantage of this opportunity and make the transition \nwill grow and prosper. Fifteen years ago there was hardly a Member of \nthis body who new where the Silicon Valley was; now everybody in \nAmerica knows where it is.\n  Recently, in the past few weeks, a corporation called Global Crossing \nannounced they were going to merge with U.S. West, one of the largest \ntelecommunications companies in America. Three years ago, Global \nCrossing did not exist as a corporation. This same story can be \nrepeated throughout America's economy.\n  We should not be spending our time authorizing on appropriations--not \neven authorizing. We should not be spending our time appropriating \nmoney to subsidize companies and corporations with loans which history \nshows us had a 77-percent default the last time we did it.\n  What we should be doing is making every effort we can, as a \nGovernment, to help them make the transition, which sooner or later \nthey will inevitably go through. Because over time, the harnessmakers, \nonce the automobile was invented, went out of business. It will happen \nhere, too.\n  Again, I want to point out that I will do everything I can to help \nany worker who is displaced. I will support Government programs that \nwork. I will especially support public-private partnerships, which have \nbeen largely successful, to provide America with the educated workforce \nnecessary to take advantage of this incredible change that is going on \nin America and the world, in which America leads.\n  But to go back to a failed program of subsidized loans, in which in \nthe 1970s the steel companies defaulted on 77 percent of the dollar \nvalue of their guarantees, and eventually ended up, by the way, in just \nas bad shape as they were in before they received those guarantees and \ndefaulted on all those loans, I think is a serious mistake, a failure \nto recognize that, as societies change and industries change, and as \nevolution goes on, to try to have Government intervene and subsidize is \nnot a success.\n\n  That is why I oppose this amendment, not only on the grounds of the \nprocedures involved, which I find, as an authorizing committee \nchairman, offensive, but the concept and the idea that somehow this \nwill succeed, I believe, flies in the face of all historical data, and, \nby the way, also flies in the face of what we Republicans are supposed \nto stand for.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \ndelayed until the majority and minority leaders agree as to the time \nfor the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer support for the \nlegislation that is brought to the floor this afternoon and to make a \nfew comments about the legislation itself. Let me especially comment on \nthe subject of steel.\n  I come from a State that doesn't produce any steel. North Dakota is \npredominantly an agriculture State. But the roots of the problems that \nconfront our steel industry, in many ways, are common to the roots of \nthe problems that confront a number of industries in our country today, \nespecially and including family farmers.\n  I haven't heard the news this afternoon, but I understand that the \nmonthly trade deficit results are to be announced today. My expectation \nis that the announcement today will conclude that we have another \nrecord monthly trade deficit, probably the fourth in a row, probably \n$20 billion that we have gone in the hole in this country in our trade \nrelations. This probably amounts to somewhere between $250- to $300 \nbillion a year just in trade in goods and services. The deficit in \ntrade in goods will be much higher than that, perhaps over $300 \nbillion.\n  What does that mean? It means that this country has to borrow in \norder to finance its trade deficit. It means, at least in the field of \neconomics, to the extent there are any certainties, that this country \nwill have to repay this trade deficit at some point in the future \nthrough a lower standard of living. Is it a problem? Is it of concern? \nApparently not to many people, because there is not much discussion \nabout it. I think it is a very serious concern to this country.\n  People make the point that we have a good economy and we have \nprospered. That certainly is the case. Unemployment is very low. \nInflation is almost nonexistent. Believe me, the Federal Reserve Board \nis on its hands and knees with magnifying glasses searching for signs \nof inflation. If they don't\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nexist, the Board will try to find them. They are so concerned about it. \nBut homeownership is nearly at a record high; new housing starts are \nnearly at a record high. There is a lot of good news in this country's \neconomy.\n  But there are clouds on the horizon because of this trade deficit, a \nrecord high trade deficit. And it is rising rapidly. We have a trade \ndeficit with China that is very substantial; an annual trade deficit \nwith Japan somewhere in the neighborhood of $50- to $60 billion--in \nfact, about the same level with China. We have a trade deficit with \nCanada, a trade deficit with Mexico, and the list goes on.\n  Some come to the floor and say, well, we must be required to compete. \nI say, absolutely. If the family farmers I represent can't compete with \nothers in the world, then we are not going to make it. But the question \nis not, will we or shall we compete; the question is, what are the \nrules of competition? How do we compete? Are we to say, let's tie our \nhands behind our backs? Then we will see how well we do. Is that \ncompetition?\n  For example, you run a manufacturing plant in this country, and you \nproduce widgets. We say: You must compete with all other widget makers \nin the world. By the way, you have to pay a living wage, a minimum \nwage. By the way, you cannot dump your chemicals into the rivers and \ninto the air. By the way, you cannot hire 10-year old kids. By the way, \nyou can't pay them 14 cents an hour. And, by the way, your factory must \nbe safe.\n  Well, the widget maker says: Well, we know that we fought about that \nfor 75 years and lost all those fights. We have to pay a minimum wage. \nWe have to have safe workplaces. We have to abide by child labor laws. \nWe have to abide by antipollution laws, and we don't like it. So what \nwe are going to do is pole vault right over this geographical barrier \nand go to another country somewhere else in the world. We are going to \nhire kids. We are going to pay them peanuts and put them in unsafe \nplants. We intend to dump our chemicals in the air, and we intend to \npollute the streams. We are going to produce the same widgets, and we \nare going to send them back to Pittsburgh, Fargo, Los Angeles and \nKansas City and sell them there.\n\n  I ask the question: Is that fair competition? Is that what people \nmean by competition? You must be able to compete, and if you can't \ncompete, quit? You must be able to compete, and if you cannot compete, \ngo broke? Is that fair competition?\n  The answer is, of course, it is not fair competition. We have fought \nfor three quarters of a century in this country over these issues. \nPeople died on the streets from gunfire, marching for their rights as \nworkers to organize for better wages, for safer working conditions, for \nall of these issues.\n  Now, some say: But it is a global economy; you just don't understand. \nCompetition now is not with the rules that we would describe as \nreasonable. The rules are whatever you can find anywhere in the world \nif you are a producer. That represents fair competition?\n  Where I come from, that is not fair competition.\n  I frankly admitted, when I started, I do not know much about the \nsteel industry. We do not produce steel in my State. I do not expect we \nwill in the future ever see a strong economy that does not have \nmanufacturing activities in automobiles and steel and other things that \nrepresent the central tenets of a strong economy. I don't think you can \ndecide that you will have a strong economy if your manufacturing base \nis gone.\n  I get in the car and turn on the radio and drive to work. The news \nreport on the radio tells about America's economic health. It is always \nabout what we consume, not what we produce. It is always about the \neconomic health as measured by what we consumed last month. Consumer \nspending is up. Spending is this; spending is that.\n  That is not a sign of economic health. What you produce is a sign of \neconomic health. What you produce determines who you are and how you \nare doing.\n  I find it interesting--I know Mr. Greenspan is on the Hill today \ntestifying, and I know Wall Street will weigh every word he says for \nsome nuance about what the Fed might do with interest rates. The stock \nmarket will rise or fall like a bobber in the ocean, based on what Mr. \nGreenspan says.\n  You ask Mr. Greenspan, and he will have to admit it--so will the \ngovernors of the Federal Reserve Board--does a heart attack or a car \naccident represent economic growth to an economist? The answer is, of \ncourse. Heart attacks and car accidents represent economic growth in \nthe data that economists use to determine how well our country is \ndoing. Because a car accident means someone must fix a fender; a heart \nattack means someone is employed in emergency rooms.\n  So you ask yourself: What do these economists tell us? What do they \nmean? What does it say about our country? What do they measure?\n  Family farming is why I came to the floor today. Family farming \nsuffers, too. We have steel manufacturers in trouble and going out of \nbusiness. We have people being laid off. So the Senator from West \nVirginia says we ought to be concerned about that. We should.\n  Is a steel plant like a harness for a two-hitch team, destined to be \ngone forever from the landscape of this country because it can be done \nelsewhere much less expensively? I don't think so. I don't think anyone \nin this country would suggest that our country--with the kind of \neconomic power and might that we have--is a country that ought to do \nwithout a strong manufacturing sector or a country that ought to do \nwithout a strong steel manufacturing capability.\n  Then what about farming? When we talk about farming, people say: \nWell, the farmer must compete. It is agriculture, some monolith called \nagriculture.\n  It is not that in my State. It is families. It is not just families \nplanting some wheat that they hope to harvest in the fall. It is \nfamilies that live out on the land, that help create a small town, that \nhelp provide economic sustenance on that main street, that organize the \nchurch, that support the school, that support the charities. That is \nwhat family farms are all about. Some people may say that you can get \nrid of all of those families. America will be farmed. Corporate farms \ncan farm America from California to Maine, hardly stopping to put some \ngas in the large tractors they would use to pull those plows. But it \nwould not be the same because corporate farming isn't going to stop at \na small town in Hettinger County to say: Let me help form that church, \nor that school, or help nurture Main Street, or help with a lifestyle \nthat really breeds family values.\n\n  I hear people stand and talk about family values all the time on the \nfloor of the Senate. There is nowhere in this country that nurtures \nfamily values any better than on the family farm. I am not saying they \nare better than anybody else, but I am saying that families living in \nthe rural reaches of our country, with a yard light illuminating that \nlife, they are the ones who really do it alone--except when there is \ntrouble, all of their neighbors are there to help. That is the way \nfarmers in a rural neighborhood are.\n  We will lose something very important in this country if we decide \nthat family farmers don't matter. A North Dakota author named \nCritchfield wrote a good number of books. He was a world-renowned \nauthor who came from Hunter, North Dakota, a tiny town near Fargo. He \nwrote a book called ``In Those Days.'' It is the finest book I have \never read about small-town life and the rural lifestyle--a wonderful \nbook. He wrote his next book about the rural lifestyle in a different \nway, and he said something I never really thought much about before. He \ntalked about the nurturing of values, family values, the nurturing of \nshared responsibility, and caring. This country really always had its \nroots in rural America; it would roll from the farm to the small town \nto the big city as America grew. We have lost farmers who have moved to \nsmall towns and who have moved to big cities. We have had a \nrefurbishment of the value system of our country coming from its \nseedbed in rural America. I wonder what would happen at some point if \nwe decide that that seedbed of family values in rural America really \ndoesn't matter, that America can as easily be farmed by large corporate \nenterprises with no lights and no homes and no stopping in small towns.\n  Well, this discussion today is about steel and oil, but especially \nabout\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\nsteel. I am talking about agriculture because I want to talk about the \ncommon thread that exists on these issues. I just heard my colleague \nfrom Arizona speak, and he is a close friend and someone whose views I \nadmire. We have disagreed from time to time. On this issue of trade, we \nfind ourselves in somewhat different camps, I think, because we \nprobably see it a bit differently. I don't, for a moment, dispute that \nit is a global economy. The times are changed. But I also believe that \nthis country has every right, on behalf of its producers, to decide it \nwill fight for values such as fair wages and safe workplaces and a good \nenvironment--to fight for those things that we have fought for in this \ncountry for over 75 years. We have a right also to fight for that in \nour international trade agreements. We regrettably do not do that.\n  Our country, interestingly enough, has a leadership position on trade \nmatters. We go out and negotiate a lot of trade agreements. Did you \nknow that we almost never enforce an agreement? My biggest complaint \nwith our trade officials is that they negotiate bad agreements. If that \nweren't bad enough, they fail to enforce even the bad agreements. Go \ndown to the Department of commerce, where they are required to enforce \ntrade agreements, and ask yourself how many people in this Government, \nin the Department of Commerce, are around with the responsibility of \nenforcing our trade agreements with China. Does anybody know? Or Japan? \nAnybody know? I will tell you the answer. Six or seven people are \ntasked at the China desk with enforcing our trade agreements with \nChina. It is the same with Japan. We have a nearly $60 billion trade \ndeficit with China, and about the same with Japan, but slightly less. \nWe have a handful of people whose job it is to enforce our trade \nagreements. Why? Because our mindset has always been to go negotiate \nnew agreements because we want to trumpet the success in negotiating a \nnew agreement, but we don't want to mess around with enforcing the old \nones. That results is a lot of folks who are angry, because the last \ntrade agreement that was negotiated was not a very good one and, in any \nevent, it wasn't enforced.\n\n  So we ended up with a trade agreement called NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Fair Trade Agreement, with Canada. A miserable agreement. It \nturned a trade surplus that we had with Mexico into a big trade \ndeficit. It doubled the trade deficit we had with Canada. I know it \nwill tire anybody who has heard me say it, but not long after the trade \nagreement with Canada, we had a flood of Canadian grain coming across \nour border and undermining the market for our family farmers. Our State \nuniversity said it cost our farmers in North Dakota over $200 million \nin lost income.\n  I drove up to the border with a fellow named Earl in an orange truck \nthat was about 10 years old. In this 10-year-old orange two-ton truck \nwe took a couple hundred bushels of durum wheat. We saw 18-wheel trucks \ncoming in our direction that were full of Canadian grain coming south. \nOn a windy day, the grain trucks drop a lot of grain on the road. Our \nwindows were getting hit all along the way by Canadian grain dropping \noff the huge semi trucks coming south. After seeing dozens of them, we \npulled up to the Canadian border with Earl and his orange truck and a \ncouple hundred bushels of durum wheat, saying we want to take this \nNorth Dakota durum into Canada, knowing that millions of Canadian \nbushels are flooding into our country. Earl Jensen and I didn't get \nacross the border with that durum wheat because you could not get it \ninto Canada. Our border was open to the Canadian grain producers, \nflooding our country and undercutting our markets, but their border \nwasn't open to us. Another fellow who was with us brought along some \nbeer. That is, after all, liquid barley. Beer comes from, in most \ncases, barley, and you liquefy barley. He was going to take barley, in \nliquid form, into Canada. No, you can't do that. How about a used \nclothes washer? Can't do that. The list goes on.\n  I sat up at that border understanding firsthand why our farmers have \na right to be so angry. Who on earth would negotiate a trade agreement \nwith Canada that says let's have a one-way circumstance across the \nboard? You can bring all your products south and flood us with your \ngrain, but, by the way, when your little orange truck comes north with \nEarl and Byron, we are not going to let you through. That is not fair \ncompetition. That is not the trade relationship we expect that would \nresult in fair competition. So my experience is that we have a right, \nit seems to me, in our country, to be mighty upset about the current \ncircumstances that exist for family farmers and unfair trade agreements \nor in trade agreements that even if they were fair are not enforced. We \nhave a right to be upset with respect to the circumstances with steel. \nMy colleague who spoke previously said undoubtedly there may be dumping \nof steel. I will bet there is. I guarantee you there is dumping of \ngrain in this country.\n  I asked the GAO to get the data from Winnipeg and Montreal. Those \nfolks thumbed their nose and said: Do you think you are going to get \nthat out of us? Not in a million years. We don't intend to give you one \nfigure with respect to the sales we are doing secretly in this country. \nThat's the Canadian Wheat Board. That would be illegal in this country, \nselling at secret prices in this country. They said to GAO that there \nis not a chance, you are not going to get numbers out of us.\n  Is there a reason for people to be angry and sore about this? Of \ncourse. Do American producers have a right to ask the question of \nwhether this country will stand up for fair trade? I am absolutely full \nup to my neck with folks who say that anybody who speaks the way I just \nspoke is a protectionist. I want to plead guilty to saying that I want \nto protect our economic interests and demand fair competition. If that \nis what being a protectionist means, I will plead guilty. In fact, I \ndemand credit. I want to protect this country's economic interests. I \nalso believe in expanded trade and trade relationships that are growing \nand are healthy. I believe in and demand and expect fair trade \nrelationships. I expect our trade negotiators not to go out and lose in \nthe first 24 hours of every single negotiation.\n  The Senator from Texas is on the floor. There is a lot of beef in \nTexas. We had a big beef agreement with Japan 20 years ago. You would \nhave thought we had won the Olympics when we announced we had this beef \nagreement with Japan. Everybody celebrated. Guess what? We are getting \nmore beef into Japan. More American beef is going into Japan. But there \nis now a 50-percent tariff on American beef going to Japan. They \nnegotiated a 50-percent tariff. That will be ratcheted down over time, \nbut it snaps back with increased quantity.\n  Would anyone here ever expect we would have a 45-percent tariff on a \nproduct and not be ridiculed in the world community by it? That is \nexactly what we negotiated with Japan. It was declared a success. Our \ntrade negotiators thought it was just great.\n  We have such lowered, dimmed expectations of our trading partners \nthat we don't even try. Part of that is because for the first 25 years \nafter the Second World War almost all of our trade relationships were \nabout foreign policy. We could beat anybody with one hand tied behind \nour back. It was easy. We negotiated trade relationships that were \nalmost exclusively foreign policy initiatives. But in the second 25 \nyears, it was different. For that reason, as better competitors \ndeveloped--Japan, Europe, China, and others--our trade negotiators \ndidn't change much. Most of our trade negotiating is still disguised as \nforeign policy, regrettably. It is not fair to our producers.\n  That is why the initiative was brought to the floor today with \nrespect to steel. We don't produce steel in North Dakota, but I am well \naware of unfair trade. I am well aware of the inability to provide \nremedies and to seek remedies for unfair trade. Certainly our producers \nunderstand that every day in every way they have to face unfair \ncompetition, and no one seems willing or able to do anything about it.\n  That is the frustration. It is a frustration, in my judgment, that \nproduces the kind of proposition that is brought here to the floor of \nthe Senate today. Is it a reasonable, modest proposition? Yes. Is it a \nproposition that jumps over the ditch here on this? No. Of course, it \nis not. It is not that at all. It is modest, in my judgment, reasonably \nthoughtful, and is something Congress should pass.\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\n  The reason I took the time to come to the floor is to say this: \nFollowing this legislation, we will come in next week to the floor of \nthe Senate once again on the subject of family farmers. Family farmers \nare now in a circumstance where they are facing Depression-era prices \nand are going out of business in record numbers.\n  It is almost impossible to go to a meeting in farm country and listen \nto those farmers, who have invested their lives and their dreams and \ntheir hearts in that land, who stand up and pour out their souls and \nthen begin to get tears in their eyes when they talk about being forced \noff the land they love.\n  I told my colleagues recently of the woman who called me and said her \nauction to sell her family farm produced on that day a circumstance \nwhere her 17-year-old refused to get out of bed--refused to come down \nand help her with the auction sale. She said it wasn't because he is a \nbad kid, or it wasn't because he was lazy; it was because he was so \nheartbroken that he wasn't going to be able to farm that he just could \nnot bear to be present at the auction sale of their farm. His dad had \nrecently died. They were forced to sell, and he simply couldn't bear to \nwatch the sale of that family farm.\n  A 6-foot-4-inch fellow stood up at a meeting. He had a beard. He was \na big, burly guy. He said his granddad farmed. He farmed. He said his \ndad farmed. It was in their blood. Then his chin began to quiver, and \nhis eyes began to water. But he said: I am going to have to sell out. \nHe would like to continue, and he couldn't. And he couldn't continue to \nspeak, because this is more than just a job. It is a lot more than just \nthe term ``agriculture.''\n\n  Again, I come to the floor to talk about family farming, because this \nquestion today relates to what we are going to talk about--agriculture, \nand fundamentally unfair trade policies that undermine our family \nfarmers for which there is no remedy.\n  You go to the trade ambassador's office to seek a remedy. You go to \nthe Commerce Department to seek a remedy. I guarantee you, industry \nafter industry, you can prove the dumping, and you will not get relief. \nYou will not get a remedy. That is, in my judgment, the weakness and \nthe shortcoming of our trade laws.\n  Let me end by saying again that we must find a foreign home for \nalmost half of what we produce in a State like North Dakota. I am not \nsomeone who wants to shut borders or restrict trade, but I darned well \ninsist on behalf of the producers that I represent, just as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from New Mexico insisted today, I \ninsist that this country stand up for the economic interests of its \nproducers, at least demanding fairness and competition in international \naffairs. As we deal with a global economy, we ought to be able to \nprovide that kind of fairness for American producers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you are going to hear an announcement in a \nmoment from the two authors of the bill that is pending that we have \nworked out an agreement on the four amendments that were discussed \nearlier. I will leave it to them to talk about it.\n  It appears we would have this vote on an extraneous matter, and then \neither accept the vote on the four previous matters discussed or have a \nrollcall vote. But before we get into all of that, I wanted to say that \nI am supportive of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  One of the problems we increasingly have in the Senate is that it is \nso hard to pass an authorization bill that we are reaching the point \nwhere almost every legislative action originates in one of two \ncommittees--the Finance Committee, which engages in direct spending \nthrough entitlements, and the Appropriations Committee, which \nappropriates money.\n  We have before us a bill that really should be under the jurisdiction \nof the Banking Committee. We are for all practical purposes \nappropriating without authorizing, or, one could say, authorizing \nwithin the Appropriations Committee. As I said to Senator Stevens, \nmaybe I ought to start reporting appropriations bills to the Banking \nCommittee and try to bring them to the floor of the Senate.\n  But Senator McCain's amendment really brings home a very important \npoint; that is, we have committees that have jurisdiction in these \nareas. We undercut the Senate when we don't recognize it.\n  A policy, I think, that is ultimately quite independent of the issue \nwe are talking about today but relevant to this amendment is that the \nsooner we can get back to having authorizing committees authorize and \nhaving appropriations committees appropriate the better off we will be.\n  I am in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not sure of the procedure. But I \nwould like to offer an amendment at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 686\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the pending committee amendment to H.R. 1664)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 686.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . Glacier Bay Study.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior shall, in cooperation with the Governor of Alaska, \n     conduct a study to identify environmental impacts, if any, of \n     subsistence fishing and gathering and of commercial fishing \n     in the marine waters of Glacier Bay National Park, and shall \n     provide a report to Congress on the results of such study no \n     later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this \n     section. During the pendency of the study, and in the absence \n     of a positive finding that a resource emergency exists which \n     requires the immediate closure of fishing or gathering, no \n     funds shall be expended by the Secretary to implement \n     closures or other restrictions of subsistence fishing, \n     subsistence gathering, or commercial fishing in the non-\n     wilderness waters of Glacier Bay National Park, except the \n     closure of Dungeness crab fisheries under Section 123(b) of \n     the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, (section 101(e) of division A of \n     Public Law 105-277).''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, less than 3 months ago this body \nadopted my amendment allowing commercial fishing and subsistence \ngathering, which consists primarily of gathering sea gull eggs in \nGlacier Bay. That issue came before this body, and passed 59 to 40.\n  It went to conference, along with the issue of the steel and oil and \ngas guarantees that are under discussion before this body.\n  I am here on behalf of the little people. I can't stand here and \ncompete on the broad issues of steel dumping or the impact the decline \nof the price of oil has had on our stripper wells; or the economies of \nthose areas dependent on steel, West Virginia and New Mexico; or oil \nand gas, as in Oklahoma. I stand here on behalf of a few of the native \npeople of my State, the Huna Tlingit Indians, who have lived for \ncenturies with access to an area known as Glacier Bay, which is one of \nour premier national parks.\n  Clearly, this issue is not in proportion with the importance of steel \ndumping, or the decline in the price of oil. I come before this body \nrepresenting this small group of indigenous American Alaskan Indians \nwho have been dependent on a subsistence lifestyle for thousands of \nyears.\n  Glacier Bay is a large area in the northern end of the archipelago of \nsoutheastern Alaska. It is a magnificent area. Visitors in the \nsummertime arrive on cruise ships. It is a great way for a visitor to \nenjoy this magnificent, scenic site. However, it is a very short \nseason, roughly Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n  The rest of the time, the area has been utilized by very small, \nindividual fishing vessels that are bound by the resource management of \nthe Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\n  In conference, there was a concern expressed by various House Members \nas to whether the fisheries resource in\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\nGlacier Bay could be maintained and the impact commercial fishing would \nhave on that resource. As a consequence, I have changed my amendment. \nMy previous amendment simply allowed commercial fishing and subsistence \ngathering to remain in Glacier Bay until the court determined whether \nthe State had the right to manage these waters within the State of \nAlaska.\n  I have now changed the amendment to propose a moratorium for 18 \nmonths. During that time, there would be a joint study between the \nState Department of Fish and Game and the Park Service to study the \nimpact of this small amount of commercial fishing and subsistence \ngathering on Glacier Bay, and to make a determination whether there was \nany detrimental effect. If there was, obviously, it would cease.\n  It is interesting to note that the matter before the Senate is \nassociated with a matter of substantial cost, because we are talking \nabout dumping steel, we are talking about addressing relief, we are \ntalking about oil and gas, we are talking about some type of relief for \nthe stripper wells. It is my understanding that steel, oil, and gas \namendments might amount to as much as $300 million.\n  I point out to my colleagues, there is zero cost associated with my \namendment--no cost whatever. There is justice to residents of these \ncommunities of Alaska.\n  Let me describe the communities. Gustavus has 346 residents and is \nadjacent to Glacier Bay; 55 of those residents are actively engaged in \nfishing. Elfin Cove, outside the bay, has 54 people; 47 are engaged in \nfishing. Huna, which is a Tlingit Indian village directly across from \nGlacier Bay, has 900 people; 228 are in the fisheries. Pelican City has \n187 residents; there are 86 in the fisheries.\n  These communities have no alternative. They can't go anyplace else. \nWhat is the justification for the attitude of the Park Service? There \nhas not been one public hearing held--not one. They did not advertise \nfor witnesses to determine the impact. They simply made an \nadministrative decision and said we are closing it.\n  Let me show another chart demonstrating where commercial fishing is \nallowed by statutory law in National Parks: Assateague, in Virginia; \nBiscayne, in Florida; Buck Reef, in the Virgin Islands; Canaveral \nNational Seashore, in Florida; Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina; Cape \nKrusenstern, in Alaska; Channel Islands, CA; Fire Island, NY; Gulf \nIslands, MS; Isle Royale, in Michigan; Jean Lafitte National Park, LA, \nto name several. But they have made a decision to close the fishing in \nmy State of Alaska.\n  It is interesting, further, to note some of the other activities they \nallow in the park, because it reflects the attitude of the Park Service \nand the manner in which they initiate an action.\n  The Park Service saw fit some 3 months ago to initiate what was \nbasically a raid on commercial fishing in Glacier Bay. They used Park \nService personnel, they boarded the boats that were fishing there, they \nhad sidearms, and they simply said they were going to close this area. \nThe area was not, in fact, closed. Those fishermen had a right to be \nthere at that time. That was a pretty heavy tactic to use, but they saw \nfit to use it.\n  Our Governor indicated his wish, as did our State and our \nlegislature, that commercial fishing be allowed to continue in Glacier \nBay.\n  To add insult to injury, the people of Glacier Bay have been \ndependent on the gathering of sea gull eggs since time immemorial. One \nwonders why they would need sea gull eggs. Frankly, it is very \ndifficult to raise chickens in Alaska. There is a lot of rain. This is \na typical village in Glacier Bay. This is an 1889 photo. That village \nis no longer there, but this is the kind of village they used to have. \nYou see there, they are drying the fish and so forth. The Huna villages \ntoday are not like that by any means--but the point is these people \nstill live in a subsistence lifestyle.\n\n  What I want to say here is just the other day the Park Service \ndecided to prohibit, if you will, what it had ignored previously and \nthat was the gathering of sea gull eggs for harvest in Glacier Bay. \nThey apprehended a Huna native for gathering sea gull eggs. I do not \nknow how long they kept the sea gull eggs, but a couple of days later \nthey gave them back to the Huna Indian Association. What is the \nconsistency of this? I do not know that there is any, and it points out \nthe Park Service is aggressively hostile to something that other \nagencies have seen fit to recognize as unique to the character of the \nsubsistence lifestyle of the native people of Alaska.\n  It should be remembered that Canada and the United States reached an \nagreement several years ago allowing native people to take birds and \neggs during the spring. That agreement was recognized by an amendment \nto the Migratory Bird Treaty. It has been nearly 2 years since the \nSenate approved the amendment to the treaty. What this amendment did \nwas recognize the need of the native people to take birds and eggs in \nthe spring, because in the fall those birds are gone. The reason is \nvery simple; cold weather has come and the birds have left.\n  The State Department has not yet exchanged the instrument of \nratification with Canada. This is the final formal exchange of \ndocuments necessary to put the new treaty into effect. Canada is eager \nto complete the process because the new treaty language is needed to \ncomply with changes in its Constitution. I'm told the delay is due to \nthe bureaucratic failure of the Department of the Interior to implement \nnew regulations. Some of the State Department officials think that is \nneeded before final documents are exchanged. I, personally, see no \nreason for the delay.\n  The point I want to make is an obvious one. The U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service has recognized the necessity of the native people of \nAlaska, being dependent on subsistence, to take birds and eggs in \nspring, including sea gull eggs. But the Park Service--another branch \nof the Federal Government--has chosen to enforce a prohibition against \ntaking sea gull eggs. What is the justification for that? I do not \nknow, unless it is a very aggressive Park Service. But, clearly, if the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sees fit to allow a modest taking of \neggs and migratory birds for subsistence purposes, you would think the \nU.S. Park Service would recognize and honor and appreciate the \ntradition of the Native Alaskans and allow this to take place. Still, \nthat is not the case.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a press \nclipping from the Juneau Empire covering the story on the apprehension \nof the individual who was accosted by the Park Service for gathering, \nfor subsistence purposes, sea gull eggs.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Gull Eggs Confiscated\n\n       Juneau--National Park Service officials seized several \n     dozen gull eggs from a Hoonah man in Glacier Bay National \n     Park over the weekend.\n       Dan Neal, 46, his son and a family of five visiting from \n     Illinois came ashore Saturday on Marble Island. They landed \n     near two U.S. Geological Survey biologists doing research on \n     a glaucous-winged gull colony.\n       The biologists informed Neal and his companions they \n     couldn't legally collect eggs there, and the group left, \n     Glacier Bay Chief Ranger Randy King said.\n       Park Service employees later stopped the boat, and Neal \n     reluctantly surrendered the eggs, King said.\n       Gathering gull eggs is prohibited by international treaty \n     and federal regulations throughout Alaska. However, the \n     harvest of gull eggs is an important cultural tradition for \n     Hoonah Tlingits.\n       The Park Service and the Hoonah Indian Association are \n     exploring ways the tradition might continue.\n       ``Our cultural and traditional uses in our ancestral \n     homeland are deeply woven into our very being,'' said Ken \n     Grant, the association's president, who urged tribal members \n     to refrain from collecting eggs until the Park Service \n     finishes its studies.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In my amendment I propose this joint study take place, \nand it is quite legitimate to ask, Where is the money going to come \nfrom? For some time now the Park Service has been generating revenue \nfrom cruise ship receipts from a recreation fee demonstration program. \nThey have approximately $2.8 million, of which $435,000 is unencumbered \nat this time. It is my suggestion this be used for the Park Service's \njoint evaluation, along with the State of Alaska, to study the \nrenewability of the fisheries resources in Glacier Bay.\n  Somebody might ask, Why should a Glacier Bay moratorium be attached \nto\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\nthis bill--an appropriations bill? I hope the appropriators recognize \nthis is a legitimate appropriations amendment. It is setting parameters \nfor the expenditure of funds being appropriated. Further, the \nmoratorium is a time-honored and time-tested device. This moratorium \nsimply amends last year's appropriation bill which terminated the \nfishing in Glacier Bay. If fisheries can be closed on an appropriations \nbill and the field of participants can be narrowed in an appropriations \nbill, then it is not out of place to use the same process for a follow-\nup measure, and that is what we have done. This is a legitimate \nappropriation amendment setting parameters for the expenditure of funds \nbeing appropriated.\n  This belongs in this package because it went over to the House and \nSenate conferees as part of the supplemental package, along with steel \nand oil. It was a part of those issues that were considered.\n  But as we look at the issue of equity here, there is no question this \namendment is an amendment substantially different from the previous \namendment inasmuch as it gives a moratorium of 18 months in which to \nevaluate, in a joint study, the renewability of the fisheries resource. \nAs evidenced by the concern of the conferees in the House, Senator \nStevens and I--I was given the opportunity in that conference to make a \npersonal presentation. But that was a different amendment. That was \nsimply to allow fishing to continue until such time as the court \ndetermined who had jurisdiction. This amendment sets to rest the \nconcerns relative to the renewability of that resource by authorizing \nthis joint study.\n  It also recognizes, in a sense, there is no real trustworthy \ninformation on the impact of fishing or subsistence use in Glacier Bay \non the ecosystem. Opponents have argued from time to time there may be \nsome consequences, but they have offered no real proof. On the other \nside, it is impossible to prove the negative that fishing has no \nlasting impact.\n  Before fishermen are permanently removed or restricted, which will \nhave irreversible consequences for the fishermen, the processing \ncompanies and the communities affected, I think it is appropriate to \nactually test the hypothesis that fishing is detrimental in some way. \nThat is why we have altered our amendment to require this 18-month \nstudy.\n  My worst fear, as I have indicated, about the Park Service harassment \nof the Alaska Native people, was realized this last week when they \nseized several dozen sea gull eggs from a Native resident of Hoonah, \none particular resident. This was unwarranted harassment by the Park \nService. I think it represents an insensitive, arrogant attitude and is \nreminiscent of the Indian policies of the 1800s, where we were simply \ndriving individuals off the land they had traditionally had access to. \nOnly passage of my amendment will end this harassment.\n  Again, this is only a few hundred people, but they have no other \nappeal. They do not want to live off welfare. They have no other place \nto go. There is no reason why they should be excluded from fishing in \nthis area, as we recognize the Park Service allows fishing in the 16 \nother national parks. I have had letters from local residents \nrepeatedly assuring me that previously they had been under the \nassumption the Park Service had no intention to eliminate the \ntraditional use, including fish and subsistence gathering.\n  Why do they enforce such an action in Glacier Bay and not enforce it \nin the 16 other areas where they allow it by statute? This fishery \nconsists of a small number of small vessels. They do a little salmon, \ncrab, halibut, bottom fishing. It is important to the people, as I have \nindicated, of Elfin Cove, 34 people, Hoonah, 228 people, who fish.\n  There have been provisions that Senator Stevens has been able to \nprevail on, allowing Federal funding for fishermen as a consequence of \nthem losing the right to fish. The letters I have ask me why the Park \nService is mandating they can no longer fish. Why isn't the Government \nmore sensitive to their particular needs? Why is the Government \nsingling them out when they have no place else to go? These are hard \nquestions to answer.\n  This is a situation of justice. These little people are crying out, \nand they are crying out in the only voice they have, and that is the \nvoice of the Congress of the United States.\n  That is basically where we are. It is my understanding there may be \nan effort to table this legislation. I personally cannot understand why \nthe amendment would not be accepted and sent over with the rest of the \npackage. Again, I appeal to fairness and equity and recognize, unlike \nthe steel issue and the oil issue, this has absolutely no cost. This is \nsimply an 18-month study on the merits of the resource--that is simply \nall it is--so these people can continue their rightful pursuit of their \ntraditional use of fish and game.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I know the Senator from Arizona wants to vote on his \namendment, but I want to ask you a question, having sat here and \nlistened. You are talking about Glacier Bay, and you showed a map of \nit. This is a far off place where, except for a very short period of \nthe year, it is cold and frozen; right?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is pretty much the case; that is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You have Native Americans who live by fishing and \ngathering and eating sea gull eggs; right?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They have traditionally gathered sea gull eggs in the \nspring of the year. They depend on fishing throughout the year.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You have bureaucrats in Washington who may have never been \nto Glacier Bay suggesting that maybe, instead of eating sea gull eggs, \nthey might raise chickens?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is pretty hard to do in that climate, but I am no \nexpert on chickens.\n  Mr. GRAMM. They have never tried going to Glacier Bay and raising \nchickens, have they?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not think they want to do that, with 200 inches \nof rain.\n  Mr. GRAMM. To make a long story short, what you are really saying is \nyou have Native Americans who are trying to eke out a living by fishing \nand by eating sea gull eggs, and you have bureaucrats in Washington who \nmay have never been there, certainly would never go live there, who are \nsaying that somehow they have the right to force them to change their \nway of life, with the idea that somehow it is more their business what \nhappens in Glacier Bay than it is the business of people who live \nthere; right?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is pretty much the case. They say fishing is a \ncommercial activity, but if you look at this tour boat entering into \nthe bay with 1,200 passengers, that obviously is a pretty significant \ncommercial activity.\n  There was a cruise vessel that had an accident in Glacier Bay the \nother day. It hit a rock. As far as I know, it is still on the rock. It \nleaked a little fuel--a few gallons. They are working on it. They are \ngoing to get it off. There is not going to be damage to the ecology or \nthe environment. Nevertheless, that is a commercial activity.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I intend to vote with the Senator. I hope everybody will. \nYour amendment really makes the point that there is no end to the \narrogance of people in Washington who are trying to tell people in a \ncompletely different part of the country, which they know nothing \nabout, how to live their lives and claiming that somehow this bay \nbelongs more to them than it does to people who have lived there for a \nthousand years. Not only are you representing your constituency, but \nyou are speaking out on behalf of a concern, not in as clear a way, not \nin as glaring a way, but that many people in other parts of the country \nshare. The last time I looked, there was no shortage of sea gulls on \nthe planet.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have observed that as well. I thank my friend from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will make one more point--I am sure \nthere are others who want to be heard--relative to an inconsistency. \nThat is, again, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allows migratory \nbird taking in Alaska in the spring, and they have seen fit to do that, \nrecognizing the subsistence needs of those native people, and egg \ngathering as well. But the U.S. Park Service, just within the last 2 \nweeks, has indicated they will not allow sea gull egg gathering in the \npark. We have two different agencies\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nwith two different jurisdictions, I grant you that. But it is \ndefinitely an inconsistency.\n  Again, for those who are wondering what this issue is doing in the \nmiddle of steel and oil, I simply appeal to the floor managers to \nrecognize the action that was taken when it was sent over to the House. \nUnlike steel and unlike oil, which did not have a vote on this floor, \nthis issue had a vote. We had a good vote. As a consequence of that, it \nbelongs in the package that is going back. Some may argue the \nintricacies of procedure, but a deal is a deal, and I made a commitment \nto my colleagues that I would bring this up again, and I intend to \nbring it up again and again because there is an injustice here.\n  If we are able to prevail on a tabling motion, why, then we run the \nrisk of what may happen to it in the House. I urge the floor managers \nto take this amendment.\n  It is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays. I do not know what \nthe procedure is, but it may be that the leaders want to delay voting \non this matter until such time as they determine it is appropriate. I \nappeal to my colleagues to take the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At the moment, \nthere is not.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in light of the fact the Senator from New \nMexico wants to speak on this amendment, I ask for the regular order.\n  With all due respect to my friends, we were going to vote 45 minutes \nago.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 685\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the McCain amendment No. \n685.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the McCain amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 685. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum, is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 174 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchinson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dodd\n     Santorum\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Alaska \nis recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized in order to offer a unanimous consent agreement regarding \namendments; that following that I be recognized in order to make a \nshort statement and move to table the Murkowski amendment No. 686, with \nno amendments in order to the amendments prior to the vote on that \nmotion to table. I also ask unanimous consent that following the vote \non the motion to table, if that amendment is tabled, the bill be read \nfor the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, with no intervening action or debate, at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, \nJune 18, and that paragraph 4 of rule XVIII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, point of inquiry. I don't mean to \nobject. When does the Senator intend to have a vote on the tabling \nmotion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Immediately after I make that motion.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nanother 5 minutes on the amendment, which is the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do object. Would the Senator at least let me be able \nto get the other amendments out of the way first?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection, even though my amendment is the \npending business--reserving my right to have 5 minutes on my pending \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection. I amend my request to ask that \nprior to the motion to table and my comments, my colleague be \nrecognized for 5 minutes. Let's get the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The total sequence is now agreed to, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 687.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, beginning on line 3, strike all through line 7.\n       On page 10, beginning on line 23, strike all through page \n     11, line 2.\n       On page 34, beginning on line 14, strike all through 16.\n       On page 9, after line 17, insert the following new \n     paragraph:\n       (4) Guarantee level.--No loan guarantee may be provided \n     under this section if the guarantee exceeds 85 percent of the \n     amount of principal of the loan.\n       On page 36, after line 23, insert the following new \n     paragraph:\n       (4) Guarantee level.--No loan guarantee may be provided \n     under this section if the guarantee exceeds 85 percent of the \n     amount of principal of the loan.\n       On page 48, beginning on line 9, strike all through line \n     17.\n       On page 6, line 7, strike all through line 13, and insert \n     the following:\n       (e) Loan Guarantee Board Membership.--\n       (1) In general.--There is established a Loan Guarantee \n     Board, which shall be composed of--\n       (A) the Secretary of Commerce;\n       (B) the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, who shall serve as Chairman of the Board: and\n       (C) the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       On page 33, line 17, strike all through line 23, and insert \n     the following:\n       (2) Loan guarantee board.--There is established to \n     administer the Program a Loan Guarantee Board, to be composed \n     of--\n       (a) the Secretary of Commerce\n       (B) the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System who shall serve as Chairman of the Board; and\n       (C) the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       On page 32, strike lines 10 and 11, and redesignate the \n     remaining subparagraphs and cross references thereto \n     accordingly.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we have a minute or two to explain \nthat amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, and \nSenator Nickles be permitted 5 minutes each to explain the amendment.\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the interest of time, I will explain \nonly one amendment, and I will let my colleagues pick up the others. If \nthey want to repeat what I have said, fine.\n  Essentially, many Senators on this side have complained that this was \nan emergency measure, and that one way of looking at an emergency \nmeasure was that this bill might use some of the Social Security \nsurplus. The emergency clause has been stricken. It is not in there \nanymore. As a consequence, this money is spent out of the regular \nallocation: Truth in budgeting, as you call it. It does not come out of \nthe trust fund because it is paid for like any other program.\n  If you are wondering how much for this year's appropriation, it is \n$19 million. So we have to find $19 million within the $1.8 billion \nbudget of the United States. So we don't have to take any money out of \nSocial Security. That is the only point I want to make.\n  We fixed three other things other Senators were concerned about. I \nwill let Senator Nickles or Senator Gramm explain those. I don't need \nthe remainder of my time. Whatever I have left, I yield back.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and, in particular, \nSenator Byrd, Senator Domenici, and Senator Stevens, for working with \nSenator Gramm, myself, and others to try to make this a better bill. \nSenator Domenici mentioned one, we strike the emergency provision. That \nbasically means there is $270 million estimated cost by CBO of this \nbill, and it was declared emergency. We are striking that. That means \nwe won't be raising the caps. I think that is important; I don't think \nwe should be calling everything an emergency, as I stated, and busting \nthe budget. I appreciate the cooperation in striking that section.\n  We did a couple of other things. The bill originally said that the \nloan guarantees would be made up to 100 percent. We limited that now to \na maximum loan guarantee of 85 percent. The lending organization, or \nbank, is going to have to put up 15 percent, with some risk. It may be \n25 or 30 percent, but they will have to put up at least 15 percent. I \nthink that is a good amendment.\n  We changed the composition of the board. Originally, the lending \nboard was comprised of the Labor Secretary, the Treasury Secretary, and \nthe Commerce Secretary.\n  We changed that. We said, well, we will keep the Secretary of \nCommerce on, but we will change it and add the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board and the head of the SEC--I think, again, trying to take \npolitics out of it, trying to put people on the board that are more \ninterested in economics and making good financial decisions, and not \nhave it be so political.\n  We also have another amendment that would strike out the lower loan \nlimits. The bill originally said in steel the loan range would be from \n$25 million to $250 million. We dropped the $25 million lower limit. In \nother words, now a steel company can get a $5 million loan, or a $10 \nmillion loan, or a $1 million loan; it won't have to be at least $25 \nmillion.\n  We did the same thing for ore, which had a $6 million minimum loan \nlevel. Now that can be smaller. For oil and gas, I believe, there was a \n$250,000 minimum. We struck that minimum as well.\n  I think the combination of amendments we have had make this a better \nbill. I appreciate the fact that leaders who are promoting this bill \nhave agreed to these amendments. I think it improves it. I am still \ngoing to vote no on final passage. I really do not think the Federal \nGovernment should be in the loan guarantee business for steel, or for \noil and gas, and for the iron ore companies. But I do appreciate their \nconsideration of these amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support them.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from \nOklahoma about his amendment. I am wondering if there is anything in \nhis amendment that would correct one problem I see in the bill, which \nis that it occurs to me, if that a steel company, for example, has an \nexisting loan with some private bank--once this program goes into \neffect and that loan is in bad shape, the bank can encourage that steel \ncompany to apply for a new loan under this program and get that Federal \nguarantee, and thereby you are transferring that risk, or at least 85 \npercent of it, from that bank that otherwise would take the hit to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Is there anything in the amendment that the Senator knows of, or \nanything in the original bill, that would prevent that kind of \nshenanigan?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to the question of my friend and colleague--I \nthink it is an excellent question--we didn't fix that problem. The \nSenator is exactly right. This bill still leaves it open where you can \nhave a bad loan, or basically you are going to have that refinanced \nwith the Government guaranteed loan; i.e., a steel company would have a \n$100 million loan. Maybe they are paying a high interest rate--maybe 12 \npercent. Maybe that loan is in jeopardy. Maybe they are having a hard \ntime making payments on it.\n  We haven't fixed that yet. That is an amendment some of us have been \ntalking about. It wasn't in this package we just agreed to.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. What about if there is a loan out there to one of the \nsmall oil and gas companies, and the president and owner of the company \nhave personally guaranteed the loan? Would they be in a position now, \nwith this new loan program, to apply for a new loan under this type of \nguarantee program, get that new loan issued, and replace their personal \nguarantees with the Government guarantees so the owners and major \nshareholders, who could be very wealthy individuals, would be taken off \nthe hook by the taxpayers?\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think, again, my colleague from Illinois is pointing \nout a shortcoming that is in the bill. It has not been fixed by the \namendments that were offered. Quite possibly, maybe the Senator from \nIllinois will have an amendment, and maybe the principals that are \nengaged in this might support it.\n  I will be happy to work with the Senator to see if we can't correct \nthat problem. But we haven't stopped anybody from refinancing a bad \nloan, or maybe a self-interest loan, as the Senator discussed. I \npersonally think those mistakes should be corrected. We have taken four \ngood steps to make it better. But we need some additional amendments to \nsolve that problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement, the amendment is agreed \nto.\n  The amendment (No. 687) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the time for Senator Gramm \nbe reserved for a later time today. He is not here at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may, I think I have some time on the \nbill to respond to the Senator from Illinois, to a certain extent.\n  With Alan Greenspan on the board managing this program--if I could \nhave the attention of the Senator from Illinois--and the head of the \nSEC on the program making the regulations concerning these loans, the \nfact that the Senator has raised this issue on the floor I am sure will \nnot miss their attention.\n  Mr. President, my colleague has 5 minutes. Then I am recognized after \nthat. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 686\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that my \namendment on Glacier Bay is the pending amendment before the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I am disappointed to learn that my senior colleague intends to table \nthe amendment. On the other hand, I know that he very much supports the \ncontinued fishing and subsistence harvest in\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\nGlacier Bay. Nevertheless, we are faced with a situation here where the \nissue is kind of caught, if you will, between two major issues; namely, \nthe guarantee on steel and the guarantee on oil. The reason it belongs \nhere is because we voted on it in the supplemental in which we also had \nthe steel and oil matters. We voted on it and passed it 59 to 40, and \nit went over to the conference. It was the same conference that \naddressed the Glacier Bay issue that addressed steel loan guarantees \nand the oil guarantee, which, I might mention, cost $270 million. My \namendment costs absolutely zero.\n  I hope my colleagues will accept the amendment. But they may see fit \nnot to. As a consequence, I believe we have an injustice occurring in \nAlaska for those few hundred Alaska Indian people who depend, and have \nfor years and years, on subsistence access in Glacier Bay. The \nbureaucrats within the Park Service moved in and simply said: We are \ngoing to close it, and that is it.\n  We have been able, through the efforts of Senator Stevens, to get \nremuneration for the potential loss of their rights. But the fact is, \non this chart we have 16 national parks where commercial fishing is \nallowed.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the vote that prevailed, 59 \nto 40, to allow fishing in Glacier Bay. But this is a different \namendment. I changed my amendment. Previously, we were going to wait \nuntil there was a determination by the State to decide who had \njurisdiction. That was going to go to the courts. My current amendment \nis simply an 18-month moratorium to allow the State to work with the \nPark Service to evaluate whether or not the resource is in danger. The \nfunding for that is available within the funds for the Park Service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that statements by Alaska's Lieutenant \nGovernor Fran Ulmer, by Myron Naneng, a respected member of the \nMigratory Bird Treaty negotiating team, and by the Director of the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, Jamie Clark, be printed in the Record with regard \nto the specifics of allowing migratory bird hunting in the spring on \nFederal lands in Alaska, as well as egg gathering.\n\n                         Migratory Bird Treaty\n\n\n                       enforcement Inconsistency\n\n       Unlike recent Park Service actions, the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service has had a long-standing policy that is sensitive to \n     subsistence use of migratory waterfowl, and shows that the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service understands its importance to rural \n     Alaskans.\n       During a Sept. 25, 1997, Senate hearing on the Migratory \n     Bird Treaty, Alaska's Lt. Governor, Fran Ulmer, noted: ``. . \n     . much of the traditional harvest of migratory birds in rural \n     Alaska has taken place, and continues to take place, during \n     the closed-season portion of the year. In Alaska prohibitions \n     on traditional hunting practices have been enforced on a very \n     limited basis.''\n       Myron Naneng, representing the Alaska Native Migratory Bird \n     Working Group, and one of the treaty negotiators, said: ``I \n     want to begin by expressing our deepest appreciation for the \n     leadership and commitment (former Fish and Wildlife Service \n     chief) Mollie Beattie demonstrated as head of the U.S. \n     negotiating team. She showed an uncommon understanding of the \n     nutritional and cultural aspects of the Native subsistence \n     way of life, and her actions showed her confidence in Native \n     people as responsible caretakers and managers of their \n     subsistence resources.''\n       The current Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     Jamie Clark, had this to say: ``Native people have continued \n     their traditional hunt of migratory birds in the spring and \n     summer, and neither government has rigidly enforced the \n     closed season given the realities of life in the arctic and \n     subarctic regions.''\n       Elsewhere in her testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, Clark called the Fish and Wildlife Service's \n     policy ``discretionary non-enforcement.'' It was--and is--the \n     only way to make the best of a bad situation until the treaty \n     amendments can be put into effect.\n       If the Fish and Wildlife Service has the good sense to use \n     ``discretionary non-enforcement'' everywhere else, then that \n     option certainly is open to the National Park Service.\n       Unfortunately, NPS has instead chosen to ignore both the \n     needs of the local people and Congress' clear desire to allow \n     reasonable spring harvesting.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, finally, I believe that as an \nauthorizer I have been caught, if you will, in this continued dilemma \nof the appropriators.\n  I remind you that we have not had hearings on the issue of steel, nor \nhearings on the issue of oil, as far as this guarantee package is \nconcerned.\n  It reminds me of an issue that occurred last year with respect to the \nappropriations process. The Clinton administration decided to acquire \nHeadwaters in Northern California for $315 million and the New World \nMine Site in Montana at a cost of $65 million. That is $380 million. It \ndid not go through my committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. These decisions last year were made with no \ncongressional involvement. The administration sought to bypass the \nauthorizing committee entirely and have the appropriators essentially \njust write the check for the purpose. We are seeing more and more of \nthis.\n  As an authorizer, I think we have a job to do, and we are either \ngoing to do our job or we might as well give it to the appropriators.\n  As chairman of the authorizing committee, I want the opportunity for \nthe committee to carefully review the merits of this acquisition. \nInstead, $380 million went right out. As a consequence, we are seeing \nsimilar things today with regard to the merits of the loan guarantee on \noil and steel.\n  Ultimately, my arguments failed last year. The authorizations and \nfunding were included in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill, much to \nthe administration's delight. There were never any hearings. There was \nnever any open debate for any type of public review.\n  My little deal represents a few hundred Native people in Alaska, \nappealing, if you will, for 18 months to study the impact of their \nmodest fishing and subsistence gathering, and they are depending upon \nthe Senate in this regard because they have no other place to \nturn. Give them money if you want, but they don't want handouts. They \nare a proud people; they want the right to continue to do what they \nhave done.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize what is happening here. I hope \nsome day we go to a 2-year budget process.\n  I appreciate the consideration of all my colleagues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I note the Senator from Texas has \nreturned. I ask unanimous consent his time be restored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have a bill before the Senate. Perhaps some believe the \nGovernment ought to be lending money to American industry; I don't, so \nI am not for the bill.\n  We have put together an amendment which I believe improves the bill.\n  No. 1, we strike the emergency designation so none of the money will \ncome out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  No. 2, we set up a board made up of the Secretary of Commerce, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Alan Greenspan would be Chairman. \nIt is a major move towards taking politics out of the determination of \nwho gets the loan.\n  We require that the lender put up 15 percent of the capital, take 15 \npercent of the risk, so that the Government does not end up eating the \nentire loss if there is a loss. Obviously, if you are lending money, \nyou are going to have to make up part of the loss; you will do a better \njob than if you are lending somebody else's money. We take the minimums \nout of the bill, so small business can compete for the money.\n  Finally, we have agreed on language that will put a focus on trying \nto make loans to maximize the chances that the loans will be paid back \nand, to the maximum extent possible, take politics out of the process.\n  This does not make it a good bill, in my mind. I am not for it, but I \nthink it improves it.\n  I thank the two authors of the bill for working for people, who were \nnot for their bill and were not going to vote for it, to try to make it \nbetter. I thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was one of those who worked on the \namendments. I thank those who participated. I thank Mr. Domenici. I \nthank Mr. Gramm and Mr. Nickles. We all met, and I agreed on the \namendments. I think they were good proposals. I think overall they \nimproved the bill.\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\n  I thank all Senators who were engaged in the efforts. I thank the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee for his fine cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that Senator Fitzgerald be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I take the Senate back to the time we \nwere in conference. We were in conference a long time on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill with concerns about Kosovo and other \nvital areas of our national defense policy.\n  In conference on that bill, we worked late into the night on a series \nof matters. We had a vote on the Byrd and Domenici amendments. As a \nmatter of fact, the House voted to accept the Byrd version of that loan \nguarantee program and rejected the version from Senator Domenici.\n  The Senate had not voted at that time. I conferred with Senate \nconferees and we told the House we insisted on our amendments. The \nHouse came back and voted again. At that time, it rejected both \namendments. We were stalemated.\n  We went into the night the next night and through the day. It was \nabout 9:30, 10 o'clock and I asked Senator Byrd if he would consider a \nsuggestion I had. We had a second supplemental in our committee, and we \nhad not conferred on that. It was a bill that was passed by the House \nand is a viable bill to send back to the House as another supplemental \nappropriations bill. I asked Senator Byrd if he would consent to take \nhis amendment off of the bill that was pending in conference. I assured \nhim that when we reconvened after the recess I would move the committee \nto put the steel loan guarantee on that bill and report it to the \nSenate. I made the same request to Senator Domenici. Both of them \nagreed.\n  We then conferred with the leadership of both the House and Senate. \nAt that time, it was clear that if this proposal of having these two \nloan guarantee programs on the supplemental and sending it back to the \nHouse had any other amendment it would not be sent to conference in the \nHouse.\n  I remember well Senator Byrd asked me at that time: What are you \ngoing to do if the bill gets to the floor and this amendment is offered \nthat would not be germane to either of these two loan guarantee \nprograms, which under the circumstance would lead to the bill not being \nsent to conference in the House, by the House?\n  I said: Senator, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I will \npersonally move to table any amendment that is not germane to the bill \nif it is reported by our committee.\n  We are at this position now. We have adopted the germane amendments. \nI congratulate all concerned for working that out. I was constrained to \nmove to table the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I thank the \nSenate for tabling that amendment.\n  The last amendment is the amendment of my colleague that I \ncosponsored when the bill was before the Senate before. I say to the \nSenate, in all sincerity, the word of a Senator has to be kept, no \nmatter what the price. I know I will read in my papers in Anchorage and \nthroughout Alaska tomorrow about this, which will be deemed a feud \nbetween me and my colleague. It is not a feud. I have a responsibility \nto keep my word.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I move to table the \nMurkowski amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 686.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 175 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Dodd\n     McCain\n     Santorum\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will make one clarifying statement \nrelative to the vote that was taken and a reference made by my senior \ncolleague to the germaneness of my amendment.\n  I would like the Record to note that the moratorium that I proposed \nsimply amended last year's appropriations bill which terminated fishing \nin Glacier Bay. If the fisheries could be closed and the field of \nparticipants could be narrowed in an appropriation, then it was \ncertainly not out of place to use the same process for the Glacier Bay \namendment, which failed under the tabling motion. I think it was a \nlegitimate appropriation amendment. It set parameters for the \nexpenditure of funds to be appropriated. That is certainly a time-\nhonored, time-tested device.\n  I recognize all my colleagues were interested in saving their own \nindividual bills, those who are interested in steel, those who are \ninterested in oil guarantees; and, obviously, I was interested in \nsaving fishing in Glacier Bay for native people.\n  But, hopefully, there will be another day. I will continue to work to \nconvince my colleagues of the merits of my position. I particularly \nwant to thank and recognize the explanation offered by my senior \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, who had indicated to me sometime ago he \nwould move to table any amendments on this pending matter. That was \ncertainly addressed as well by Senator Byrd. I appreciate and respect \ntheir opinion.\n  We will still be fighting for the native people associated with \nfishing in Glacier Bay.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield to my good friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. As the distinguished Senator from Alaska will recall, I \nvoted with him previously. But as I explained earlier today, had we \namended this bill with a nongermane amendment, it would have killed the \niron and the oil and gas guarantee bill. It would have been dead. \nBecause the Speaker made no commitment to help bring up a bill that \nwould have other matters included in it. He only made his commitment \nwith regard to the iron and oil and gas guarantee. So I thank the \nSenator.\n  I had to vote against the Senator from Alaska on this occasion \nbecause I wanted to save the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly accept my good friend's explanation. I \nhope I will have another opportunity to bring the issue up and garner \nhis support on its merits.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today with mixed feelings. On one \nhand I desperately want to do everything possible to help out America's \noil patch. My state has lost thousands of jobs over the last decade and \nour small independent oil and gas producers are being forced out of the \nbusiness. Our oil towns are now ghost towns and oil development plans \nfor Montana are far and few between. I would love nothing more than to \nfind a way to help out this vital segment of Montana's economy.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe that the piece of legislation is the \nbest course of action. With all due respect to my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, I cannot support any legislation that dips us deeper into the \nSocial Security fund. We have made a stand. We will not continue to dip \ninto this fund and put a further cramp on a system already strained to \nits breaking point. One step here, another there, and the next thing \nyou know the pledge is gone, and along with it a promise I have made to \nmy fellow Montanans.\n  It is a hard, hard decision, but I know that Montanans will support \nme. I have already heard from many of them on this vote. I have called \nsome of my independent producers and asked them if this is the course \nof action they need us to take right now. Some of them originally \nsupported the program, but more often than not I heard an answer that \nmade me even more proud to know these men and women. They told me that \nthey don't want a handout, and this legislation doesn't address the \nheart of the problem. The problem in oil country is pretty simple. The \nfederal government is running us off the land and ensuring we can't \nmake a profit.\n  If you want to help the true independents out there, the Montana \nbusinesses, and the other producers who live in the communities, then \nyou better look at royalty relief and streamlining the process to keep \nour marginal wells in production. You need to let us get to the oil and \ngas, and you need to be there working with producers, not against them. \nThe Bureau of Land Management, the Department of the Interior, and the \nUnited States Forest Service need to change. We don't need to set up a \nloaning bureaucracy to place more restrictions on our producers and \nrope them into more capital investment in a market of uncertainty.\n  Passing this legislation without addressing the heart of the problem \nis the same as increasing someone's credit limit because they are on \nthe edge of bankruptcy. You have to address the problems of price and \naccess versus production cost, you can't just give them more lead rope \nand hope the market rebounds to allow them to repay their loans.\n  Additionally, the legislation before us says you are only eligible \nfor loans under this proposal if credit is not otherwise available, and \nyou can ensure repayment. Well, that sounds like we are talking out of \nboth sides of our mouths. To make matters worse, the legislation \ndictates that you have to let the General Accounting Office take a full \nlook at your company's records. Not many Montanans that I know want the \nfederal government having full access to their books as a bargaining \nchip in their effort to get a loan. The other big problem is that the \nGuarantee Board is made up of appointees of the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration. I believe the real problems facing our producers are \npolitical. Would this legislation only make this problem worse? The \nadministration has a known political agenda that is attempting to move \nall economic activity off our public lands. They are locking it up \npiece by piece. Will this agenda infect the decision process as to who \ngets loans? A lot of our interest is on public land and I don't want to \nhave to face the possibility that some of my producers would be \ndiscriminated against because they operate on public land.\n  I know that my colleagues who support this measure mean well, and \nthey are looking for a way to respond to the pain in the oil patch as \nquickly as possible, but this is not the way to do it. We need to rally \nbehind a consensus bill that gives tax relief and helps lower the cost \nof production. We need to stand firm on royalty rates, and we need to \ncontinue pushing our Cabinet agencies to stop running our producers off \nthe land. We can extract oil and gas responsibly, and our nation \ndepends on it. Unfortunately, the agenda of the current administration \nis blinded by politics and is set on completely ignoring the reality of \nwhat is good both for the West, and for the security of our nation.\n  No matter what the outcome of the vote today, I hope it does not \ndistract us from working together to find a real solution. If the \nlegislation passes, I don't want to hear that we have fixed the \nproblem. If it fails, I hope those of us who understand the problems \nfacing our oil and gas producers can come together and work towards \npassing legislation that goes to the core of the problem.\n  Mr. BREAUX. As a cochair of the Congressional Oil and Gas Forum, I \nwould like to take a few minutes to discuss the importance of America's \nsmall, independent oil and gas producers and the importance of this oil \nand gas loan guarantee program to their survival.\n  Over time, oil and gas production in the lower 48 states has become \nthe province of independent producers. The so-called majors are more \nlikely to operate in the offshore deepwater and in Alaska. The \nindependents' share of production in the continental U.S. has increased \nfrom about 45 percent in the mid-1980s to more than 60 percent in 1997.\n  Independents are a different element of the oil and gas production \nindustry than majors. Most producers operating in the lower 48 are \nsmall producers. They don't have the resources of majors such as \nrefineries and chemical operations to buffer them during periods of low \noil prices, such as those over the last year and a half.\n  As a result, independents finance their operations differently than \nmajors. Independents generate 35 percent of their capital primarily \nfrom financial institutions. Low oil prices have made banks reluctant \nto make loans to the industry. This program would unlock the access to \ncapital that is the lifeblood of this industry.\n  Independent producers have suffered significantly from the current \nprice crisis. These statistics show the impact low prices have had \nsince October 1997:\n  Domestic production has dropped below six million barrels per day--\nfrom 6.4 million to 5.8 million barrels per day. That's the lowest \nproduction since 1951.\n  More than 56,000 jobs lost out of an estimated 340,000 total industry \njobs--that's more than 16 percent.\n  Although prices are improving, an additional 20,000 oil and natural \ngas jobs are at risk of being lost.\n  Since October 1997, 136,000 oil wells (25 percent of the U.S. total) \nand 57,000 natural gas wells have shut down. Many will never operate \nagain.\n  Mr. President, $2.21 billion in lost federal royalties and state \nseverance and production taxes. In my state, falling royalty and \nseverance tax revenue have caused Governor Mike Foster to order a $30 \nmillion freeze on state government hiring and spending to head off a \nbudget shortfall. The rate of growth in Louisiana sales and personal \nincome taxes has fallen in recent months as laid-off energy workers \nreduce their spending.\n  Mr. President, $25 billion in lost economic impact associated with \nshut down oil and gas wells.\n  U.S. production down 651,000 barrels per day to 5.88 million, the \nlowest level since 1951.\n  Operating rig counts have hit historic lows. From November 1997 \nthrough April 1999, the domestic drilling rig count dropped 50 percent. \nThe rig count is a quick measure of the level of activity in the \nindustry. While most of this drop has been in the oil side of the \nbusiness--about a 60 percent drop--the natural gas side of the industry \nhas seen a 40 percent decline.\n  Capital budgets for oil and natural gas development are down 25-30 \npercent with the biggest cuts in the U.S. Most independents are \ndrilling new wells.\n  Faced with these stark problems, the oil and gas loan guarantee \nprogram provides a two-year, GATT-legal, $500 million guaranteed loan \nprogram to back loans provided by private financial institutions to \nqualified oil and gas producers and the associated oil and gas service \nindustry (drilling contractors, well service contractors, tubular \ngoods, etc.)\n  The OMB estimates that the program will cost $125 million. The cost \nis fully offset by funds from the Administration's travel budget.\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\n  Loan guarantees are an approach that the Federal Government has used \nto help recovery of key domestic industries or cities in times of \nsevere crisis. They have been used for Chrysler Corporation and New \nYork City. The Department of Agriculture operates an ongoing loan \nguarantee program for farmers that addresses their problems during low \ncommodity prices. Here, the concept would provide bridge financing to \nallow independent producers and the oil industry supply business to \nrecover from the current price crisis.\n  Independent producers throughout the country continue to suffer \nsevere economic distress. Recovery will be neither quick nor easy. This \nEmergency Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program will save jobs and \nbusinesses. It will contribute to the continued viability of the \nindependent producing industry and U.S. national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I cosponsored the oil and gas loan \nguarantee program on the emergency supplemental because I believe this \nis an important and necessary program to ensure independent producers \nare able to continue operating in the United States. This program is \navailable only to small producers who do not own refineries of any \nsize. No major oil company is eligible.\n  We are currently importing well over 50 percent of our oil needs. The \nEnergy Information Administration projects that by 2020 we will be \nimporting 65 percent of the oil we consume. The independent oil and gas \nproducers, those companies eligible for this program, have remained \ncommitted to domestic production. They are the backbone of our domestic \noil supply. They do not import oil, and they do not sell gasoline. \nEvery barrel these independents produce generates jobs, tax and royalty \nrevenues and eliminates another barrel of imports.\n  Oil prices were as low as $7 per barrel in New Mexico a few months \nago. Although prices have recovered somewhat, small producers were \ndevastated. In addition to the pending loan guarantee program, I \nbelieve we need to implement other policy changes to protect our \ndomestic production. Our tax and royalty policies need to be changed to \nensure independent oil and gas producers have enough cash flow so they \ncan avoid shutting in production again when prices fall as low as they \nwere recently.\n  I urge support for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for a third time.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for their work in the handling of \nthis legislation today. They made a lot of progress. We will vote on \nfinal passage first thing in the morning.\n  A number of Senators have asked about the plan for tomorrow. We do \ntake up the State Department authorization bill after we have final \npassage of this piece of legislation. There may be a necessary vote or \ntwo on amendments, but they will occur, hopefully, as early in the \nmorning as possible, but none later than 11:45. So any of you who have \nplans to leave at 11:45 or 12 noon, whatever, you will be able to do \nthat.\n  As usual, we announced we would have a vote or votes on this Friday, \nbut the votes will not occur beyond 12 noon. I hope it will be earlier \nthan that.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I only want to take a few seconds to thank the majority leader for \nbringing up the bill which the Senate has reached agreement on which \nwill be voted on tomorrow morning, the iron and oil and gas guarantee \nbill. The leader made a commitment to bring that bill up; he did not \nmake any commitment to pass it. He did not make any commitment to vote \nfor it. But he made a commitment to bring it up, and he has kept his \nword. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my own leader, and I thank Ted Stevens, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Domenici. They \nhave used their usual skill, good humor, and toughness. I think the \nNation is better off as a result.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I will take just a few moments this \nevening to address the Senate on an issue which our leader, Senator \nDaschle, and others, have spoken to the Senate about in the period of \nthese last few days. I would like to urge that the leadership here in \nthe Senate set a firm time for the consideration of legislation, which \nI believe is of central concern to families all over this country, \nknown as the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We have taken advantage of the opportunity in the Senate to make a \ncase for the consideration of this legislation. We are very mindful \nthat there are appropriations bills that have to be addressed, but I \nthink this is a matter which is of central importance and concern to \nall of the families of this country. It does seem to me that we ought \nto address this question and at least establish a timeframe for which \nthe Senate could debate and finalize its actions on this legislation.\n  I know there are probably Members wondering why there are several of \nus who are bringing this to the attention of the Senate again this \nevening. I would like to just review for the Senate membership what the \ntimeframe has been in the consideration of this legislation since the \nintroduction of the original Patients' Bill of Rights more than 2 years \nago.\n  When we introduced legislation in the Senate over 2 years ago, we \nthought we would have an opportunity to address it, at least in the \nfinal months or weeks of the last session. We were unable to do so. At \nthe very end of the session, the majority leader, at that time, \nindicated this would be a priority item for the consideration of the \nSenate.\n  I thought I would just review briefly tonight the key parts of this \nlegislation and why so many of us are anxious that we have the \nassurance by the leadership that this matter will be considered by a \ndate certain. If we secure a date, then members will know about it, and \nthe American people will understand it. They will be able to focus on \nthis extremely important health measure, which effectively, when all is \nsaid and done, will guarantee that medical decisions in this country \nare going to be made by the trained professionals and the patients they \nare treating and not be made by accountants in the various HMOs and \ninsurance companies. When you get right down to it, that is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced over 2 years ago. It was \nnever scheduled in the last Congress, despite our repeated efforts to \nbring it before the Senate. This year's track record is equally \ntroubling.\n  On January 19, the majority leader said on the floor of the Senate \nthat it was a priority. On January 27, in an address to the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the majority leader announced that he expected the \nbill to come up in May. On March 18, our Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\npassed a bill on a party-line vote, but a report has just filed today. \nWe passed the legislation out of our committee on March 18. Now we have \nApril 18, May 18, June 18 coming up tomorrow.\n  On April 15, the majority leader issued a list of bills to be \ncompleted by Memorial Day. The Patients' Bill of Rights was not even on \nthat list. On May 19, the majority leader told the National Journal \nthat he hoped to bring up the bill in June, that he had ordered the \nFinance Committee to move its portions of the bill. But that committee \nhas held 30 hearings this year, not one on the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and no markup is scheduled.\n  Then on May 27, just as the Memorial Day recess was starting, the \nmajority leader said at a press conference that he hoped it could be \nbrought up by the summer.\n  So we have gone from an announcement in January that it is a priority \nto a possible scheduling in May, to a possible scheduling in June, and \nnow it is something that might come up this summer. And just today, the \nRepublican leader said flatly that if we asked for a reasonable number \nof amendments, the answer was no. That is a quote from the majority \nleader in today's publication of Congress Daily.\n  We can say, well, what is this really all about? Why should we be \ngiving this consideration? We had the opportunity in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee to actually mark up a Patients' \nBill of Rights in March of this year. It was reported out over the \nopposition of a number of us on some very important measures.\n  I will review very quickly with the Members of the Senate in the time \nthat I have tonight--how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator has 3 minutes 8 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You can take 5 minutes from me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the 3 minutes then.\n  Mr. President, listed in this chart are the protections in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. First of all, the legislation that we favor \ncovers all 161 million Americans with private health insurance. Those \non the other side, whose legislation primarily favors so-called self-\nfunded programs, don't protect anyone in HMOs. But that's the issue \nhere. HMOs are making decisions on the basis of the bottom line rather \nthan the interests of the patients. We want to protect families. The \nRepublican proposal doesn't even cover those individuals in HMOs, \nbecause HMOs are not self-funded.\n  One amendment would allow the Senate to show whether we are really \ninterested in providing protection for all Americans who need it or \njust for one-third? It seems to me that could be an issue that wouldn't \ntake a great deal of time to be able to understand.\n  We heard very considerable debate on complicated issues here this \nafternoon and were able to make resolutions of those measures. \nCertainly we ought to be able to make a decision on the floor of the \nSenate whether we are interested in covering all Americans or whether \nwe are interested, as our friends are on the other side, in only \ncovering about a third of those.\n  So these issues on the chart are the principal differences between \nthe Republican proposal and the Democratic bill. We would make sure we \nare going to cover all the patients. We would make sure that we are \ngoing to guarantee that all patients, including children, are able to \nget the specialists that are needed to deal with their needs.\n\n  We are going to guarantee coverage for routine costs in certain \nclinical trials. I believe that the next century is going to be known \nas the century of life sciences. We are committed here, I believe, in \nthe Senate to doubling the research budget in the NIH. Why? Because of \nthe promises of breakthroughs in lifesaving drugs for cancer and \nParkinson's disease and Alzheimer's and other conditions. But to get \nthese breakthrough drugs, you have to provide clinical trials. Clinical \ntrials are a key element in terms of bringing the brilliance of our \nresearchers from the laboratory to the bedside.\n  We want to make sure that individuals who are afflicted with a \ndisease for which traditional treatments offer very little hope for \ntheir survival have access to the breakthroughs that can be achieved by \nclinical trials. If the medical doctor that is treating that patient \nrecommends a clinical trial, we are committed to making sure that \nclinical trial will be available for that mother, for that daughter, \nfor that child, for whomever it might be in the family that can benefit \nfrom it. That is one of the very important aspects in this debate.\n  It doesn't make a lot of sense on the one hand to be voting for \nbillions of dollars to support research at the NIH to discover \nbreakthrough therapies, but on the other hand not be able to use them. \nWe want to make sure that there is going to be a law, a guarantee, that \nencourages access for certain patients.\n  So, we will take the time in the Senate to go over a few of these \nissues each day and spell out exactly the kinds of protections that we \nthink are needed in a real Patients' Bill of Rights. There are not a \nlot of them.\n  When the minority leader indicated there would be probably 20 \namendments or so needed on our side, it is no secret what many of those \namendments would be. You can look right over this list and see the \nprotections that are guaranteed in our Patients' Bill of Rights and the \nfailings of the one that will be proposed by the opposition.\n  The bottom line is that over 200 organizations in this country, made \nup of the best of the medical profession, the best doctors, the best \nnurses, the patients' organizations, working families and others, \nuniversally and uniformly support our proposal. And the other side does \nnot have one, not one organization. There isn't a single medical \norganization in our country that supports their program. But 200 \nleading groups support ours. Not because it is Democrat or Republican. \nIt is because ours protects patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could, I ask unanimous consent to \nengage my friend on my time in a couple of questions, reserve the \nremainder of my time, and then ask the Senator from Illinois if he \nwould go, and then I will close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we thought there was a breakthrough from \nour majority leader. We believed we were going to have this Patients' \nBill of Rights before us soon. I know we did that with the gun bill. I \njust want to know where we stand on this. I was listening to my friend. \nIs it my understanding it is the position of the majority leader that \nhe would not agree to scheduling this Patients' Bill of Rights if we \nwould just offer 20 amendments to it? Is that it? Did he put out a \nnumber of amendments he would accept?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct, according to this \nmorning's edition of Congress Daily. The leader was here earlier this \nevening and has not refuted it. The Democratic leader has restated \nit. Here it is. He says, ``If they are still insisting on 20 \namendments, the answer is no.'' Then he says, ``We don't have but 2 \nweeks before the Fourth of July.''\n\n  But, as I understand it, there are some 52 or 53 amendments that are \nnow pending on the legislation we are calling up tomorrow, dealing with \nthe State Department authorization. So 52 amendments are OK for the \nState Department authorization, but our 20 amendments are not OK for \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Here they are, effectively, on this chart. There is no secret about \nwhat we are generally interested in addressing. There may be some \nchanges in some of the language. I think one of the ones that might be \nmissing is something on ``drive-through mastectomies,'' which is not \nspelled out here. But there is no secret here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, so that people in this country understand, \nwhen it comes to the State Department, which deals with other \ncountries, there doesn't seem to be any problem of the leadership with \nhaving 50-plus amendments. But when it comes to the reality and \neveryday life of our people who are not getting the quality health care \nthey deserve, who want to see HMOs held accountable,\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nwho want to be able to go to a specialist, who want to make sure they \nhave the information as to what all the possibilities of treatment are, \nwho want to make sure, if they are, for example, a woman and they go to \nan OB/GYN and all of those points on there, we can't have that. They \nwould add up to 20, 21 amendments, but we do not have agreement.\n  I think the American people ought to understand what is going on \nhere. I have to say, in my heart of hearts, as my friend points out, \nevery responsible organization that deals with health care supports \nthis Patients' Bill of Rights--the Democrats' version. So one can only \nconclude it is the special interests on the other side that are \nblocking this proposal from coming to the floor. I can't come up with \nany other answer. I wonder if my friend can.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. I mentioned a moment ago--\nbut it bears repeating--that we had the assurance by the majority \nleader on January 19 and January 27 that this would be a priority, and \nwe expected the bill to come up in May. On March 18, we acted in our \nHealth and Education Committee and reported out what I consider to be a \n``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' It doesn't provide the protections \nAmerican patients need. But we ought to have whatever is going to be \nused out here so we can debate it. The bill from our committee was just \nfiled today. They have had half of March, all of April, May, and half \nof June--3 months. That gives an indication of what the attitude and \natmosphere is here in terms of acting on something that is of central \nimportance to protecting families across this country.\n  And then, finally, as we heard today, it isn't just to the Senator \nfrom California, or from Illinois, or the Senator from Massachusetts, \nbut they are saying no to the families in this country: No, you are not \ngoing to be able to have those protections considered. No, you are not \ngoing to be able to bring this up. We heard last year from those on the \nother side of the aisle that we are not going to let you decide what \nthe agenda is going to be.\n  All we are trying to do is the people's business. It is the business \nthat has been supported by virtually every single major medical and \npatient organization. It is their business, and their treatment. It is \neach family's business. That is why I wonder whether the Senator from \nCalifornia, like myself, is troubled by the fact that we can't get this \nlegislation up, why we get a refusal to consider this proposal.\n  If I could ask the Senator, does the Senator remember that the \nDemocratic leader indicated that, as far as speaking for the Democrats, \nwe could go on sort of a dual track. If it was the judgment of the \nRepublican leadership that we could do their agenda, I know I would be \nhere through the afternoon tomorrow and through the afternoon on \nSaturday, or in the evenings, of course, next week. We could certainly \nget a debate and discussion on the various 20 or so amendments needed \nto pass a good bill. And I am wondering if the Senator from California \nor the Senator from Illinois remembers when that proposal was put \nforward. I have been here a number of times when we have followed that \nprocedure.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I just heard Senator Daschle propose again that we \nhave a late shift. He said many Americans, after they work their day \nshift, work a late shift. Why don't we do it here in the Senate? Here \nwe are, the Senator from Utah is in the Chair, and he is always ready \nto work; he is a great worker. We are here ready to work. The people \nwant us to do the business.\n  I will close my question this way. This happened once before on the \nminimum wage. I hope the Senate remembers the ending of that. When the \nSenator from Massachusetts decides to take all his energy and put it to \nan issue, and we come around and we put our energy and spirit behind an \nissue, what happens is that eventually the issue will be heard. We did \nit with the minimum wage. It was a horrible situation, trying to get \nthat before the Senate. But I think we know how to do it. As the \nSenator from Massachusetts said, if this wasn't an important issue, we \nwould fail in our effort. If this was a frivolous matter, we wouldn't \nwin. But it is important every single day to people.\n  I have case after case in California--and I hear them coming from \naround the country--where you have a little child who is your pride and \njoy. Suddenly, a terrible disease hits and an HMO says: You don't need \na pediatric specialist; take him to our cancer specialist. They ask: \nHas the cancer specialist ever operated on a child before? The answer \nis: No, but he is good. They say: No; I want the best for my child. I \nwant somebody who knows what it is to examine a little body. Children \nare not little adults; they are changing, they are growing, they are \ndifferent. I, on the other hand, am a little adult, but a child is \ndifferent and they need to have specialties.\n  Under the bill the Democrats are supporting, that would be a fact. \nYou would have the right to have someone who knows what they are doing. \nIf you want to get a tooth pulled, you don't go to a foot doctor. If \nyou want to treat a child, you go to a pediatric specialist. So this is \nserious.\n  I am so happy to be part of this little trio tonight.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, the proposal advanced by our \nRepublican friends is so bad that you can't even appeal the rights it \npurports to guarantee. If, for example, you had a child whose doctor \nrecommended a cancer specialist--a pediatric oncologist--and the HMO \nrejected it, by saying, ``No, we are not going to allow you to see that \nspecialist, even if the doctor recommended it,'' and the parent said, \n``Well, I want to appeal''; under the proposal reported out of the \nLabor Committee, that family has no right of appeal, because the right \nof appeal is defined to deal only with certain decisions and not with \nregard to individuals' access to specialists. So it effectively \nexcludes from the appeal system a whole range of care and protection \nthat it claims to provide. That is rather a technical aspect. That may \ntake a little time to debate. We can certainly vote on that. But not \nonly don't you get the specialist, you don't even have a right to \nappeal it even if the doctor says this is what your child needs.\n  I can say, from a personal point of view, how important these \nprovisions are. My son had cancer, osteosarcoma, and he was given \nlittle chance in terms of survival. They told him he needed a pediatric \noncologist, and he was able to participate in a clinical trial that \nworked miracles for him and the other children who participated in it.\n  Members of the Senate always have very good insurance. We can get \ninto clinical trials, and we can have our specialists. It is always \ninteresting to me that some Members can vote no on these protections \nwhen they have it themselves. Then some Members wonder why people are \ncynical about how they view Members of the Congress.\n  As you well know, when you become a Member of the Senate, you fill \nout that little card so you can have the health care coverage that is \navailable to Federal employees. You don't have to take it. But I bet \nthere isn't a Member of the Senate who has refused it.\n  Yet, they are prepared to deny Americans across the country the kind \nof protections we have, and that our families have. They don't want to \ndebate this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues from \nCalifornia and Massachusetts. We were on the floor about a month ago \nand decided that we would like to have the Senate debate the gun issue. \nI remember the day very well. The majority leader, Senator Lott, came \nto the floor and said: You will have your wish. In 2 weeks you will get \na vote.\n  Most people view that as a very historic debate, as America was \nliterally emotionally wrenched over the Littleton, CO, tragedy.\n  We, finally after a few weeks, addressed it on the floor of the \nSenate in a debate which culminated in the passage of sensible gun \ncontrol legislation, when the Vice President of the United States, Al \nGore, cast the deciding vote.\n  We come to the floor this evening, as we have before and will in the \nfuture, to urge the leadership of the Senate to again address the issue \nwhich is on the minds of American families nationwide.\n  Senator Kennedy made an excellent point. We are blessed as Members of\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\nthe Senate. We are blessed by being considered Federal employees. As \nFederal employees, we have access to health care, which very few people \nin America have.\n  Imagine this for a moment. Once a year, we have open enrollment. We \nget to make a choice of medical plans. What do we want for our \nfamilies?\n  There is a Congressman now who serves from the State of South \nCarolina in the House of Representatives who decided at age 60 that he \nwanted a lung transplant. He waited until open enrollment and enrolled \nin a plan which would cover a lung transplant for him at the age of 60. \nHe signed up for it and went through the operation successfully, and \nstill serves in the U.S. House of Representatives. This was 6 or 8 \nyears ago. But he was able to shop for his health insurance. What a \nluxury.\n  How many Americans can do that? Those of us in the Senate and most \nFederal employees have that option. What we are talking about is giving \nthis kind of protection and this kind of option to many different \nAmericans when it comes to the quality of their own health care.\n  When we asked the Rand Corporation how important this issue is, they \ntold us that 115 million Americans either have had a problem with their \nmanaged care insurance, or a member of their family has had a problem. \nThis is a real concern.\n  Do you remember the movie ``As Good As It Gets'' with Jack Nicholson \nand Helen Hunt? She was so good in that movie and had a little boy \nsuffering from asthma. There was this great scene in the movie where \nJack Nicholson decides to pay for a specialist to come see her little \nboy at their apartment. They are sitting at the table, and Helen Hunt \ndecides to give, in her own earthy way, an expletive definition of \nmanaged care. In every movie theater that I have been to where that \nmovie is shown the people started applauding. She knows what she is \ntalking about.\n  Arbitrary decisions that are being made by bureaucrats and clerks in \ninsurance companies are not good for you or your family.\n  Senator Kennedy is talking about the Democratic Patients' Bill of \nRights. Senator Boxer of California spelled out the difference between \nthese two.\n  It gets down to some fundamental things. When you look at it, think \nabout this.\n  An internist from my hometown of Springfield, IL, a town of about \n110,000 people with two excellent hospitals comes in to talk to me. We \nare in a conversation. He says: You know, I am treating more and more \npatients for depression. It is something that seems to bother a lot of \npeople, and thank goodness we have many ways to treat it with drugs and \ntherapies that work. He says: You know, a lot of my patients are \nconcerned if it gets into part of their medical record that they have \nbeen treated for chronic depression. He says: Of course, they know that \nif they are in a position where they have to apply for health insurance \nin the future they may be turned down because they have ``a mental \nillness,'' a chronic depression, a very common malady among American \npeople.\n  Shouldn't we during the course of this debate on a Patients' Bill of \nRights talk about this kind of prejudice and discrimination against \npeople who have chronic depression? This is something that affects \nevery family. It could.\n  When we talk about access to health care--Senator Kennedy made this \npoint, and Senator Boxer as well--the difference between the Republican \nplan and the Democratic plan is graphic. The Republican plan excludes \nmore than 100 million Americans from protections we are talking about. \nThey cover people that are in a self-funded employer health insurance \nplan, about 48 million Americans. But look who is left behind--15 \nmillion Americans buying individual policies, 23 million State and \nlocal government workers, 75 million people whose employers provide \ncoverage through an insurance policy, or an HMO, 75 million people \nwritten out of the Republican plan. They leave behind 113 million \nAmericans.\n  If we are talking about a real bill that addresses the concern of \nreal American families, it should include all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Basically, the self-funded plans are primarily the \nlargest businesses. Looking at this another way, you will find that \npeople left out of the Republican plan are schoolteachers, police \nofficers, social workers, and small business men and women. How many \nsmall businesses have self-funded programs? Virtually none.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And farmers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And farmers. These are the ones that aren't included in \nthe majority's proposal. These are the ones that the statistics confirm \nwhat the Senator from Illinois has said. But when you look behind those \nstatistics about who is covered and who isn't covered, you will find \nthat it is the working families, the small business men and women, and \nthe farmers and the workers who are the ones that aren't included. They \ncertainly should be protected as well as everyone else.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. His point is well \ntaken.\n  Before we end this debate, let's stop talking about health for a \nminute and let's talk about politics.\n  If this is such an important issue, and the debate on this issue is \nreally one where we could have some debates, why are we not considering \nit on the floor of the Senate?\n  We spent 5 days debating protection for computer companies against \nlawsuits--5 days to protect these computer companies. It is an \nimportant debate. Can't we spend 5 hours talking about protecting \nAmerican families when it comes to their health insurance? We are \nafraid of amendments, the Republicans say. We want to make sure that we \nhave a limited number of amendments--no more than 20 on the side. In \nfact, that may be too many.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, on the next bill we will consider there are \nover 50 amendments. We haven't disqualified that bill from \nconsideration. We understand that it is important that we do our \nbusiness and debate these things and vote on them.\n  The bottom line here is that there are Members on the other side of \nthe aisle who do not want to face votes on these issues. They don't \nwant to have to go home and explain why they stood with the insurance \ncompanies and voted against the people they are supposed to represent--\nthe families, the consumers, those who are literally worried on a day-\nto-day basis as to whether they have health insurance protection.\n  I think, frankly, they have to face their responsibility on this side \nof the aisle as we do on our side of the aisle, a responsibility to \nface a tougher vote, make a choice, go home, and defend your vote. That \nis the nature of this government.\n  For them to try to construct some sort of a strategy on the floor to \nprotect themselves from criticism is at the expense of the families \nacross America who do not have adequate health insurance and expect \nCongress to do something to protect them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his eloquence on this point.\n  When he said we spent 5 days taking care of the computer industry, I \ncome from the Silicon Valley. I love those people. They are good \npeople. They are the best employers. As a matter of fact, I thought it \nwas a bit insulting to them to think that they need to have all of this \nspecial help from us. I think they are going to take care of the \nproblem and stand up to the challenge. They are wonderful people. We \ntook care of them with days of debate. We took care of the steel \ncompanies. We just did that. Oil companies--just did that.\n\n  I am sitting here thinking what about all these people who write us \nevery day.\n  I want to ask the Senator a question. Is it not his understanding--\nbecause the Senator said this before, and I want the Senator to expound \non it--that there are only two groups in America today who cannot be \nheld accountable in a court of law? Could the Senator talk about who \nthose groups are?\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Every one of us as individuals and businesses can be held \naccountable for our actions. That is understandable. You go out and \ndrink too much, drive a car, get in an accident, and you might be sued. \nThere are two groups, though, that are spared this: foreign diplomats \nand health insurance companies.\n  Why in the world would we carve out this kind of protection from \nliability for this group of health insurance companies? If they make \nthe wrong decision on coverage, and it is your child who ends up not \ngetting adequate care, or getting a bad medical result, who should be \nheld responsible--the doctor, the hospital, or the insurance company \nthat made the basic decision? I think the insurance company should.\n  Frankly, if they are held accountable, they will think twice about \nmaking the wrong decision. They will make certain that children have \naccess to specialists they need, that people can go to emergency rooms \nclose to home, and when there is a medical necessity there is a \ncontinuity of care. If your employer changes health insurance, you have \nan opportunity to keep that doctor who is so important to you.\n\n  One of the most humbling experiences in my life--in the life of \nvirtually anyone--is to sit in a waiting room in a hospital waiting to \nhear about the surgery on your child. Senator Kennedy has been through \nthat. I have been through that. It is something I will never forget. \nYou realize that everything you hold dear and close is in the hands of \npeople you have to trust to be the very best specialists, well-trained \nmedical technicians trying to save or improve the life of someone you \nlove so very much.\n  I think at those moments in our life when we are so vulnerable and \npray that we have the very best and brightest helping our children and \nhelping members of the family we love so much, to do the job and do the \nright thing and bring them home, we need to have the confidence that we \nhave a system that works.\n  Over 100 million Americans today question whether this system works. \nThey question whether that doctor they want to trust can tell them \neverything they need to know. They question whether that hospital \nmaking a decision can make that decision without worrying about some \ninsurance clerk in some faraway city.\n  If we do nothing else in the 106th Congress, shouldn't we address \nthis basic gut issue that American families worry about on a day-to-day \nbasis? The 105th Congress came and went with a record no one remembers. \nThis Congress has a chance to act. We may debate a lot of things on the \nfloor of the Senate, but if we don't take up this very fundamental \nissue, we are missing our responsibility.\n  This Congress should not be toiling in an atmosphere of partisanship. \nIt shouldn't be afraid to face tough issues. It should come forward and \nvote for the Patients' Bill of Rights, as Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBoxer have said, to make sure families across America receive the \nprotection they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will address the same subject that my \nsenior colleague from Massachusetts and the Senators from California \nand Illinois have talked about: The Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Our health care system has been a remarkably successful system. We \ncan't forget the fact that over the years the idea of people living \nlonger and healthier has become a reality.\n  When I was a little boy, all the kids in my neighborhood would come \naround and press their foreheads to the kitchen window because in our \nhome sat a curiosity, in a certain sense. It was my great grandmother; \nshe was over 80. In the neighborhood, everybody said she was the oldest \nlady in the world. They hadn't seen anybody over 80. It was a rarity.\n  These days, of course, somebody who lives over 80 is, thank God, \nrather commonplace. In fact, on the ``Today Show'' they used to \nannounce people who celebrated their 80th birthday; then they announced \nthe 90th birthdays; and now they announce the 100th and 105th \nbirthdays. That is, in good part, because of our health care system.\n  It is a good health care system, there is no question. However, over \nthe last several years it has developed some problems that can be \nfixed. These are not the intractable problems of how we pay for the \ncosts of new operations that cost tens of thousands and even hundreds \nof thousands of dollars.\n  What happened is very simple. Costs were going up. We were basically \ninvolved in a cost-plus system. As a result, HMOs developed. HMOs had a \ngood purpose. They were going to ``rationalize'' the health care \nsystem. They were going to keep costs down so that the providers could \nnot raise costs willy-nilly and have a third party pay.\n  For a while it worked. Costs did decline. It is one of the reasons \nthat our budget is in better shape today than it has been.\n  However, the pendulum swung too far. In a good effort to reduce \ncosts, HMOs began to go too far. They started assigning important, \noften life-and-death decisions. They started taking those decisions out \nof the hands of physicians, out of the hands of hospitals, out of the \nhands of trained personnel, and putting them in the hands of actuaries.\n  As a result, day after day after day, injustices are done. We hear \nstories such as the one I told on the floor a couple of days ago about \nthe young nurse who can barely walk because her HMO would not provide \nher with an orthopedic oncologist. Instead, she went to a regular \northopedic surgeon. The surgery was performed not well. The tumor grew \nback. She had to go to an orthopedic oncologist.\n  How about a simple case where somebody has cancer. The HMO says yes, \nthat is covered. Because of the cancer, they cannot swallow; they \ncannot eat. The HMO's decision of no dietary supplements being allowed \nis a ridiculous decision.\n  How about the times when people go to an emergency room and are told: \nYou are not covered; go somewhere else.\n  Or when woman after woman after woman is again turned away from going \nto an obstetrician or gynecologist. A woman is told that osteoporosis, \na common woman's disease, is not covered by the HMO, even though \ndiseases that would be just as frequent in men are covered.\n  On issue after issue after issue, every day across America, scores of \npeople--perhaps hundreds of people--are sitting there in awful \nsituations and are told that not only do they have to deal with their \nillness but they have to deal with an unfair HMO.\n  What we seek to do, led by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, is \nsimply to redress that imbalance. This is not radical surgery. We are \nnot trying to totally change the system. We are not even trying to \neliminate HMOs. We are simply trying to put in place some basic rules \nof fairness that seem to most Americans to be called for. We are simply \ntrying to say that the pendulum, which has swung so far over on the \nside of the actuaries, should move a little bit back to the middle. We \nare attempting to keep the best parts of HMOs, which deal with cost \nsavings, and at the same time get rid of their most egregious \nviolations. We are on the floor of the Senate simply asking for a \nchance to debate those issues.\n  I have now been in the Senate close to 6 months. We had some historic \nmoments in the first few months. Since then, it seems to me no issue is \nbeing asked to be debated more, to be discussed, to be legislated upon \nthan this subject. Yet we are told we can't do it. It just does not \nmake sense.\n  So we must come to the floor of the Senate in the early hours of the \nmorning or the later hours of the evening and make our case. We \nshouldn't have to. This is a deliberative body that has been known for \nits great debates, that has been known for the fact that, if a group of \nSenators feels strongly about an issue, they will get to debate it and \nvote on it. That has been the tradition for the 200-some-odd glorious \nyears of this body. It is being thwarted on an issue of great \nimportance.\n  I am sure most of my colleagues in this body do not agree with every \nposition I hold, and I don't agree with every position they hold on \nHMOs. How in the name of fairness can we refuse to debate the \nissue? How can we refuse that young nurse who really needs the \northopedic oncologist or that cancer victim who needs dietary \nsupplements or that woman who needs help with\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\nosteoporosis? How can we refuse, at least through their elective \nRepresentatives, to let their voices be heard?\n\n  So we debate tonight simply asking for some vital things. We ask for \nthe ability of patients to be treated in the emergency room wherever \nthat emergency occurs. We ask for the ability of people to get the \nspecialists that are medically called for and that they need, not for \nexcessive use, not for things they do not need, but for things they \nneed. We ask, if that HMO makes an egregious and reckless mistake, for \nthe ability to sue it, not out of malice but out of fairness, out of \nrecompense, and out of a desire to correct an abuse that may have \noccurred.\n  As I mentioned, these are not large demands in the grand scheme of \nthings, but they are very important to millions of Americans who either \nhave an ill loved one, or have an illness themselves, or who worry that \nthey might.\n  So I ask, and I am joined by so many of my colleagues, particularly \nthose of us on this side of the aisle, I ask the majority leader to \nallow this issue to come to the floor, to allow a full and open debate. \nI do not know what the results will be, but I can tell you this: If we \ndo that, we will be, indeed, fulfilling our obligation as the people's \nSenators, as the people's Representatives, and we will be living up to \nthe fine and high traditions of this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hoped to get over here prior to the \ntime my colleagues left the floor, but let me compliment Senators \nKennedy, Durbin, Boxer, Schumer, and others who participated in the \ncolloquy this afternoon on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are very \nhopeful that over the course of the next two weeks the Senate can reach \nan agreement on proceeding to the bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We will be more than happy to enter into negotiations with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle with one understanding, that \nwe have the opportunity to offer amendments. In fact, we have suggested \nat least 20 amendments to ensure that we have a good debate. We don't \nwant to have a sham debate on something of this import. On a bill that \nwe will take up tomorrow, the State Department authorization bill, both \nsides have agreed to consider 52 amendments. We passed the Defense \nauthorization bill a month ago, and we agreed to over 100 amendments. \nWe have reached an agreement on virtually every bill that has come to \nthe floor. In fact, the juvenile justice bill had 35 amendments with \nover 18 rollcall votes.\n  But I think the key question is, if tomorrow we can agree, as \nRepublicans and Democrats, to consider 52 amendments on a bill that \nhas, frankly, very little relevance to the day-to-day lives of every \nAmerican, as important as it is for other reasons, then, my goodness, \nit would seem to me we could agree to 20 amendments on the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  One of the amendments we feel very strongly about offering is an \namendment to expand the scope of the bill. I just want to talk briefly \nabout that before I move to another issue. Probably the single biggest \ndifference--I won't say the only big difference, because there are \nmany--but one of the most important differences between the Republican \nbill and the Democratic bill has to do with what we call scope. By \nscope, we simply mean who is covered.\n  By everybody's recognition, the Republican bill covers 48 million \nAmericans. Those 48 million Americans fall into one category: those \nemployed by large businesses that are self-insured. Those are the only \nAmerican people today who are covered under the Republican bill.\n  I have a chart. This is so important. This chart says it so well. \nThis chart shows what the Republican bill does not do, and why we feel \nso strongly about offering amendments. Mr. President, 48 million \nAmericans are covered through a plan that self-funds insurance within \nthe company. Here are all the people who are not covered; 75 million \nAmericans are not covered who have individual insurance policies or an \nHMO that is purchased but not funded by their employer. In other words, \nif you are an employee of a company with self-funded insurance, you are \ncovered. If you work for an employer who contracts with an insurance \ncompany or an HMO, you are not covered.\n  There are only 48 million people in that category--those who work for \na self-insured employer. There are 75 million Americans who are working \nfor employers who purchase their insurance through separately-funded \ninsurance companies and HMOs. There are another 23 million Americans \nwho have their insurance through their jobs in State and local \ngovernments, and then there are 15 million Americans who have \nindividual insurance plans. All of those people are not covered in the \nRepublican plan. Two-thirds of all of those with health insurance are \nnot covered.\n  I do not know why they would not be covered under the Republican \nplan. I am sure our Republican colleagues have a good rationale for not \nincluding all of these people. I have heard them say they are covered \nin some of the State plans. That is the problem.\n  What if you move from one State to another? The average American \nfamily now moves three times in the life of the family as children are \ngrowing up. What if you move? What if you get transferred? You may not \nbe covered. How do you know? Are you going to call the State capital \nand find out? We say: Cover them all. Cover all 75 million Americans \nwho are working for companies that have insurance coverage. Cover all \nState and local government employees. Cover all people who have \nindividual policies and, yes, cover everybody who is working for a \nself-insured company.\n  That is just one of the many differences--and we want to talk more \nabout that in the future--but it is why we ought to have amendments. \nSome suggest let's just have an up-or-down vote on the Republican bill \nand an up-or-down vote on the Democratic bill. That will not cut it. We \nwill not have an opportunity to talk about issues like this.\n  I really hope we will have the opportunity to have that debate in the \nnext 2 weeks. We will have the opportunity, because if we cannot get an \nagreement, we will be forced then to offer it as an amendment to \nanother bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7208-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7208-S7209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     WHO CALLS THE SHOTS ON CAPITOL HILL, THE GUN LOBBY OR AVERAGE \n                               AMERICANS?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to briefly talk about another \nissue, because it is pending in the House at this time and I think it \nis very important to talk about the gun control issue.\n  Last month, the day before the Senate voted to close the gun show \nloophole, a prominent Republican Senator made a prediction. He said it \nreally did not matter how the Senate voted, because the House would \nwater down any gun restrictions we pass.\n  That is what was predicted. The gun lobby and its supporters in the \nHouse have now made good on that threat. But even though we were \nwarned, we are still stunned that the power of one lobbyist \norganization can be so demonstrably effective as they appear to have \nbeen thus far.\n  The gun lobby's approach to gun control in the Senate was a sham. It \nis a sham in the House. The first House Republican leadership \nannouncement was that they would divide the juvenile bill into two \nseparate bills: one focusing on youth crime and culture, the other on \ngun control.\n\n  We all recognize what that announcement was. It was a move to dilute \nor even kill the modest gun control measures that had passed in the \nSenate just a few short weeks ago. Now the House Republican leadership \nhas decided not to bring its sham bill to the floor of the House until \n8 o'clock tonight, well after the evening news. I think we know why. \nThe pro-gun forces clearly do not want the American public to know what \nis going to happen after 8 o'clock tonight.\n  It may be after 8 o'clock tonight when the House begins its gun \ndebate, but it is certainly high noon for those of us who care about \nthis issue. It is time we find out who is going to win\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\nthis showdown: the gun lobby or the American people.\n  Littleton, CO, marked a turning point for most Americans, and now we \nwill find out if it marked a turning point for the pro-gun forces on \nCapitol Hill--or if it is just business as usual. Are we going to make \nit harder for children and criminals to get guns--or easier? Is it as \ndramatic a moment, is it as clear a choice as many of us in the Senate \nbelieve it is?\n  Today, we are warning those who are about to vote in the House: The \ngun lobby tried every excuse and half-measure they could come up with \nto defeat the modest restrictions in the Senate, and they failed.\n  Why? Because we know what America wants. America wants to close the \ngun show loophole. Sham proposals that do not cover all gun shows and \nallow criminals to get guns are not enough. Weak measures that only \nallow 24--or even 72 hours--are not enough. Law enforcement must have \nup to three business days to complete background checks, when \nnecessary, to make sure that guns do not end up in the hands of \ncriminals. Nothing less is acceptable.\n  The gun lobby says it is, but I guarantee that any family who has \nlost a child to gun violence will disagree. Listen to your conscience \nand your constituents, not to the extremist wing of the gun lobby.\n  I come from gun country. Most South Dakotans feel pretty strongly \nabout guns. They are part of our culture, our heritage. I have owned a \ngun since I was 8 years old. But even in South Dakota, the vast \nmajority of people believe we need to do more to keep guns out of the \nhands of children and criminals.\n  Tonight, the House of Representatives has a chance to build on the \nconscientious proposals that passed in the Senate. It is a narrow \nwindow of opportunity for Congress to act in a way that will make a \nreal difference for our children and for our communities. Let us \nlisten, let us stop the maneuvering, let us do something now. Tonight \nis the night. Mr. President, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 3 \no'clock, it does not matter. Do the right thing. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7209-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7209-S7211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENDING ABUSIVE AND EXPLOITATIVE CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to speak about \nwhy I was necessarily absent from voting yesterday and explain how I \nwould have voted had I been here.\n  For the better part of a decade, I have been working to help end \nabusive and exploitative child labor around the globe and even in our \nbackyard. I have come to the floor many times over the last several \nyears to speak about this issue, submitting resolutions, working with \nthe International Labor Organization, and others, to do what we can to \nend abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  The ILO, the International Labor Organization, estimates that 250 \nmillion children worldwide are economically active--that means they are \nworking--and many work in dangerous environments which are detrimental \nto their emotional, physical, and moral well-being.\n  Yesterday was a very historic day. For the first time in the 80-year \nhistory of the International Labor Organization, the President of the \nUnited States addressed that body. The President traveled to Geneva and \nasked me to accompany him because of my work on this issue.\n  I cannot really find the words to describe the impact of the \nPresident of the United States standing in front of a couple thousand \npeople, all of whom have been working for years to end child labor, \nspeaking as the President of the United States--it was the first time \nin the history of the ILO that a President ever spoke to this \norganization--about one issue: child labor.\n  I could not have been more proud of our Nation and of President \nClinton for the words he spoke, for the position he took on this issue. \nHe endorsed this new convention. There is a new convention that was \njust signed today, a new convention to end the most abusive and \nexploitative forms of child labor around the globe. We were there. We \nsigned it at the meeting. I am hopeful the President will very soon \ntransmit this new convention to the Senate for ratification.\n  It was a great speech President Clinton gave to the ILO. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the address by the \nPresident of the United States to the International Labor Organization \nin Geneva, Switzerland, on June 16.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by the President to the International Labor Organization \nConference, United Nations Building, Geneva, Switzerland, June 16, 1999\n\n       The PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Director General \n     Somavia, for your fine statement and your excellent work.\n       Conference President Mumuni, Director General Petrovsky, \n     ladies and gentlemen of the ILO: It is a great honor for me \n     to be here today with, as you have noticed, quite a large \n     American delegation. I hope you will take it as a commitment \n     of the United States to our shared vision, and not simply as \n     a burning desire for us to visit this beautiful city on every \n     possible opportunity.\n       I am delighted to be here with Secretary Albright and \n     Secretary of Labor Herman; with my National Economic Advisor \n     Gene Sperling, and my National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. \n     We're delighted to be joined by the President of the American \n     Federation of Labor, the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, and several \n     other leaders of the U.S. labor movement; and with Senator \n     Tom Harkin from Iowa who is the foremost advocate in the \n     United States of the abolition of child labor. I am grateful \n     to all of them for coming with me, and to the First Lady and \n     our daughter for joining us on this trip. And I thank you for \n     your warm reception of her presence here.\n       It is indeed an honor for me to be the first American \n     President to speak before the ILO in Geneva. It is long \n     overdue. There is no organization that has worked harder to \n     bring people together around fundamental human aspirations, \n     and no organization whose mission is more vital for today and \n     tomorrow.\n       The ILO, as the Director General said, was created in the \n     wake of the devastation of World War I as part of a vision to \n     provide stability to a world recovering from war, a vision \n     put forward by our President, Woodrow Wilson. He said then, \n     ``While we are fighting for freedom we must see that labor is \n     free.'' At a time when dangerous doctrines of dictatorship \n     were increasingly appealing the ILO was founded on the \n     realization that injustice produces, and I quote, ``unrest so \n     great that the peace and harmony of the world are \n     imperiled.''\n       Over time the organization was strengthened, and the United \n     States played its role, starting with President Franklin \n     Roosevelt and following through his successors and many \n     others in the United States Congress, down to the strong \n     supporters today, including Senator Harkin and the \n     distinguished senior Senator from New York, Patrick Moynihan.\n       For half a century, the ILO has waged a struggle of rising \n     prosperity and widening freedom, from the shipyards of Poland \n     to the diamond mines of South Africa. Today, as the Director \n     General said, you remain the only organization to bring \n     together governments, labor unions and business, to try to \n     unite people in common cause--the dignity of work, the belief \n     that honest labor, fairly compensated, gives meaning and \n     structure to our lives; the ability of every family and all \n     children to rise as far as their talents will take them.\n       In a world too often divided, this organization has been a \n     powerful force for unity, justice, equality and shared \n     prosperity. For all that, I thank you. Now, at the edge of a \n     new century, at the dawn of the information Age, the ILO and \n     its vision are more vital than ever--for the world is \n     becoming a much smaller and much, much more interdependent \n     place. Most nations are linked to the new dynamic, idea-\n     driven, technology-powered, highly competitive international \n     economy.\n       In digital revolution is a profound, powerful and \n     potentially democratizing force. It can empower people and \n     nations, enabling the wise and far-sighted to develop more \n     quickly and with less damage to the environment. It can \n     enable us to work together across the world as easily as if \n     we were working just across the hall. Competition, \n     communications and more open markets spur stunning innovation \n     and make their fruits available to business and workers \n     worldwide.\n       Consider this; Every single day, half a million air \n     passengers, 1.5 billion e-mail messages and $1.5 trillion \n     cross international borders. We also have new tools to \n     eradicate diseases that have long plagued humanity, to remove \n     the threat of global warming and environmental destruction, \n     to lift billions of people into the first truly global middle \n     class.\n       Yet, as the financial crisis of the last two years has \n     shown, the global economy with its churning, hyperactivity, \n     poses new risks, as well, of disruption, dislocation and \n     division. A financial crisis in one country can be felt on \n     factory floors half a world away. The world has changed, much \n     of it for the better, but too often our response to its new \n     challenges has not changed.\n       Globalization is not a proposal or a policy choice, it is a \n     fact. But how we respond to it\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\n     will make all the difference. We cannot dam up the tides of \n     economic change anymore than King Knute* could still the \n     waters. Nor can we tell our people to sink or swim on their \n     own. We must find a new way--a new and democratic way--to \n     maximize market potential and social justice, competition and \n     community. We must put a human face on the global \n     economy, giving working people everywhere a stake in its \n     success, equipping them all to reap its rewards, providing \n     for their families the basic conditions of a just society. \n     All nations must embrace this vision, and all the great \n     economic institutions of the world must devote their \n     creativity and energy to this end.\n       Last May I had the opportunity to come and speak to the \n     World Trade Organization and stress that as we fight for open \n     markets, it must open its doors to the concerns of working \n     people and the environment. Last November, I spoke to the \n     International Monetary Fund and World Bank and stressed that \n     we must build a new financial architecture as modern as \n     today's markets, to tame the cycles of boom and bust in the \n     global economy as we can now do in national economies; to \n     ensure the integrity of international financial transactions; \n     and to expand social safety nets for the most vulnerable.\n       Today I say to you that the ILO, too, must be ready for the \n     21st century, along the lines that Director General Somavia \n     has outlined.\n       Let me begin by stating my firm belief that open trade is \n     not contrary to the interest of working people. Competition \n     and integration lead to stronger growth, more and better \n     jobs, more widely shared gains. Renewed protectionism in any \n     of our nations would lead to a spiral of retaliation that \n     would diminish the standard of living for working people \n     everywhere. Moreover, a failure to expand trade further could \n     choke off innovation and diminish the very possibilities of \n     the information economy. No, we need more trade, not less.\n       Unfortunately, working people the world over do not believe \n     this. Even in the United States, with the lowest unemployment \n     rate in a generation, where exports accounted for 30 percent \n     of our growth until the financial crisis hit Asia, working \n     people strongly resist new market-opening measures. There are \n     many reasons. In advanced countries the benefits of open \n     trade outweigh the burdens. But they are widely spread, while \n     the dislocations of open trade are painfully concentrated.\n       In all countries, the premium the modern economy places on \n     skills leaves too many hard-working people behind. In poor \n     countries, the gains seem too often to go to the already \n     wealthy and powerful, with little or no rise in the general \n     standard of living. And the international organizations \n     charged with monitoring and providing for rules of fair \n     trade, and enforcement of them, seem to take a very long time \n     to work their way to the right decision, often too late to \n     affect the people who have been disadvantaged.\n       So as we press for more open trade, we must do more to \n     ensure that all our people are lifted by the global economy. \n     As we prepare to launch a new global round of trade talks in \n     Seattle in November, it is vital that the WTO and the ILO \n     work together to advance that common goal.\n       We clearly see that a thriving global economy will grow out \n     of the skills, the idea, the education of millions of \n     individuals. In each of our nations and as a community of \n     nations, we must invest in our people and lift them to their \n     full potential. If we allow the ups and downs of financial \n     crises to divert us from investing in our people, it is not \n     only those citizens or nations that will suffer--the entire \n     world will suffer from their lost potential.\n       It is clear that when nations face financial crisis, they \n     need the commitment and the expertise not only of the \n     international financial institutions, they need the ILO as \n     well. The IMF, the World Bank and WTO, themselves, should \n     work more closely with the ILO, and this organization must be \n     willing and able to assume more responsibility.\n       The lesson of the past two years is plain: Those nations \n     with strong social safety nets are better able to weather the \n     storms. Those strong safety nets do not just include \n     financial assistance and emergency aid for poorest people, \n     they also call for the empowerment of the poorest people.\n       This weekend in Cologne, I will join my partners in the G-8 \n     in calling for a new focus on stronger safety nets within \n     nations and within the international community. We will also \n     urge improved cooperation between the ILO and the \n     international financial institutions in promoting social \n     protections and core labor standards. And we should press \n     forward to lift the debt burden that is crushing many of the \n     poorest nations.\n       We are working to forge a bold agreement to more than \n     triple debt relief for the world's poorest nations and to \n     target those savings to education, health care, child \n     survival and fighting poverty. I pledge to work to find the \n     resources so we can do our part and contribute our share \n     toward an expanded trust fund for debt relief.\n       Yet, as important as our efforts to strengthen safety nets \n     and relieve debt burdens are, for citizens throughout the \n     world to feel that they truly have a hand in shaping their \n     future they must know the dignity and respect of basic rights \n     in the workplace.\n       You have taken a vital step toward lifting the lives of \n     working people by adopting the Declaration on Fundamental \n     Principles and Rights at Work last year. The document is a \n     blueprint for the global economy that honors our values--the \n     dignity of work, an end to discrimination, an end to forced \n     labor, freedom of association, the right of people to \n     organize and bargain in a civil and peaceful way. These are \n     not just labor rights, they're human rights. They are a \n     charter for a truly modern economy. We must make them an \n     everyday reality all across the world.\n       We advance these rights first by standing up to those who \n     abuse them. Today, one member nation, Burma, stands in \n     defiance of the ILOs most fundamental values and most serious \n     findings. The Director General has just reported to us that \n     the flagrant violation of human rights persists, and I urge \n     the ILO governing body to take definite steps. For Burma is \n     out of step with the standards of the world community and \n     the aspirations of its people. Until people have the right \n     to shape their destiny we must stand by them and keep up \n     the pressure for change.\n       We also advance core labor rights by standing with those \n     who seek to make them a reality in the workplace. Many \n     countries need extra assistance to meet these standards. \n     Whether it's rewriting inadequate labor laws, or helping \n     fight discrimination against women and minorities in the \n     workplace, the ILO must be able to help.\n       That is why in the balanced budget I submitted to our \n     Congress this year I've asked for $25 million to help create \n     a new arm of the ILO, to work with developing countries to \n     put in place basic labor standards--protections, safe work \n     places, the right to organize. I ask other governments to \n     join us. I've also asked for $10 million from our Congress to \n     strengthen U.S. bilateral support for governments seeking to \n     raise such core labor standards.\n       We have asked for millions of dollars also to build on our \n     voluntary anti-sweat shop initiative to encourage the many \n     innovative programs that are being developed to eliminate \n     sweat shops and raise consumer awareness of the conditions in \n     which the clothes they wear and the toys they buy for their \n     children are made.\n       But we must go further, to give life to our dream of an \n     economy that lifts all our people. To do that, we must wipe \n     from the Earth the most vicious forms of abusive child labor. \n     Every single day tens of millions of children work in \n     conditions that shock the conscience. There are children \n     chained to often risky machines; children handling dangerous \n     chemicals; children forced to work when they should be in \n     school, preparing themselves and their countries for a better \n     tomorrow. Each of our nations must take responsibility.\n       Last week, at the inspiration of Senator Tom Harkin, who is \n     here with me today, I directed all agencies of the United \n     States government to make absolutely sure they are not buying \n     any products made with abusive child labor.\n       But we must also act together. Today, the time has come to \n     build on the growing world consensus to ban the most abusive \n     forms of child labor--to join together and to say there are \n     some things we cannot and will not tolerate.\n       We will not tolerate children being used in pornography and \n     prostitution. We will not tolerate children in slavery or \n     bondage. We will not tolerate children being forcibly \n     recruited to serve in armed conflicts. We will not tolerate \n     young children risking their health and breaking their bodies \n     in hazardous and dangerous working conditions for hours \n     unconscionably long--regardless of country, regardless of \n     circumstance. These are not some archaic practices out of a \n     Charles Dickens novel. These are things that happen in too \n     many places today.\n       I am proud of what is being done at your meeting. In \n     January, I said to our Congress and the American people in \n     the State of the Union address, that we would work with the \n     ILO on a new initiative to raise labor standards and to \n     conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in \n     the world. I am proud to say that the United States will \n     support your convention. After I return home I will send it \n     to the U.S. Senate for ratification, and I ask all other \n     countries to ratify it, as well. (Applause.)\n       We thank you for achieving a true breakthrough for the \n     children of the world. We thank the nations here represented \n     who have made genuine progress in dealing with this issue in \n     their own nations. You have written an important new chapter \n     in our effort to honor our values and protect our children.\n       Passing this convention alone, however, will not solve the \n     problem. We must also work aggressively to enforce it. And we \n     must address root causes, the tangled pathology of poverty \n     and hopelessness that leads to abusive child labor. Where \n     that still exists it is simply not enough to close the \n     factories where the worst child labor practices occur. We \n     must also ensure that children then have access to schools \n     and their parents have jobs. Otherwise, we may find children \n     in even more abusive circumstances.\n       That is why the work of the International Program for the \n     Elimination of Child Labor is so important. With the support \n     of the United States, it is working in places around the \n     world to get children out of the business of making \n     fireworks, to help children move from their jobs as domestic \n     servants, to take children from factories to schools.\n       Let me cite just one example of the success being achieved, \n     the work being done to eliminate child labor from the soccer \n     ball industry in Pakistan. Two years ago, thousands of \n     children under the age of 14 worked for 50 companies \n     stitching soccer balls full-time. The industry, the ILOS and \n     UNICEF\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\n     joined together to remove children from the production of \n     soccer balls and give them a chance to go to school, and to \n     monitor the results.\n       Today, the work has been taken up by women in 80 poor \n     villages in Pakistan, giving them new employment and their \n     families new stabilities. Meanwhile, the children have \n     started to go to school, so that when they come of age, they \n     will be able to do better jobs raising the standard of living \n     of their families, their villages and their nation. I thank \n     all who were involved in this endeavor and ask others to \n     follow their lead.\n       I am pleased that our administration has increased our \n     support for IPEC by tenfold. I ask you to think what could be \n     achieved by a full and focused international effort to \n     eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Think of the \n     children who would go to school, whose lives would open up, \n     whose very health would flower, freed of the crushing burden \n     of dangerous and demeaning work, given back those \n     irreplaceable hours of childhood for learning and playing and \n     living.\n       By giving life to core labor standards, by acting \n     effectively to lift the burden of debt, by putting a more \n     human face on the world trading system and the global \n     economy, by ending the worst forms of child labor, we will be \n     giving our children the 21st century they deserve.\n       These are hopeful times. Previous generations sought to \n     redeem the rights of labor in a time of world war and \n     organized tyranny. We have a chance to build a world more \n     prosperous, more united, more humane than ever before. In so \n     doing, we can fulfill the dreams of the ILO's founders, and \n     redeem the struggles of those who fought and organized, who \n     sacrificed and, yes, died--for freedom, equality, and justice \n     in the workplace.\n       It is our great good fortune that in our time we have been \n     given the golden opportunity to make the 21st century a \n     period of abundance and achievement for all. Because we can \n     do that, we must. It is a gift to our children worthy of the \n     millennium.\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. One of the very important things he said in his speech \nwas:\n\n       You have taken a vital step by adopting this new \n     convention. We will do everything we can to join with you.\n       We will not tolerate children being used in pornography and \n     prostitution.\n       We will not tolerate children in slavery or bondage.\n       We will not tolerate children being forcibly recruited to \n     serve in armed conflicts.\n       We will not tolerate young children risking their health \n     and breaking their bodies in hazardous and dangerous working \n     conditions for hours unconscionably long--regardless of \n     country, regardless of circumstance. These are not some \n     archaic practices out of a Charles Dickens novel. These are \n     things that happen in too many places today.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       I am proud of what is being done at your meeting. In \n     January, I said to our Congress and the American people in \n     the State of the Union address, that we would work with the \n     ILO on a new initiative to raise labor standards and to \n     conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in \n     the world. I am proud to say that the United States will \n     support your convention. After I return home I will send it \n     to the U.S. Senate for ratification, and I ask all other \n     countries to ratify it, as well.\n\n  Mr. President, today I had delivered to every office a letter, a \ncover letter, and a copy of the new convention on the worst forms of \nchild labor. It has all the information in here that Senators and their \nstaffs would need to understand what that new convention is.\n  I did that because it is my intention to offer a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to the State Department authorization bill stating our \nsupport for this historic convention. I hope my colleagues will take \nthe time to look at the material that I sent to their offices. I hope \nthat we can all join together in a bipartisan effort to support this \nconvention. This convention offers a brighter tomorrow for all of our \nworld's children.\n  Yesterday, because I was in Geneva with the President for this very \nhistoric gathering and for this very historic speech by the President \nof the United States, I was necessarily absence from the Senate floor.\n  Had I been here, on the military construction appropriations bill, I \nwould have voted yes.\n  Iowa is deeply saddened that I could not be here to vote on a bill \nfor which I had worked for a long time with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nJeffords, and so many others. I am happy to see that it passed the \nSenate 99-0. Had I been here, it would have been 100-0; and that is the \nWorkforce Incentives Act.\n  As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, this was \nsort of one of the final building blocks of ensuring that people with \ndisabilities not only have the right and the civil rights to go out and \nget jobs and work, but this bill provides them with the necessary \nsupport in the health care that they need. Too often, people with \ndisabilities go out to get a job, and under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act they can get that job, but then they lose their health \ncare. Because many of these jobs are low-paying, entry-level jobs, they \nsimply cannot afford to take them. So I am really proud that the \nSenate, in a strong bipartisan fashion, passed the Workforce Incentives \nAct yesterday. Had I been here I would have of course voted yes.\n  On the lockbox provision that came up, again, I would have voted no \non that because there were no amendments allowed. I feel very strongly \nthat the provision, the loophole that I felt was in the bill, that said \nthat this was only good until Social Security reform was passed, I do \nnot believe was adequate enough. The question is, What reform are we \ntalking about? I think we needed to define the reform before we voted \nfor the lockbox.\n  On the energy and water appropriations, I would have supported that.\n  On the legislative branch appropriations, I would have voted yes on \nthat had I been here.\n  I wanted to state for the Record why I was necessarily absent \nyesterday, and how I would have voted had I been here.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7211-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7211-S7213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the time has come. Our friends with \ndisabilities have waited patiently. Our bipartisan coalition has \nremained united. The last obstacles have been resolved. Assurances have \nbeen given. I am referring to yesterday's passage of the landmark \nlegislation, S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative \npriorities was to provide access to the American dream for individuals \nwith disabilities. It was not an easy task. I learned quickly that \nproviding access for Americans with disabilities was complicated.\n  It involved providing access to education, it involved removing \nphysical barriers, and it involved ensuring access to rehabilitation, \njob training, and job placement assistance. It required obtaining \naccess to assistive technology and health care. Most importantly, \naccess to the American dream for people with disabilities meant gaining \nthe opportunity to choose and to participate in the full range of \ncommunity activities. Moreover, it involved making sure that the \nfederal government, along with other entities, be made to comply with \nlaws affecting access for people with disabilities. We have made \ntremendous progress in the last 24 years.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation \nAct, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Assistive Technology \nAct have changed, and will continue to change lives. Children with \ndisabilities are being educated with their peers. No agency or \nindividual, including the Federal Government, can discriminate against \nindividuals on the basis of disability in employment, transportation, \npublic accommodations, public services, or telecommunications. Job \ntraining and placement opportunities for individuals with disabilities \nare ever expanding because of the reforms we achieved in the Work Force \nInvestment Act of 1998. I am proud of these accomplishments.\n  I began work on the Work Incentives Improvement Act more than 2 years \nago. Since then, I have learned a great deal. I suspect the same holds \ntrue for the 79 other co-sponsors of this bill. S. 331 addresses a \nfundamental flaw in federal policy. Individuals with disabilities must \nchoose between working or having health care. This is an absurd choice. \nYet, current federal law forces individuals with disabilities to make \nthis choice. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if \nthey are given access to health care. S. 331 does just that--it gives \nworkers with disabilities access to appropriate health care--health \ncare that is not readily available or affordable from the private \nsector. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if they \nare given access to job training and job\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\nplacement assistance. S. 331 does just that--it gives individuals with \ndisabilities training and help in securing a job.\n  Over the past several months, we have all received letters in support \nof S. 331. I would like to share one such story with you. Don is a 30 \nyear-old man, who has mild mental retardation, cerebral palsy, a \nseizure disorder, and a visual impairment. Don works, but only part-\ntime.\n  At the end of his letter, Don wrote:\n\n       The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help my friends \n     become independent too. Then they can pay taxes too. But most \n     of all, they will have a life in the community. We are \n     adults. We want to work. We don't need a hand out, we need a \n     hand up.\n\n  S. 331 will give Don and his friends a hand up. Doing so would be \ngood for Don, and good for the nation.\n  Hard facts make a compelling case for S. 331:\n  The growth rate of Social Security disability programs between 1989 \nand 1997 was 64 percent.\n  Social Security disability cash payments grew from $34.4 billion in \n1989 to $62.9 billion in 1997.\n  For 1997, GAO estimated weekly disbursements in cash payments to be \n$1.21 billion.\n  In my state of Vermont, 24,355 Social Security disability \nbeneficiaries are waiting for S. 331 to become law. Nationally, that \nfigure is 7.5 million. Under current law, if these people work and earn \nover $500 per month, they lose cash payments and health care coverage \nunder Medicaid or Medicare. There are few if any private insurance \noptions available to these individuals, so only one-half of one percent \nof the 7.5 million forgo cash payments and federally subsidized health \ncare, and work without health insurance. Would any of us take that \nrisk?\n  Let's take a closer look at some numbers. As I indicated, there are \n7.5 million Social Security disability beneficiaries. Of those who \nwork, very few make more than $500 a month. In fact, of working \nindividuals with disabilities on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), \nonly 17 percent make over $500 per month and only 10 percent make over \n$1000 per month. Another 29 percent make $65 or less per month.\n  Let's assume that S. 331 and the companion bill in the House, H.R. \n1180 become law, and only 200 Social Security disability beneficiaries \nin each state work and forgo cash payments. That would be 10,000 \nindividuals across the country out of the 7.5 million disability \nbeneficiaries. The annual savings to the Federal Treasury in cash \npayments for just these 10,000 people out of 7.5 million would be \n$133,550,000! Imagine the savings to the Federal Treasury if this \nnumber were higher.\n\n  Clearly, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is targeted, \nfiscally responsible legislation. It enables individuals with \nsignificant disabilities to enter the work force for the first time, \nre-enter the work force, or avoid leaving it in the first place.\n  These individuals will no longer need to worry about losing their \nhealth care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to put in \novertime, or to pursue a career advancement. Individuals who need job \ntraining or job placement assistance will get it.\n  Private insurers will begin to have access to data that describes the \nhealth care-use patterns of workers with disabilities, and as a result, \nwill be able to expand or develop appropriate health care packages for \nindividuals with disabilities who work.\n  I would like to highlight a few of the health care provisions in S. \n331. First, S. 331 allows states to expand Medicaid coverage to workers \nwith disabilities and to require the workers, depending on their \nincome, to pay a part or all of the premium for this coverage.\n  A state that elects to expand coverage receives a grant to support \nthe design, establishment, and operation of infrastructures to support \nworking individuals with disabilities.\n  The bill also includes a 6-year trial program that permits Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries to continue to \nreceive Medicare coverage if they work.\n  Finally, the legislation includes a time-limited demonstration \nprogram allowing states to extend Medicaid coverage to workers who have \na disability which, without access to health care, would become severe \nenough to qualify them for Social Security disability cash payments. \nThis demonstration will produce important information on the cost \neffectiveness of early health care intervention in keeping people with \ndisabilities from becoming too disabled to work.\n  S. 331 reflects what individuals with disabilities say they need. It \nwas shaped by input across the philosophical spectrum. It was endorsed \nby the President in his State of the Union Address. And, it's companion \nbill H.R. 1180 has recently been reported out of the House Committee on \nCommerce with unanimous support.\n  The passage of S. 331 allows responsible change to federal policy and \nthe elimination of a perverse dilemma for many Americans with \ndisabilities--if you don't work, you get health care; if you do work, \nyou don't get health care.\n  S. 331 is a vital link in making the American dream, an accessible \ndream, for Americans with disabilities.\n  Let me tell you about the dream of a young constituent of mine. Her \nname is Maria, and she faces many daily challenges as a result of her \ndisabilities. She contacted my office to let me know that she is \ncounting on S. 331 being signed into law. Maria is a junior majoring in \nSpanish at a college in Vermont. She plans to graduate next year, and \nhopes to attend graduate school to become a Spanish teacher for \nchildren and adults from Central and South America.\n  Maria has her whole life ahead of her. She has dreams, and she has \ncontributions to make. Yesterday's passage of S. 331 made Maria's \ndreams possible. She will be able to pursue a career without fear of \nlosing the health care she needs.\n  The enactment of S. 331 is our graduation present to Maria . . . and \nto the millions of other Americans with disabilities, who also want to \nwork, a sign of our recognition of their right to contribute to the \neconomic and social vibrancy of America.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my many colleagues who contributed \nto making yesterday, with a record vote of 99-0, a reality.\n  First, I must thank my bipartisan co-sponsors Senators Kennedy, Roth, \nand Moynihan the original co-sponsors of this bill. Each of them made a \ncommitment many months ago to work together to create a sound piece of \nlegislation to address a real problem for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. Such commitment represents the best of what the Senate \ncan accomplish when principle is placed above partisanship.\n  I also thank the additional, original 35 co-sponsors of this bill and \nthe subsequent 45 co-sponsors who represent a total of over three \nquarters of this body, perhaps a Senate record on health care \nlegislation. Together, we have come to understand the importance of \nhealth care and a job to individuals with disabilities. Sometimes the \npower of common sense and the voices of reason transcend politics and \nhelp us to forge new policy that will make America a better place for \nall of its citizens.\n  Over the last two weeks, the Majority Leader has been the driving \nforce who urged us to work out policy differences that were delaying \nfloor consideration. We did so through good faith efforts that \nbroadened support for the bill and reduced its overall modest cost. In \nparticular, I want to recognize Senators Nickles, Bunning, and Gramm \nfor their willingness to reach consensus with us on policy without \ncompromising the integrity of the legislation, thus, allowing S. 331 to \nmove forward.\n  I must strongly thank the over two hundred national organizations \nthat offered time, energy, and ideas to create and support a bill that \nwill improve the quality of life for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities who want to work.\n  And finally, I would like to thank several individuals and groups who \nhave contributed to the development and to the Senate passage of this \nlegislation. In particular, I would like to thank my staff including \nPatricia Morrissey, Mark Powden, Paul Harrington, Lu Zeph, Erik \nSmulson, Joe Karpinski, Leah Menzies, Chris Crowley and the many others \nwho worked long and hard to bring this bill about.\n  Additionally, I would like to recognize and thank the staff members \nof the three other primary co-sponsors who took the lead in their \noffices: Connie Garner from Senator Kennedy's\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nStaff, Jennifer Baxendell and Alec Vachon from Senator Roth's staff, \nand Kristen Testa from Senator Moynihan's staff.\n  In addition to staff, I would like to recognize the contributions of \nthe Work Incentives Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities who met weekly with staff for over a year to build the \nconsensus necessary to get us here today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7213-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7213-S7215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS IN S. 1186, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS \n                              FOR FY 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the energy and water appropriations bill \nis fundamental to our Nation's energy and defense-related activities, \nand takes care of vitally important water resources infrastructure \nneeds. Unfortunately, this bill diverts from its intended purpose by \nincluding a multitude of additional, unrequested earmarks to the tune \nof $531 million.\n  This amount is substantially less than the earmarks included in the \nFY '99 appropriations bill and I commend my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee for their hard work in putting this bill \ntogether. In fact, this year's recommendation is about 60 percent lower \nthan the earmarks included in last year's appropriation bill. My \noptimism was raised upon reading the committee report which states that \nthe Committee is ``reducing the number of projects with lower priority \nbenefits.'' Unfortunately, while the Committee attempts to be more \nfiscally responsible, there is a continuing focus on parochial, special \ninterest concerns.\n  Funding is provided in this bill for projects where it is very \ndifficult to ascertain their overall importance to the security and \ninfrastructure of our nation.\n  Let me highlight a few examples:\n  $3,000,000 is provided for an ethanol pilot plant at Southern \nIllinois University; $300,000 is provided to the Vermont Agriculture \nMethane project; $400,000 is included for aquatic weed control at Lake \nChamplain in Vermont, and, $100,000 in additional funding for mosquito \ncontrol in North Dakota.\n  How are these activities connected to the vital energy and water \nresource needs of our nation? Why are these projects higher in priority \nthan other flood control, water conservation or renewable energy \nprojects? These are the type of funding improprieties that make a \nmockery of our budget process.\n  Various projects are provided with additional funding at levels \nhigher than requested by the Administration. The stated reasons include \nthe desire to finish some projects in a reasonable timeframe. \nUnfortunately, other projects are put on hold or on a slower track. The \ninconsistency between the Administration's request, which is \nresponsible for carrying out these projects, and the views of the \nAppropriators on just how much funding should be dedicated to a \nproject, is troubling. As a result, various other projects that may be \nequally deserving or higher in priority do not receive an appropriate \namount of funding, or none at all. Many of my objections are based on \nthese types of inconsistencies and nebulous spending practices.\n  Another $92 million above the budget request is earmarked in \nadditional funding for regional power authorities. I fail to understand \nwhy we continue to spend millions of federal dollars at a time when \npower authorities are increasingly operating independent of federal \nassistance. Even the Bonneville Power Administration, one of these \npower entities, is self-financed and operates without substantial \nfederal assistance.\n  We must stop this practice of wasteful spending. It is unconscionable \nto repeatedly ask the taxpayers to foot the bill for these biased \nactions. We must work harder to focus our limited resources on those \nareas of greatest need nationwide, not political clout.\n  I remind my colleagues that I object to these earmarks on the basis \nof their circumvention of our established process, which is to properly \nconsider, authorize and fund projects based on merit and need. Indeed, \nI commend my colleagues for not including any projects which are \nunauthorized. However, there are still too many cases of erroneous \nearmarks for projects that we have no way of knowing whether, at best, \nall or part of this $531 million should have been spent on different \nprojects with greater need or, at worst, should not have been spent at \nall.\n  I supported passage of this bill, but let me state for the record \nthat this is not the honorable way to carry out our fiscal \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of \nobjectionable provisions in S. 1186 and its accompanying Senate report \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Objectionable Provisions in S. 1186--FY 2000 Energy and Water \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n             Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers\n\n                         General Investigations\n\n       Earmark of $226,000 for the Great Egg Harbor Inlet to \n     Townsend's Inlet, New Jersey.\n\n                          General Construction\n\n       Earmark of $2,200,000 to Norco Bluffs, California.\n       Earmark of $3,000,000 to Indianapolis Central Waterfront, \n     Indiana.\n       Earmark of $1,000,000 to Ohio River Flood Protection, \n     Indiana.\n       Earmark of $800,000 to Jackson County, Mississippi.\n       Earmark of $17,000,000 to Virginia Beach, Virginia \n     (Hurricane Protection).\n       An additional $4,400,000 to Upper Mingo County (including \n     Mingo County Tributaries), Lower Mingo County (Kermit), Wayne \n     County, and McDowell County, elements of the Levisa and Tug \n     Forks of the Big Sandy River and Upper Cumberland River \n     project in West Virginia.\n       Earmark of $2,000,000 to be used by the Secretary of the \n     Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is directed to \n     construct bluff stabilization measures at authorized \n     locations for Natchez Bluff, Mississippi.\n       Earmark of $200,000 to be used by the Secretary of the \n     Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to initiate a \n     Detailed Project Report for the Dickenson County, Virginia, \n     elements of the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River \n     and Upper Cumberland River, West Virginia, Virginia and \n     Kentucky, project.\n       An additional $35,630,000 above the budget request to flood \n     control, Mississippi River and Tributaries, Arkansas, \n     Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and \n     Tennessee.\n\n                    Power Marketing Administrations\n\n       $39,594,000 restored to the Southeastern Power \n     Administration above the budget request.\n       An additional $60,000 above budget request for operation \n     and maintenance at Southwestern Power Administration.\n       An additional $52,084,000 above the budget request for \n     Western Area Power Administration.\n\n                          Independent Agencies\n\n       An additional $5,000,000 above the budget request is \n     provided for the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n       An amount of $25,000,000 above the budget request is \n     provided for the Denali Commission.\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n       Language which stipulates all equipment and products \n     purchased with funds made available in this Act should be \n     American-made.\n\n\n                            report language\n\n             Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers\n\n                         General Investigations\n\n       Earmark of $100,000 to the Barrow Coastal Storm Damage \n     Reduction, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Chandalrr River Watershed, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Gastineau Channel, Juneau, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Skagway Harbor, AK.\n       Earmark of $150,000 to Rio De Flag, Flagstaff, AZ.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to North Little Rock, Dark Hollow, AR.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to Llagas Creek, CA.\n       An additional $450,000 to Tule River, CA.\n       An additional $450,000 to Yuba River Basin, CA.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to Bethany Beach, South Bethany, DE.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Lake Worth Inlet, Palm Beach County, \n     FL.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Mile Point, Jacksonville, FL.\n       An additional $170,000 to Metro Atlanta Watershed, GA.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Kawaihae Deep Draft Harbor, HI.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Kootenai River at Bonners Ferry, ID.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Little Wood River, ID.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Mississinewa River, Marion, IN.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Calcasieu River Basin, LA.\n       Earmark of $500,000 to Louisiana Coastal Area, LA.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to St. Bernard Parish, LA.\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Detroit River Environmental \n     Dredging, MI.\n       Earmark of $400,000 to Sault Ste.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FISCAL YEAR 2000 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the chairman \nand ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenators Domenici and Reid, for the extraordinary work they have \naccomplished in bringing the FY2000 energy and water appropriations \nbill to the floor. While this bill funds a number of vastly important \nnational security and economic development programs and initiatives, \nuntil this year it has been relatively non-controversial, in part \nbecause of the hard work of my colleagues, Senators Domenici and Reid.\n  This year, however, they have had to operate under more difficult \ncircumstances. They have had to fashion a bill from extremely limited \nresources. As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the bill \nprovides $21.2 billion in new budget authority--$12.6 billion within \ndefense activities and $8.6 billion within nondefense. In the defense \naccounts, that represents a $220 million increase over the President's \nbudget request. In the nondefense accounts, however, it represents a \nreduction of $608 million from the request. This includes decreases in \nfunding for critical water projects.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee noted in his \nopening remarks on Monday, this is the first time in his memory--and he \nhas been here many years longer than this Senator from North Dakota--\nthat less funding for water projects is provided than requested in the \nbudget. This is a worrisome situation for many important and worthwhile \nflood control and other projects in the coming year, but that is also a \nsituation forced upon this subcommittee, indeed on most subcommittees, \nby the allocations received as a result of staying within the budget \ncaps.\n  He also noted that he was unable to accommodate all of the funding \nrequests of the members of this body. That was the case with this \nSenator, but I do want to note that he and his distinguished ranking \nmember were able to fund a number of important flood control and water \ndevelopment projects in my home state of North Dakota.\n  For instance, as the city of Grand Forks continues its recovery from \nthe devastating 1997 floods of the Red River, the city and State have \ndeveloped a plan to reconstruct flood control dikes to protect the \ncities of Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, from future \nfloods. The city and State are matching Federal funds for this project, \nbut this bill provides $9 million in federal funds for initial \nconstruction.\n  It also funds the President's request of $27 million for the Garrison \nDiversion project as well as over $2 million in additional funds \nrequested by me and Senator Conrad for unmet water supply needs on our \nIndian reservations. The tribes have already reached their funding \nceiling under existing authority for these needs and the Bureau of \nReclamation has documented over $200 million in critical unmet water \ndevelopment needs on three reservations. These funds will begin to make \na dent in these needs.\n  I am also pleased that the bill recommends $1 million for the Energy \nand Environmental Research Center, EERC, to conduct research relating \nto the integration of biomass with fossil fuels in conventional power \nsystems to increase busload renewable electricity generation; \ndevelopment of practical methods for using biomass in advanced power \nsystems; and improvement of efficiency and environmental performance in \nagricultural processing and forest-based product industries producing \nfood, fiber, and chemicals. These funds will build upon the exciting \nresearch already being conducted at the nationally recognized EERC in \nGrand Forks.\n  The bill funds the President's request of $5 million to purchase of \neasements and compensate landowners who in the Buford-Trenton area are \nunable to farm as a result of flooding and high water tables caused by \nsiltation upriver from the Garrison Dam. In 1998, more than 1000 acres \nremained under water and represented an economic loss to the farmers \nand others in this area of hundreds of thousands of dollars. This year, \nthe water level is higher and only continues to grow. This is a Federal \nresponsibility and one which is only beginning to be met. The project \nwas authorized in the 1996 Water Development Act at $34 million and \nthis represents continued progress for buying easements from willing \nsellers.\n  Finally, I appreciate the subcommittee's support for an amendment \noffered by me and Senator Conrad to add $50,000 for a reevaluation \nstudy of the Grafton dikes project by the Army Corps of Engineers. \nBecause the project was de-authorized, this report is needed. While not \nreauthorizing the project, these funds will help us jump start the \nprocess once the project is reauthorized.\n  Our water supply and flood control needs in North Dakota are many and \ngrowing. Not all of our requested needs are met by this bill, but this \nis a good bill and one I can support. I thank Chairman Domenici and \nRanking Member Reid for their support and look forward to working with \nthem in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7215-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7215-S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FISCAL YEAR 2000 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFY 2000 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This legislation \ndemonstrates a considerable investment in our military's \ninfrastructure, and a strong commitment to improving the quality of \nlife of our soldiers that will go a long way toward achieving retention \nand recruiting goals. I especially thank and acknowledge the efforts of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee Senator Byrd, the chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee, Senator Burns, and ranking member, Senator Murray.\n  I am particularly pleased that the committee included $1.9 million \nfor the Armament Software Engineering Center, ASEC, at Picatinny \nArsenal in my home State of New Jersey. Throughout our Nation's \nhistory, Picatinny Arsenal has provided our men and women with the \nhigh-technology weapons that have helped achieve our military \nvictories. The new ASEC will consolidate many of the Arsenal's \noperations, thus enhancing Picatinny's capability to test and upgrade \n``smart'' weapons. In 1998, the Senate supported ASEC by providing \nfunds for the initial design, but unfortunately, the Army has not yet \nmoved forward with the project. I am pleased by the Senate's renewed \nsupport of the Center, and look foward to working with the Subcommittee \nand the Army to ensure that this state-of-the-art facility becomes a \nreality.\n  I also express my support for the committee's inclusion of $11.8 \nmillion to modernize several facilities at the United States Military \nAcademy Preparatory School, USMAPS, at Fort Monmouth. Currently, the \ncadets attending USMAPs are housed in substandard facilities which have \nnot been modernized since 1979. This funding will provide for much \nneeded improvements that will allow USMAPS to continue training cadets \nfor the Army and admittance into the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint.\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\n  I am extremely pleased by the Senate's support of the ACFT/Platform \nInterface Lab, API Lab, at the Lakehurst Naval Air Warfare Center. The \ninclusion of $15.71 million for this project will allow for the \nconsolidation of 14 labs and 5 different 40-70 year old facilities to \nbuild the new modern API lab. The consolidation of these facilities in \none location will result in greater productivity and efficiency, and an \nincreased ability for Lakehurst to fulfill its mission of ensuring our \nmilitary's aircraft can take off and land safely from all Navy ships.\n  I thank the committee for supporting several projects at two other \ncritical bases in my State. First, the $5.6 million provided for the \nCentralized Tactical Vehicle Wash Facility at Fort Dix will increase \nour ability to prepare military vehicles for missions overseas. Second, \nthe funding for a Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, Visiting \nQuarters and additional units of housing at McGuire Air Force Base will \nimprove the standard of living and increase productivity throughout the \nbase.\n  Finally, while I am supportive of the projects included in this \nlegislation, I look forward to working with the community to identify \nadditional funding for another important project that was not included \nin the bill. This project, the National Guard Bureau Training and \nTraining Technology Battle Lab, T3BL, at Fort Dix, will allow the Army \nNational Guard to conduct cutting edge training through the application \nand use of critical training, aides, devices, simulators, and \nsimulation. Currently, $9.5 million is needed to begin the second phase \nconstruction of the lab.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman, Ranking \nMember Byrd, Chairman Burns, and Ranking Member Murray for their \ncommitment and attention to these important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7216-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

\n     and\n       Whereas, the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) \n     establishes new safety standards that pesticides must meet to \n     be newly registered or remain on the market; and\n       Whereas, the FQPA requires the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (USEPA) to ensure that all pesticide \n     tolerances meet these new standards by reassessing one-third \n     of the 9,700 current pesticide tolerances by August 1999, and \n     all current tolerances in ten years; and\n       Whereas, risk determinations based on sound science and \n     reliable real-world data are essential for accurate \n     decisions, and the best way for USEPA to obtain this data is \n     to require its development and submission by the registrants \n     through the data call-in process; and\n       Whereas, risk determinations made in the absence of \n     reliable, science-based information is expected to result in \n     the needless loss of pesticides and certain uses of other \n     pesticides; and\n       Whereas, the needless loss of pesticides and certain \n     pesticide uses will result in fewer pest control options for \n     Hawaii and would be\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\n     harmful to the economy of Hawaii by jeopardizing agriculture, \n     one of the few industries that has shown great strength \n     during the recent years of the State's flat economy, and \n     fewer pest control options for urban and suburban uses that \n     will result in significant loss of personal property and \n     increased human health concerns; and\n       Whereas, the needless loss of pesticides will jeopardize \n     the ability of the state and county governments to protect \n     public health and safety on public property and to protect \n     our natural environmental resources, for example, from \n     aggressive alien species; and\n       Whereas, the flawed implementation of the FQPA is likely to \n     result in significant increases in food costs to consumers, \n     thereby putting the nutritional needs of children, the poor, \n     and the elderly at unnecessary risk; and\n       Whereas, the Clinton administration has directed the USEPA \n     and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to work jointly toward \n     implementing the FQPA in a manner that assures that our \n     children will be adequately protected and that risk \n     determinations related to pesticide tolerances and \n     registrations will be based on accurate, science-based \n     information; and\n       Whereas, the cost of developing data to quantify real-world \n     risk is prohibitive and minor use data may not be financed by \n     pesticide registrants and the State and pesticide users may \n     fund studies to support minor users; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twentieth Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that the Legislature of the State \n     of Hawaii does hereby respectfully request that the U.S. \n     Congress direct the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency to:\n       (1) Initiate rulemaking to ensure that the policies and \n     standards it intends to apply in evaluating pesticide \n     tolerances and making realistic risk determinations are based \n     on accurate information, real-world data available through \n     the data call-in process, and sound science, and are subject \n     to adequate public notice and comment before it issues final \n     pesticide tolerance determinations;\n       (2) Provide interested persons the opportunity to produce \n     data needed to evaluate pesticide tolerances so that USEPA \n     can avoid making faulty final pesticide tolerance \n     determinations based upon unrealistic default assumptions;\n       (3) Implement the FQPA in a manner that will not adversely \n     disrupt agricultural production nor adversely affect the \n     availability, diversity of the food supply, nor jeopardize \n     the public health or environmental quality through the \n     needless reassessment of pesticide tolerances for non-\n     agricultural activities; and\n       (4) Delay the August 1999, deadline until 2001 or until the \n     USEPA, USDA, industry leaders and manufacturers can provide \n     science-based data as to use, application, and residue of the \n     pesticides under review; and be it further\n       Resvolved, That the Legislature of the State of Hawaii \n     respectfully requests that pesticide registrants and the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency support minor use \n     registrations by reserving a meaningful portion of the risks \n     projected from the use of a pesticide or a class of \n     pesticides for minor uses;

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish additional provisions to combat waste, fraud, and abuse \nwithin the Medicare Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n         medicare fraud prevention and enforcement act of 1999\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished \ncolleagues Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley, I rise today to \nintroduce the Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999. \nBoth of these Senators have been leaders in the fight against Medicare \nfraud.\n  This bill will help solve an almost $13 billion problem. According to \nthe HHS Inspector General, waste, fraud, abuse, and other improper \npayments drained about that much from the Medicare Trust Fund in fiscal \nyear 1998. Fraud and abuse not only compromise the solvency of the \nMedicare program but also, in some cases, directly affect the quality \nof care delivered to the 38 million older and disabled Americans who \ndepend upon this program. Although this legislation will not prevent \nall of the waste, fraud, and abuse that now plagues Medicare, it \nrepresents an important step toward a solution to a problem that \nthreatens the financial integrity of this vital social program.\n  Unfortunately, there is no line item in the budget called ``Medicare \nWaste, Fraud and Abuse'' that we can simply cut to eliminate this \ninsidious problem. It is a complicated, difficult challenge to plug the \nholes that make Medicare at high risk for fraud and abuse.\n  In May 1997, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, started an extensive investigation of the Medicare program. So \nfar, my Subcommittee has held three hearings in an effort to expose \nfraud and abuse within Medicare.\n  As the Subcommittee's hearings revealed, we are now seeing a \ndangerous and growing problem with Medicare fraud. Career criminals and \nbogus providers with no background in health care are increasingly \nentering the system with the sole purpose of stealing hard-earned \ntaxpayer dollars from the Medicare Trust Fund. Only tough deterrents \ncan prevent these unscrupulous providers from entering the Medicare \nsystem. At the same time, however, we must be careful not to make entry \ninto the Medicare program so difficult that the process deters \nlegitimate health care providers. We owe it to the American public to \nstrike this crucial balance.\n  During a Subcommittee hearing earlier last year, we heard testimony \ndescribing egregious examples of fraud committed by unscrupulous health \ncare providers. For example, two physicians who submitted in excess of \n$690,000 in fraudulent Medicare claims listed nothing more than a \nBrooklyn laundromat as their office location. We were also told that \nover $6 million in Medicare funds were sent to durable medical \nequipment companies that provided no services; one of these companies \neven listed a fictitious address that would have placed the firm in the \nmiddle of a runway at the Miami International Airport.\n  While the number of unscrupulous providers in the Medicare program is \nvery small relative to the number of honest providers, these criminals \nnevertheless are able to steal millions of dollars from Medicare, \nwreaking financial havoc on the program. This fraud contributes to the \ntremendous increase in health care expenditures and adversely affects \nthe quality of health care given to our nation's elderly and disabled.\n  In response to the serious problems identified through my \nSubcommittee's investigation, Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, and I \nare introducing legislation designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse \nby strengthening the Medicare enrollment process, expanding certain \nstandards of participation, and reducing erroneous payments. Among \nother things, this legislation gives additional enforcement tools to \nthe federal law enforcement agencies pursuing health care criminals.\n  One of the most important steps this bill takes is to prevent scam \nartists and criminals from securing the provider numbers that permit \nthem to gain access to the Medicare system. Specifically, this bill \nrequires background investigations to be conducted on all new providers \nto prevent career criminals from getting involved with Medicare in the \nfirst place. In addition, this bill requires site inspections of new \ndurable medical equipment suppliers and community mental health\n\n[[Page S7220]]\n\ncenters prior to their being given a provider number. This will help \nclose the system to those who apply for a provider number from a bogus \nor nonexistent location. Together, these provisions are designed to \nmake it more difficult for unscrupulous individuals to obtain a \nMedicare provider number and begin submitting fraudulent claims.\n  This legislation also requires community mental health centers to \nmeet applicable certification or licensing requirements in their state \nbefore they are issued a provider number, and requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish additional standards for such \ncenters to participate in the Medicare system.\n\n  In September of last year, Health Care Financing Administration \nAdministrator Nancy-Ann DeParle acknowledged the extensive fraud \nassociated with community mental health centers as she announced a 10-\npoint plan to curb abuses within this program. I applaud Administrator \nDeParle for taking a step in the right direction, but we can go \nfurther.\n  Our legislation requires each agency that bills Medicare on behalf of \nphysicians or provider groups to register with HCFA and receive a \nunique registration number. Many billing companies receive a percentage \nof the claims they submit that are paid by Medicare. Unethical \ncompanies, therefore, have a financial incentive to inflate the cost or \nnumber of claims submitted. Because billing companies do not have a \nMedicare provider number, however, it is difficult for HCFA to sanction \nor exclude them from billing Medicare. Hence, there is little to deter \nunscrupulous billing companies from submitting inflated claims. This \nbill makes all companies accountable for their billings through a \nuniform registration system.\n  This legislation also provides that Medicare contractors should be \nheld financially accountable for any amounts they improperly pay to \nexcluded providers 60 or more days after being notified of the \nexclusion. There have been numerous instances in which a Medicare \ncontractor has continued to pay a provider after HCFA had excluded the \nprovider from participating in the program. As a result, excluded \nproviders have sometimes continued to receive unauthorized payments due \nto the negligence of contractors.\n  Why should American taxpayers swallow the cost of improper payments \nwhen a contractor has been specifically told not to pay a particular \nprovider and yet continues to do so? This bill would help deter such \nnegligence. I realize, however, that this is a complex issue and that \nthis accountability provision may require further refinement.\n  Under our legislation, providers also would be required to refund \noverpayments even if they filed for bankruptcy, if the overpayments \nwere incurred through fraudulent means. This money would then be \ndeposited into the Medicare Trust Fund. Some bad actors have used \nbankruptcy as a shield against repaying Medicare. Essentially, \nunscrupulous individuals steal literally hundreds of thousands of \ndollars from the Medicare program, hide or spend it quickly, and then \nfile for bankruptcy protection when they are caught, leaving the \nMedicare Trust Fund in debt. With this bill, we intend to close this \nloophole.\n  Another provision of this legislation aims to halt trafficking in \nprovider numbers. The bill makes it a felony to knowingly, purchase, \nsell, or distribute Medicare beneficiary or provider numbers with the \nintent to defraud. Our investigation revealed that there is a growing \nproblem with unscrupulous providers using ``recruiters'' to \nfraudulently obtain Medicare beneficiary identification numbers, \nthereafter using these numbers to bill for services never delivered. \nThis problem must be stopped.\n  Our legislation will also grant much needed statutory law enforcement \nauthority to qualified special agents of the Department of Health and \nHuman Service's Office of Inspector General. Even though one of their \nmajor responsibilities is to enforce federal criminal laws, these \nspecial agents have no statutory authority to carry firearms, make \narrests, or execute search warrants. The office now operates under a \ntemporary Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice.\n\n  This lack of full law enforcement authority jeopardizes the safety of \nHHS-OIG special agents and witnesses under their protection. As my \nSubcommittee's hearings have demonstrated, more and more career \ncriminals are becoming involved in health care fraud; this increases \nthe potential danger to the agents charged with investigating these \ncrimes. It is time for Congress to spell out the law enforcement \nauthorities of the HHS Office of Inspector General in a more permanent \nway.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Grassley, who has been a leader in the \nfight against Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse, has agreed to be an \noriginal cosponsor of our legislation. Senator Durbin and I have \nincorporated into our legislation a valuable proposal that Senator \nGrassley sponsored, namely requiring the use of Universal Product \nNumbers (``UPNs'') on claims forms for reimbursement under the Medicare \nprogram. Senator Grassley, and a bi-partisan coalition, introduced this \nconcept as a freestanding bill, S.256, which I cosponsored earlier this \nyear.\n  These provisions of our legislation would require that a UPN that \nuniquely identifies the item would be affixed by the manufacturer to \nmedical equipment and supplies. The UPNs would be based on \ncommercially-accepted identification standards, however, customized \nequipment would not be required to comply with this requirement. \nSenator Durbin and I believe that this proposal is complementary to our \npackage of reforms and strengthens the legislation we are introducing \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today represents our \nconcrete commitment to improve the Medicare program by providing \nadditional tools that are needed to combat the extensive waste, fraud, \nand abuse that plague our nation's most important health care program. \nThe unscrupulous individuals who commit Medicare fraud drive legitimate \nproviders out of business, cost taxpayers vast sums of money, deliver \nsubstandard services and equipment, and endanger our elderly by not \nproviding needed services.\n  We must use common sense and cost-effective solutions to curtail the \nspreading infection of fraud that threatens the vitality of Medicare. \nYet, we must do more. We have a serious responsibility to older \nAmericans across the country and to the nation's taxpayers to protect \nthe Medicare program. We urge our colleagues to join us in this bi-\npartisan effort to strengthen and improve the Medicare program.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, \na section-by-section analysis of the bill, and four letters endorsing \nthe legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Grants the Secretary the \n     authority to substitute state licensing procedures for \n     background checks if it is determined that a State's \n     procedures have the same substantive requirements.\n       Requires the Attorney General to provide criminal \n     background information to the Secretary regarding individuals \n     applying for a Medicare provider number. The Secretary may \n     only use this information for determining eligibility for \n     participation in the Medicare program.\n       The Secretary may decline to issue a provider number if the \n     Secretary determines, after a background check, that the \n     applicant has a history of acts that the Secretary determines \n     would be detrimental to the best interests of the program or \n     its beneficiaries.\n       The Secretary shall report all decisions to refuse a \n     provider number as a result of a background check to the \n     Health Integrity Protection Database.\n       HCFA may use Medicare Integrity Program funds to cover the \n     costs of conducting the site visits and background \n     investigations.\n       A physician or hospital that provides durable medical \n     equipment, prosthetics, orthotics or supplies incident to an \n     office visit or emergency room visit is exempt from the site \n     visit requirement.\n       Explanation: Currently, site inspections and background \n     checks are random and typically only occur in certain areas \n     of the country and on certain types of providers. Mandating \n     site inspections and background checks would significantly \n     enhance the ability of HCFA to keep ``bad apples'' from \n     entering the program. Site inspections must do more than \n     simply verify that a business actually exists at a particular \n     location; they must ensure that the entity meets or exceeds \n     the established participation standards related to their \n     speciality.\n       Sec. 3: Registration of Billing Agencies\n       Requires agencies that bill Medicare on behalf of \n     physicians or provider groups to register with HCFA.\n       Requires HCFA to assign a unique registration number to \n     each billing agency.\n       Requires that every claim submitted by a billing agency to \n     Medicare for reimbursement include the agency's unique \n     registration number.\n       Allows the Secretary to exclude a billing agency from \n     participating in the Medicare program if it knowingly submits \n     a false or fraudulent claim.\n       Explanation: This provision would require HCFA to assign a \n     unique identifying number (similar to a provider number) to \n     each company which would then allow Medicare to sanction or \n     exclude these companies (and principal owners) from billing \n     Medicare. Federal law enforcement agencies have received \n     several allegations involving cases in which billing \n     companies that bill Medicare on behalf of providers submitted \n     fraudulent (upcoded/unbundled/fictitious) claims for payment. \n     Many billing companies receive a percentage of all claims \n     paid by Medicare; therefore, these companies have a financial \n     incentive to inflate the cost or number of claims submitted. \n     This occurs both with and without the knowledge of the \n     provider. Because these billing companies do not have a \n     Medicare provider number (they bill using the particular \n     physician's provider number), HCFA is currently unable to \n     sanction or exclude the companies from billing Medicare.\n       Sec. 4: Expand Access to the Health Integrity Protection \n     Database (HIPDB)\n       Allows any entity that bills Medicare to query the HIPDB \n     before hiring or initiating a contractual relationship with a \n     health care provider.\n       HIPDB is intended to provide a ``one stop shop'' data base \n     for public information on the imposition of health care \n     sanctions. Includes information such as health care-related \n     criminal convictions, civil judgments, exclusions, and \n     adverse license or certification actions.\n       Abuse of the information in the HIPDB is a federal felony. \n     Whoever knowingly uses information maintained in the database \n     for unauthorized purposes shall be imprisoned for not more \n     than 3 years or fined under title 18, United States Code, \n     or both.\n       Currently, the HIPDB is only available to government \n     investigators and health care plans.\n       Explanation: Expanding access to HIPDB for those entities \n     that bill Medicare will allow for better tracking and \n     accountability of individuals who have received an adverse \n     action; therefore, allowing the employer to make a more \n     informed hiring decision.\n       Sec. 5. Contractor Payments to Excluded Providers\n       Requires a Medicare contractor to reimburse the Secretary \n     for any amounts paid by HCFA for claims submitted by excluded \n     providers 60 days after the Secretary has provided notice of \n     the exclusion, unless the payment was made as a result of \n     incorrect information provided by the Secretary or the \n     individual or entity excluded from participation has \n     concealed or altered their identity.\n       Prevents an excluded provider from directly billing a \n     Medicare beneficiary.\n       Explanation: There have been numerous instances in which \n     Medicare contractors have continued to pay providers after \n     HCFA had excluded the provider from participating in the \n     program. As a result, excluded individuals and entities have \n     continued to receive Medicare payments due to the negligence \n     of contractor personnel. Instead of draining the Medicare \n     Trust Fund, Medicare contractors should be held financially \n     accountable for any amounts they improperly pay to excluded \n     providers 60 days after they have been notified of the \n     exclusion unless the payment was made as a result of \n     incorrect information by HHS or the excluded provider \n     intentionally concealed or altered its identity so\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\n     that the contractor could not have known the provider was \n     excluded. By making Medicare contractors liable for such \n     erroneous payments, they will be encouraged to exert greater \n     diligence when reviewing new provider applications and paying \n     claims.\n       Sec. 6. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC)\n       CMHCs must meet applicable certification or licensing \n     requirements of the state in which they are located before \n     they are issued a provider number.\n       CMHCs cannot serve only Medicare patients.\n       CMHCs must meet additional standards of participation to be \n     established by the Secretary before they are issued a \n     provider number.\n       Explanation: This provision is designed to ensure that \n     fraudulent or fly-by-night companies are not allowed to \n     participate in the CMHC program. Recent subcommittee hearings \n     have highlighted the rampant fraud within the CMHC program. \n     CMHCs are paid by Medicare to provide partial hospitalization \n     services to patients that would otherwise have to be admitted \n     for inpatient psychiatric treatment. The program has grown \n     from about $30 million in 1993 to more than $350 million in \n     1997. Of the approximately 1,500 CMHCs nationwide, more than \n     250 of these centers are located in the State of Florida. On-\n     site visits to these facilities in Florida by HCFA personnel \n     revealed that many CMHCs did not meet the criteria for a \n     Medicare provider number, numerous patients did not meet \n     eligibility criteria, and many centers were using non-\n     licensed staff to furnish non-therapeutic services. In \n     essence, Medicare was paying for adult daycare, which is not \n     allowed.\n       Sec. 7: Bankruptcy Protection\n       Provides that any overpayment which is the result of \n     fraudulent activity is not dischargeable through the \n     bankruptcy process.\n       Provides that any civil monetary penalty or collection of \n     past-due obligations arising from breach of a scholarship and \n     loan contract are not dischargeable through the bankruptcy \n     process.\n       Explanation: Under current law, health care providers and \n     suppliers can use bankruptcy as a shield against recovery of \n     Medicare overpayments. A provider or supplier can assert that \n     any overpayment due to the Medicare program is discharged and \n     does not survive the bankruptcy proceeding. Under this \n     proposal, a provider or supplier would be liable to refund \n     overpayments even in bankruptcy if the provider obtained the \n     overpayment by fraudulent means. This money would eventually \n     be deposited into the Medicare Trust Fund. Additionally, any \n     civil monetary penalties levied or past-due obligations \n     arising from breach of a contract entered into pursuant to \n     the National Health Services Corp Scholarship Program, the \n     Physician Shortage Area Scholarship Program, or the Health \n     Education Assistance Loan Program, are not dischargable.\n       Sec. 8: Illegal Distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid \n     Provider Number or Beneficiary Identification Number\n       This provision makes it a felony for a person to knowingly, \n     intentionally, and with the intent to defraud, purchase, \n     sell, or distribute two or more Medicare or Medicaid \n     beneficiary identification numbers or provider numbers.\n       An individual convicted under this seciton shall be fined \n     under Title 18 of the United States Code or, whichever is \n     greater, an amount equal to the monetary loss to the \n     Government, or imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both.\n       Explanation: There are no specific statutes that prohibit \n     the purchase, sale or distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid \n     provider number or beneficiary identification (billing) \n     number. This provision would address the growing trend of \n     unscrupulous providers using ``recruiters'' to fraudulently \n     obtain beneficiary identification numbers in order to bill \n     for bogus services. In addition, this provision will provide \n     penalties for individuals who ``steal'' legitimate provider \n     numbers and then submit fraudulent claims.\n       Sec. 9: Define Certain Crimes as Health Care Offenses\n       Defines criminal violations of the Medicare/Medicaid \n     statutes under section 1128B of the Social Security Act \n     (including the illegal sale or distribution of a Medicare \n     provider number or beneficiary identification number) as \n     ``federal health care offenses''.\n       Explanation: The Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act (HIPAA) established several enforcement \n     tools for deterring health care related crime, including \n     authority for injunctive relief, streamlined investigative \n     demand and subpoena procedures, and property forfeitures. \n     These remedies were made applicable to all ``Federal health \n     care offenses''. In identifying these criminal provisions, \n     however, some criminal provisions (i.e., kickbacks, false \n     certifications, and overcharging beneficiaries) were \n     inadvertently omitted. This provision defines the \n     aforementioned crimes as well as the offenses enumerated in \n     Section 8 (Illegal Distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid \n     beneficiary identification or provider number) of this bill \n     as Federal health care offenses.\n       Sec. 10: Authority of Inspector General for the Department \n     of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n       Gives criminal investigators within HHS' Office of \n     Inspector General the authority to:\n       Obtain and execute warrants;\n       Arrest without warrant if--a crime committed against the \n     United States is committed in their presence; or the \n     investigator reasonably believes a felony offense has been \n     committed.\n       Share in forfeited assets when pursuing a joint \n     investigation with another law enforcement agency.\n       The authority provided under this section shall be carried \n     out in accordance with guidelines approved by the Attorney \n     General.\n       Exercise those authorities necessary to carry out those \n     functions.\n       Explanation: The lack of full law enforcement authority \n     jeopardizes the safety of HHS-OIG agents and witnesses under \n     their protection. HHS-OIG agents currently exercise limited \n     law enforcement authority under a special deputation issued \n     by the Department of Justice through the U.S. Marshals \n     Office. This special deputation allows HHS-OIG agents to \n     exercise only limited law enforcement powers. All HHS-OIG \n     agents receive nine weeks of specialized training at the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. This is the same \n     training required by the United States Marshal Service, \n     United States Secret Service, and numerous other federal law \n     enforcement agencies. More and more career criminals are \n     becoming involved in health care fraud; this increases the \n     potential danger for those agents charged with investigating \n     these crimes. Both the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \n     Association as well as the Fraternal Order of Police support \n     this provision.\n       Sec. 11: Universal Product Numbers on Claims Forms for \n     Reimbursement\n       Requires that all Medicare claims forms accommodate a \n     Universal Product Number (UPN) no later than February 1, \n     2001, in order to receive reimbursement under the Medicare \n     program. The UPN requirement would apply to all durable \n     medical equipment and supplies, orthotics and prosthetics, \n     except for any customized items, billed under the Medicare \n     program.\n       The Secretary, in consultation with manufacturers and \n     entities with appropriate expertise, shall determine the \n     relevant descriptive information appropriate for inclusion in \n     a UPN.\n       The Secretary, in consultation with interested parties, \n     shall review information obtained by the use of UPNs on \n     claims forms and shall adjust the Common Procedure Coding \n     System (Medicare's current coding system) to ensure that \n     functionally equivalent UPN covered items are billed and \n     reimbursed under the same codes.\n       The UPN shall be based upon, but not limited to, \n     commercially acceptable identification standards established \n     by the Uniform Code Council-International Article Numbering \n     System or the Health Industry Business Communications \n     Council. The two Councils are not-for-profit organizations \n     that are currently used by the industry to establish and \n     issue bar codes, but should a similar entity develop, the \n     Secretary retains the discretion to use this as well.\n       No payments shall be made for claims forms not containing \n     UPNs submitted after February 1, 2002. This grace period \n     provides manufacturers that are not currently using UPNs time \n     to adjust to this new reimbursement system.\n       The Secretary shall report to Congress no later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act on the \n     progress of implementing UPNs on claims forms.\n       The Secretary shall report 18 months after the date of \n     enactment and annually thereafter for 3 years a detailed \n     description of the results of using the UPN for \n     reimbursement.\n       Explanation: Currently, HCFA does not know which products \n     it is purchasing. The only identification that is reflected \n     on the claims form is a billing code. The billing code for \n     each individual product can cover a wide range of items. For \n     example, GAO determined that one single Medicare code is used \n     for more than 200 different urological catheters and the \n     wholesale price range of the catheters varies from $1 to $18. \n     The use of a UPN would specifically identify the item and, \n     thus, reduce the likelihood of ``upcoding'' and combat fraud \n     and abuse in the Medicare program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Health Industry\n\n\n                                     Distributors Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Chair, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: On behalf of the Health Industry \n     Distributors Association (HIDA), I applaud you for \n     introducing the Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement \n     Act. HIDA is the national trade association of home care \n     companies and medical products distribution firms. Created in \n     1902, HIDA represents over 700 companies with approximately \n     2500 locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide value-added \n     distribution services to virtually every hospital, \n     physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and other \n     health care sites across the country, as well as to a growing \n     number of home care patients.\n       As a professional trade association, HIDA wholeheartedly \n     supports the rigorous enforcement of laws that ensure that \n     Medicare pays reasonable reimbursement amounts for medically \n     necessary items and services on behalf of Medicare \n     beneficiaries. HIDA has long advocated the responsible \n     administration of the Medicare program, and has repeatedly \n     identified specific abusive or illegal practices occurring in \n     the marketplace to assist the government's anti-fraud \n     efforts. HIDA has also assisted in the development of\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n     additional targeted policies designed to aid the government \n     in the administration of the Medicare Program.\n       The Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act is needed \n     to support the integrity of the Medicare Program. HIDA has \n     advocated more stringent standards for Medicare Part B \n     durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic and supply \n     (DMEPOS) providers for a number of years. HIDA believes that \n     that the current Medicare DMEPOS supplier standards are \n     simply insufficient. Importantly, it is not just the de \n     minimus nature of the standards that is deficient, but also \n     the process Medicare uses to determine whether a provider \n     actually meets those standards. The site visits and increased \n     provider scrutiny included in your bill will address our \n     concerns.\n       By enacting this bill, Medicare will realize an immediate \n     benefit by ensuring that beneficiaries receive DMEPOS \n     services only from legitimate firms. Unscrupulous providers \n     will never have an opportunity to engage in abusive behavior \n     because they will never be able to bill the Medicare program \n     on behalf of beneficiaries. Consequently, these increased \n     standards and enforcement tools will significantly contribute \n     to reducing fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. For \n     these reasons HIDA strongly supports the Medicare Fraud \n     Prevention and Enforcement Act.\n       Again, thank you for introducing this important bill. \n     Please contact Ms. Erin H. Bush, HIDA's Associate Director of \n     Governmental Relations (703) 838-6110 if we can be of any \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Cara C.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Chair, Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee \n         on Investigations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Pedorthic Footwear Association \n     (PFA) applauds your leadership and ongoing efforts to combat \n     fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. Your legislation, \n     ``The Medicare Fraud Prevention & Enforcement Act of 1999,'' \n     is encouraging as a positive step forward to strengthen \n     current law and further protect both patients and providers.\n       PFA strongly shares your concern that only qualified \n     entities should be able to participate and provide health \n     care services to the nation's Medicare patient population. In \n     an effort to protect patients and provide HCFA with improved \n     control of its supplies, PFA greatly appreciates your \n     leadership and introduction of legislation to address these \n     important public policy issues.\n       The PFA, founded in 1958, is a not-for-profit organization \n     representing professionals in the field of pedorthics--the \n     design, manufacture, modification and fit of footwear, \n     including foot orthoses, to alleviate foot problems caused by \n     disease, overuse, congenital defect or injury. Pedorthists \n     are one of the four professionals recognized by Congress as \n     suppliers of the Therapeutic Shoes for Diabetics benefit.\n       Shoes are simply apparel for most people, but for \n     individuals with severe diabetic foot disease, shoes are a \n     part of their treatment plan. As such, PFA supports all \n     efforts to ensure that these patients are treated and \n     provided services by qualified individuals. Thank you for \n     your efforts to enhance HCFA's overall ability to accomplish \n     its mission of protecting the health of the patient and the \n     integrity of the Medicare program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Roger Marzano, C.P.O, C.Ped.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The American Occupational\n\n\n                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,\n\n                                       Bethesda, MD, May 21, 1999.\n     Hon.

We are also pleased that your bill recognizes the \n     validity of state licensure as a proxy for background checks.\n       Thank you for your efforts to promote quality, efficient \n     services under Medicare.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Christina A.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Chair,\n     Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee, on \n         Investigations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chair: AARP commends you and your colleague, \n     Sen. Richard Durbin, for introducing the ``Medicare Fraud \n     Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999.'' Fraud and abuse \n     remain serious problems in the Medicare program that drain \n     valuable funds which could otherwise be used to help \n     strengthen the program for current and future beneficiaries. \n     Your legislation's focus on deterrence is constructive and \n     should significantly improve Medicare's ability to stop fraud \n     by unscrupulous providers before it happens.\n       The provisions in your bill to require site inspections and \n     background checks of certain providers, to require billing \n     agencies to register with the Health Care Financing \n     Administration, to allow entities billing Medicare to access \n     the Health Integrity Protection Database, and to make it a \n     felony to distribute provider or beneficiary identification \n     numbers are powerful tools that should make those intent on \n     defrauding the Medicare program think twice before attempting \n     to do so.\n       As we move to strengthen Medicare's ability to identify and \n     eliminate fraud, it is important to do this judiciously so \n     that the vast majority of providers--who are honest and \n     intent on following the rules--are not burdened. The \n     provisions of your bill appear reasonable and seem to reflect \n     this critical balance. While fraud and abuse cannot be \n     completely eliminated, it can be significantly reduced. Your \n     bill will help in this effort.\n       AARP is pleased to have the opportunity to comment on this \n     legislation and we appreciate the work you and Sen. Durbin \n     have done to reduce the effect of fraud and abuse on the \n     Medicare program and its beneficiaries. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and your colleagues in the House \n     and Senate on a bipartisan basis to find effective ways to \n     address this issue.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me \n     or have your staff contact Michele Kimball of the AARP \n     Federal Affairs Health Team at 202-434-3772.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in summary, I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this bipartisan legislation. I am also proud to be a member of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which Senator Collins chairs. This has been one of the best \nassignments I have had in the Senate because Senator Collins is not \nafraid to tackle tough issues. We have gone after the issue of food \nsafety with fascinating hearings which I believe will lead to improving \nAmerica's food supply and really protecting America's families.\n  She has shown extraordinary courage in addressing this issue of \nMedicare fraud. Frankly, it took a very good investigative team and her \ndetermination to bring us to this moment where this legislation is \nbeing introduced.\n  Mr. President, 39 million Americans rely on Medicare. If you have a \nparent or grandparent who is elderly or disabled, they may view \nMedicare as their health insurance plan. Without it, think where \nAmerica would be if elderly people and disabled folks had to rely on \ntheir own resources to pay for their medical care.\n  We pay a great deal of money each year in America to keep Medicare, \nthis health insurance plan, solvent and working; about $218 billion a \nyear. What Senator Collins is addressing is the fact that we know for a \nfact that each year we waste anywhere from $13 billion to $21 billion a \nyear. You say: How does that happen? Is it a matter of the bureaucrats \nmoving the paper around, and they get it wrong? No, for the most part, \nit comes down to people who are setting out to intentionally defraud \nthe Government, and they are so good at it, we lose at least $35 \nmillion a day--a day--to these smoothies, these swindlers, these con \nartists who prey upon the Medicare system as an open pot of money they \ncan reach into and grab.\n  When Senator Collins' investigators went out, they found that some of \nthe people who claimed to be providing medical services and medical \nequipment do not even exist. The addresses they gave, when we traced \nthem, turned out, if they were true addresses, would be smack dab in \nthe middle of a runway at the Miami International Airport, and no one \nchecked up on it. Year after year, we send out money automatically to \nthese folks without verification.\n  The legislation I am introducing with Senator Collins will really put \nsome teeth in the law and say we are not going to tolerate this \nanymore. The\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nmoney that is being taken out of this program is at the expense of the \nelderly and disabled and certainly at the expense of America's \ntaxpayers.\n  Can I give one illustration of this? Nursing homes provide care for \nelderly people who suffer from incontinency. It is something which \nhappens to many older folks. Nursing homes are supposed to provide \nadult diapers for seniors who find themselves in this predicament. \nHowever, one of the groups that we discovered decided they would try to \ninvent a way to bill the Federal Government for these 30-cent diapers \nthat are needed for elderly people, so they changed the name of the \ndiaper to ``female urinary collection device'' and billed the Federal \nGovernment $8 an item: a 30-cent diaper, billed them $8--clearly \nfraudulent, taking money right out of the Treasury, money that, \nfrankly, should be there for the real needs of senior citizens.\n  The stories go on and on. With this bill, we try to step forward and \nsay we are going to put an end to it or at least reduce it \ndramatically. We are going to create incentives for people who take the \ntime, as many seniors should with the help of their families, to go \nthrough their medical bills. Really, that is the first line of defense. \nWhen a senior under Medicare receives a medical bill, I know it has to \nbe a challenge--it is for me and I am an attorney--they should go \nthrough it page by page and look for things that do not make sense. \nWhen they discover these things and call into the hotline under \nMedicare, we can many times track down abuses and fraud and help not \nonly that senior, but every senior and Americans in general.\n  I salute the Senator from Maine. Her leadership on this issue is \nabsolutely essential.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1232. A bill to provide for the correction of retirement coverage \nerrors under chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States Code; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n       The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide \nrelief to many Federal employees and their families who, through no \nfault of their own, find themselves the victims of retirement coverage \nerrors.\n  In 1984, the Federal government made a transition from the Civil \nService Retirement System (CSRS) to the Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem (FERS). As government agencies carried out the complex job of \napplying two sets of transition rules, mistakes were made, and \nthousands of employees were placed in the wrong retirement system--many \nlearning that their pensions would be less than expected. Under the \ncurrent statutory scheme, federal agencies have no choice but to \ncorrect a retirement coverage error when it is discovered, effectively \nforcing employees into a new retirement plan. Unfortunately, the \ncorrection of a retirement coverage error can have a harmful impact on \nan employee's financial ability to plan for retirement.\n  This proposal, ``The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage \nCorrections Act,'' provides comprehensive and equitable relief to \nemployees, former employees, retirees, and survivors who are affected \nby retirement coverage errors. The bill provides individuals with a \nchoice between corrected retirement coverage and the coverage the \nemployee expected to receive, without disturbing Social Security \ncoverage law. For each type of retirement coverage error, individuals \nare furnished the opportunity to maintain their expected level of \nretirement benefits without a change in their retirement savings and \nplanning. Among other provisions, the bill also provides that certain \nemployees who missed an opportunity to contribute to the Thrift Savings \nPlan (TSP) due to a coverage error may receive interest on their TSP \nmake-up contributions.\n  ``The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act'' \nprovides a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by Federal \nemployees due to retirement coverage erros--it does so at a reasonable \ncost and without creating unnecessary administrative burdens.\n  I invite my colleagues to support this effort to address a serious \nproblem affecting Federal employees and their families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act--Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       The ``Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections \n     Act'' would provide a remedy to federal employees who have \n     been placed in the wrong retirement system.\n       Section 1: Provides the short title (``Federal Erroneous \n     Retirement Coverage Corrections Act'') and the Table of \n     Contents.\n       Section 2: Defines the terms used throughout the Act.\n       Section 3: Provides coverage for all errors that have been \n     in effect for at least three years of service after December \n     31, 1986.\n       Section 4: Provides that elections made under this Act are \n     irrevocable.\n\n\n  title i: description of retirement coverage errors and measures for \n                             rectification\n\n       This title details the specific types of retirement \n     coverage errors and the remedies provided by the Act.\n       Subtitle A: Covers employees and annuitants who should have \n     been FERS covered, but were erroneously covered under CSRS or \n     CSRS Offset. These individuals have a choice between \n     correction to FERS or be covered by CSRS Offset. Includes \n     provisions that allow all employee contributions, and \n     earnings thereon, to remain in the TSP account if CSRS Offset \n     is elected.\n       Subtitle B: Covers employees who should have been covered \n     by a retirement plan (CSRS, CSRS Offset, or FERS), but were \n     erroneously covered by Social Security only. In all cases, \n     coverage is corrected to the appropriate plan so that the \n     employee has retirement coverage.\n       Subtitle C: Covers employees who should have been covered \n     by Social Security only, but were erroneously covered by CSRS \n     or CSRS Offset. These individuals have a choice between \n     correction to Social Security only or be covered by CSRS \n     Offset.\n       Subtitle D: Covers employees who should have been covered \n     by CSRS, CSRS Offset, or Social Security only, but were \n     erroneously covered by FERS. These individuals have a choice \n     between remaining in FERS or correction to the appropriate \n     plan. Includes provisions that allow all employee \n     contributions, and earnings thereon, to remain in the TSP \n     account if coverage other than FERS is elected.\n       Subtitle E: Covers employees who should have been covered \n     by CSRS Offset, but were erroneously covered by CSRS. \n     Coverage is corrected to CSRS Offset to conform with Social \n     Security coverage law.\n       Subtitle F: Covers employees who should have been covered \n     by CSRS, but were erroneously covered by CSRS Offset. \n     Coverage is corrected to CSRS to conform with Social Security \n     coverage law.\n\n\n                      title II: general provisions\n\n       Section 201: Requires that all government agencies make \n     reasonable efforts to identify and notify individuals \n     affected by retirement coverage errors.\n       Section 202: Authorizes OPM, SSA, and TSP to obtain any \n     information necessary to carry out the responsibilities of \n     this Act.\n       Section 203: Provides for payment of interest on certain \n     deposits made by employees that, due to correction of a \n     retirement coverage error, are returned to the employee. \n     Allows retirement credit for certain periods of service \n     without payment of a service credit deposit. Provides that \n     the retirement or survivor benefit is actuarially reduced by \n     the amount of deposit owed.\n       Section 204: Provides that the employing agency pays any \n     employer OASDI taxes due for the period of erroneous \n     coverage, subject to the three-year statute of limitations in \n     the Internal Revenue Code. OPM will transfer excess employee \n     retirement deductions to the OASDI Trust Funds to fund the \n     employee share of the OASDI taxes. In no case will an \n     employee be required to pay additional OASDI taxes.\n       Section 205: Provides that certain employees who missed an \n     opportunity to contribute to TSP due to a coverage error may \n     receive interest on their own TSP make-up contributions. \n     ``Lost'' interest will be paid by the employing agency. Note: \n     Current law already provides that certain employees who \n     missed an opportunity to contribute to TSP due to a coverage \n     error may receive agency matching contributions on TSP make-\n     up contributions, agency automatic one percent contributions \n     to TSP, and interest on both.\n       Section 206: Provides that employing agencies may not \n     remove excess agency retirement contributions from the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund.\n       Section 207: Requires that agencies obtain written approval \n     from OPM before placing certain employees under CSRS \n     coverage.\n       Section 208: Authorizes the Director of OPM to extend \n     deadlines, reimburse individuals for reasonable expenses \n     incurred by reason of the coverage error or for losses, and \n     waive repayments required under the Act.\n       Section 209: Authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations to \n     administer the Act.\n\n\n                      title III: other provisions\n\n       Section 301: Makes remedies provided under the Act also \n     available to employees of\n\n[[Page S7227]]\n\n     the Foreign Service and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n       Section 302: Authorizes payments from the Civil Service \n     Retirement and Disability Fund for administrative expenses \n     incurred by OPM and for other payments required under the \n     Act.\n       Section 303: Allows individuals to bring suit against the \n     United States Government for matters not covered under this \n     Act.\n       Section 304: Provides that the Act is effective from the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n                        title iv: tax provisions\n\n       Section 401: Provides that transfers and payments of \n     contributions under this Act will not result in an income tax \n     liability for affected employees.\n\n\n              title v: miscellaneous retirement provisions\n\n       Section 501: Allows portability of service credit between \n     Federal Reserve service and FERS.\n       Section 502: Provides technical amendments to chapter 84 of \n     title 5, United States Code, that allow certain transfers to \n     other federal retirement systems to be treated as separations \n     from federal services for TSP purposes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Biden, Mr. DeWine, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1235. A bill to amend part G of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow railroad police officers \nto attend the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy for law \nenforcement training; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  national academy for law enforcement training attendance legislation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators \nHatch, Biden, DeWine, and Schumer, a bill to provide railroad police \nofficers the opportunity to attend the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's National Academy for law enforcement training in \nQuantico, Virginia.\n  The FBI is currently authorized to offer the superior training \navailable at the FBI's National Academy only to law enforcement \npersonnel employed by state or local units of government. Police \nofficers employed by railroads are not allowed to attend this Academy \ndespite the fact that they work closely in numerous cases with Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies as well as State and local law enforcement. \nProviding railroad police with the opportunity to obtain the training \noffered at Quantico would improve inter-agency cooperation and prepare \nthem to deal with the ever increasing sophistication of criminals who \nconduct their illegal acts either using the railroad or directed at the \nrailroad or its passengers.\n  Railroad police officers, unlike any other private police department, \nare commissioned under State law to enforce the laws of that State and \nany other State in which the railroad owns property. As a result of \nthis broad law enforcement authority, railroad police officers are \nactively involved in numerous investigations and cases with the FBI and \nother law enforcement agencies.\n  For example, Amtrak has a police officer assigned to the New York \nCity Joint Task Force on Terrorism, which is made up of 140 members \nfrom such disparate agencies at the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the \nU.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \nThis task force investigates domestic and foreign terrorist groups and \nresponds to actual terrorist incidents in the Metropolitan New York \narea.\n  Whenever a railroad derailment or accident occurs, often railroad \npolice are among the first on the scene. For example, when a 12-car \nAmtrak train derailed in Arizona in October 1995, railroad police \njoined the FBI at the site of the incident to determine whether the \nincident was the result of an intentional criminal act of sabotage.\n  Amtrak police officers have also assisted FBI agents in the \ninvestigation and interdiction of illegal drugs and weapons trafficking \non transportation systems in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In \naddition, using the railways is a popular means for illegal immigrants \nto gain entry to the United States. According to recent congressional \ntestimony, in 1998 alone, 33,715 illegal aliens were found hiding on \nboard Union Pacific railroad trains and subject to arrest by railroad \npolice.\n  With thousand of passengers traveling on our railways each year, \nmaking sure that railroad police officers have available to them the \nhighest level of training is in the national interest. The officers \nthat protect railroad passengers deserve the same opportunity to \nreceive training at Quantico that their counterparts employed by State \nand local governments enjoy. Railroad police officers who attend the \nFBI National Academy in Quantico for training would be required to pay \ntheir own room, board and transportation.\n  This legislation is supported by the FBI, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and the National Railroad Passenger \nCorporation.\n  I urge prompt consideration of this legislation to provide railroad \npolice officers with the opportunity to receive training from the FBI \nthat would increase the safety of the American people.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nspaceports like airports under the exempt facility bond rules; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        spaceport investment act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, Senators \nMack, Bingaman, Inouye, Inhofe, Burns, Baucus, Crapo, Craig, and \nFeinstein, to introduce legislation entitled the Spaceport Investment \nAct.\n\n  On May 25th, the Cox Commission Report revealed alarming and long-\nstanding instances of Chinese espionage that have damaged our national \nsecurity. In addition to the theft of nuclear secrets at our National \nLaboratories, the Cox Report highlighted assistance provided by U.S. \nsatellite manufacturers to Chinese military and civilian launch \nvehicles. Mr. President, we have helped to create the conditions \nleading to this sorry state of affairs. To borrow from Pogo, we have \nmet the enemy, and it is us.\n  U.S. satellite manufacturers have faced increasing pressure to \nconsider the use of foreign launch vehicles, due to a lack of a \nsufficient domestic launch capability.\n  The Cox Report recognized these facts specifically at recommendation \nnumber 24. I quote from the Report: ``In light of the impact on U.S. \nnational security of insufficient domestic, commercial space-launch \ncapacity and competition, the Select Committee recommends that \nappropriate congressional committees report legislation to encourage \nand stimulate further the expansion of such capacity and competition.''\n  Mr. President, we must address this problem.\n  Last year, along with Senator Mack, I proposed, Congress passed, and \nthe President signed into law the Commercial Space Act. Congressman \nDave Weldon provided crucial leadership in the House on this issue.\n  The Commercial Space Act helped break the federal government's \nmonopoly on space travel by establishing a licensing framework for \nprivate sector reusable launch vehicles. The Act also provided for the \nconversion of excess ballistic missiles into space transportation \nvehicles, helping to reduce the cost of access to space.\n  Mr. President, to follow-up on the Commercial Space Act this year, I \nplan to introduce a number of initiatives to further help the \ncommercial space industry in this country. The first of these \ninitiatives is my proposal to stimulate infrastructure development by \nattracting private sector investment capital to our nation's launch \nfacilities. My proposal achieves this purpose by addressing an issue of \ngreat importance to our country's commercial space transportation \nindustry--tax exempt status for spaceport facility bonds. The \nlegislation clarifies that spaceports are eligible for tax exempt \nfinancing to the same extent as publicly-owned airports and seaports. \nThis bill will stimulate the growth of spaceports in this country by \nattracting private sector investment capital for infrastructure \nimprovement, leading directly to the expansion of U.S. launch capacity \nand competition.\n  Spaceports are subdivisions of state government. They attract and \npromote the U.S. commercial space transportation industry by providing \nlaunch infrastructure in addition to that available at federal \nfacilities. Spaceport authorities operate much like airport authorities \nby providing economic and transportation incentives to industry and \nsurrounding communities.\n  The Spaceport Florida Authority was the first such entity, created as \na subdivision of state government by Florida's Governor and State \nLegislature in 1989. Its purpose is to attract space related businesses \nby providing a supportive and coordinated environment for space related \neconomic growth and educational development. Since its creation, \nSpaceport Florida estimates that it has been involved in space-related \nconstruction and investment projects worth more than $100 million. \nThese efforts include the modification and conversion of Launch Complex \n46 from a military to commercial facility. NASA's Lunar Prospector was \nlaunched from this site on January 6, 1998, the first launch conducted \nfrom a spaceport.\n  There are presently four spaceports throughout the country in \nFlorida, California, Virginia, and Alaska, and more than ten others are \nunder consideration. States considering the development of spaceports \ninclude Mississippi, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Montana, Nevada, \nNorth Carolina, Louisiana, Utah, and Idaho.\n  Our Nation's commercial space transportation industry includes not \nonly spaceports themselves and providers of launch services, but also \ncompanies which develop needed infrastructure for testing and servicing \nlaunch vehicles and their components. This industry faces increasing \npressure from government sponsored or subsidized competition from \nEurope, China, Japan, India, Australia, and Russia. The French \nGovernment, for example, indirectly provides Arianespace with most of \nits infrastructure, including real and personal property. In countries \nwith non-market economies, such as China, the government provides all \nreal and personal property as well as labor necessary to build \nsatellites and launch vehicles.\n  Mr. President, my proposal does not provide direct federal spending \nfor our commercial space transportation industry. Instead, it creates \nthe conditions necessary to stimulate private sector capital investment \nin infrastructure. This is an efficient means of achieving our ends.\n  Mr. President, to be state of the art in space requires state of the \nart financing on the ground.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this important \neffort by co-sponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spaceport Investment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPACEPORTS TREATED LIKE AIRPORTS UNDER EXEMPT \n                   FACILITY BOND RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 142(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exempt facility \n     bond) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) airports and spaceports,''.\n       (b) Treatment of Ground Leases.--Paragraph (1) of section \n     142(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     certain facilities must be governmentally owned) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Special rule for spaceport ground leases.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (A), spaceport property which is \n     located on land owned by the United States and which is used \n     by a governmental unit pursuant to a lease (as defined in \n     section 168(h)(7)) from the United States shall be treated as \n     owned by such unit if--\n       ``(i) the lease term (within the meaning of section \n     168(i)(3)) is at least 15 years, and\n       ``(ii) such unit would be treated as owning such property \n     if such lease term were equal to the useful life of such \n     property.''.\n       (c) Bond May Be Federally Guaranteed.--Paragraph (3) of \n     section 149(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating \n     to exceptions) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) Exception for spaceports.--Paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply to any exempt facility bond issued as part of an issue \n     described in paragraph (1) of section 142(a) to provide a \n     spaceport in situations where--\n       ``(i) the guarantee of the United States (or an agency or \n     instrumentality thereof) is the result of payment of rent, \n     user fees, or other charges by the United States (or any \n     agency or instrumentality thereof), and\n       ``(ii) the payment of the rent, user fees, or other charges \n     is for, and conditioned upon,\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n     the use of the spaceport by the United States (or any agency \n     or instrumentality thereof).''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to obligations issued after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nBy Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n  Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. \n Murray, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Grams, \n                           and Ms. Landrieu):\n\n  S. 1240. a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na partial inflation adjustment for capital gains from the sale or \nexchange of timber; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     reforestation tax act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer bipartisan legislation \nthat would help ensure that our Nation maintains its position as a \nworld leader in the forest products industry. I am pleased to be joined \nby Senators Breaux, Gorton, Cochran, Tim Hutchinson, Collins, Lincoln, \nShelby, Snowe, Murray, Sessions, Gordon Smith, Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nRod Grams, and Mary Landrieu.\n  This industry is vital to the United States' economy. It ranks in the \ntop ten of the country's manufacturing industries, representing 7.8 of \nthe manufacturing work force. It employs 1.5 million workers, with a \npayroll of $40.8 billion. I ask my colleagues to attempt to imagine a \nsingle minute of their day that does involve the utilization of a \nforest product--from the paper this speech is written on, to the desk \nand chair in my office, to the lumber in my house, to the box my \ncomputer arrives in. Clearly, the health of the world economy is \ndependent on a vibrant forest products industry.\n  At the same time, the industry is facing serious international \ncompetitive threats. New capacity growth is now taking place in other \ncountries, where forestry, labor and environmental practices may not be \nas responsible as those in the U.S. Additionally, a recent study using \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation's estimating model shows that the U.S. \nforest products industry has the second highest tax burdens in the \nworld--55 percent.\n  The Reforestation Tax Act recognizes the unique nature of timber and \nthe overwhelming risks that accompany investment in this essential \nnatural asset, and attempts to place the industry on a more competitive \nfooting with our competitors. In short, it would reduce the capital \ngains paid on timber for both individuals and corporations and expand \nthe current reforestation credit. Because it often takes decades for a \ntree to grow to a marketable size, it is important that we look \ncarefully at the long-term return on investment and the treatment of \nthe costs associated with owning and planting of timber.\n  The first part of the Reforestation Tax Act would provide a sliding \nscale reduction in the amount of taxable gain based on the number of \nyears the asset is held (3% per year). The maximum reduction allowed \nwould be 50 percent. Thus, if the taxpayer held the timber for 17 \nyears, the effective tax rate for corporate holdings would be 17.5% and \nthe rate for most individuals would be 10%.\n  The second part of the bill would encourage replanting by lifting the \nexisting cap on the reforestation tax credit and amortization \nprovisions of the tax code. Currently, the first $10,000 of \nreforestation expenses are eligible for a 10 percent tax credit and can \nbe amortized over 7 years. No additional expenses are eligible for \neither the credit or the deduction, meaning that most reforestation \nexpenses are not recoverable until the timber is harvested. The \nlegislation removes the $10,000 cap and allows all reforestation \nexpenses to qualify for the tax credit and to be amortized over a 5-\nyear period. This change in the law will provide a strong incentive for \nincreased reforestation by eliminating the arbitrary cap on such \nexpenses.\n  These tax changes will provide a strong incentive for landowners of \nall sizes to not only plant and grow trees, but also to reforest their \nland after harvest. This is key to maintaining a long-term sustainable \nsupply of fiber and to keeping land in a forested state.\n  Besides ensuring fairness, the Reforestation Tax Act will encourage \nsound forestry practices that keep our environment healthy for the \nfuture. Timberlands held by corporations help reduce the demand for \ntimber from public lands. Moreover, by sequestering carbon, managed \nforests help to offset emissions that contribute to the ``greenhouse \neffect.'' Unfortunately, the current high tax burden on forest assets \nruns counter to our nation's commitment to preserve and invest in the \nenvironment. This bill would encourage reforestation--or reinvestment \nin the environment--by extending tax credits for all reforestation \nexpenses and shortening the amortization period for reforestation costs \nand by making investment in timber viable. As we consider policies to \ncounteract global warming and improve water quality, we need to ensure \nthat our tax policy is aligned with and encourages sound forestry \npractices.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is supported by labor and business--\nlarge and small. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nletter signed by over 75 CEOs from the forest products industry and a \nletter from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Our members manufacture the wood \n     and paper products used around the globe every day and are \n     concerned with the industry's ability to compete in the \n     future.\n       The forest products industry has changed dramatically over \n     the last decade, and today we find ourselves at a competitive \n     disadvantage in the global market. Foreign companies, whose \n     wages are far below American standards, have easy access to \n     the American market. At the same time they are keeping \n     American products out of their own markets through tariff and \n     other barriers to trade. U.S. negotiators and the U.S. forest \n     products industry are working to lessen this trade threat, \n     but there is obviously no guarantee our foreign competitors \n     will agree to eliminate what is a significant benefit for \n     them. Progress could take additional years our industry may \n     not have.\n       The U.S. tax code, however, is one area where the U.S. \n     government can help to mitigate these factors. And that is \n     why we ask for your support of the Reforestation Tax Act. HR \n     1083 eliminates current inequities between our tax code and \n     the tax treatment given to our competitor industries \n     overseas. It levels the playing field for the U.S. forest \n     products industry, ensuring the long-term viability of high-\n     paying, high skilled jobs. The bill also provides incentives \n     for reforestation activities critical to the future of our \n     industry, our workers and our forests.\n       Please support this legislation that is important to the \n     working men and women in the forest products industry. Thank \n     you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Draper\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Forest &\n\n\n                                            Paper Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Archer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Rangel,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Rep. Rangel: As the committee begins \n     its work on tax legislation to be considered by Congress \n     later this year, the American Forest & Paper Association \n     (AF), including the undersigned chief executives within \n     the forest products industry, strongly urge you to include in \n     the committee's bill the provisions of H.R. 1083, the \n     Reforestation Tax Act of 1999. Our industry is united in the \n     conviction that this legislation is critically needed to help \n     American companies and workers complete in a global economy, \n     restore equity to the tax code, and encourage future \n     investments in sound, sustainable forestry.\n       The planting, growing, harvesting and sustained management \n     of timberlands is a vital component of the U.S. economy. The \n     forest products industry employs more than 1.5 million \n     workers, and in 46 states, our industry ranks as one of the \n     top ten manufacturing industries. More than 9.3 million \n     private owners hold and manage more than 390 million acres of \n     timberlands in the U.S.\n       While our products and businesses may vary, all of us are \n     affected by policies that make it increasingly difficult for \n     U.S. companies and workers to compete in international \n     markets. Just last year, the respected firm of Price \n     Waterhouse Coopers--using the same economic model used by the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation--found that the effective tax \n     rate for U.S. forest products companies was 55%--the second \n     highest among major competitors (Brazil, Canada, Finland, \n     Indonesia, and Japan).\n       The competitive factors we now face have changed \n     dramatically over the past 10 years. We are not competing on \n     a level playing field with our major international \n     competitors, and this inequity is very obvious in the area of \n     tax.\n       H.R. 1083 would address some of the government-imposed \n     obstacles to U.S. competitiveness. The legislation would \n     assure that all taxpayers that own timber and manage it \n     sustainably over many years are treated equitably, and it \n     would restore the historical balance in tax rates among \n     various forms of timberland ownership. Additionally, the bill \n     offers incentives to landowners of all sizes to plant and \n     grow trees and to reforest their land after harvest. Thus, \n     H.R. 1083 offers environmentally sound, pro-growth policies \n     to promote sustainable forestry, encourage reforestation and \n     help U.S. workers and companies compete.\n       The Reforestation Tax Act represents a balanced, bipartisan \n     approach to structural problems that affect an important \n     American industry, and we urge your support for this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       W.

Bill Archer,\n     Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to you today in strong \n     support of several important tax proposals that are going to \n     come before your committee in the near future. As you know, \n     the tax code has a major impact on the management of private \n     forest lands, lands which are coming under increasing \n     pressure from a number of directions. As land prices and \n     timber demand escalate, forest landowners are faced with \n     tough decisions about the management of their lands. The \n     current tax code can provide a major disincentive to them to \n     properly manage their lands for long-term forestry benefits \n     including sustainable timber production, soil erosion \n     control, wildlife habitat, and carbon sequestration. Several \n     changes to the tax code can help provide incentives to \n     landowners to reforest their lands and keep them in forest \n     cover for the foreseeable future.\n       First, we'd strongly encourage you to support the \n     Reforestation Tax Act (H.R. 1083), introduced by Rep. \n     Jennifer Dunn and Rep. John Tanner. This bill provides a \n     lower capital gains rate for timber investments, which \n     recognizes the inherent risks and long-term nature of forest \n     management. It also allows landowners to claim tax credits \n     for all of their reforestation expenses, which are currently \n     limited to $10,000. This will provide a major incentive to \n     landowners to make the investment to reforest, a risky \n     commitment of capital over the long-term which provides \n     numerous societal benefits beyond the landowner's property \n     lines.\n       Representatives Dunn and Tanner have also introduced the \n     Death Tax Elimination Act (HR 8), which we believe would have \n     a positive impact on forest conservation as well. We \n     encourage you to work with them to ensure that Federal estate \n     taxes do not provide yet another incentive to forest land \n     fragmentation.\n       In addition, we understand that Representative Rob Portman \n     will introduce the Conservation Tax Incentives Act. This bill \n     will provide a level playing field to rural landowners who \n     want to see their lands protected from development over the \n     long-term, but who cannot afford to simply donate their lands \n     for conservation purposes. This is an extremely low-cost \n     approach that will help public agencies and private land \n     trusts protect working lands and acquire sensitive lands for \n     future generations.\n       We hope you will also consider providing targeted tax \n     incentives for landowners to manage their lands in ways that \n     benefit species of wildfire that are listed or are candidates \n     for listing under the Endangered Species Act.\n       The National Association of State Foresters is a national \n     non-profit organization made up of the directors of the State \n     Forestry agencies from all 50 States, several U.S. \n     territories, and the District of Columbia. Our membership \n     supports legislation that helps provide incentives to \n     landowners to engage in long-term, sustainable forest \n     management. We hope you will give the proposals discussed \n     above your strongest consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gary L. Hergenrader,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lott, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, \n        and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 1241. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide private sector employees the same opportunities for time-and-a-\nhalf compensatory time off and biweekly work programs as Federal \nemployees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and needs of work \nand family, to clarify the provisions relating to exemptions of certain \nprofessionals from minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     family friendly workplace act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, and myself, I am pleased to reintroduce the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. I also am pleased to include a list of 34 \ncolleagues as original cosponsors. It is an opportunity to address a \nvery important need for American families--spending more time together.\n  Over the past four years, we have been talking about the difficulty \nthat parents have balancing work and family obligations. I do not think \nthere are two values that are more highly or intensely admired in \nAmerica than these. The first one is the value we place on our \nfamilies. We understand that more than anything else the family is an \ninstitution where important things are learned, not just knowledge \nimparted but wisdom is obtained and understood in a family which \nteaches us not just how to do something but teaches us how to live.\n  The second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our \nheritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. We \nare a culture that says if you work well, you should be paid well. If \nyou have merit, you should be rewarded. If you take risks and succeed--\nyou represent the engine that drives America forward.\n  The difficult issue that faces us as a nation, is how are we going to \nresolve these tensions? I think that is one of the jobs, that we have \nto try and make sure we build a framework where people can resolve \nthose tensions and where Government somehow does not have rules or \ninterference that keeps people from resolving those tensions.\n  For example, there are a lot of times when an individual would say on \nFriday afternoon to his boss or her boss, ``My daughter is getting an \naward at the high school assembly today. Can I have an extended lunch \nhour, maybe just 1 hour so that I can see my daughter get the award? I \nwould like to reinforce, I would like to give her an `atta girl,' I \nwould like to hug her and say, `You did a great job, this is the way \nyou ought to work and conduct yourself, it is going to mean a lot to \nyourself and our family and our country if you keep it up.' ''\n  Right now, it is illegal for the boss to say, ``I will let you take \nan hour on Friday and you can make it up on Monday,'' because it is in \na different 40-hour week. You cannot trade 1 hour for 1 hour from one \nweek to the next. That\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nwill make one week a 41-hour week and will go into overtime \ncalculation. Since most bosses do not want to be involved in overtime, \nit just does not happen.\n  This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or \nset in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us \nflexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do \novertime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then \nyou are paid time and a half for your overtime. But at some point, you \nwould rather have the time than the money. If the employer agreed to it \nvoluntarily--both parties--we ought to let that happen. It is against \nthe law.\n  Some employers even want to go so far as to help their families by \nsaying instead of doing 1 week for 40 hours, we would be willing, if \nyou wanted to and on a voluntary basis, let the worker average 40 hours \nover a 2-week period regularly, so you would only work 9 days in the 2 \nweeks, but you would work 45 hours the first week and 35 hours the \nsecond week and have every other Friday off so you could take the kids \nto the dentist or drop by the department of motor vehicles and get the \ncar licensed or visit the governmental offices that are not open on \nSaturday. It is against the law to do that now.\n  What I have described are two ways to tackle these time problems. \nFirst, is the option--when you work overtime, to get in time rather \nthan money--if that is what you want to do. Second, you could schedule \na work schedule to fill your needs by spreading 80 hours over two weeks \nto better accommodate your needs and the needs of your families.\n  Both of these things are available in the Federal Government and for \ngovernmental entities. Since 1978, the Federal Government has said it \nis OK to swap comp time off instead of overtime pay. The Federal \nGovernment also said if you want to have some flexible scheduling so \nthat every other Friday or every other Monday is off, that is something \nwe can work with you on.\n  It is totally voluntary--voluntary for the worker, it is voluntary \nfor the Federal Government employer or administrator. Neither can force \nthe other because we do not want to force people to work overtime or \ntake comp time, but we want to allow Americans to make choices which \nwill help them resolve the tensions between the home place and the \nworkplace, these two values that are in competition.\n  These potentials, which exist for Federal workers, it occurs to me, \nought to be able to be available to workers in the private sector as \nwell, were we not to be locked into the hard and fast rules of the \n1930's. That was a time when Henry Ford said, ``You can have your Ford \nany color you want so long as it is black.'' Things were not quite as \nflexible then as they are now, and families did not need the \nflexibility then as they do now. With 70 to 80 percent of all mothers \nof school-age children now working and two parents working in all those \nsettings, and the tension between work and home, I think we ought to \nhave more flexibility at the option of both the employer and the \nworker, only when it is agreed to.\n  That is really the subject of the Family Friendly Workplace Act which \nwe reintroduce today. It is a way of saying we need to allow families \nto work out the conflict that exists between these important values \nthat are crucial and so fundamental to the success of this culture in \nthe next century, not just fundamental to the success of our culture, \nbut fundamental to the success of our own families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Bread \nfor the World, an organization which has dedicated itself to helping \nend hunger in the U.S. and throughout the world, and is celebrating its \n25th Anniversary this year. I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the members of Bread for the World on their 25 years of \ndedication to helping those less fortunate.\n  Bread for the World began in 1974 with a small group of Protestants \nand Catholics who were concerned about hunger. This group of \nindividuals has now become a national movement with 44,000 members \nrepresenting 40 denominations. In its informational campaigns around \nthe world, and here on Capitol Hill, Bread for the World is a non-\npartisan organization whose legislative initiatives serve the purpose \nof providing assistance to those in need and, no less important, a \nmeans to provide for oneself.\n  Children and child nutrition programs have been a principal focus for \nBread for the World. In addition, Bread for the World has advocated \nprograms designed to help individuals in need to receive assistance \nand, ultimately, find a job. During my tenure here in the Senate, and \nearlier as a member of the House of Representatives, I have worked with \nBread for the World on a number of initiatives related to these issues. \nLast year, the Congress passed and the President signed into law \nlegislation backed by Break for the World, the Africa: Seeds of Hope \nAct, of which I was an original cosponsor. This law will redirect U.S. \nresources to small-scale farmers and struggling rural communities in \nAfrica. It also established a revolving loan fund to provide food aid \nin response to emergency food crises throughout the world.\n  As a member of the board, I am pleased to commend the people of this \nfine organization for 25 years of dedicated efforts on behalf of \nAmericans and people around the world who suffer from hunger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7236-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            60TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEOPLE COORDINATED SERVICES\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

The ``Excellence in Education'' award is an \nannual program designed to identify one elementary, middle, and \nsecondary school that is representative of the many outstanding schools \nin New Hampshire.\n  Kingswood Regional High School was chosen for this honor because of \nthe dedication and commitment to education by its teachers, parents, \nand students. Its exemplary community involvement in support curriculum \nhas created an environment conducive to the development of young minds.\n  I admire Kingswood's commitment to excellence. In recent years \nKingswood Regional High School has taken on challenging initiatives \nwith outstanding results. Its achievement of academic excellence based \non New Hampshire's 10th grade and SAT testing results, and ensuing \nWriting Across The Curriculum Project, is to be commended. Technology \neducation is integrated throughout Kingswood Regional's curriculum and \nit's newly established electronics course will lead to student \ncertification in the electronics field.\n  The teachers, parents, and students of this school hold a special \nplace in my heart. My wife Mary Jo and I live in nearby Tuftonboro, and \nI taught history at Kingswood Regional High School. I have had the \nwonderful opportunity of meeting with both the students and faculty and \nhave established strong and lasting friendships. This close \nrelationship with the Kingswood has allowed me to witness the quality \nof education that is provided at this school.\n  As a former Kingswood Regional High School teacher and school board \nmember. I know first hand that this school is truly deserving of this \nhonor. Kingswood Regional High School is a testament to the tradition \nof molding students into successful adults. I wish to offer my most \nsincere congratulations and best wishes to Kingswood Regional High \nSchool. The school's achievements are truly remarkable.

SHINSEKI'S APPOINTMENT TO THE JOINT \n                            CHIEFS OF STAFF\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nGeneral Eric K. Shinseki's appointment as the Army's thirty-fourth \nChief of Staff. As a highly decorated officer and a dedicated member of \nour nation's Armed Forces, I know that General Shinseki will prove to \nbe a valuable member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  In his thirty-three years of service, General Shinseki has served the \nArmed Forces in both the continental United States and overseas. He \nserved in the United States Army Hawaii, as well as at Fort Shafter \nwith Headquarters, United States Army-Pacific. From March 1994 to July \n1995, General Shinseki was the Executive Officer of the 1st Squadron of \nthe 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n  From August 1997 until November 1998, Shinseki was the Commanding \nGeneral of the United States Army-Europe and 7th army. He concurrently \nled NATO soldiers as the Commander of the Allied Land Forces Central \nEurope in Germany. Additionally, General Shinseki has served as \nCommander of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and as the \nArmy's Vice Chief of Staff.\n  As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of our men and women \nin uniform. I understand the difficult sacrifices they make every day \nin defense of our country--and our ideals. I honor the hard work and \ncommitment that sacrifice demands. Just\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nas they fight for us, I fight for them and federal policies that \nsupport them.\n  As a result of General Shinseki's military service, he has earned the \nDefense Distinguished Service Medal, a Legion of Merit with oak leaf \ncluster, a Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' Device and two oak leaf \nclusters, a Purple Heart Award with oak leaf cluster, and a Meritorious \nService Medal with two oak leaf clusters.\n  Mr. President, I know that General Eric K. Shinseki will be an \ninstrumental contributor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Throughout his \ncareer he has shown his capability as a leader. His leadership and his \nmilitary successes will help him to succeed as the new Army Chief of \nStaff. I look forward to working with him on the restructuring of TECOM \nto ensure that Aberdeen remains the home of Army testing. I am happy to \nknow that General Shinseki shares the Maryland delegation's view of how \nimportant Aberdeen Proving Ground is to the Army, Maryland, and the \nUnited States. I wish General Shinseki the best in his new \nposition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7237-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY BOARD ``SCIENCE AT ITS BEST, \n                        SECURITY AT ITS WORST''\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, earlier this week the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board released its report on security and \ncounterintelligence operations at the nuclear weapons laboratories of \nthe Department of Energy.\n   The report's title--Science at its Best, Security at its Worst--\nneatly encapsulates the Board's findings. This report reiterates and \nclearly delineates problems within our nuclear laboratories that other \nreports have also detailed. No one should be surprised.\n  Let me simply list a few of this newest report's more compelling \nconclusions:\n\n       At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs \n     of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling \n     record of security administration. Twenty years later, \n     virtually every one of its original problems persists.\n       The nuclear weapons and research functions of DOE need more \n     autonomy, a clearer mission, a streamlined bureaucracy, and \n     increased accountability.\n       More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal \n     inquires . . . have identified a multitude of chronic \n     security and counterintelligence problems at all of the \n     weapons labs.\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen.\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven incapable of reforming itself.\n       Lastly, the report states: Reorganization is clearly \n     warranted to resolve the many specific problems with security \n     and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories, but also \n     to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic \n     throughout the entire Department.\n\n  These findings are nothing new.\n  When Senators Kyl, Murkowski, and I introduced our amendment to the \nDefense Authorization calling for reorganization and streamlining \nwithin the Department of Energy, one of the charges leveled against us \nwas that no hearings had been held on this issue. That old, tired claim \nthat ``we need more hearings'' is used every time Congress tries to act \non an urgent matter.\n  Sometimes that may be true. In this instance, we have undoubtedly \ndestroyed a major forest with all the paper documenting DOE \nmismanagement in just the past 15 years. We have done studies; we have \nheld hearings; the House has held hearings; we have asked for a review \nby the GAO, by the CRS, by outside groups, and we must have 25 pounds \nof recommendations gathering dust right now.\n  Today, my friend Secretary Richardson is implementing a new round of \nreforms at DOE. Mr. President, you should know that, while I have been \ncritical of some past Secretaries for failing to give sufficient \nattention to these matters, Secretary Richardson is clearly indicating \na willingness to tackle these issues.\n  However, Secretaries come and go. Reforms introduced during any \nspecific tenure of a Secretary often do not endure after their \ndeparture. The Rudman report states, and I quote, ``the Department of \nEnergy is incapable of reforming itself--bureaucratically and \nculturally--in a lasting way, even under an activist Secretary.''\n  I can tell you from my own experience that it is sometimes hard to \nfigure out just who is responsible in any given situation at DOE. Under \nthe current structure the programs within one office, comply with \npolicies set by a second office, in accordance with procedures set by a \nthird office, verified by a fourth office. When I look at something \nlike that, I have to wonder, ``Who is in charge?''\n  The experts involved in producing the Rudmann Report asked a number \nof DOE officials to whom they report, who whom they were responsible. \nThe most common response was ``it depends.''\n  This myriad of oversight and review does not improve performance. To \nthe contrary, in some cases it diminishes performance. It is my view \nthat it is frequently easier to be an overseer than the responsible \nparty. As overseers have multiplied, the line between oversight and \nresponsibility has been blurred and sometimes disappears. The frequent \nresult is that, when mistakes are made, everyone thinks they were an \noverseer, and nobody takes responsibility.\n  Mr. President, the national laboratories, especially the ones in my \nstate, literally saved millions of lives through their work in World \nWar II and during the cold war. They abound with dedicated, patriotic, \nand truly gifted men and women, working for this nation's security as \ntheir top priority. We should not make the labs a scapegoat for an \nineffective bureaucracy. We need a fundamental re-emphasis on the \nnuclear weapons work at DOE, recognizing that the rules and regimes \nthat govern the rest of the DOE cannot be entirely used in the nuclear \nweapons complex.\n  I would like to show you an organizational chart of DOE's current \nstructure as it pertains to our nuclear weapons program. This chart is \nfound on page 17 of the new report. As one can readily discern, it's a \ntoss up who or what office might have oversight in a given situation in \na maze such at this. Just one glance at this chart makes the point.\n  The PFIAB Report demands legislative changes. Again, I quote, ``The \nDepartment of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven \nincapable of reforming itself.'' The PFIAB Report makes some very \nspecific recommendations as to what changes are necessary. The authors \nrecommend that Congress pass and the President sign legislation that:\n\n       Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear \n     Stewardship.\n       Streamlines the Nuclear Stewardship management structure.\n       Ensures effective administration of safeguards, security, \n     and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by \n     creating a coherent security/CI structure within the new \n     agency.\n\n  The organizational chart outlining this new organization looks \nsomething like this. This can be found on page 50 of their report.\n  Creation of a semi-autonomous agency for our nuclear weapons work is \nprecisely what I have been pushing over the last several weeks. Indeed, \nwhat I and my colleagues Senator Kyl and Senator Murkowski have \nproposed boils down to a true ``Chain of Command'' approach, with all \nthe discipline this entails. I truly believe, and today's report \nconfirms, that this approach, if it had been used in the past, may have \navoided some of the security problems and will help us avoid them in \nthe future.\n  The Rudman Report is a significant, timely contribution to the \naccumulating evidence that we must act to ensure that brilliant science \nand tight security are compatible within our nuclear weapons \ninfrastructure.\n  I would like to congratulate Chairman Rudman and the members of the \nPFIAB for the tremendous contribution their findings will make to the \ndialog on how to best preserve our nuclear secrets and still maintain \nthe greatest scientific research centers in the world.\n  The recommendations made in this report parallel what I and my \ncolleagues tried to do several weeks ago. Perhaps this additional \nevidence will persuade others that it is long past time for Congress to \ntake decisive action. I encourage my colleagues to read the report and \ndraw their own conclusions about the need for organizational reform at \nDOE.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7238-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n                          HAMILTON HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President I rise today to \nhonor Arthur Nelson, of Goshen, New Hampshire, for his dedicated \nservice to his town and the nation.\n  Arthur has been an important figure in the town of Goshen. His \ncommitment to the community has not gone unnoticed. It is for this \nreason that he was chosen Honorary Parade Marshall in celebration of \nthe founding of the Goshen Volunteer Fire Department.\n  In 1939, Arthur helped establish the Goshen Volunteer Fire \nDepartment. This was the beginning of Arthur's long and fulfilling \ncareer as a public servant to the town of Goshen. Since then he has \nserved as fire warden for fifty years. During those years he had been \nknown to strap on a backpack pump and search reported puffs of smoke. \nThis intense devotion led him to successfully find, and extinguish, \nmany wildfires.\n  In addition to service to the town of Goshen, Arthur has been an \nactive participant in fire fighting in Sunapee, Croyden, Marlow and \nGrantham. His concern for the safety of his own community, and those of \nhis neighbors, has brought Arthur a tremendous amount of respect from \nall who know him. All of these towns join Goshen in recognizing Arthur \nas a true hero.\n  Arthur's presence in the Goshen Volunteer Fire Department is not his \nonly contribution to his community. He has been elected and served as a \nselectman, been a part of the Historical Society and served on the \nConservation Commission. Arthur has also been an active member of the \nGoshen Community Church. Among all of his commitments, Arthur was also \nable to write a book in his spare time. Foundations of Old Goshen, \npublished in 1980, in a history of the town he loves.\n  At age 91, Arthur can look back on a fulfilling life in the town of \nGoshen. His dedication to community service should be used as an \nexample for others. I want to commend Arthur for his commitment to \nserving his town and country. it is an honor to represent him in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7238-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7238-S7239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROTECTING THE EARTH'S SOIL FERTILITY JUNE 17--WORLD DAY TO COMBAT \n                            DESERTIFICATION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the gradual but accelerating loss \nof soil fertility and productive agricultural land worldwide may not be \nheadline-grabbing news. But it is the kind of threat that, if not \naddressed, will exacerbate global problems of hunger, poverty, \nmigration and conflict over local scarce land and water resources in \nthe 21st century.\n  The process of soil erosion and severe land degradation, often \nreferred to as ``desertification,'' results from over-cultivation, \ndeforestation, improper irrigation and drought. Most Americans are \naware of the phenomenon from our own ``dust bowl'' in the 1930's when \nhundreds of thousands of farmers were forced to abandon their exhausted \nland. Today, dust bowls are occurring in more than 90 countries with an \nalarming annual loss of 10 million acres of productive agricultural \nland worldwide. Because of our own successful soil and water \nconservation programs, U.S. businesses, universities and non-\ngovernmental organizations have a crucial role to play in providing \ntechnical expertise and support to communities around the world that \nare fighting land degradation.\n  Today is World Day to Combat Desertification, which marks the fifth \nanniversary of a coordinated international initiative to address the \nland degradation problem. In recognition of this observance, I would \nlike to share a recent Christian Science Monitor op-ed piece on the \nseriousness of land degradation in Africa written by His Excellency \nMamadou Mansour Seck, Senegal's Ambassador to the United States.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n  Shrinking Forests--Will U.S. Aid in the Greening of World's ``Dust \n                                Bowls''?\n\n                       (By Mamadou Mansour Seck)\n\n       As a young pilot 40 years ago, flying over my country of \n     Senegal and across Africa's Sahel region, I remember looking \n     down on vast stretches of green fields and forests. Today the \n     view is of a yellowish brown landscape that's growing barren.\n       Like many African countries, Senegal is losing precious \n     agricultural land to a process of soil erosion and \n     degradation known as ``desertification.'' It occurs when land \n     that receives little or irregular rainfall is overcultivated, \n     overgrazed, deforested, or otherwise stripped of its soil-\n     fixing vegetative cover.\n       Worldwide, with more than 10 million acres of farm land \n     becoming unproductive each year, ``dust bowls'' are \n     multiplying and raising legitimate concern about our planet's \n     capacity to feed its rapidly growing population.\n       In Africa and elsewhere, desertification fuels a downward \n     cycle of poverty and hunger, which leads to migration from \n     rural areas to overcrowded urban centers including those in \n     North America and Europe. Desertification can lead to \n     conflict over scarce resources, threatening to undermine the \n     progress Africa is making toward democracy and economic \n     reform.\n       But desertification is not inevitable. The U.S. can play a \n     larger role in stemming the tide by ratifying the Convention \n     to Combat Desertification, already ratified by 150 other \n     countries.\n       The 1994 Convention focuses on food security and poverty \n     reduction. It also promotes African self-reliance, a shift \n     from aid to trade, the sustainable use of natural resources, \n     and the benefits of democratic participation.\n       The U.S. signed the treaty in 1994, and President Clinton, \n     during his trip last year to Africa, reaffirmed U.S. support \n     for it. But\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n     U.S. interests in an economically healthy and politically \n     stable Africa would be well served by ratification by the \n     Senate.\n       The desertification convention provides a coordinated \n     international framework to channel technical and financial \n     resources to communities where the fight against the \n     interrelated problems of desertification and poverty must be \n     waged.\n       Under the treaty, developing countries must engage local \n     communities and organizations of farmers, herders, women, and \n     youth in a ``bottom up'' process to devise national action \n     programs.\n       Senegal and other desertified countries around the world \n     are now active in this joint public-private planning process. \n     Senegal's capital, Dakar, recently hosted the Second \n     Conference of Parties to the Convention, attended by more \n     than 140 countries.\n       Much more progress could be made with the help of the U.S., \n     which has successful community-based soil and water \n     conservation programs and is recognized as one of the world's \n     leaders on fighting desertification. The technical resources \n     of American universities, research institutions, and \n     businesses are urgently needed in the Convention-generated \n     partnerships with communities around the world.\n       Unchecked, desertification will continue to foster food \n     crises, poverty, conflict, migration, floods and other \n     environmental disasters. No nation is immune from the \n     consequences.\n       Africa's 750 million people look to the U.S. for leadership \n     on many issues, and desertification is one of the closest to \n     our hearts. We look forward to welcoming the U.S. as a full \n     partner to the convention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7239-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7239-S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  On June 16, 1999, the Senate passed S. 1186, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 2000.

Mr. President, I just left a marvelous event in which \nMr. John Edwards of my hometown of Mobile, AL, was recognized \nnationally for his selfless service to youth. He had been trained as a \nboxer and has done some professional boxing.\n  Mr. Edwards has two children. He trains now 18 to 36 young people in \na gym. He works two jobs and trains them on the side. He does more than \njust teach them boxing; he teaches them how to work, how to save, how \nto manage money, and the important characteristics that are necessary \nfor life.\n  He told me, when they come there, the first thing he asks them to \nproduce is a report card. If it is not good enough, he puts them on \nsort of his own probation, and he works with them to see their grades \nimprove.\n  I just believe there are more people than we realize in America today \nwho are giving of themselves for other people.\n  Mr. Edwards shared that. It is important to me because I chair the \nYouth Violence Committee. Young people are in trouble today, and they \nneed adults who care about them and who will spend time with them. \nThere are people like Mr. Edwards who have done that to an \nextraordinary degree, and we salute all of them.\n  I particularly congratulate Mr. Edwards on his commitment to his \ncommunity and my hometown of Mobile, AL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/17/senate-section/article/S7244-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7244-S7245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
