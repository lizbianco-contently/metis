Mr. President, on March 17, Senator George Mitchell \nreceived the Medal of Freedom at the White House.\n  The day was picked especially because Irish Americans had gathered at \nthe White House, but also Irish from both Northern Ireland and the \nRepublic of Ireland were in attendance.\n  All together, with the President of the United States, we honored the \nextraordinary achievements of the United States Senate's former \nmajority leader.\n  Marcelle and I were in attendance with great pride in watching our \nfriend, Senator Mitchell. We were honored also to be with his wife, \nHeather, and other members of his family. Having served with him, I \nknow he is an extraordinarily capable, patient, and talented person. No \none else could have done what he did.\n  Senator Mitchell received a standing ovation for his words that \nevening--words that came from his heart and mind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his words be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by Senator George J. Mitchell on Receipt of the Medal of \n                Freedom, the White House, March 17, 1999\n\n       Thank you, Mr. President, for your generous remarks, and \n     for your commitment to peace and reconciliation in Northern \n     Ireland. You are the only American President ever to have \n     placed Northern Ireland high on our national agenda, the only \n     President ever to have visited there while in office. The \n     people of Ireland, North and South, know of your concern for \n     their future; and they are deeply grateful. In behalf of \n     peace loving people everywhere, I thank you.\n       I also want to thank you for giving me the chance to serve \n     in Northern Ireland. I must admit that I didn't always feel \n     this way. During the years that I sat and listened to the \n     same arguments, over and over again, I had other, less \n     charitable thoughts about you and about my role there.\n       It was difficult and demanding, but it also was deeply \n     rewarding. For me to have played a part in trying to end an \n     ancient conflict, trying to make possible a more safe and \n     secure life for generations to come; for me to have come to \n     know, to admire, and to love the people of Northern Ireland--\n     these are rewards which cannot be measured, or even \n     described.\n       I can only say that my heart is overflowing with \n     gratitude--to you, Mr. President; to the political leaders \n     and to the people of Northern Ireland; to Prime Ministers \n     Ahern and Blair and their predecessors; to Mo Mowlam and \n     David Andrews and their predecessors and colleagues; to my \n     colleagues, John de Chastelain and Harri Holkeri; to my \n     staff, Martha Pope, David Pozorski, and Kelly Currie; and \n     especially to my wife, Heather, who was patient \n     and understanding through three-and-a-half long, lonely \n     years.\n       On an occasion like this, it is tempting for me to take a \n     nostalgic look back on my life.\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\n     But instead we must look forward, with urgency, not to my \n     life, but to the lives of the people of Northern Ireland.\n       The events of the past year have shown the great promise of \n     peace. But they also have shown that huge obstacles remain to \n     a durable and sustainable peace. On Good Friday of last year, \n     the political leaders of Northern Ireland showed the world \n     the meaning of political courage. Many of these leaders are \n     present, and I'd like to recognize some of them: David \n     Trimble, John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Reg Empey, Gerry Adams, \n     John Alderdice, Sean Neeson, David Ervine, Monica McWilliams \n     and Gary McMichael.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, these are the heroes of the Northern \n     Ireland Peace process. These are the men and women who \n     deserve the medals and the applause. They are my friends, and \n     yours. Please join me in letting them know how much you value \n     their Good Friday agreement.\n       I'd like to address those leaders directly. You've heard \n     the applause. Perhaps better than anyone, I know how well \n     deserved it was. But even before the applause fades, the \n     future intrudes.\n       Getting the agreement was historic. But, as you know, by \n     itself it doesn't provide or guarantee peace. It makes peace \n     possible. Whether it will be realized is up to you.\n       The Good Friday Agreement transformed Northern Ireland. It \n     also transformed you. You are no longer just the leaders of \n     your parties, or members of the assembly. You are the vessels \n     into which the people of Northern Ireland have poured their \n     hopes and dreams. You sought public office and with it comes \n     power and responsibility. You have the awesome responsibility \n     of life or death. What you do, or don't do, could mean life \n     or death for many of your fellow citizens.\n       As he left London to join us at the talks last April, Tony \n     Blair said he felt the hand of history on his shoulder. It's \n     still there, on your shoulders.\n       For a moment, come back in time with me to December 16, \n     1997, the last negotiating session of that year. We met in \n     the small conference room at Stormont. We had tried for two \n     intense weeks to get agreement on a statement of the key \n     issues to be resolved, and we had failed. We were all \n     bitterly frustrated and deeply discouraged.\n       As we walked out into the windswept and rainy night, it \n     seemed so hopeless, so impossible. And yet, less than four \n     months later, you reached agreement.\n       How did you do it? You did it because each of you took a \n     risk for peace, each of you acted with wisdom and courage. \n     And you did it because you knew, in your hearts, that the \n     alternative was unacceptable.\n       It stills is. The alternative to peace in Northern Ireland \n     is unacceptable. It should be unspeakable, unthinkable. The \n     continued punishment beatings and the savage murder of \n     Rosemary Nelson, who on Sunday was blown to death just a few \n     yards from her eight year old daughter's school, are like \n     alarm bells ringing in the night. They warn that the cancer \n     of violence and sectarian hatred lurks just below the surface \n     and could erupt at any time into wide-spread conflict.\n       History might have forgiven failure to reach an agreement, \n     since no one thought it possible. But once the agreement was \n     reached, history will never forgive the failure to carry it \n     out. The people of Northern Ireland don't want to slip back \n     into the cauldron of sectarian conflict. You can prevent it.\n       Those who oppose the agreement have failed to bring it \n     down. As Seamus Mallon has said, the only people who can \n     bring the Good Friday down are those who supported it. You \n     cannot let that happen.\n       I know you. I trust you. I believe in you. And I say to you \n     that the problems you now face are no greater or more \n     difficult than those you faced, and dealt with, last year. \n     You must once more rise above adversity. You must again defy \n     history.\n       You must come together, now and as often as necessary until \n     peace is assured. Then you will deserve and receive the honor \n     that will transcend all others: the satisfaction of knowing \n     that, in the most difficult and dangerous of circumstances, \n     you have bestowed on your countrymen the ultimate prize peace \n     and reconciliation.\n       After you reached agreement on Good Friday, we were \n     exhausted, elated, and emotional. I conclude tonight by \n     repeating what I told some of you then.\n       The agreement was for me the realization of a dream that \n     had sustained me for three-and-a-half years. Now, I have a \n     new dream. In a few years, I will take my young son to \n     Northern Ireland. We will roam the country, taking in the \n     sights and sounds of one of the most beautiful landscapes on \n     earth, feeling the warmth and generosity of a great people. \n     Then, on a rainy afternoon, we will go to the Northern \n     Ireland Assembly. We will sit quietly in the visitors' \n     gallery and watch and listen as you debate the ordinary \n     issues of life in a democratic society: education, health \n     care, agriculture, tourism. There will be no talk of war, for \n     the war will have long been over. There will be no talk of \n     peace, for peace will be taken for granted.\n       On that day, the day on which peace is taken for granted in \n     Northern Ireland, I will be truly and finally fulfilled.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Federally \nImpacted School Improvement Act.\n  As we all know, there is a very important debate going on in our \ncountry today concerning our Nation's schools. Schools all across our \ncountry are crumbling, in many cases in such disrepair that it affects \nthe child's ability to learn or even feel safe. I hope and expect that \nthis Congress will reach a consensus on a school construction bill very \nsoon.\n  I support and have cosponsored several bills in the last Congress \nthat encourage a nationwide effort to rebuild our public schools. Quite \nsimply, it is the right thing to do.\n  But in a heated national debate, one group of children is continually \nleft out in the cold; that is, students who live on federally owned \nland, usually an Indian reservation, very often a military \ninstallation. In my State of Montana, about 12,000 children are \nclassified as federally impacted; that is, they live on Federal land.\n  For almost 50 years, Congress has provided financial assistance to \nschool districts that are impacted by a Federal presence. We call this \nImpact Aid funding. Unfortunately, it has been underfunded for the last \n15 years. And even worse, for the last 5 years Impact Aid schools have \nreceived zero dollars to help in paying for badly needed repairs and \nconstruction.\n  This has created an underclass of schools with glaring infrastructure \nproblems that border on dangerous and inhumane.\n  How bad is it, you may ask? Let me tell you.\n  In one school in Montana, the Hays Lodge Pole Elementary School on \nthe Fort Belknap Reservation, they say that the high school has \ninfrastructure problems that are so bad that saying it has problems is \nlike saying that the Titanic had a small leak.\n  Whenever it rains or snows, the roof leaks making classrooms \nunusable. The kindergarten is located on a stage, not in a classroom. \nThe school nurse and counselor work out of a converted locker room \nshower with no ventilation. The decrepit sewage system regularly backs \nup into this same shower, filling the nurse's and counselor's office \nwith raw sewage. And all special education services, which a large \npercentage of students use, are provided in a separate house requiring \nthe children or staff to walk over an ice rink in high winds and \nadverse weather just to get to class.\n  While some may say, OK, that sounds like a bad deal, shouldn't the \nlocal taxpayers pass a mill levy to build a new school? Or shouldn't \nthey get help from the President's school construction bill which gives \nbillions of dollars in bonding authority to school districts for just \nthese sorts of problems? The answer, sadly, is no.\n\n  The problem is that these schools have no bonding authority. Since \nthe land is owned by the Federal Government, there is no local mill \nlevy to raise. And since the Federal Government has, for 5 consecutive \nyears, provided zero dollars for repairing Impact Aid schools, these \nproblems have just gotten worse and more expensive. And it is our \nchildren who pay the price.\n  So the Baucus-Hagel Federal Impacted School Improvement Act aims to \nfix that. Make no mistake, this is not some budget-busting Government \nhandout. The act authorizes a small but meaningful $50 million a year \nappropriation for the next 5 years for Impact Aid school construction \nand repair.\n  And 45 percent of the funds appropriated under the bill go to Indian \nlands. Another 45 percent is dedicated to military schools. The final \n10 percent is reserved for emergency situations.\n  In order to make this small appropriation go further, our bill \nrequires local school districts to match every\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nFederal dollar except for the 10 percent reserved for true emergencies. \nThe act also limits to $3 million the amount an individual school \ndistrict can receive in any 5-year period. This is done to ensure that \nall--or at least more--impacted schools will have the opportunity to \nuse these grants to improve the lives of their children.\n  Mr. President, this bill is vital to a vast number of children in \nMontana, Nebraska, and all across our country. I am hopeful that a \ncomprehensive school construction bill can pass this Congress. But let \nme tell the Senate today, Senator Hagel and I plan to make sure that \nany school construction bill that passes this Senate will also take \ncare of federally impacted school districts.\n  We hope to pass this bill regardless of the larger debate. But if \nthat does not happen, we will also work to include this act in a \nbroader school construction bill.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate that the children who attend schools \non Indian lands or military installations are all of our children. We \nmust not ignore them or allow their schools to fall into dangerous \ndisrepair. They deserve the same education as every other child. Let us \ntake this opportunity to redress our negligence in ignoring these \nchildren, and show them that we care. Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4215-S4216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know there has been discussion about the \nagenda here in the Senate, what the Senate will take up, what it will \nconsider, what it will debate in the coming days and weeks and months. \nI hear very little discussion about the need to respond to the farm \ncrisis in the rural parts of our country.\n  I have, on half dozen occasions now, brought to the floor of the \nSenate a chart that shows our entire country with those counties \nblocked out in red that are losing population. What it shows is a large \npart of the middle of our country is being depopulated. We have a \nserious and abiding farm crisis. That depopulation in the middle part \nof America stems in large part from a farm economy that means family \nfarmers are not making a living and all too often are having to leave \nthe farm.\n  We keep hearing that it is a global economy. If it is a global \neconomy, then why on earth do we have so many people hungry in the rest \nof the world? We are told 500 to 600 million people go to bed with an \nache in their belly every night because they did not have enough to \neat. Then in the same global economy, with so many hungry people, a \nfarmer somewhere in Cando, ND, or Regent, ND, today loads up a \ntruckload of wheat and takes it to the county elevator and is told that \nthe food has no value. That is not a global economy that seems to work, \nin my judgment.\n  This chart shows what is happening in the heartland of our country. \nMost of it is because of the urgency of the economic crisis facing \nfamily farmers. These red counties are the counties which have lost \nmore than 10 percent of their population. Many of them have lost far \nmore. My home county [Hettinger] is right up in here. It has lost \nalmost half of its population in the last 25 years.\n  The middle part of America is being depopulated. We have a farm \nprogram that doesn't work. We have natural disasters that affect these \nfamily farmers. We have crop diseases. A GAO study I just released last \nweek shows that in North Dakota a crop disease called scab or vomitoxin \nhas cost our farmers $200 million a year in lost income. They say 750 \nfarmers have lost their farms because of just that one crop disease, \nthe worst crop disease in a century in my home State.\n  Natural disasters, crop diseases; how about trade? How about telling \nour family farmers to compete in the global economy with the Europeans \nsubsidizing their farmers in multiples of what we are while we try to \nhelp our farmers open foreign markets. You compete in the international \nmarketplace with one hand tied behind your back. Or how about \ninternational trade that says, why don't we have the Canadians dump \ntens of thousands of semi-truckloads of their grain, their durum wheat \nand their spring wheat into our marketplace in conditions of unfair \ntrade, driving down our prices. That is all right, and we will sit by \nand do nothing about it.\n  That is not a fair circumstance for our farmers. Japan, China; how \nmany in this Chamber know that currently the tariff on American beef \ngoing into Japan is 45 percent, a 45-percent tariff? If we imposed that \non anybody, we would be considered a massive failure. China says maybe \nthey will decrease their tariff on American beef going into China. It \nis now 42.5 percent.\n  Our farmers deserve better trade policies than they are getting from \nthis Government of ours. Our Government cannot do much about natural \ndisasters except respond to them with a helping hand at a time when \npeople need help. It can do something about trade policy that is unfair \nto our producers. And certainly, this administration and this Congress, \nespecially this Congress, ought to do something about a farm bill that \nshortchanges American farmers.\n  The current farm bill we have is a wonderful bill if you are Cargill \nor Continental or some large grain trading company. If you are one of \nthe behemoths, one of the giant agrifactories in America, you have to \nlike the current circumstance. You have low prices at which you can buy \nthe grain. Then you can put it in your plant, apply some air to it, and \nyou can puff it up. Now you can call it puffed wheat and put it on the \ngrocery store shelf. And while you are paying less for the grain, you \ncan increase your prices. That is exactly what is happening, and that \nis exactly what was announced last week.\n  Grain prices for family farmers are collapsed. Cereal manufacturers \nare saying, we want to increase cereal prices 2.5 percent. You talk \nabout a disconnection. You talk about short-circuiting the economic \nsystem. That is a short-circuit.\n  The question for this Congress is, Do we care? I do. Do enough others \ncare to want to save family farmers? Or is America's food production \ndestined to go to the giant agrifactories that farm America from \nCalifornia to Maine with nary a person in sight--no farm lights, no \nyard lights out there illuminating where a family lives and does its \nwork--because there won't be families on the farm?\n\n  Or does this country, does this Congress, as many other countries, \nbelieve that a broad network of family producers on America's farms and \nranches represents the best economic system? Do we believe in the \nJeffersonian model that Thomas Jefferson talked about: That which keeps \nAmerica free is broad-based economic ownership, because economic \nfreedom relates to political freedom?\n  Do we really believe in broad-based economic ownership? If so, let's \nstart to manifest that belief in farm policy. Let's decide that current \nfarm policy is a bankrupt policy. The bill that was passed, the current \nfarm bill that was passed that pulls the rug out from under family \nfarmers says, when prices collapsed, do not bank on us for help--when \nthat bill was passed, without my vote in this Congress, there was \nfeasting and rejoicing and celebrating here in this town by the largest \nagribusinesses because they thought they had just won the lottery. What \na wonderful deal for them.\n  Someday we will have lower grain prices, they thought, and we will \nbuy this grain from family farmers cheap, and then eventually the \nfamily farmers will be gone. They will take over the farms and farm all \nof our country. They will put that grain in plants and will make \nsubstantial money off of it. That is exactly what happened at the \nexpense of family farmers.\n  The question before this Congress is: Are we going to have the will \nto do what is necessary to repair the hole in the safety net for family \nfarmers? Do we care whether there are family farmers left in our \ncountry?\n  Wheat prices have fallen 53 percent. Let me show a chart which \ndemonstrates what has happened to wheat prices. I ask any American, I \nask any Member of the Senate, how would you\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nfeel if this was what was happening to your paycheck? How well would \nyou do if this was what your income looked like? That is what the \nincome looks like on our farms.\n  On America's farms, they see Depression-era prices in constant \ndollars, but their expenses keep going up. Try to buy a tractor or a \ncombine, fertilizer, seed, fuel, at today's prices. See if you get a \nbargain. But then sell the grain that comes from the sweat and the \nlabor, from driving the tractor, planting the seeds in the spring, \ntending that crop through the year and at harvesting in the fall. Try \nto sell that crop, and see what they tell you. Then it is not so much a \ncircumstance where they say, well, times have changed and things cost \nmore. They say, your product that you worked so hard to create is worth \nless, worth less or worthless.\n  This country can do better than that. If we don't do better than \nthat, we won't have any farmers left.\n  We need to decide that by the Memorial Day break or by the July 4 \nbreak at the very latest, we need to do something to repair this safety \nnet. The first step is obvious. I just spoke over in the Appropriations \nCommittee hearing. We have an emergency bill which provides for the \nfirst spring planting loans. That emergency bill was passed many weeks \nago here in the Senate and now, of course, awaits action on the Kosovo \nemergency question. But the climate doesn't wait. The spring doesn't \nwait. Spring planting is needed to move ahead now. Yet the loans that \nmany farmers need to get into the field for the spring, to buy the fuel \nand buy the seed, those loans are not available because we haven't \npassed that emergency supplemental dealing with those emergency loans.\n  That is the first step. That ought to be done immediately.\n  The second step is, between now and the Memorial Day break or the \nJuly 4 break, we ought to do something to put in place a fair price \nplan for family farmers. We ought to have the good sense to do that. \nThere is nothing wrong with making a U-turn when you discover where you \nare headed is the wrong direction. The current farm bill is the wrong \ndirection. It seemed right at the time for a lot of folks who voted for \nit. As I said, I didn't. For those who voted for it when farm prices \nwere better, it seemed like it was the right thing to do. But it was \nthe wrong thing to do.\n  Now that farm prices have collapsed, the question is, Do we have a \nsafety net left in this country for family farmers to try to get them \nacross those price valleys? The answer is no. But we can repair and \nprovide a safety net for family farmers if this Congress and this \ncountry believes it is important to have a broad-based network of \nfamily farm ownership across this country. I believe that very \nstrongly, and I hope my colleagues who support family farming will feel \nthe same way.\n  Now, Mr. President, last week, when I came to the floor of the \nSenate, I held up a newspaper that I got on an airplane in Minneapolis. \nThis paper said: ``Cargill Profits From Decline in Farm Prices; 53 \npercent jump in earnings.'' I don't know Cargill. It is a big \nagrifactory. ``Cargill Profits From Decline in Farm Prices.'' As do all \nof the big economic interests. This was in the same newspaper: \n``General Mills to Boost Cereal Prices 2.5 Percent.'' There is a \ndecline in farm prices, farm prices have collapsed, but cereal \nmanufacturers are going to increase the price of breakfast food 2.5 \npercent.\n  I think the consumers and farmers are both victimized, and they have \na right to ask what on Earth is going on in this country. Farmers are \nbeing shortchanged and consumers are being overcharged. What on Earth \nis happening and when is somebody going to do something about it?\n  On the same day in that newspaper, these two stories tell of the sad, \nsad events that now confront our family farmers: collapsed prices and a \ncircumstance where all of those who take their product and use it, turn \nit into cereal for store shelves, those who haul it, those who trade \nit, and those who add value to that product are making record profits, \nincreasing prices, and are doing fine. But family farmers, of course, \nare going broke.\n  This Congress must decide, and decide quickly. I and others will be \ncoming to the floor repeatedly to ask this question: Why is it when \npeople talk about family values they only refer to cultural values? Why \nis the family not valued as an economic unit in this country? Why \naren't family economics important? The family farm, the family \nbusiness--that is an economic unit that is important to this country, \nand our public policy ought to reflect that. It is long past the time \nwhen Congress ought to address this farm crisis in a serious and \nthoughtful way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the continuing \ncrisis in agriculture. Last night I was watching CNN. They had the \nfirst of a series of programs on the crisis in agriculture. They \ninterviewed a cotton farmer from the Deep South who has a 2,500-acre \nfarm, which is not a small farm but certainly not one of the largest. \nHe was telling the interviewer that he lost $500,000 last year.\n  I tell that story because that was a farmer from the Deep South. I \nrepresent North Dakota, the opposite end of the country. We are having \nexactly the same experience in our part of the country, a farm \ndepression.\n  This is a cartoon that ran in the major newspaper back home. It is a \npicture of vultures sitting on signs of farm auctions, pointing the way \nto farm auctions. There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven \ndifferent signs pointing towards farm auctions with the buzzard sitting \non top of the sign. The cartoon says, ``Tis spring! Tis spring! Tis \nspring!''\n  That is how an awful lot of us are feeling because in most of the \ncountry we are celebrating spring. Certainly here in the Nation's \nCapital we see beautiful flowers in bloom and we are enjoying \nabsolutely gorgeous weather. We are celebrating a rebirth, a renewal.\n  But we are not celebrating in farm country because spring has brought \nus up against hard reality. The hard reality is that our operations are \nnot going to make it. They are not cash-flowing. Many farmers are not \ngetting the credit they need to get into the field this spring.\n  That is why the now stalled emergency supplemental is important. It \nprovides emergency disaster funding for farm credit to assure that \nthose who are credit worthy can get into the field to plant this year's \ncrop.\n  Too many feel that agriculture has turned against them, that policy \nhere has turned against them, that trade policy has turned against \nthem, and, yes, that market forces have turned against them.\n  Look at the very tough facts that our producers face. This chart \nshows wheat prices. The red line on the chart shows the cost of \nproduction across the country. Producing a bushel of wheat costs about \n$5. This jagged line shows what has happened to wheat prices. Wheat \nprices are now $2.40 a bushel, and it costs over $5 to produce it.\n  This is the pattern going back to 1996. The last time we were at the \ncost of production was back in 1996. Since that time, wheat prices have \nplunged. Why? It is a complicated series of factors, starting with the \nAsian financial collapse that cost us some of our best markets, \nfollowed by the financial collapse in Russia that did further damage to \nour farmers because, of course, Russia was a big customer of ours. Yet \nnow they cannot pay because they are out of hard currency. We have had \nthat double whammy. On top of that, we have had good production weather \naround most of the world, so production has been up, yet because of the \nfinancial problems in Asia and Russia, demand is down. That has led to \na dramatic price weakening.\n  In the midst of that, we passed a new farm bill. The new farm bill, \nunfortunately, doesn't work well when prices collapse because there is \nno adjustment for price collapses. Under the old farm policy, when \nprices went down, support\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\nwent up. Under this new policy, support goes down year by year no \nmatter what happens to prices. The combination is leaving our farmers \nin the ditch, literally and figuratively. Our prices are so bad, so \nruinously low, that literally tens of thousands of farm families face \nforeclosure.\n\n  This is not just true in our part of the country. The distinguished \nChair is from a nearby State. They are experiencing the effect of these \nvery low prices, not only in terms of row crops, not only in terms of \nwheat, barley, and other commodities, but in terms of beef, in terms of \nhogs. We see hog prices as low as 8.5 cents a pound. It costs 40 cents \na pound to produce a hog. If farmers only get 8.5 cents a pound when \nthey go to sell, they are in deep trouble.\n  We are down to only 800 hog producers in my State. We anticipate \nlosing as many as three-quarters of them this year; 600 of the 800 are \ngoing to go out of business. The story is not much different in terms \nof beef because we see cattle prices at very, very low levels.\n  The combination--whether it is in our part of the country, the \nnorthern plains, or as I started these remarks talking about this \ncotton farmer in the Deep South losing $500,000 last year on only 2,500 \nacres--is a calamity. What is especially ironic is it is in the midst \nof a great economic boom across the country. We have probably never had \nbetter economic times in the larger economy, yet when we look at \nagriculture, we see the worst of times.\n  It is really a result of a triple whammy: bad prices, bad policy, and \nbad weather. To top it all off, in addition to the bad prices, these \nare the lowest prices in 52 years; on top of that, the bad policy--\ntrade policy and farm policy--that has left farmers without much help \nin a time of this financial collapse; on top of that, we have had bad \nweather. In my State, 5 years of overly wet conditions have led to the \nbiggest outbreak of a disease called scab that has also dramatically \nreduced production. Talk about a bad set of facts, that is it: bad \nprices, bad weather, and bad policy.\n  We have a chance to do something on the policy front. It won't solve \nthe problem, but it will help. It is urgently needed. That is the \ndisaster supplemental that is before the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues, can't we move on that disaster supplemental? \nCan't we move on that legislation now? Can't we pass it? If we wait, it \nwill be too late. If we wait, it is simply going to be too late. \nFarmers need to be in the field now. This is the end of April. Time \nwaits for no man. Time does not wait when you are planting a crop.\n  I hope my colleagues will respond to this plea that we pass the \nurgent supplemental directly. I hope we do it this week and get that \nmoney out there where it can do some good and help these farmers \nthrough what is the worst crisis they have faced since the 1930s.\n  The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to participate in that \neffort. We passed it here the end of March, and now here we are at the \nend of April. There is something dysfunctional when we have disaster \nemergency legislation before us and we passed it in this Chamber a \nmonth ago and it still is not out there; it is still not implemented.\n  Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to act on that disaster \nsupplemental and to do it now. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4217-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL MEDAL OF TECHNOLOGY AWARD\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The majority of responsible business enterprises in the \n     United States are committed to working in cooperation with \n     their contracting partners towards the timely and cost-\n     effective resolution of the many technological, business, and \n     legal issues associated with the Y2K date change.\n       (2) Congress seeks to encourage businesses to concentrate \n     their attention and resources in short time remaining before \n     January 1, 2000, on addressing, assessing, remediating, and \n     testing their Y2K problems, and to minimize any possible \n     business disruptions associated with the Y2K issues.\n       (3) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (4) Y2K issues will potentially affect practically all \n     business enterprises to at least some degree, giving rise \n     possibly to a large number of disputes.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses, particularly \n     small businesses, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Congress recognizes that every business in the United \n     States should be concerned that widespread and protracted Y2K \n     litigation may threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business relationships that are so important to the effective \n     functioning of the world economy, and which may put \n     unbearable strains on an overburdened and sometime \n     ineffective judicial system.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Y2K action.--The term ``Y2K action'' means a civil \n     action commenced in any Federal or State court in which the \n     plaintiff's alleged harm or injury resulted directly or \n     indirectly from an actual or potential Y2K failure, or a \n     claim or defense of a defendant is related directly or \n     indirectly to an actual or potential Y2K failure.\n       (2) Y2K failure.--The term ``Y2K failure'' means failure by \n     any device or system (including any computer system and any \n     microchip or integrated circuit embedded in another device or \n     product), or any software, firmware, or other set or \n     collection of processing instructions to process, to \n     calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, to store, to \n     transmit, or to receive date-related data, including \n     failures--\n       (A) to deal with or account for transitions or comparisons \n     from, into, and between the years 1999 and 2000 accurately;\n       (B) to recognize or accurately process any specific date in \n     1999, 2000, or 2001; or\n       (C) accurately to account for the year 2000's status as a \n     leap year, including recognition and processing of the \n     correct date on February 29, 2000.\n       (3) Actual damages.--The term ``actual damages'' means \n     direct damages for injury to tangible property, and the cost \n     of repairing or replacing products that have a material \n     defect.\n       (4) Economic loss.--Except as otherwise specifically \n     provided in a written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action (and subject to applicable State \n     law), the term ``economic loss''--\n       (A) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than for personal injury or damage to \n     tangible property (other than property that is the subject of \n     the contract); and\n       (B) includes amounts awarded for--\n       (i) lost profits or sales;\n       (ii) business interruption;\n       (iii) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (iv) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (v) losses that must be pleaded as special damages; and\n       (vi) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law); but\n       (C) does not include actual damages.\n       (5) Material defect.--The term ``material defect'' means a \n     defect in any item, whether tangible or intangible, or in the \n     provision of a service, that substantially prevents the item \n     or service from operating or functioning as designed or \n     intended.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages may be awarded under applicable State law, the \n     defendant shall not be liable for punitive damages unless the \n     plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with conscious and flagrant disregard for the \n     rights and property of others.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Punitive damages against a defendant in \n     such a Y2K action may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for actual damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as a individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in such a Y2K \n     action may not be awarded against a person described in \n     section 3(8)(B).\n\n              TITLE I--OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE Y2K PROBLEMS\n\n     SEC. 101. PRE-FILING NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K\n\n[[Page S4220]]\n\n     claim shall serve on each prospective defendant in that \n     action a written notice that identifies with particularity--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) the remedy sought by the prospective plaintiff;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy; and\n       (5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any \n     individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the \n     dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.\n       (b) Delay of Action.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     a prospective plaintiff may not commence a Y2K action in \n     Federal or State court until the expiration of 90 days from \n     the date of service of the notice required by subsection (a).\n       (c) Response to Notice.--Within 30 days after receipt of \n     the notice specified in subsection (a), each prospective \n     defendant shall serve on each prospective plaintiff a written \n     statement acknowledging receipt of the notice, and proposing \n     the actions it has taken or will take to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff. The written \n     statement shall state whether the prospective defendant is \n     willing to engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (d) Failure To Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff,\n\n     then the 90-day period specified in subsection (a) will \n     terminate at the end of the 30-day period as to that \n     prospective defendant and the prospective plaintiff may \n     commence its action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Failure To Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) and without awaiting the \n     expiration of the 90-day period specified in subsection (b), \n     the defendant may treat the plaintiff's complaint as such a \n     notice by so informing the court and the plaintiff. If any \n     defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for 90 days after filing of the \n     complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during this 90-day period.\n       (f) Effect of Contractual Waiting Periods.--In cases in \n     which a contract requires notice of nonperformance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided in the contract is controlling over the \n     waiting period specified in subsections (a) and (e).\n       (g) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n\n     SEC. 102. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, the complaint shall provide \n     specific information as to the nature and amount of each \n     element of damages and the factual basis for the damages \n     calculation.\n       (b) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that a product or service is defective, the \n     complaint shall contain specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (c) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each element of \n     that claim, state with particularity the facts giving rise to \n     a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required \n     state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 103. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably could have been, \n     aware, including reasonable efforts made by a defendant to \n     make information available to purchasers or users of the \n     defendant's product or services concerning means of remedying \n     or avoiding Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 104. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--A person against whom a final judgment is \n     entered in a Y2K action shall be liable solely for the \n     portion of the judgment that corresponds to the relative and \n     proportional responsibility of that person. In determining \n     the percentage of responsibility of any defendant, the trier \n     of fact shall determine that percentage as a percentage of \n     the total fault of all persons, including the plaintiff, \n     who caused or contributed to the total loss incurred by \n     the plaintiff.\n       (b) Several Liability.--Liability in a Y2K action shall be \n     several but not joint.\n\n        TITLE II--Y2K ACTIONS INVOLVING CONTRACT-RELATED CLAIMS\n\n     SEC. 201. CONTRACTS ENFORCED.\n\n       In any Y2K action, any written term or condition of a valid \n     and enforceable contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant, including limitations or exclusions of liability \n     and disclaimers of warranty, is fully enforceable, unless the \n     court determines that the contract as a whole is \n     unenforceable. If the contract is silent with respect to any \n     matter, the interpretation of the contract with respect to \n     that matter shall be determined by applicable law in force at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFENSES.\n\n       (a) Reasonable Efforts.--In any Y2K action in which breach \n     of contract is alleged, in addition to any other rights \n     provided by applicable law, the party against whom the claim \n     of breach is asserted shall be allowed to offer evidence that \n     its implementation of the contract, or its efforts to \n     implement the contract, were reasonable in light of the \n     circumstances for the purpose of limiting or eliminating the \n     defendant's liability.\n       (b) Impossibility or Commercial Impracticability.--In any \n     Y2K action in which breach of contract is alleged, the \n     applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by applicable \n     law in existence on January 1, 1999, and nothing in this Act \n     shall be construed as limiting or impairing a party's right \n     to assert defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 203. DAMAGES LIMITATION.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, consequential or punitive \n     damages unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was executed or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 204. MIXED ACTIONS.\n\n       If a Y2K action includes claims based on breach of contract \n     and tort or other noncontract claims, then this title shall \n     apply to the contract-related claims and title III shall \n     apply to the tort or other noncontract claims.\n\n              TITLE III--Y2K ACTIONS INVOLVING TORT CLAIMS\n\n     SEC. 301. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may not recover \n     damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party;\n       (2) such losses result directly from a personal injury \n     claim resulting from the Y2K failure; or\n       (3) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     property caused by the Y2K failure (other than damage to \n     property that is the subject of the contract),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or \n     State law.\n\n     SEC. 302. CERTAIN DEFENSES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith; Reasonable Efforts.--In any Y2K action \n     except an action for breach or repudiation of contract, the \n     party against whom the claim is asserted shall be entitled to \n     establish, as a complete defense to any claim for damages, \n     that it acted in good faith and took measures that were \n     reasonable under the circumstances to prevent the Y2K failure \n     from occurring or from causing the damages upon which the \n     claim is based.\n       (b) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action making a \n     claim for money damages in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim, the defendant is not liable \n     unless the plaintiff, in addition to establishing all other \n     requisite elements of the claim, proves by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the defendant knew, or recklessly \n     disregarded a known and substantial risk, that the failure \n     would occur in the specific facts and circumstances of the \n     claim.\n       (c) Foreseeability.--In a Y2K action making a claim for \n     money damages, the defendant is not liable unless the \n     plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence, in \n     addition to all other requisite elements of the claim, that \n     the defendant knew, or should have known, that the \n     defendant's action or failure to act would cause harm to the \n     plaintiff in the specific facts and circumstances of the \n     claim.\n       (d) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was within the control of the \n     party against whom a claim for money damages is asserted in a \n     Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery \n     of damages in that action.\n       (e) Preservation of Existing Law.--The provisions of this \n     section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any \n     requirement under applicable law as to burdens of proof and \n     elements necessary for prevailing in a claim for money \n     damages.\n\n     SEC. 303. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) shall not be personally liable in any Y2K \n     action making a tort or other noncontract claim in that \n     person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability was imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) intentionally made misleading statements regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) intentionally withheld from the public significant \n     information there was a legal duty to disclose to the public \n     regarding any actual or potential year 2000 problem of that \n     business or organization which would likely result in \n     actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\n     State law, charter, or a bylaw authorized by State law, in \n     existence on January 1, 1999, that establishes lower limits \n     on the liability of a director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of such a business or organization.\n\n                      TITLE IV--Y2K CLASS ACTIONS\n\n     SEC. 401. MINIMUM INJURY REQUIREMENT.\n\n       In any Y2K action involving a claim that a product or \n     service is defective, the action may be maintained as a class \n     action in Federal or State court as to that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law or applicable rules of civil \n     procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the alleged defect in a product or \n     service is material as to the majority of the members of the \n     class.\n\n     SEC. 402.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am going to offer a compromise amendment \nthat is at the desk, and I further ask unanimous consent that debate \nonly be in order following the offering of that amendment until 2:15 \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Committee Amendment Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Commerce Committee and \nwith the authority of the committee, I withdraw the committee \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendment is withdrawn.\n  The committee amendment was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 267\n\n   (Purpose: To regulate interstate commerce by making provision for \n  dealing with losses arising from Year 2000 problem-related failures \n that may disrupt communications, intermodal transportation, and other \n                 matters affecting interstate commerce)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I send a substitute amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the substitute \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Lott, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n     Burns, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Santorum proposes an \n     amendment numbered 267.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer, with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, a substitute amendment to S. 96, \nthe Y2K Act. The substitute amendment we offer is truly a bipartisan \neffort. We have worked diligently with our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and will continue to do so to address concerns, narrow some \nprovisions, and assure that this bill will sunset when it is no longer \npertinent and necessary.\n  Senator Wyden, who said at our committee markup that he wants to get \nto ``yes,'' has worked tirelessly with me to get there. He has offered \nexcellent suggestions and comments, and I think the substitute we bring \ntoday is a better piece of legislation for his efforts.\n  Specifically, this substitute would provide time for plaintiffs and \ndefendants to resolve Y2K problems without litigation. It reiterates \nthe plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages and highlights the defendant's \nopportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing that by providing information \nand resources. It provides for proportional liability in most cases \nwith exceptions for fraudulent or intentional conduct or where the \nplaintiff has limited assets.\n  It protects governmental entities, including municipalities, school, \nfire, water and sanitation districts from punitive damages, and it \neliminates punitive damage limits for egregious conduct while providing \nsome protection against runaway punitive damage awards. It provides \nprotection for those not directly involved in a Y2K failure.\n\n  The bill as amended does not cover personal injury and wrongful death \ncases. It is important to keep in mind the broad support this bill has \nfrom virtually every segment of our economy. This bill is important not \nonly to the high-tech industry or to big business but carries the \nstrong support of small business, retailers and wholesalers. Many of \nthose supporting the\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\nbill will find themselves as both plaintiffs and defendants. They have \nweighed the benefits and drawbacks of the provisions of this bill and \nhave overwhelmingly concluded that their chief priority is to prevent \nand fix Y2K problems and make our technology work and not divert the \nresources into time-consuming and costly litigation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to interrupt my prepared statement at \nthis time to mention that when we passed this legislation through the \nCommerce Committee, unfortunately, on one of the rare occasions in the \nmore than 2 years that I have been chairman of the committee, it was \npassed on a party line vote, on a vote of 11 to 9.\n  At that time Senator Wyden, Senator Kerry, Senator Dorgan and others \nexpressed a strong desire to work in a bipartisan fashion so that we \ncould pass this legislation. Most of us are aware that when legislation \ngoes to the floor along party lines and is divided on party lines, the \nchances of passage are minimal, to say the least.\n  We worked with Senator Wyden and others, and we made eight major \ncompromises in the original legislation, sufficient in the view of many \nto enhance the ability of this legislation to be passed and, very \nfrankly, satisfy at least some of the concerns of the trial lawyers and \nothers that had been voiced about the legislation.\n  Last night, Senator Wyden and the Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd, and I met, and we discussed three major concerns that Senator \nDodd had, which two we could agree to, and on the third there was some \ndiscussion about language. It was my distinct impression at that time \nthat we had come to an agreement on these three particular additional \nitems.\n  Apparently this morning that is not the case. On the third item there \nis still not agreement between ourselves and Senator Dodd and his \nstaff. I hope we can continue to work on that language.\n  Mr. President, I have been around here now for 13 years. I have seen \nlegislation compromise after compromise made to the point where the \nlegislation itself becomes meaningless. We are approaching that point \nnow.\n  I will be glad to negotiate with anyone. My friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, and I have been in discussions as well. \nBut we cannot violate some of the fundamental principles that I just \narticulated as the reason for this legislation. If we weren't facing a \nvery severe crisis in about 7 or 8 months from now--7 months, I guess--\nthen there would not be a need for this legislation.\n  Our object is to protect innocent business people, both large, medium \nand small, from being exposed to the kind of lawsuits which we know \nwill transpire if we do not do something about the problem.\n  It is not only important that we receive the support of the ``high-\ntech community,'' which is very important to the future of our Nation's \neconomy, but the medium-size businesses, the small businesses, the \nretailers and others are all in support of this legislation.\n  I am aware of the power of the American Trial Lawyers Association. I \nhave been beaten by them on several occasions. They have a string of \nvictories to their credit. They are also, among others, another \nargument for campaign finance reform, which is a diatribe I will not \nenter in today. The fact is this issue needs to be resolved. I would be \nvery disappointed if over a couple of points we cannot agree and this \nlegislation fails to proceed.\n  Did my friend from Oregon have a question or a comment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the \nSenator from Oregon, without losing my claim to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee for his comments. I will just advise my colleagues \nwhere I think we are.\n  First, I think it is important to note that the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee has made nine major changes in the legislation--all \nof them proconsumer, proplaintiff--since the time this legislation left \nthe Commerce Committee. I and other Democrats felt it was important. I \nwant the Record to show that those are major, substantive changes, and \nas the chairman indicated, we had some discussions with Senator Dodd \nlast night and I am hopeful they are going to bear fruit as well, \nbecause Senator Dodd has tackled this in a very thoughtful way as well.\n  I also think it is important that our leadership, Senator Lott and \nSenator Daschle, continue, as they have tried to do, to help us work \nthrough some of the procedural issues which are not directly relevant \nto this legislation, so that it is possible to vote on the McCain-Wyden \nsubstitute expeditiously.\n  I want to tell the Senate that now is the time when this can be done \nin a thoughtful and deliberative way. I don't think the Senate wants to \ncome back next January, when there is a state of panic, as I believe \nthere well could be, over this problem. The time to do it is now. That \nis what we have been working on in committee.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that \nuses date information, and I want it understood how this happened. Y2K \nis not a design flaw; it was an engineering tradeoff. In order to get \nmore space on a disc and in memory, the precision of century indicators \nwas abandoned. Now, it is hard to believe today that disc and memory \nspace used to be at a premium, but it was. The tradeoff became an \nindustry standard, and computers cannot work at all without these \nindustry standards. The standards are the means by which programs and \nsystems exchange information, and it was recently noted: ``The near \nimmortality of computer software came as a shock to programmers. Ask \nanybody who was there. We never expected this stuff to still be \naround.''\n  One way to solve the problem might be to dump all the old layers of \ncomputer code, but that is not realistic. So our goal ought to be to \ntry to bring these systems into compliance as soon as possible and, at \nthe same time--and this is what the McCain-Wyden substitute does--have \na safety net in place.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. I would like to briefly wrap up by \noutlining several of the major changes. The first is that there is a 3-\nyear sunset provision. There are a number of individuals and groups who \nsaid, ``Well, this is just an effort to rewrite the tort law and make \nchanges that are going to stand for all time.'' This provision says \nthat any Y2K failure must occur before January 1, 2003, in order to be \neligible to be covered by the legislation.\n  Second, there were various concerns that there were vague defenses in \nthe legislation, particularly terms that involve a reasonable effort. \nWe said that that ought to be changed, we ought to make sure there \naren't any new and ill-defined Federal defenses. That has been changed.\n\n  Finally, and especially important, for truly egregious kinds of \nconduct and fraudulent activity, where people simply misrepresent the \nfacts in the marketplace, we ensure that punitive damages and the \nopportunity to send a deterrent to egregious and fraudulent activity \nare still in place.\n  So I think these are just some of the major changes we are going to \noutline in the course of the debate. I also say that the latest draft \nalso restores liability for directors and officers, which was again an \neffort to try to be responsive to those who felt that the legislation \nwas not sufficiently proconsumer.\n  I only say--and I appreciate that the chairman of the committee \nyielded me this time--that I think after all of these major changes, \nwhich have taken many hours and, in fact, weeks since the time this \nlegislation came before the Committee on Commerce, we have now produced \nlegislation that particularly Democratic Members of the Senate can \nsupport.\n  This is not legislation where, for example, if someone had their arm \ncut off tragically in a tractor accident, they would not have a remedy. \nWe make sure that all personal injuries which could come about--say an \nelevator doesn't work and a person is tragically injured. This \nlegislation doesn't affect that. That person has all the remedies in \nthe tort law and the personal injury laws that are on the books. This \ninvolves ensuring that there is not chaos in the marketplace early next \nyear, that we don't tie up thousands of our\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\nbusinesses in frivolous suits and do great damage to the emerging \nsector of our economy that is information driven.\n  I thank the chairman for the many changes he has made, and I am \nespecially hopeful that over the next few hours the two leaders, \nSenator Lott and Senator Daschle, can help us work through the \nprocedural quagmire the Senate is in, so we can pass this legislation \nnow, at a time where there is an opportunity to pursue it in a \ndeliberative way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nenormous work on this legislation. I think it bears repeating what we \nhave been able to do here. I believe any objective observer would agree \nthat what Senator Wyden has brought to the bill represents a tremendous \nmovement from the bill we originally passed in the Commerce Committee.\n  These discussions with Senator Wyden and others resulted in at least \neight major changes. The biggest change was that we eliminated the so-\ncalled good-faith defense, because we could not define good faith and \nreasonable efforts.\n  We also put in, as Senator Wyden mentioned, a sunset of January 1, \n2003. There is no cap on punitive damages when the defendant has \nintentionally caused harm to the plaintiff. It clarifies that if a \nplaintiff gives 30 days notice of a problem to the defendant, the \ndefendant has 60 days to fix it. This doesn't result in a 90-day delay \nfor litigation but does offer a critical opportunity to solve problems \nrather than litigate.\n  Language regarding the state of mind and liability of bystanders was \nsignificantly narrowed, redrafted, and clarified in order to assure \nthat the provisions are consistent with the Year 2000 Information and \nReadiness Disclosure Act of 1998.\n  The economic loss rule was likewise rewritten and narrowed to reflect \nthe current law in the majority of States.\n  Proportionate liability was significantly compromised to incorporate \nexceptions to the general rule to protect plaintiffs from suffering \nloss.\n  Class action language was revised and narrowed, and language \nrespecting the effect of State law on contracts and the rules with \nrespect to contract interpretation was also revised to address concerns \nthat Senator Wyden raised.\n  In other words, I believe we have gone a long way.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation will make several \narguments. I respect those arguments. One will be that we are changing \ntort law--that we are somehow fundamentally changing the law despite \nthe fact that this has a sunset provision in it of January 1, 2003.\n  Also, they will say it is not a big problem; it is not nearly as big \na problem as you think it is; there are going to be suits dismissed; \nthat the manufacturers and the high-tech community and the \nbusinesspeople are setting up a straw man here because it is not that \nhuge an issue despite the estimates that there can be as much as $300 \nbillion to $1 trillion taken out of the economy.\n  Let me quote from the Progressive Policy Institute backgrounder of \nMarch 1999. They state:\n\n       As the millennium nears, the year 2000 computer problem \n     poses a critical challenge to our economy. Tremendous \n     investments are being made to fix Y2K problems with U.S. \n     companies expected to spend more than $50 billion. However, \n     these efforts could be hampered by a barrage of potential \n     legislation as fear of liability may keep some businesses \n     from effectively engaging in Y2K remediation efforts.\n\n  Trial attorneys across the country are actually preparing for the \npotential windfall. For those who doubt the emergence of such leviathan \nlitigation, one only needs to listen to what is coming out of certain \nquarters of the legal community. At the American Bar Association annual \nconvention in Toronto last August, a panel of experts predicted that \nthe legal costs associated with Y2K will exceed that of asbestos, \nbreast implants, tobacco, and Superfund litigation combined. That is \nmore than three times the total annual estimated cost of all civil \nlitigation in the United States.\n  That is what was propounded at the American Bar Association \nconvention in Toronto last August.\n  Mr. President, it isn't the Bank of America that is saying that. It \nisn't the high-tech community. It is the American Bar Association.\n\n       Seminars on how to try Y2K cases are well underway, and \n     approximately 500 law firms across the country have put \n     together Y2K litigation teams to capitalize on the event. \n     Also, several lawsuits have already been filed making trial \n     attorneys confident that a large number of businesses, big \n     and small, will end up in court as both a plaintiff and a \n     defendant. Such overwhelming litigation would reduce \n     investment and slow income growth for American workers.\n       Indeed, innovation and economic growth will be stifled by \n     the rapacity of strident litigators. In addition to the \n     potentially huge costs of litigation, there is another unique \n     element to the Y2K problem. In contrast to past cases of \n     business liability where individual firms or even industries \n     engaged in some wrongful and damaging practices, the Y2K \n     problem potentially affects all aspects of the economy as it \n     is for all intents and purposes a unique one-time event. It \n     is best understood as an incomparable societal problem rooted \n     in the early stages of our Nation's transformation to a \n     digital economy. Applying some of the existing standards of \n     litigation to such a distinct and communal problem is simply \n     not appropriate.\n       Legislation is needed to provide incentives for businesses \n     to fix Y2K problems, to encourage resolution of Y2K conflicts \n     outside of the courtroom, and to ensure that the problem is \n     not exploited by untenable lawsuits.\n\n  The Progressive Policy Institute goes on to say at the end:\n\n       In order to diminish the threat of burdensome and \n     unwarranted litigation, it is essential that any legislation \n     addressing Y2K liability do the following:\n       Encourage remediation over litigation and the assignment of \n     blame;\n       Enact fair rules that reassure businesses;\n       That honest efforts at remediation will be rewarded by \n     limiting liability while enforcing contracts and punishing \n     negligence;\n       Promote alternative dispute resolution;\n       And, finally discourage frivolous lawsuits while protecting \n     avenues of redress for parties that suffer real injuries.\n\n  Mr. President, on those four principles we acted in this legislation, \nand then we moved back to, if not the principles of it, some of what, \nin my view, were the most desirable parts of the legislation on the \nnine major issues which I just described in our negotiations with \nSenator Wyden and others. Then we even made concessions in two \nadditional areas with Senator Dodd. And now it is not enough.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Oregon have a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do. I think there is one other important point that \nneeds to be made. It seems to me that the legislation as it stands now \nmakes it very clear that what is really going to govern the vast \nmajority of cases is the written contractual terms between businesses.\n  If you look at page 11 of the subcommittee report, it makes it very \nclear that the act doesn't apply to personal injuries or to wrongful \ndeaths. What is going to apply are the written contractual terms \nbetween businesses.\n  As I recall, the chairman of the Commerce Committee thought \noriginally that in this and other major changes there ought to be a \nFederal standard in this area. There was a concern that was, again, \nwriting new law and tort law. The chairman decided to make it clear \nthat it was going to be written in contractual terms that were going to \ngovern these agreements between businesses.\n  What is the chairman's understanding of how that came about, and why \nthose written contractual terms were important in this reform?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Oregon that he has pretty well \npointed out that there were several standards which could be used for \nboth legal as well as the sense of how the people who are involved in \nthe Y2K situation are involved. To have one standard, I think, was \nclearly called for, although perhaps I would have liked to have seen a \ntougher standard. But the fact is that this was a process of how we \ndevelop legislation. We also wanted to respect the individual \ncontracts, as the Senator from Oregon knows.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say again that my dear friend from \nSouth Carolina has been very patient, and I know that he wants to speak \nat some length. I appreciate both his compassion and commitment and \nknowledge of the issue.\n  We have tried to compromise. We will continue to try to compromise. \nWe\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nare now reaching close to a point where the legislation would be \nmeaningless.\n  I am all in favor of a process where amendments are proposed, where \nthey are debated and voted on. I think that is the way we should do \nbusiness.\n\n  If the Senator from South Carolina has a problem with this \nlegislation, I hope he will propose an amendment to this legislation. I \nwill be glad to debate it, and we will be glad to have votes.\n  It is important that we resolve this legislation. I would not like to \nsee, nor do I think the people of this country deserve, a gridlock \nwhere blocking of any legislation to move forward on this issue takes \nplace. I don't think that is fair. I don't think it is fair or \nappropriate on an issue of this magnitude of which time is of the \nessence. We can't have a blockage of this issue and take this \nlegislation up several months from now.\n  I respect the views of others who oppose this legislation. But let's \ngo through a legislative process. I am willing to stay here all day and \nall night to debate the amendments, whatever they may be. I don't want \nto introduce a cloture motion, because obviously that cuts off people's \nability to debate this issue because of the timeframe and time limits \ninvolved in a cloture motion.\n  But I also urge my colleagues who oppose this legislation, let's not \nengage in extraneous amendments on minimum wage, or violence on TV, or \nguns, or anything else. That, frankly, in all due respect to my \ncolleagues, is avoiding this issue. This issue needs to be addressed.\n  In the eyes of every American, there is a huge problem arising at \n12:01, January 1 of the year 2000. We have an obligation to address \nthat problem.\n  For us to now be sidetracked with other issues and extraneous \namendments, or others, is doing a great disservice to those men and \nwomen, small businesses and large and medium size, which will be \naffected by this serious problem, of which, by the way, even with a \nselect committee we really haven't gotten a good handle on the \nmagnitude of the problem. It depends on what part of our economy, what \npart of government, et cetera.\n  But there is no one who alleges that there is no problem. It is our \nobligation to try to address this problem. Let's do it in an orderly \nfashion with debate, with amendments, and then vote on final passage.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect such a process.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate \nreconvenes at 2:15 it be in order for the Senate Chaplain to offer a \nprayer in honor of the moment of silence being observed in Colorado, \nand following the prayer the junior Senator from Colorado be recognized \nto speak, to be followed by the senior Senator from Colorado who, after \nsome remarks, will offer a moment of silence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the 12:30 recess be extended 10 minutes, until 12:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will go right to the point with \nrespect to the compromise. I have in hand a letter from Craig R. \nBarrett, the distinguished CEO of Intel. Without reading the entire \nletter, the consensus is that what they would really need is a \nsettlement or compromise regarding four particular points. One is \nprocedural incentives; another is with respect to the provisions of \ncontracts, that they have specificity; third, threshold pleading \nprovisions and the amount of damages in materiality of defects which \nwould help constrain class action suits; and, of course, the matter of \nproportionality, or joint and several.\n\n  I contacted Mr. Grove and told him we would yield on three points, \nbut we didn't want to get into tort law with a contract provision--all \ntriable under the Uniform Commercial Code. He didn't think he could \nyield on that fourth one.\n  Since that time, I understand that the downtown Chamber of Commerce \nsays they are not yielding at all with respect to the test in tort law.\n  My colleague from Oregon says there are nine points and that we have \ngotten together. That is garbage. That is not the case at all, I can \nsay that right now.\n  They are determined to change the proof of neglect by ``the greater \nweight of the preponderance of evidence'' to ``clear and convincing.'' \nI thought that was compromise. Reviewing the McCain-Wyden amendment \nthat is now under debate, Members will find on that page scratched out \nand written in, ``clear and convincing evidence.'' They want to change \nthe burden in tort cases from ``the greater weight of the preponderance \nof evidence'' to ``clear and convincing.''\n  How can you do that when you do not have the elements before you? You \ndo not have control of the manufacturer; you do not have control of the \nsoftware. If you are like me and other professionals like our doctor \nfriends or CPAs, they don't know those kinds of things. They have to do \nthe best they can by the greater weight of the preponderance of \nevidence--not clear and convincing.\n  So they stick to punitive, they stick to clear and convincing, they \nstick to joint and several, but they come on the floor of the Senate \nand exclaim how reasonable they are and then allude, of course, to the \ntrial lawyers and talk about campaign financing, but say as an aside, \nWe don't want to get into it--as if the Senator from South Carolina is \npaid by trial lawyers to do this.\n  I represented corporate America, and I will list those companies. I \nwas proud of the Electric and Gas. I was proud of the wholesale grocer, \nPiggly Wiggly firm. We had 121 stores. I was their chief counsel on an \nantitrust case which I took all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. I \nwon. I had good corporate clients, too. I am proud of trial lawyers. We \ndon't have time for frivolous cases.\n  This downtown crowd will never see the courtroom. They sit there in \nthe mahogany rooms with the Persian rugs. Their colleagues call and \nsay, Let's get a continuance, I want to play golf this afternoon--the \nclock runs on billable hours. The clock is running and the clients \nnever know the difference. And they pay $450 to $500 an hour.\n  The distinguished Senator from Ohio who sat in front of me, now a \nnational hero, is indebted to a case for billable hours.\n  We know about downtown. I don't understand aspersions with respect to \nthe trial bar--we are looking out for the injured parties.\n  I want these matters in the Record. The case is clear cut, in this \nSenator's mind. For example, I talked for about an hour in the office \nwith the distinguished head of Intel, Andy Grove, some weeks back. I \ndon't want anyone to be misled, he is for proportionality. That is \nexplained in the letter. However, he said it wasn't a real problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in the March issue of \nBusiness Week entitled ``Be Bug-Free or Get Squashed'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Business Week, Mar. 1, 1999]\n\nBe Bug-Free or Get Squashed--Big Companies May Soon Dump Suppliers That \n                            Aren't Y2K-Ready\n\n       Lloyd Davis is feeling squeezed. In 1998, his $2 million, \n     25-employee fertilizer-equipment business was buffeted by the \n     harsh winds that swept the farm economy. This year, his \n     Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies Inc. in Colby, Kan., \n     is getting slammed by Y2K. Davis needs $71,000 to make his \n     computer systems bug-free by Jan. 1. But he has been able to \n     rustle up only $39,000. His bank has denied him a loan \n     because--ironically--he's not Y2K-ready. But Davis knows he \n     must make the fixes or lose business. ``Our big customers \n     aren't going to wait much longer,'' he frets.\n       Golden Plains and thousands of other small businesses are \n     getting a dire ultimatum from the big corporations they sell \n     to: Get ready for Y2K, or get lost. Multinationals such as \n     General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, and Deere are making the \n     first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for \n     partners and vendors to prove they're bug-free. A recent \n     survey by consultants Cap Gemini America says 69% of the \n     2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with \n     companies that can't pass muster. The National Federation of \n     Independent Business figures more than 1 million companies \n     with 100 workers or less won't make the cut and as many as \n     half could lose big chunks of business or even fail.\n       Weak Links. Cutting thousands of companies out of the \n     supply chain might strain supply lines and could even crimp \n     output. But most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run \n     to avoid bugs in the first place.\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\n       Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the \n     past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers \n     from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, \n     and it continues to look for weak links, says Irene Dec, \n     vice-president for information systems at the company. At \n     Citibank, says Vice-President Ravi Apte, ``cuts have already \n     been made.''\n       Suppliers around the world are feeling the pinch. Nike Inc. \n     has warned its Hong Kong vendors that they must prove they're \n     Y2K ready by Apr. 1. In India, Kishore Padmanabhan, vice-\n     president of Bombay's Tata Consultancy Services, says repairs \n     are runing 6 to 12 months behind. In Japan, ``small firms are \n     having a tough time making fixes and are likely to be the \n     main source of any Y2K problems,'' says Akira Ogata, general \n     research manager for Japan Information Service Users Assn. \n     Foreign companies operating in emerging economies such as \n     China, Malaysia, and Russia are particularly hard-pressed to \n     make Y2K fixes. In Indonesia, where the currency has \n     plummeted to 27% of its 1977 value, many companies still \n     don't consider Y2K a priority.\n       A December, 1998 World Bank survey shows that only 54 of \n     139 developing countries have begun planning for Y2K. Of \n     those, 21 are taking steps to fix problems, but 33 have yet \n     to take action. Indeed, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, \n     an international group of more than 230 institutions in 46 \n     countries, has reconsidered its December, 1998 promise to the \n     U.N. to publish its country-by-country Y2K-readiness ratings. \n     The problem: A peek at the preliminary list has convinced \n     some group members that its release could cause massive \n     capital flight from some developing countries.\n       Big U.S. companies are not sugar-coating the problem. \n     According to Sun Microsystems CEO Scott G. McNealy, Asia is \n     ``anywhere from 6 to 24 months behind'' in fixing the Y2K \n     problem--one he says could lead to shortages of core \n     computers and disk drives early next year. Unresolved, says \n     Guy Rabbat, corporate vice-president for Y2K at Solectron \n     Corp. in San Jose, Calif., the problem could lead to price \n     hikes and costly delivery delays.\n       Thanks to federal legislation passed last fall allowing \n     companies to share Y2K data to speed fixes, Sun and other \n     tech companies, including Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, \n     Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Motorola, are teaming up to \n     put pressure on the suppliers they judge to be least Y2K-\n     ready. Their new High-Technology Consortium on Year 2000 and \n     Beyond is building a private database of suppliers of \n     everything from disk drives to computer-mouse housings. He \n     says the group will offer technical help to laggard firms--\n     partly to show good faith if the industry is challenged later \n     in court. But ``if a vendor's not up to speed by April or \n     May,'' Rabbat says ``it's serious crunch time.''\n       Warnings. Other industries are following suit. Through the \n     Automotive Industry Action Group, GM and other carmakers have \n     set Mar. 31 deadlines for vendors to become Y2K-compliant. In \n     March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will \n     meet with their counterparts from the Food Marketing \n     Institute to launch similar efforts. Other companies are \n     sending a warning to laggards--and shifting business to the \n     tech-savvy. ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and \n     modernize the supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., \n     chairman of the board of Baldor Electric Co, in Fort Smith, \n     Ark.\n       In Washington, Senators Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.) and \n     Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) have introduced separate bills to \n     make it easier for small companies like Davis' to get loans \n     and stay in business. And the World Bank has shelled out $72 \n     million in loans and grants to Y2K-stressed nations, \n     including Argentina and Sri Lanka. But it may be too little \n     too late: AT alone has spent $900 million fixing its \n     systems.\n       Davis, for one, is not ready to quit. ``I've survived \n     tornadoes, windstorms, and drought,'' he says. ``We'll be \n     damaged, yes, but we'll survive.'' Sadly, not everyone will \n     be able to make that claim.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

We pointed that out. In a report by none other \nthan Bill Gates at the World Economic Forum, they believe the \nmillennium bug, aside from some possible glitches in delivery and \nsupply, may pose only modest problems. Mr. Gates talked about it not \nbeing a real problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe New York Times, dated April 12, entitled ``Lawsuits Related to Y2K \nProblem Start Trickling Into the Courts.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 12, 1999]\n\n    Lawsuits Related to Y2K Problem Start Trickling Into the Courts\n\n                         (By Barnaby J. Feder)\n\n       A trickle of new lawsuits in recent months is expanding the \n     legal landscape of the Year 2000 computer problem. But so \n     far, the cases offer little support for the dire predictions \n     that courts will be choked by litigation over Y2K, as the \n     problem is known.\n       Some major equipment vendors, including IBM, AT and \n     Lucent Technologies Inc., for example, have joined the ranks \n     of those being sued for not forewarning customers that \n     equipment they sold in recent years cannot handle Year 2000 \n     dates and for not supplying free upgrades.\n       A California suit claims that Circuit City Stores Inc., \n     CompUSA Inc. and other mass-market retailers violated that \n     state's unfair business practices law by not warning \n     customers about Year 2000 problems in computers and other \n     equipment they sold. And an Alabama lawyer sued the state of \n     Alabama on behalf of two welfare recipients, asking that the \n     state be ordered to set aside money to upgrade its computer \n     systems to ensure that benefits will be delivered without \n     interruption.\n       Despite such skirmishes, though, which lawyers say only \n     offer hints of the wide variety of cases yet to come, there \n     is no sign yet of the kind of high-stakes damage suits that \n     some have projected could overwhelm courts with $1 trillion \n     in claims.\n       In fact, while Congress and many state legislatures are \n     suddenly awash in proposed laws meant to prevent such a tidal \n     wave, many lawyers actively involved with Year 2000 issues \n     now question just how big the litigation threat really is.\n       ``There was more reason to be alarmed a year ago,'' said \n     Wynne Carvill, a partner at Thelen, Reid & Priest in San \n     Francisco, one of the first law firms to devote major \n     resources to Year 2000. ``People are finding things to fix \n     but not many that would shut them down.''\n       The work and the litigation stems from the practice in \n     older computers and software programs of using two digits to \n     denote the year in a date; some mistakenly read next year's \n     ``00'' as meaning 1900, and others do not recognize it as a \n     valid number.\n       Somewhere between 50 and 80 cases linked to the Year 2000 \n     problem have been filed so far, according to various \n     estimates. The vast majority focus on whether hardware and \n     software vendors are obligated to pay for fixing or replacing \n     equipment and programs that malfunction when they encounter \n     Year 2000 dates.\n       When such cases involve consumer products, a key issue has \n     been whether lawsuits could be filed before any malfunctions \n     have actually occurred. Plaintiff's lawyers have likened the \n     situation to a car known to have a safety hazard; Detroit \n     would be expected to take the initiative, send out recall \n     notices to car owners and pay for the fix before an accident \n     occurred, they say.\n       But in the major rulings so far, courts in California and \n     New York have concluded that the law in those states does not \n     treat the fast-changing, low-cost world of consumer software \n     like cars.\n       Actions against Intuit Inc., the manufacturer of Quicken, a \n     popular financial package, have been dismissed because \n     consumers were unable to demonstrate that they had already \n     been damaged.\n       Intuit has promised to make free software patches available \n     before next Jan. 1, but is fighting efforts by plaintiffs' \n     lawyers in California to force the company to compensuate \n     consumers who dealt with the problem by purchasing upgrades \n     before learning of the free fix.\n       The case against mass retailers, filed in Contra Costa \n     County, Calif., in January, argues that the stores violated a \n     state consumer protection statute by selling a wide array of \n     software, including Windows 98 and certain versions of \n     Quicken, Microsoft Works, Peachtree Accounting and Norton \n     Anti-Virus, without warning customers about potential Year \n     2000 problems or supplying free patches from the \n     manufacturers.\n       In cases where consumers were told of software defects, the \n     complaint contends, they were sometimes told that the least \n     expensive solution was to buy an upgrade from the store, even \n     though the manufacturers had a stated policy of providing \n     free patches.\n       The complaint also cites hardware with Year 2000 defects \n     that was sold in the stores without warning, including \n     equipment from Compaq Computer, NEC and Toshiba from 1995 to \n     1997. it also contends that as recently as this year, the \n     stores have been packaging a wide variety of new computers \n     with software that contains Year 2000 defects.\n       The stores have moved to dismiss the suit, arguing among \n     other things that failing to warn consumers about defects \n     does not amount to misleading them under the California law.\n       Many other cases have involved business software, services \n     and computer equipment, but lawyers describe them largely as \n     ``plain vanilla'' contract disputes.\n       The first case to result in a settlement paying damages to \n     a plaintiff involved Produce Palace International, a Warren, \n     MI., grocery that had complained that its business had been \n     repeatedly interrupted by the failure of a computerized \n     checkout scanning system to read credit cards expiring in the \n     Year 2000. In the settlement, reached last November, the \n     vendor, TEC America Inc., an Atlanta-based unit of the TEC \n     Corp. of Japan, paid Produce Palace $250,000.\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\n       Several software manufacturers have settled suits on terms \n     that provide free upgrades and payments to the lawyers that \n     sued them. Last month, for example, a magistrate for U.S. \n     District Court in New Jersey approved a settlement that \n     provided up to $46 million in upgrades and $600,000 in cash \n     to doctors who had purchased billing management software from \n     Medical Manager Corp.\n       That is not the end of Year 2000 problems for Medical \n     Manager, which is based in Tampa, FL. It still has to contend \n     with a shareholder lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in \n     Florida last fall after its stock tumbled on the news of the \n     New Jersey class-action suit. Several other shareholder suits \n     have been filed against other software companies based on \n     claims linking Year 2000 problems to stock declines.\n       In general, defendants have fared well in Year 2000 \n     business software cases. Courts have strictly interpreted \n     contracts and licenses to prevent plaintiffs from collecting \n     on claims for upgrades or services unless they were \n     specifically called for in the contract.\n       In December, an Ohio court threw out a potential class-\n     action claim against Macola Inc., a software company, \n     contending that early versions of its accounting program with \n     Year 2000 defects should be upgraded for free because the \n     company advertised it as ``software you'll never outgrow.''\n       The court ruled that anyone actually licensing the software \n     accepted the explicit and very limited terms of the warranty \n     as all that Macola had legally promised. That decision has \n     been appealed.\n       One closely watched case involves the Cincinnati Insurance \n     Co.'s request that a U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids, \n     Iowa, declare that the company is not obligated to defend or \n     reimburse a client that has been sued on an accusation that \n     it failed to provide hospital management software free of \n     Year 2000 defects.\n       It is the first case to raise the question of whether \n     insurance companies may be ultimately liable for much of the \n     hundreds of billions spent on Year 2000 repairs, if not \n     damages from breakdowns in the future. But lawyers say the \n     actual insurance policy at issue may not cover the crucial \n     years in the underlying suit against Cincinnati Insurance's \n     client. That wrinkle, they say, could let the insurer off the \n     hook without the court's shedding light on the larger issues.\n       ``The results in the initial cases have dampened the fervor \n     somewhat,'' said Charles Kerr, a New York lawyer who heads \n     the Year 2000 section of the Practicing Law Institute, a \n     legal education group. ``Legislation could change the \n     landscape dramatically.''\n       Many lawyers say the momentum for some kind of action in \n     Congress looks unstoppable. Seven states have already barred \n     Year 2000 damage suits against themselves and similar \n     proposals were filed in 30 other legislatures this year. Some \n     states have already passed bills limiting private lawsuits as \n     well. A recent example, signed last Tuesday in Colorado, \n     gives businesses that attempt to address their Year 2000 \n     risks stronger defenses against lawsuits; it also bans \n     punitive damages as a remedy in such litigation.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article entitled ``Liability for the Millennium Bug'' from the New \nYork Times, dated April 26.\n  The being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  [The New York Times, Apr. 26, 1999]\n\n                    Liability for the Millennium Bug\n\n       With 249 days to go until the year 2000, many experts are \n     alarmed and others are only mildly concerned about the danger \n     of computer chaos posed by the so-called millennium bug. One \n     prediction seems safe, however. Whatever the damage, there \n     will be lots of lawsuits. In anticipation, some in Congress, \n     mainly Republicans, want legislation to limit the right of \n     people and businesses to sue in the event of a Y2K disaster. \n     Their reasoning is that the important thing is to get people \n     to fix their computer problems now rather than wait and sue. \n     But the legislation is misguided and potentially unfair. It \n     could even lessen the incentive for corrective action.\n       As most people know by now, the millennium bug arises from \n     the fact that chips and software have been coded to mark the \n     years with only two digits, so that when the date on \n     computers moves over to the year 2000, the computers may go \n     haywire when they register 1900 instead. A recent survey by a \n     Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 found that while \n     many Government agencies and larger companies have taken \n     action to correct the bug, 50 percent of the country's small- \n     and medium-size businesses have not. The failure is \n     especially worrisome in the health sector, with many \n     hospitals and 90 percent of doctors' offices unprepared.\n       If hospitals, supermarkets, utilities and small businesses \n     are forced to shut down because of computer problems, \n     lawsuits against computer and software manufacturers will \n     certainly result. Some experts estimate that liability could \n     reach $1 trillion. Legislation to protect potential \n     defendants, sponsored by Senator John McCain of Arizona, is \n     expected to be voted on in the Senate this week. The bill \n     would impose caps on punitive damages and tighter standards \n     of proof of liability, and provide for a 90-day waiting \n     period in which the sued company would be allowed to cure the \n     problem. The bills would also suspend ``joint and several \n     liability,'' under which wealthy defendants, like chip or \n     software companies, could have to pay the full cost of \n     damages if other parties could not be sued because they were \n     overseas or unable to pay.\n       These provisions would curtail or even suspend a basic \n     protection, the right to sue, that consumers and businesses \n     have long enjoyed. The White House and the Congressional \n     Democratic leadership are right to view such a step as \n     unnecessary. Existing liability laws offer plenty of \n     protections for businesses that might be sued. Proponents of \n     the legislation argue, for example, that companies that make \n     good-faith efforts to alert customers of Y2K problems should \n     not be punished if the customers ignore the warning, or if \n     the companies bear only a small portion of the \n     responsibility. But state liability laws already allow for \n     these defenses. The larger worry is that the prospect of \n     immunity could dissuade equipment and software makers from \n     making the effort to correct the millennium-bug problem.\n       It might make sense to have a 90-day ``cooling off'' period \n     for affected businesses to get help to fix as many problems \n     as possible without being able to file lawsuits. But it would \n     be catastrophic if stores, small businesses and vital \n     organizations like hospitals and utilities were shut down for \n     90 days. They should have the same recourse to relief from \n     the parties that supplied them with faulty goods that any \n     other customer has.\n       Government can certainly help by providing loans, subsidies \n     and expertise to computer users and, perhaps, by setting up \n     special courts to adjudicate claims. Congress can also \n     clarify the liability of companies once it becomes clear how \n     widespread the problem really is. But before the new year, \n     the Government should not use the millennium bug to overturn \n     longstanding liability practices. A potential crisis is no \n     time to abrogate legal rights.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This article says a potential crisis is no time to \nabrogate legal rights. They come out in opposition of this particular \nlegislation.\n  My colleague from Oregon says that has all been cleaned up by his \nparticular amendment. Not at all. I ask unanimous consent an article \nfrom the Oregonian, dated March 22, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Y2K Escape Clause\n\n                            (By Paul Gillin)\n\n       Faced with an almost certain flood of year 2000-related \n     litigation, industry groups are banding together to try to \n     limit their liability. Users should oppose those efforts with \n     all their power. This legal debate is tricky because the \n     combatants are equally opportunistic and unpleasant. On one \n     side is the Information Technology Association of America, in \n     alliance with various other industrial groups. They have \n     proposed a law that, among other things, would limit punitive \n     damages in year 2000 cases to triple damages and give \n     defendants 90 days to fix a problem before being named in a \n     suit. On the other side are lawyers' associations that \n     anticipate a bonanza of fees, even if the year 2000 problem \n     doesn't turn out to be that serious.\n       Hard as it is to find a good guy, you have to give the \n     lawyers their due. Year 2000 may be their opportunity, but it \n     isn't their problem.\n       The problem belongs--hook, line and sinker--to the vendors \n     that capriciously ignored warnings from as long ago as the \n     late '70s and that now are trying to buy a free pass from \n     Congress. It's appalling to look at the list of recent \n     software products that have year 2000 problems. It has been \n     five years since year 2000 awareness washed over the computer \n     industry, which makes it difficult to believe that products \n     such as Office 97 aren't fully compliant.\n       The industry players behind this legislation package are \n     the same ones that helped push through the Trojan horse \n     called the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act \n     last October. That bill provides vendors with a cloak of \n     legal protection based on past statements about efforts to \n     correct the problem. The industry players have tried to color \n     the bills as reasonable hedges against frivolous lawsuits \n     that will sap the legal system post-new year. Yet defendants \n     in personal injury and class-action suits enjoy no such \n     protections.\n       Vendors have had plenty of time to prepare for 2000. The \n     fact that some were more preoccupied with quarterly earnings \n     and stock options than in protecting their customers is no \n     excuse for giving them a get-out-of-jail-free card now.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. One line in the article reads,\n\n       Sponsoring GOP Senators say this bill would provide \n     incentives for solving technical issues before failures \n     occur, but in fact it does just the opposite. It eliminates \n     the threat of lawsuits as a negative incentive for companies \n     that might otherwise neglect their responsibilities in \n     addressing their Y2K problems or reimbursing consumers for \n     their losses. Federal legislation that overrides\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\n     State courts is a serious infringement on States' rights that \n     merits only rare application, while a massive computer \n     meltdown meets that criteria. Congress passed the tightly-\n     crafted bipartisan bill to help companies work through the \n     problem.\n\n  As you can see from the Business Week article, they worked through \nthat problem.\n  Mr. President, there was some interesting testimony that we received \nbefore our committee a few weeks back from a Dr. Robert Courtney. It is \ntalking about the cases.\n  Incidentally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter \nof yesterday from the Honorable Ronald N. Weikers.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Philadelphia, PA, April 26, 1999.\n     Re Y2K Legislation Unnecessary.\n     Mr. Moses Boyd,\n     Office of the Honorable Fritz Hollings, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Mr. Boyd: Thank you for speaking with me earlier. \n     Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to \n     date have been dismissed entirely or almost entirely.

Weikers, Attorney at Law, \n     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n  Mr. President, there are things in here to emphasize. One is: ``I do \nnot represent any clients that have an interest in the passage or \ndefeat of any proposed Y2K legislation.'' And I emphasize that his book \nwill be published by the West Group in June. The month after next, in \nabout 5 or 6 weeks, this book will be coming out. I can tell you as a \npracticing attorney that the West Group is not going to publish any \npartisan political book or edition. It would not sell to the lawyers on \nboth sides. We like to look up and find the authorities, not political \narguments. The West Group is in that particular field professionally of \ndocumenting in a research fashion the matter of Y2K cases in this \nparticular interest. I can tell you right now they have pretty good \nevidence about what has been occurring.\n  What has been occurring is best evidenced by the testimony of Dr. \nRobert Courtney before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation on February 9 on S. 96, the Y2K Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent that his testimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of Dr. Robert Courtney at the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Hearing on S. 96, the Y2K Act, February 9, \n                                  1999\n\n       Good morning, my name is Bob Courtney, and I am a doctor \n     from Atlantic County, New Jersey. It is an honor for me to be \n     here this morning, and I thank you for inviting me to offer \n     testimony on the Y2K issue.\n       As a way of background, I am an ob/gyn and a solo \n     practitioner. I do not have an office manager. It's just my \n     Registered Nurse, Diane Hurff, and me, taking care of my 2000 \n     patients.\n       These days, it is getting tougher and tougher for those of \n     us who provide traditional, personalized medical services. \n     The paperwork required by the government on one hand, and by \n     insurance companies on the other is forcing me to spend fewer \n     hours doing what I do best--taking care of patients and \n     delivering their babies.\n       But it was a Y2K problem which recently posed a serious \n     threat to my practice, and that is why I am here this \n     morning.\n       As a matter of clarification, although I am a doctor, I am \n     not here to speak on behalf of the American Medical \n     Association. Although I am also a small businessman, I am not \n     here to speak on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I cannot \n     tell you who these organizations feel about the legislation \n     before the Committee. But I can tell you how it would have \n     affected my practice and my business.\n       I am one of the lucky ones. While a potential Y2K failure \n     impacted my practice, the computer vendor that sold me the \n     software system and I were able to reach an out-of-court \n     settlement which was fair and expedient. From what my \n     attorney, Harris Pogust, who is here with me today tells me, \n     I doubt I would have been so lucky had this legislation been \n     in effect.\n       In 1987, I purchased a computer system from Medical \n     Manager, one of the leading medical systems providers in the \n     country. I used the Medical Manager system for tracking \n     surgery, scheduling due dates and billing. The system worked \n     well for me for ten years, until the computer finally crashed \n     from lack of sufficient memory.\n       In 1996, I replaced my old system with a new, state of the \n     art pentium system from Medical Manager for $13,000. This was \n     a huge investment for a practice of my size.\n       I remember joking with the computer salesman at the time \n     that this was a big purchase for me, and that I was counting \n     on this system to last as long as the last one did.\n       I remember the salesman telling me that he was sure that I \n     would get at least ten years out of it. He showed me a list \n     of how many of his local customers had used the Medical \n     Manager for longer than ten years.\n       And, the salesman pointed me to this advertising brochure \n     put out by Medical Manager. It states that their product \n     would provide doctors with ``the ability to manage [their] \n     future.''\n       In truth, I never asked the salesman about whether the new \n     system that I was buying was Y2K compliant. I honestly did \n     not know even to ask the question. After all, I deliver \n     babies. I don't program computers. Based on the salesman's \n     statements and the brochure, I assumed the system would work \n     long into the future. After all, he had promised me over ten \n     years' use, which would take me to 2006.\n       But just one year later, I received a form letter from \n     Medical Manager telling me that the system I had just \n     purchased had a Y2K problem. It was a problem that would make \n     it impossible for me to schedule due dates or handle my \n     administrative tasks--as early as 1999.\n       Medical Manager also offered to fix the problem that they \n     had created--but for $25,000.\n       I was outraged, as I suspect anyone sitting around this \n     table would be. The original system had cost me $15,000 when \n     I purchased it in 1986. The upgraded system cost me $13,000 \n     in 1996. Now, a year later, they wanted another $25,000. They \n     knew when they sold me the $13,000 system that it would need \n     this upgrade--but of course, they didn't tell me.\n       I wrote back to the company that I fully expected them to \n     fix the problem for free, since I had just bought the system \n     from them and I had been promised that it would work long \n     into the future.\n       The company ignored my request, however, and several months \n     later, sent me an estimate for fixing the problem--again, for \n     over $25,000.\n       At this point, I was faced with a truly difficult dilemma. \n     My practice depends on the use of a computer system to track \n     my patients' due dates, surgeries and billings--but I did not \n     have $25,000 to pay for an upgrade. Additionally, I was \n     appalled at the thought of having to pay Medical Manager for \n     a problem that they had created and should have anticipated. \n     If I had to pay that $25,000, that would force me to drop \n     many of my indigent patients that I now treat for free.\n       Since Medical Manager insisted upon charging me for the new \n     system, and because my one year-old system was no longer \n     dependable, I retained an attorney and sued Medical Manager \n     to fix or replace my computer system at their cost.\n       Within two months of filing our action, Medical Manager \n     offered to settle by providing all customers who bought a \n     non-Y2K compliant system from them after 1990 with a free \n     upgrade that makes their systems Y2K compliant by utilizing a \n     software ``patch.''\n       This settlement gave me what I wanted from Medical \n     Manager--the ability to use my computer system as it was \n     meant to be used. To my great satisfaction, the legal system \n     worked for me and the thousands of other doctors who bought \n     Medical Manager's products since 1990. In fact, since I \n     brought\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\n     my claim against Medical Manager, I have received numerous \n     telephone calls and letters from doctors across the country \n     who had similar experiences.\n       Additionally, even Medical Manager has stated that it was \n     pleased with the settlement. According to the Medical Manager \n     president who was quoted in the American Medical News, \n     ``[f]or both our users and our shareholders, the best thing \n     was to provide a Y2K solution. This is a win for our users \n     and a win for us.'' [pick up article and display to Senators]\n       I simply do not see why the rights of doctors and other \n     small businesses to recover from a company such as Medical \n     Manager should be limited--which is what I understand this \n     bill would do. Indeed, my attorney tells me that if this \n     legislation had been in effect when I bought my system, \n     Medical Manager would not have settled. I would still be in \n     litigation, and might have lost my practice.\n       As an aside, at roughly the same time I bought the non-\n     compliant system from Medical Manager, I purchased a sonogram \n     machine from ADR. That equipment was Y2K compliant. The \n     Salesman never told me it was compliant. It was simply built \n     to last. Why should we be protecting the vendors or \n     manufacturers of defective products rather than rewarding the \n     responsible ones?\n       Also, as a doctor, I also hope the Committee will look into \n     the implications of this legislation for both patient health \n     and potential medical malpractice suits. This is an issue \n     that many doctors have asked me about, and that generates \n     considerable concern in the medical community.\n       In sum, I do appreciate this opportunity to share my \n     experiences with the Committee. I guess the main message I \n     would like to leave you with is that Y2K problems affect the \n     lives of everyday people like myself, but the current legal \n     system works. Changing the equation now could give companies \n     like Medical Manager an incentive to undertake prolonged \n     litigation strategies rather than agree to speedy and fair \n     out-of-court settlements.\n       I became a doctor, and a sole practitioner, because I love \n     delivering babies. I give each of my patients my home phone \n     number. I am part of their lives. This Y2K problem could have \n     forced me to give all that up. It is only because of my \n     lawyer, and the court system, that I can continue to be the \n     doctor that I have been. This bill, and others like it, would \n     take that away from me. Please don't do that. Leave the \n     system as it is. The court worked for me--and it will work \n     for others.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, he is a doctor from Atlantic County, NJ. \nI will not read it in its entirety, but he said:\n\n       . . .

I call your \n     attention to page nine of that testimony where we address our \n     specific concerns with this type of legislation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that testimony \nwhich was prepared before the committee on the House side.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of Donald J. Palmisano, M.D., J.D., Member, Board of \n Directors, and Chair, Development Committee, National Patient Safety \nFoundation, and Member, Board of Trustees, American Medical Association\n\n(Testimony Before the House Committee on Ways and Means--Hearing on the \n  Year 2000 Conversion Efforts and Implications for Beneficiaries and \n                     Taxpayers, February 24, 1999)\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, my name is \n     Donald J. Palmisano, MD, JD. I am a member of the Board of \n     Trustees of the American Medical Association (AMA), a Board \n     of Directors member of the National Patient Safety Foundation \n     (NPSF) and the Chair of the Development Committee for the \n     same foundation. I also practice vascular and general surgery \n     in New Orleans, Louisiana. On behalf of the three hundred \n     thousands physician and medical student members of the AMA, I \n     appreciate the chance to comment on the issue of year 2000 \n     conversion efforts and the implications of the year 2000 \n     problem for health care beneficiaries.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The year 2000 problem has arisen because many computer \n     systems, software and embedded microchips cannot properly \n     process date information. These devices and software can only \n     read the last two digits of the ``year'' field of data; the \n     first two digits are presumer to be ``19.'' Consequently, \n     when data requires the entry of a date in the year 2000 or \n     later, these systems, devices and software will be incapable \n     of correctly processing the data.\n       Currently, nearly all industries are in some manner \n     dependent on information technology, and the medical industry \n     is no exception. As technology advances and its contributions \n     mount, our dependency and consequent vulnerability become \n     more and more evident. The year 2000 problem is revealing to \n     us that vulnerability.\n       By the nature of its work, the medical industry relies \n     tremendously on technology, on computer sytems--both hardware \n     and software, as well as medical devices that have embedded \n     microchips. A survey conducted last year by the AMA found \n     that almost 90% of the nation's physicians are\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\n     using computers in their practices, and 40% are using them to \n     log patient histories.\\1\\ These numbers appear to be growing \n     as physicians seek to increase efficiency and effectiveness \n     in their practices and when treating their patients.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Virtually every aspect of the medical profession depends in \n     some way on these systems--for treating patients, handling \n     administrative office functions, and conducting transactions. \n     For some industries, software glitches or even system \n     failures, can, at best, cause inconvenience, and at worst, \n     cripple the business. In medicine, those same software or \n     systems malfunctions can, much more seriously, cause patient \n     injuries and deaths.\n\n\n                              Patient Care\n\n       Assessing the current level of risk attributable \n     specifically to the year 2000 problem within the patient care \n     setting remains problematic. We do know, however, that the \n     risk is present and it is real. Consider for a minute what \n     would occur if a monitor failed to sound an alarm when a \n     patient's heart stopped beating. Or if a respirator delivered \n     ``unscheduled breaths'' to a respirator-dependent patient. Or \n     even if a digital display were to attribute the name of one \n     patient to medical data from another patient. Are these \n     scenarios hypothetical, based on conjecture? No. Software \n     problems have caused each one of these medical devices to \n     malfunction with potentially fatal consequences.\\2\\ The \n     potential danger is present.\n       The risk of patient injury is also real. Since 1986, the \n     FDA has received more than 450 reports identifying software \n     defects--not related to the year 2000--in medical devices. \n     Consider one instance--when software error caused a radiation \n     machine to deliver excessive doses to six cancer patients; \n     for three of them the software error was fatal.\\3\\ We can \n     anticipate that, left unresolved, medical device software \n     malfunctions due to the millennium bug would be prevalent and \n     could be serious.\n       Medical device manufacturers must immediately disclose to \n     the public whether their products are Y2K compliant. \n     Physicians and other health care providers do not have the \n     expertise or resources to determine reliably whether the \n     medical equipment they possess will function properly in the \n     year 2000. Only the manufacturers have the necessary in-depth \n     knowledge of the devices they have sold.\n       Nevertheless, medical device manufacturers have not always \n     been willing to assist end-users in determining whether their \n     products are year 2000 compliant. Last year, the Acting \n     Commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, testified \n     before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 \n     Problem that the FDA estimated that only approximately 500 of \n     the 2,700 manufacturers of potentially problematic equipment \n     had even responded to inquiries for information. Even when \n     vendors did respond, their responses frequently were not \n     helpful. The Department of Veterans Affairs reported last \n     year that of more than 1,600 medical device manufacturers it \n     had previously contacted, 233 manufacturers did not even \n     reply and another 187 vendors said they were not responsible \n     for alterations because they had merged, were purchased by \n     another company, or were no longer in business. One hundred \n     two companies reported a total of 673 models that were not \n     compliant but should be repaired or updated this year.\\4\\ \n     Since July 1998, however, representatives of the \n     manufacturers industry have met with the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, the FDA, the AMA and others to discuss \n     obstacles to compliance and have promised to do more for the \n     health care industry.\n\n\n                             administrative\n\n       Many physicians and medical centers are also increasingly \n     relying on information systems for conducting medical \n     transactions, such as communicating referrals and \n     electronically transmitting prescriptions, as well as \n     maintaining medical records. Many physician and medical \n     center networks have even begun creating large clinical data \n     repositories and master person indices to maintain, \n     consolidate and manipulate clinical information, to increase \n     efficiency and ultimately to improve patient care. If these \n     information systems malfunction, critical data may be lost, \n     or worse--unintentionally and incorrectly modified. Even an \n     inability to access critical data when needed can seriously \n     jeopardize patient safety.\n       Other administrative aspects of the Y2K problem involve \n     Medicare coding and billing transactions. In the middle of \n     last year, HCFA issued instructions through its contractors \n     informing physicians and other health care professionals that \n     electronic and paper claims would have to meet Y2K compliance \n     criteria by October 1, 1998. In September 1998, however, HCFA \n     directed Medicare carriers and fiscal intermediaries not to \n     reject or ``return as unprocessable'' any electronic media \n     claims for non-Y2K compliance until further notice. That \n     notice came last month. In January 1999, HCFA instructed both \n     carriers and fiscal intermediaries to inform health care \n     providers, including physicians, and suppliers that claims \n     received on or after April 5, 1999, which are not Y2K \n     compliant will be rejected and returned as unprocessable.\n       We understand why HCFA is taking this action at this time. \n     We genuinely hope, however, that HCFA, to the extent \n     possible, will assist physicians and other health care \n     professionals who have been unable to achieve Y2K compliance \n     by April 5. We have been informed that HCFA has decided to \n     grant physicians additional time, if necessary, for \n     reasonable good faith exceptions, and we strongly support \n     that decision. Physicians are genuinely trying to comply with \n     HCFA's Y2K directives. In fact, HCFA has already represented \n     that 95% of the electronic bills being submitted by \n     physicians and other Medicare Part B providers already meet \n     HCFA's Y2K filing criteria. HCFA must not withhold \n     reimbursement to, in any sense, punish those relatively few \n     health care professionals who have lacked the necessary \n     resources to meet HCFA's Y2K criteria. Instead, physicians \n     and HCFA need to continue to work together to make sure that \n     their respective data processing systems are functioning \n     properly for the orderly and timely processing of Medicare \n     claims data.\n       We also hope that HCFA's January 1999 instructions are not \n     creating a double standard. According to the instructions. \n     HCFA will reject non-Y2K compliant claims from physicians, \n     other health care providers and suppliers. HCFA however \n     has failed to state publicly whether Medicare contractors \n     are under the same obligation to meet the April 5th \n     deadline. Consequently, after April 5th non-compliant \n     Medicare contractors will likely continue to receive \n     reimbursement from HCFA while physicians, other health \n     care providers, and suppliers that file claims not meeting \n     HCFA's Y2K criteria will have their claims rejected. this \n     inequity must be corrected.\n       Medicare administrative issues are of critical importance \n     to patients, physicians, and other health care professionals. \n     In one scenario that took place in my home state of \n     Louisiana, Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the Medicare \n     claims processor for Louisiana, implemented a new computer \n     system--intended to be Y2K compliant--to handle physicians' \n     Medicare claims. Although physicians were warned in advance \n     that the implementation might result in payment delays of a \n     couple of weeks, implementation problems resulted in \n     significantly longer delays. For many physicians, this became \n     a real crisis. Physicians who were treating significant \n     numbers of Medicare patients immediately felt significant \n     financial pressure and had to scramble to cover payroll and \n     purchase necessary supplies.\\5\\\n       We are encouraging physicians to address the myriad \n     challenges the Y2K dilemma poses for their patients and their \n     practices, which include claims submission requirements. The \n     public remains concerned however that the federal government \n     may not achieve Y2K compliance before critical deadlines. An \n     Office of Management and Budget report issued on December 8, \n     1998, disclosed that the Department of Health and Human \n     Services is only 49% Y2K compliant.\\6\\ In a meeting last \n     week, though, HCFA representatives stated that HCFA has made \n     significant progress towards Y2K compliance, specifically on \n     mission critical systems. In any case, we believe that HCFA \n     should lead by example and have its systems in compliance as \n     quickly as possible to allow for adequate parallel testing \n     with physician claims submission software and other health \n     care professionals. Such testing would also allow for further \n     systems refinements, if necessary.\n\n\n                reimbursement and implementation of BBA\n\n       To shore up its operations, HCFA has stated that it will \n     concentrate on fixing its internal computers and systems. As \n     a result, it has decided not to implement some changes \n     required under the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, and it \n     plans to postpone physicians' payment updates from January 1, \n     2000, to about April 1, 2000.\n       In the AMA's view, the Y2K problem is and has been an \n     identifiable and solvable problem. Society has known for many \n     years that the date problem was coming and that individuals \n     and institutions needed to take remedial steps to address the \n     problem. There is no justification for creating a situation \n     where physicians, hospitals and other providers now are being \n     asked to pay for government's mistakes by accepting a delay \n     in their year 2000 payment updates.\n       HCFA has indicated to the AMA that the delay in making the \n     payment updates is not being done to save money for the \n     Medicare Trust Funds. In addition, the agency has said that \n     the eventual payment updates will be conducted in such a way \n     as to fairly reimburse physicians for the payment update they \n     should have received. In other words, the updates will be \n     adjusted so that total expenditures in the year 2000 on \n     physician services are no different than if the updates had \n     occurred on January 1.\n       We are pleased that HCFA has indicated a willingness to \n     work with us on this issue. But we have grave concerns about \n     the agency's ability to devise a solution that is equitable \n     and acceptable to all physicians.\n       Also, as it turns out, the year 2000 is a critical year for \n     physicians because several important BBA changes are \n     scheduled to be made in the resource-based relative value \n     scale (RMRVS) that Medicare uses to determine physician \n     payments. This relative value scale is comprised of three \n     components: work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. \n     Two of the three--practice expense and malpractice--are due \n     to undergo Congressionally-mandated modifications in the year \n     2000.\n       In general, the practice expense changes will have \n     different effects on the various specialities. Malpractice \n     changes, to some modest degree, would offset the practice \n     expense\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n     redistributions. To now delay one or both of these changes \n     will have different consequences for different medical \n     specialties and could put HCFA at the eye of storm that \n     might have been avoided with proper preparation.\n       To make matters worse, we also are concerned that delays in \n     Medicare's reimbursement updates could have consequences far \n     beyond the Medicare program. Many private insurers and state \n     Medicaid agencies base their fee-for-service payment systems \n     on Medicare's RBRVS. Delays in reimbursement updates caused \n     by HCFA may very well lead other non-Federal payers to follow \n     Medicare's lead, resulting in a much broader than expected \n     impact on physicians.\n\n\n                     Current Level of Preparedness\n\n       Assessing the status of the year 2000 problem is difficult \n     not only because the inventory of the information systems and \n     equipment that will be affected is far from complete, but \n     also because the consequences of noncompliance for each \n     system remain unclear. Nevertheless, if the studies are \n     correct, malfunctions in noncompliant systems will occur and \n     equipment failures can surely be anticipated. The analyses \n     and surveys that have been conducted present a rather bleak \n     picture for the health care industry in general, and \n     physicians' practices in particular.\n       The Odin Group, a health care information technology \n     research and advisory group, for instance, found from a \n     survey of 250 health care managers that many health care \n     companies by the second half of last year still had not \n     developed Y2K contingency plans.\\7\\ The GartnerGroup has \n     similarly concluded, based on its surveys and studies, that \n     the year 2000 problem's ``effect on health care will be \n     particularly traumatic . . . [l]lives and health will be at \n     increased risk. Medical devices may cease to function.'' \\8\\ \n     In its report, it noted that most hospitals have a few \n     thousand medical devices with microcontroller chips, and \n     larger hospital networks and integrated delivery systems have \n     tens of thousands of devices.\n       Based on early testing, the GartnerGroup also found that \n     although only 0.5-2.5 percent of medical devices have a year \n     2000 problem, approximately 5 percent of health care \n     organizations will not locate all the noncompliant devices in \n     time.\\9\\ It determined further that most of these \n     organizations do not have the resources or the expertise to \n     test these devices properly and will have to rely on the \n     device manufacturers for assistance.\\10\\\n       As a general assessment, the GartnerGroup concluded that \n     based on a survey of 15,000 companies in 87 countries, the \n     health care industry remains far behind other industries in \n     its exposure to the year 2000 problem.\\11\\ Within the health \n     care industry, the subgroups which are the furthest behind \n     and therefore at the highest risk are ``medical practices'' \n     and ``in-home service providers.'' \\12\\ The GartnerGroup \n     extrapolated that the costs associated with addressing the \n     year 2000 problem for each practice group will range up to \n     $1.5 million per group.\\13\\\n\n\n                   Remediation Efforts--AMA's Efforts\n\n       We believe that through a united effort, the medical \n     profession in concert with federal and state governments can \n     dramatically reduce the potential for any adverse effects \n     with the medical community resulting from the Y2K problem. \n     For its part, the AMA has been devoting considerable \n     resources to assist physicians and other health care \n     providers in learning about and correcting the problem.\n       For nearly a year, the AMA has been educating physicians \n     through two of its publications, AMNews and the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association (JAMA). AMNews, which is a \n     national news magazine widely distributed to physicians and \n     medical students, has regularly featured articles over the \n     last twelve months discussing the Y2K problem, patient safety \n     concerns, reimbursement issues, Y2K legislation, and other \n     related concerns. JAMA, one of the world's leading medical \n     journals, will feature an article written by the \n     Administrator of HCFA, explaining the importance for \n     physicians to become Y2K compliant. The AMA, through these \n     publications, hopes to raise the level of consciousness among \n     physicians of the potential risks associated with the year \n     2000 for their practices and patients, and identify avenues \n     for resolving some of the anticipated problems.\n       The AMA has also developed a national campaign entitled \n     ``Moving Medicine Into the New Millennium: Meeting the Year \n     2000 Challenge,'' which incorporates a variety of \n     educational seminars, assessment surveys, promotional \n     information, and ongoing communication activities designed \n     to help physicians understand and address the numerous \n     complex issues related to the Y2K problem. The AMA is \n     currently conducting a series of surveys to measure the \n     medical profession's state of readiness, assess where \n     problems exist, and identify what resources would best \n     reduce any risk. The AMA already has begun mailing the \n     surveys, and we anticipate receiving responses in the near \n     future. The information we obtain from this survey will \n     enable us to identify which segments of the medical \n     profession are most in need of assistance, and through \n     additional timely surveys, to appropriately tailor our \n     efforts to the specific needs of physicians and their \n     patients. The information will also allow us to more \n     effectively assist our constituent organizations in \n     responding to the precise needs of other physicians across \n     the country.\n       One of the many seminar series the AMA sponsors is the \n     ``Advanced Regional Response Seminars'' program. We are \n     holding these seminars in various regions of the country and \n     providing specific, case-study information along with \n     practical recommendations for the participants. The seminars \n     also provide tips and recommendations for dealing with \n     vendors and explain various methods for obtaining beneficial \n     resource information. Seminar participants receive a Y2K \n     solutions manual, entitled ``The Year 2000 Problem: \n     Guidelines for Protecting Your Patients and Practice.'' This \n     seventy-five page manual, which is also available to hundreds \n     of thousands of physicians across the country, offers a host \n     of different solutions to Y2K problems that physicians will \n     likely face. It raises physicians' awareness of the problem, \n     year 2000 operational implications for physicians' practices, \n     and identifies numerous resources to address the issue.\n       In addition, the AMA has opened a web site (URL: www.ama-\n     assn.org) to provide the physician community additional \n     assistance to better address the Y2K problem. The site serves \n     as a central communications clearinghouse, providing up-to-\n     date information about the millennium bug, as well as a \n     special interactive section that permits physicians to post \n     questions and recommended solutions for their specific Y2K \n     problems. The site also incorporates links to other sites \n     that provide additional resource information on the year 2000 \n     problem.\n       On a related note, the AMA in early 1996 began forming the \n     National Patient Safety Foundation or ``NPSF.'' Our goal was \n     to build a proactive initiative to prevent avoidable injuries \n     to patient in the health care system. In developing the NPSF, \n     the AMA realized that physicians, acting alone, cannot always \n     assure complete patient safety. In fact, the entire community \n     of providers is accountable to our patients, and we all have \n     a responsibility to work together to fashion a systems \n     approach to identifying and managing risk. It was this \n     realization that prompted the AMA to launch the NPSF as a \n     separate organization, which in turn partnered with other \n     health care organizations, health care leaders, research \n     experts and consumer groups from throughout the health care \n     sector.\n       One of these partnerships is the National Patient Safety \n     Partnership (NPSP), which is a voluntary public-private \n     partnership dedicated to reducing preventable adverse medical \n     events and convened by the Department of Veterans Affairs. \n     Other NPSP members include the American Hospital Association, \n     the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare \n     Organizations, the American Nurses Association, the \n     Association of America Medical Colleges, the Institute for \n     Healthcare Improvement, and the National Patient Safety \n     Foundation at the AMA. The NPSP has made a concerted effort \n     to increase awareness of the year 2000 hazards that patients \n     relying on certain medical devices could face at the turn of \n     the century.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       As an initial step, we recommend that the Administration or \n     Congress work closely with the AMA and other health care \n     leaders to develop a uniform definition of ``compliant'' with \n     regard to medical equipment. There needs to be clear and \n     specific requirements that must be met before vendors are \n     allowed to use the word ``compliant'' in association with \n     their products. Because there is no current standard \n     definition, it may mean different things to different \n     vendors, leaving physicians with confusing, incorrect, or no \n     data at all. Physicians should be able to spend their time \n     caring for patients and not be required to spend their time \n     trying to determine the year 2000 status of the numerous \n     medical equipment vendors with whom they work.\n       We further suggest that both the public and private sectors \n     encourage and facilitate health care practitioners in \n     becoming more familiar with year 2000 issues and taking \n     action to mitigate their risks. Greater efforts must be made \n     in educating health care consumers about the issues \n     concerning the year 2000, and how they can develop Y2K \n     remediation plans, properly test their systems and devices, \n     and accurately assess their exposure. We recognize and \n     applaud the efforts of this Committee, the Congress, and the \n     Administration in all of your efforts to draw attention to \n     the Y2K problem and the medical community's concerns.\n       We also recommend that communities and institutions learn \n     from other communities and institutions that have \n     successfully and at least partially solved the problem. \n     Federal, state and local agencies as well as accrediting \n     bodies that routinely address public health issues and \n     disaster preparedness are likely leaders in this area. At the \n     physician level, this means that public health physicians, \n     including those in the military, organized medical staff, and \n     medical directors, will need to be actively involved for a \n     number of reasons. State medical societies can help take a \n     leadership role in coordinating such assessments.\n       We also must stress that medical device and software \n     manufacturers need to publicly disclose year 2000 compliance \n     information regarding products that are currently in use. Any \n     delay in communicating this information may further \n     jeopardize practitioners' efforts at ensuring compliance. A \n     strategy needs to be developed to more effectively motivate \n     all manufacturers to promptly provide compliance status \n     reports. Additionally, all compliance information should be \n     accurate, complete, sufficiently detailed and readily \n     understandable to physicians. We\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n     suggest that the Congress and the federal government enlist \n     the active participation of the FDA or other government \n     agencies in mandating appropriate reporting procedures for \n     vendors. We highly praise the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     the FDA, and others who maintain Y2K web sites on medical \n     devices and offer other resources, which have already helped \n     physicians to make initial assessments about their own \n     equipment.\n       We are aware that the ``Year 2000 Information and Readiness \n     Disclosure Act'' was passed and enacted into law last year, \n     and is intended to provide protection against liability for \n     certain communications regarding Y2K compliance. Although the \n     AMA strongly believes that information must be freely shared \n     between manufacturers and consumers, we continue to caution \n     against providing liability caps to manufacturers in exchange \n     for the Y2K information they may provide, for several \n     reasons. First, as we have stated, generally vendors alone \n     have the information about whether their products were \n     manufactured to comply with year 2000 data. These \n     manufacturers should disclose that information to their \n     consumers without receiving an undue benefit from a liability \n     cap.\n       Second, manufacturers are not the only entities involved in \n     providing medical device services, nor are they alone at risk \n     if an untoward event occurs. When a product goes through the \n     stream of commerce, several other parties may incur some \n     responsibility for the proper functioning of that product, \n     from equipment retailers to equipment maintenance companies. \n     Each of these parties, including the end-user--the \n     physician--will likely retain significant liability exposure \n     if the device malfunctions because of a Y2K error. However, \n     none of these parties will typically have had sufficient \n     knowledge about the product to have prevented the Y2K error, \n     except the device manufacturer. To limit the manufacturer's \n     liability exposure under these circumstances flies in the \n     face of sound public policy.\n       We also have to build redundancies and contingencies into \n     the remediation efforts as part of the risk management \n     process. Much attention has been focused on the vulnerability \n     of medical devices to the Y2K bug, but the problem does not \n     end there. Patient injuries can be caused as well by a \n     hospital elevator that stops functioning properly. Or the \n     failure of a heating/ventilation/air conditioning system. Or \n     a power outage. The full panoply of systems that may break \n     down as our perception of the scope of risk expands may not \n     be as easily delineated as the potential problems with \n     medical devices. Building in back-up systems as a fail-safe \n     for these unknown or more diffuse risks is, therefore, \n     absolutely crucial.\n       As a final point, we need to determine a strategy to notify \n     patients in a responsible and professional way. If it is \n     determined that certain medical devices may have a problem \n     about which patients need to be notified, this needs to be \n     anticipated and planned. Conversely, to the extent we can \n     reassure patients that devices are compliant, this should be \n     done. Registries for implantable devices or diagnosis- or  \n     procedure-coding databases may exist, for example, which \n     could help identify patients who have received certain \n     kinds of technologies that need to be upgraded and/or \n     replaced or that are compliant. This information should be \n     utilized as much as possible to help physicians identify \n     patients and communicate with them.\n       As we approach the year 2000 and determine those segments \n     of the medical industry which we are confident will weather \n     the Y2K problem well, we will all need to reassure the \n     public. We need to recognize that a significant remaining \n     concern is the possibility that the public will overreact to \n     potential Y2K-related problems. The pharmaceutical industry, \n     for instance, is already anticipating extensive stockpiling \n     of medications by individuals and health care facilities. In \n     addition to continuing the remediation efforts, part of our \n     challenge remains to reassure patients that medical treatment \n     can be effectively and safely provided through the transition \n     into the next millennium.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We appreciate the Committee's interest in addressing the \n     problems posed by the year 2000, and particularly, those \n     problems that relate to physicians. Because of the broad \n     scope of the millennium problem and physicians' reliance on \n     information technology, we realize that the medical community \n     has significant exposure. The Y2K problem will affect patient \n     care, practice administration, and Medicare/Medicaid \n     reimbursement. The AMA, along with the Congress and other \n     organizations, seeks to better educate the health care \n     community about Y2K issues, and assist health care \n     practitioners in remedying, or at least reducing the impact \n     of, the problem. The public and private sectors must \n     cooperate in these endeavors, while encouraging the \n     dissemination of compliance information.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n       \\1\\ ``Doctors Fear Patients Will Suffer Ills of the \n     Millennium Bug; Many Are Concerned That Y2K Problem Could \n     Erroneously Mix Medical Data--Botching Prescriptions and Test \n     Results,'' Los Angeles Times, Jan. 5, 1999, p.

I do not want to mislead. As I understand, as of this \nmorning my staff contacted Mr. Emery. And they said that the AMA is not \nopenly opposing the legislation, but if there is going to be \nlegislation, they want to be taken care of. They want all the tort \nthings to take care of them, too.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 minutes just to \nbriefly respond to several of the points made by the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very brief.\n  I specifically want to talk on this matter with respect to the \nevidence which would be considered in these suits. The sponsors of the \nsubstitute have made it very clear in the Senate that we will strike \nthe clear and convincing evidence standard. It is an important point \nthat the Senator from South Carolina has made.\n  What we have indicated is that we think it is in the public interest \nto essentially use the standard the Senate adopted in the Year 2000 \nInformation and Readiness Disclosure Act which passed overwhelmingly in \nthe Senate. So we have something already with a strong level of \nbipartisan support, and it is an indication again that the sponsors of \nthe substitute want to be sympathetic and address the points being made \nby the Senator from South Carolina.\n  But at the end of the day, this is not legislation about trial \nlawyers or campaign finance. And I have not mentioned either of those \nsubjects on the floor of the Senate. But this is about whether or not \nthe Senate is going to act now, when we have a chance to address this, \nin a deliberative way, and produce good Government--something which \nwill make sense for consumers and plaintiffs who are wronged and at the \nsame time ensure that we do not have tumult in the marketplace early \nnext year.\n  I am very hopeful we can go forward with this legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to respond. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may address \nthe Senate for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am reading page 30. The language \nthere--the last 3 lines; 23, 24, and 25--``The defendant is not liable \nunless the plaintiff establishes that element of the claim in \naccordance with the evidentiary standard required,'' which is the \ngreater weight by the preponderance of the evidence. That is lined out. \nAnd written--and I understand in Chairman McCain's handwriting--here, \n``by clear and convincing evidence.''\n  Again on page 31 of the particular bill under consideration, on lines \n19 and 20, ``in accordance with the evidentiary standard required'' is \nlined out; and inserted in lieu thereof ``by clear and convincing \nevidence.''\n  That is why I addressed it that way. That is what we have before us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4232-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Comfort the \nparents who lost their children, both as victims and perpetrators. Help \nus all to deal with the deeper issues of the need for moral renewal in \nour culture.\n  O God, bless the children of our land. May we communicate to them \nYour love and Your righteousness so that they have a rudder for the \nturbulent waters of our time and are able to present them with the \ncharts to make it through these difficult waters.\n  O Gracious God, help us to communicate Your commandments and help \nthem to know the joy of living in faithfulness with You. In our quest \nto separate church and State, there are times when we have divided God \nfrom our culture. Now when there is nowhere else to turn, we return to \nYou.\n  O dear God, heal our land. In Your holy name. Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand the leadership accommodated \nSenator Campbell's and my request to observe a moment of silence out of \nrespect for the victims of the tragic shooting at Columbine High School \nin Littleton, CO.\n  I also understand that later today the Senate will consider a \nresolution expressing sorrow and offering condolences to the families \nand friends and students, all of Littleton, CO. I will address the \nSenate in greater detail at that time.\n\n  In the meantime, I yield the floor to my senior colleague in order \nfor him to request a moment of silence.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I, too, thank the \nleadership for affording the Senate an opportunity to express our \nprofound sorrow and to offer condolences to the families and friends of \nthe fallen people of Littleton, CO.\n  I understand that a resolution addressing this issue will arrive from \nthe House of Representatives at about 4:30 today. I expect that many \nMembers may want to make comments at that time.\n  The tragic truth is that the angels are now carrying the souls of 13 \ninnocent people to the everlasting glory of heaven. A resolution alone \nwould never express the degree of sorrow we feel. Certainly all of \nAmerica has much to do to heal our Nation and to rid ourselves of hate \nand vengeance.\n  Until that resolution is pending, and in order to observe, \nacknowledge, and honor a moment of silence called for throughout the \nState of Colorado, I now ask that the Senate observe a moment of silent \nprayer for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now observe a moment of \nsilence.\n  [Period of silence.]\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know that a number of Senators do wish to \nexpress their concern, sympathy, and great regret with regard to the \nincident for which we are all so very sorry, and suffering. As Senators \nAllard and Campbell said, I think we can save that until we have the \nresolution up later this afternoon when Senators will have the \nopportunity to speak on this matter. I will be speaking with Senator \nDaschle and we will be talking about an appropriate way for the Senate \nto consider this matter for a reasonable period of time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret having to file a cloture motion. I \nhoped we would not have to do that, that we could get an agreement on \nhow to proceed, and that the amendments would be relevant. But since we \nhave not been able to, with the objection just heard, I have no \nalternative. Therefore, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     amendment to Calendar No. 34, S.96, the Y2K legislation:\n         Senators Trent Lott, John McCain, Rick Santorum, Spence \n           Abraham, Judd Gregg, Pat Roberts, Wayne Allard, Rod \n           Grams, Jon Kyl, Larry Craig, Bob Smith, Craig Thomas, \n           Paul Coverdell, Pete Domenici, Don Nickles, and Phil \n           Gramm.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there is a sincere effort underway on \nboth sides of the aisle to work out an agreement on this Y2K \nlegislation. I know that will continue. But we need to make progress, \nor have the opportunity for a cloture vote in the meantime, or, in case \nthat doesn't work out, you always have the option, if we get everything \nworked out, to vitiate the cloture vote, or we could move to a \nconclusion earlier. If we can get an agreement worked out and \nconclusion on Wednesday, that would be ideal.\n  But, barring that, a cloture vote will occur on Thursday.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could make a couple of observations \nwith regard to the schedule, I know Members are interested in a variety \nof very important issues they wish to be heard on. I have to be \nsympathetic to those requests. We don't have it worked out yet.\n  But I am discussing with Senator Daschle the possibility of having \nsome measure on the floor of the Senate later on this week which would \nbe an opportunity for further discussion and perhaps votes with regard \nto the Kosovo matter. We wish it to be a bipartisan resolution that \nallows Senators to state their position and to allow the Senate to take \na vote on exactly how they wish to proceed at this point with regard to \nKosovo. We will have to work through that. Hopefully, we can take it up \nThursday and complete it Thursday night, or Friday, or later, if the \nSenators so desire.\n  On another matter, I know there are Senators who have a real desire \nto say something and have a policy discussion about what has happened \nin Colorado. I ask my colleagues, let's give this a moment. Let's allow \na period of mourning and grief. Let's allow these families to bury \ntheir children. Let's all wait to see more about what happened and ask \nnot only what but why.\n  Then 2 weeks from today, if the Senate thinks well of it, we will \nlook for a vehicle--and we have one in mind, perhaps a juvenile justice \nbill--that we could take up, and the Senate would then have an \nopportunity for debate, have amendments, and have votes.\n  I think we need a period of time to think this through and allow our \ncountry, collectively, to have a period of mourning and then see if \nthere is something we can do. I don't think the answer is here. I think \nthe answer is out across America.\n  I wanted the Senators to know I recognize their desires and I am \ntrying to find a way to accommodate those desires. I ask, also, that we \nmust continue to work on Y2K and find a way to complete it without \ngetting into a myriad of subsidiary issues and complete our work by \nWednesday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I heard the majority leader. There are \nmany Members who, obviously, agree with the majority leader and share \nthe sentiments expressed here on the floor of the Senate a few moments \nago in the moments of silence, and the very superb prayer of the \nchaplain in reaching out to those families. However, there are Members \nwho want to at least consider some legislation dealing with \nresponsibility in the area of firearms.\n  Is the leader now indicating to Members he will give us the \nopportunity to have some debate on those measures, and other measures, \nas well, within a period of 2 weeks? Measures that could help and \nassist parents, families and schools. Measures that are balanced and \npermit Members to reach across the aisle to try and work out bipartisan \napproaches? Could the majority leader indicate now whether we will have \nthat opportunity and give assurance to the American people that the \nsubject matter which is No. 1 in the minds of all families and children \nacross this country--at least we will have the opportunity in the U.S. \nSenate to debate some proposals and to reach resolutions of those.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, I \nthink it is always incumbent upon the leadership to make sure we \nproceed in an appropriate way and that Senators have an opportunity to \nexpress their views and offer amendments on issues of policy. I think \nwe are doing that. We have appropriately had a moment of silence and a \nprayer for the children and the families, and for our country. We are \ngoing to have a resolution this afternoon officially expressing our \nregret and sympathy.\n  I have asked that we have a brief period of mourning where we don't \nrush to judgment before we start flinging amendments at each other. I \nmentioned the idea to Senator Daschle moments ago in which I said that \n2 weeks from today we will look at bringing up a particular piece of \nlegislation. I don't want to say it will be exactly that day or exactly \nthat piece of legislation because Senator Daschle needs to confer with \na lot of Members on that side.\n  However, it is my intent, that 2 weeks from today we give Senators an \nopportunity to offer amendments, thoughts and policy issues they wish \nto have addressed. I think the timing would be appropriate and I think \nthat the issue or the issues are appropriate for Members to debate and \nvote on.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a moment, with those \nassurances, I have worked with a number of our colleagues--they may \nhave differing views--and I think the assurances of the majority leader \nthat the Senate would have an opportunity to debate legislation with \nregard to the limitations on weapons and also support and assistance \nfor families and schools, and that we will have debate and resolution \nof some of those measures, then, I think at least I will look forward \nto that opportunity.\n  I think with the assurance of the majority leader--I know the Senate \nDemocratic leader wanted to talk to colleagues--it is my certain belief \nthe Democratic leader would support the majority leader in that \nundertaking. I think the message will go out this afternoon to families \nacross the country that the Senate of the United States--hopefully, in \na bipartisan way--will give focus and attention to different ideas, \nrecommendations and suggestions of Members of this body,\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nand hopefully from others, to try to see what we can do not only about \nthe problems of the schools but the inner cities and other communities \naffected by guns, as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair.\n  First, I thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle for their commitment \nto try to work out a resolution, a Lott-Daschle amendment on the Kosovo \nissue. I have been saying, as have many others, that we as U.S. \nSenators, individually and as a body, have a duty to be on record on \nthis issue. Those who oppose our involvement, I believe, should be on \nrecord in that fashion as well as those who are in favor.\n  I think it is well-known by most observers of the U.S. Senate that \nthe 1991 debate that took place in this Chamber on the Persian Gulf war \nresolution was one of the more enlightened and, frankly, sterling \nmoments of this Senate. It was a very close vote, 53-47. I remember it \nvery well. At that time, Senators on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of this United States were heard. They were on record and the \nU.S. Senate was on record, as well.\n  I point out that immediately following that very close vote there was \na unanimous vote in support of the men and women in the military who \nwere conducting that conflict.\n  I thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. I am pleased to work out \nthe details of this resolution. I know it is a very, very contentious \nand difficult issue that we will be debating. I have heard allegations \nthat some Senators don't wish to risk a vote on this issue. I don't \nbelieve that is the case. If it were the case, we have young men and \nwomen right now who are risking their lives. It is incumbent upon us as \na body to act.\n  Second, I say to my friend from South Carolina, I am sorry that we \nhave to go through the filling up of the tree and filing a cloture \nmotion on this bill. I prefer the normal amending process.\n  I believe the pending legislation is the Y2K substitute. What is the \npending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 271, a \nsecond-degree amendment offered by the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if there is an amendment that is germane \nthat the Senator from South Carolina or anyone else would like to bring \nup, I believe we could by unanimous consent vacate the final amendment \nof the majority leader so that we can debate and vote on that \namendment.\n  The purpose of filling up the tree was, clearly, to prevent \nnongermane amendments from clogging up this process.\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina, I think we should debate \namendments. We should move forward as quickly as possible and get this \nissue resolved as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I was compelled momentarily to object to \nthe request of our distinguished leader that the amendments be germane. \nI think a word is in order to understand my objection.\n  What happens is, No. 1, we have tried our dead-level best to \ncompromise and move this particular piece of legislation along. My \nIntel friends wrote us a letter to the effect that there were four \ndemands. I contacted Mr. Grove by phone and told him that of the four, \nI could agree to the waiting time period, to the materiality and the \nspecificity, but the joint and several went to the heart of tort law \nand trials and I could not agree to that.\n  My understanding is and I am willing to fill out the record on this, \nour Chamber of Commerce friend, Tom Donohue and NAM downtown, Victor \nSchwartz, have been working this thing for years. When we are asked \nabout germane amendments, I think of the opportunity that I have in \nthis perilous position, so to speak, with respect to the legislation.\n  Realizing that they are willing to amend the Constitution, article \nVII, taking away a trial by jury, and they are willing to amend article \nX of the rights of the States with respect to tort law, then I thought \nmaybe at the moment it would be good to amend article II with respect \nto the bearing of arms.\n  Yes, Mr. President, I do have an amendment, and it is at the desk. It \nis very germane to our interest in real things. We are not really \nconcerned at this minute, because the system is working. According to \nBusiness Week, according to the testimony, according to the evidence, \naccording to the editorials, our tort system is working to protect \ndoctors, small business folks and everyone else. What is not working in \nColorado is this inordinate number of pistols and firearms in our \nsociety.\n  I came to the Senate as a strong-headed States righter and still try \nmy best to follow that principle because I believe in it very, very \nstrongly. However, I have had to yield with respect to that particular \nposition when it came to the Saturday night specials. We had the FBI \ncome with that. The States could not control that. We had the matter of \nassault weapons, and the States could not control that.\n  Then watching over the years, the States' response, instead of going \nin the direction of control, they actually are in the direction of \nrunning around with concealed weapons. All the States now are going in \nthat direction. That is why the NRA, the National Rifle Association, \nwas ready to meet in Denver last week. I figured we ought to bring this \nup for immediate discussion.\n  Rush to judgment? No; no. I have been there 33 years. I have watched \nthis debate, I have listened, and I watched our society. It is not a \nrush to judgment. It is a judgment that I had a misgiving about over \nmany years waiting on the States to respond.\n  I put at the desk the Chafee amendment relative to handgun control. I \nwill be prepared later on, if we are allowed and we get into the \ndebate, to bring that up, because I think it is very timely. It is not \na rush to judgment. It is far more important to our society. According \nto Computerworld, according to the Oregonian, according to the New York \nTimes, according to the witnesses, it is far more important than Y2K \nwhich may occur 7 or 8 months from now. Come; come.\n  We know good and well that everybody is getting ready. We have, in a \nbipartisan fashion, set aside the antitrust restrictions so that they \ncould collaborate.\n  We have positive evidence of a young doctor in New Jersey who in 1996 \nbought a computer, and the salesman bragged how it can last for more \nthan 10 years, that it was Y2K compliant. He gave references. By \nhappenstance, they did go to one of the references and found out it was \nnot Y2K compliant.\n  The young doctor then said: I need to get this thing modified and \nmade compliant. The company that sold it to him said: Gladly, for \n$25,000. The main instrument itself was only $13,000.\n  What did he do? He wrote a letter and asked, and then he asked the \nsecond time. Months passed. He finally went to a lawyer. People do not \nlike to go to lawyers and get involved in court. I hear all about \nfrivolous lawsuits, frivolous, frivolous. Nobody has time for frivolous \nlawsuits. The real lawyer does not get paid unless he gets a result.\n  Finally, he did get a lawyer, and the lawyer was smart enough to put \nit on the Internet. The next thing you know, there were 17,000 doctors \nin a similar situation with the same company, and they finally reached \na settlement and got it replaced and made compliant--free. That was all \nthat was necessary.\n\n  The system is working now. There have been 44 cases. Over half of \nthem have been thrown out as frivolous; half of the remaining cases \nhave been settled. There are only eight or nine pending Y2K cases. The \nproblem is real. You do not have to wait if you are going to have those \nsupplies. It is like an automobile dealer faced every year with a new \nmodel and has to get rid of the old.\n  You will find some of the various entities will come around and \noffload and misrepresent. That is why we have the tort system at the \nState level, and that is why it works, and that is why we have this \nwonderful economic boom.\n  There is a conspiracy. They call it a bunch of associations that have \nendorsed the legislation. They have come around now and said this is a \nwonderful opportunity, we can just ask them for tort reform, and here \nit is going to save them from lawyers and frivolous lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  If I was an innocent doctor in regular practice with no time to study \nand pay attention to these matters, I would say, ``Sure, put me on, \nthat sounds good to me. I am having troubles enough now with Medicare \nand HCFA and all of these rules and regulations made ex post facto \nabout charges for my particular treatments.''\n  That is why it all builds and it mushrooms on the floor of the \nSenate. The Senator from South Carolina has been in the vineyards now \n20 years on this one issue relative to trial lawyers and tort reform. \nHe can see it like pornography. You understand it and know it when you \nsee it, and I see this.\n  I was constrained on yesterday to not only put up the Chafee \namendment relative to gun control, but more particularly, Mr. \nPresident, with respect to the violence in the schools. I know one of \nthe causes. I have been fighting in that vineyard all during the \nnineties. We have had hearings on TV violence, and we have had study \nafter study after study. They put us off again and again with another \nstudy. So in the Congress before last, we reported it out of committee \n19 to 1 on barring gratuitous violence in these shows, excessive \ngratuitous violence.\n  When you run a Civil War series, necessarily you are going to have to \nhave violent films and shots made and scenes that will appeal. But we \ngot into the excessive gratuitous violence that they control in Europe, \ndown in New Zealand and Australia. They use the one example, of course, \nin Scotland where they had the poor fellow who was estranged and insane \ncome in and shoot up the little children. But they don't have this \nhappening in Arkansas like it did or happening in Kentucky like it did.\n  You can see this occurring over the years. Monkey see, monkey do--\nyoungsters emulate and they see more than anything else, not excessive \ngratuitous violence, but no cost, no result, no injury to the violence. \nSeemingly, it happens and you move right on. They become hardened. Then \nthey go to the computer games shooting each other.\n  I called that bill up the Congress before last. We got it reported to \nthe floor. I went to my friend, Senator Dole, who was running for \nPresident. He just returned from the west coast, and he had given the \nproducers a fit. He said, ``You have to act more responsibly.''\n  I said, ``Bob, why don't I step aside and you offer the bill and let \nit just be the Dole-Hollings bill? It is out here and reported. You put \nup one. You are the leader, and we can get a vote on that right \nquick.''\n  We got a 19-to-1 vote in the committee. I never did get a response. \nSo I put it in again, and in the last Congress it was reported out 20 \nto 1. But I cannot get the distinguished leader who wants to be oh so \nreasonable and everybody working together, and let's don't rush to \njudgment on TV violence--I have a judgment, and it is not a rush to it. \nIt has been learned over the many, many years, looking at the \nexperience of other countries, looking at the need in our society, \nhaving listened to the witnesses, the Attorney General saying this \nwould pass constitutional muster with respect to the freedom of \nspeech. I wanted to bring that up. That amendment sat at the desk. That \nis important, far more important than Y2K.\n\n  And otherwise we have hard experiences. We Senators do get home from \ntime to time, and we do politic. And it was about 4 years ago when I \ngot back to Richland County where I met my friend, the sheriff, Senator \nLeon Lott. And he said, I want to show you a school out here that was \nthe most violent, was infested with drugs and trouble and everything \nelse of that kind.\n  He said, Senator, I took one of your cops on the beat. I put him in \nthe classroom, in uniform, teaching classes, law, respect for the law, \nthe penalties in driving for young folks coming along, the penalties, \nand why the controls in relation to respect and the severe penalties \nrelative to drugs, so they would understand.\n  Now, that was in the classroom. He was not in the parking lot waiting \nfor somebody to steal a car. Rather, he was teaching respect for the \nlaw. And then, in the afternoon, this particular officer was associated \nwith the athletic activities, and in the evening with the civic \nactivities. He became a role model.\n  I say this advisedly because I think about that poor security officer \nwho did not know from ``sic em'' out there in the Columbine school in \nColorado. Here they could unload pipe bombs, all kinds of pistols, all \nkinds of this, that, and everything else, like that going on the \nInternet, running down the halls in trench coats, butt everybody out of \nthe way, and everything else. They were surprised by what happened.\n  So, yes, I have an amendment at the desk relative to our safe schools \nsafety initiative because Senator Gregg, the chairman of our \nSubcommittee on State, Justice and Commerce--we put $160 million in the \nappropriations bill last year, and it is being used and employed with \ntremendous success all over the country.\n  The emphasis should be not as I heard on TV last night, where they \nsaid this law enforcement officer would be directly connected with law \nenforcement; I want him connected with the students. I want him to \nbecome a role model. I want him to understand and know the students and \nknow the teachers. And the teachers know when they have a troublemaker, \nor whatever it is--a poor lad maybe does not have a mama or does not \nhave a daddy, he is totally lost, so he brings about all kinds of \nextreme activity to get recognition.\n  But that officer can work. And we also added in counseling. I cannot \nhave him do all the counseling and all the role modeling and everything \nelse at once, as well as law enforcement, as well as instruction. So we \nincluded, after the advice from hearings, that we put in counseling; \nand we got a measure. It is on the statute books. It ought to be \nembellished and enlarged.\n  These are the kinds of things we ought to be talking about this \nafternoon rather than this bum's rush about a crisis that is going to \nhappen 7 months from now. Come on. Here it is happening right \nunderneath us and all we do is pray. We are the board of directors of \ncorporate United States of America, and we are flunking our particular \nduties; we cannot pay any bills.\n  We talked all last week--and it is still on the calendar right now, \nand regular order--of saving 100 percent of Social Security, a lockbox. \nThen I heard instead the distinguished leader say, oh, no. He said, \nthis money we are going to add on to the President's request for \nKosovo--another $6 billion. When asked, where is it going to come from, \nhe said, from Social Security.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, they say that is the only surplus, but it \nis not. Social Security is $720 billion shy. And with the estimation--\nand I have it by the Congressional Budget Office--at the end of \nSeptember this year we will owe--not surplus--Social Security $837 \nbillion, because what we have been doing is we have been paying down \nthe debt.\n  It is like taking two credit cards, having a Visa card and \nMasterCard, and saying, ``I'll pay off my MasterCard with the Visa \ncard. It looks pretty good for the MasterCard debt--the public debt--\nbut it increases the Visa debt over here--it increases the Social \nSecurity debt. So it has. And we owe Social Security $837 billion. The \n$137 billion in excess of what is required to be paid out this \nparticular year is not surplus.\n  Under the law, 13301 of the Budget Act, it should go in reserve for \nSocial Security for the baby boomers, but we are all talking about; oh, \nthe President; oh, the Congress; no, the Congress; no, the President. \nNobody wants to get a plan to save Social Security; and all the time we \nare stealing, we are looting the fund. It is a shame. It is a show. It \nis a spin. It is the message nonsense that you have up here in the \nSenate.\n  So let's get real now and let's get these issues out. Let's talk \nabout handguns. Let's talk about Kosovo. Let's talk about TV violence. \nWe have some real problems. Let's talk about paying the bill, and not \nany ``Mickey Mouse'' of one day it is going to be a lockbox and no one \ncan get to it and 48 hours later saying, no, no, I'm going to use that \nlockbox for a $12 billion payment on Kosovo. We have to get honest with \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  I have been here many fewer years than the Senator from South \nCarolina,\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\nbut I can tell you, just listening to him over the last few minutes, I \nsure agree with what he has to say about Social Security, I sure agree \nwith what he has to say about school violence and the connections that \nare so important in the community between law enforcement, counselors, \nand the students. I could go on and on. I have supported him on many of \nthose issues in the past and am planning to do so in the future.\n  But I did want to take the floor for just a moment and address a \ncouple of the points that were made with respect to the Y2K issue \nspecifically.\n  I am very hopeful that we can still see the Senate come together on a \nbipartisan basis to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is \nthat the year 2000 problem is essentially not even a design flaw. It is \na problem because a number of years ago, to get more space on a disc \nand in memory, the precision of century indicators was abandoned. And \nit is hard for all of us today to believe that disc and memory space \nused to be at a premium, but it was back then, and that is why we have \nthis problem today.\n  So what a number of us in the Senate want is to do everything we \npossibly can to ensure companies comply with the standards that are \nnecessary to be fair in the marketplace, but also to provide a safety \nnet if we see problems develop and particularly frivolous, \nnonmeritorious suits.\n  Now, with respect to a couple of the points that have been made on \nthe record, this notion that the sponsors, particularly Senator McCain \nand I, are trying to rewrite tort law for all time is simply not borne \nout by the language of this bill. This is a bill which is going to \nsunset in 2003. It is not a set of legal changes for all time. It is an \neffort to deal in a short period of time with what we think are \npotentially very serious problems.\n  In fact, the American Bar Association--this is not a group of people \nwho are against lawyers, but the American Bar Association itself has \nsaid this could affect billions and billions of dollars in our \neconomy. So this bill will last for a short period of time. It doesn't \napply to personal injuries, whatever. If a person, for example, is \ninjured as a result of an elevator falling because the computer system \nbroke down and is tragically injured or killed, all of the legal \nremedies in tort law remain.\n\n  This is a bill that essentially involves contractual rights of \nbusinesses. We respect those rights first, and only when the \nmarketplace breaks down would this law apply.\n  We have heard a number of comments in the last few hours that this \nlegislation throws out the window the principle of joint and several \nliability, a legal doctrine that I, following the lead of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, have supported in many instances, particularly \nwhen it relates to vulnerable individuals who might be the victim of \npersonal injuries. But this legislation specifically says that joint \nand several liability will, in fact, apply if you have egregious or \nfraudulent conduct on the part of the defendant. And, second, it will \napply if you have an insolvent defendant so there will be an \nopportunity for the plaintiff to be made whole. We also make changes \nrelating to directors and officers to ensure that they have to be held \naccountable.\n  As to the evidentiary standard, the sponsors of this legislation have \nmade it clear that they want to work with Senator Hollings and others \nwho have questions about this standard to change it. What we wish to do \nis make it comply with the earlier legislation we overwhelmingly passed \non Y2K.\n  There have been a number of comments made today about the Intel \nCorporation and their views. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe CEO of the Intel Corporation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                            Intel Corporation,\n\n                                  Santa Clara, CA, April 19, 1999.\n     Re Y2000 legislation.\n\n\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I write to ask for your help in \n     enacting legislation designed to provide guidance to our \n     state and federal courts in managing litigation that may \n     arise out of the transition to Year 2000-compliant computer \n     hardware and software systems. This week, the Senate is \n     expected to vote upon a bipartisan substitute text for S. 96, \n     the ``Y2K Act'', which we strongly support.\n       Parties who are economically damaged by a Year 2000 failure \n     must have the ability to seek redress where traditional legal \n     principles would provide a remedy for such injury. At the \n     same time, it is vital that limited resources be devoted as \n     much as possible to fixing the problems, not litigating. Our \n     legal system must encourage parties to engage in cooperative \n     remediation efforts before taking complaints to the courts, \n     which could be overwhelmed by Year 2000 lawsuits.\n       The consensus text that has evolved from continuing, \n     bipartisan discussions would substantially encourage \n     cooperative action and discourage frivolous lawsuits. \n     Included in its provisions are several key measures that are \n     essential to ensure fair treatment of all parties under the \n     law:\n       Procedural incentives--such as a requirement of notice and \n     an opportunity to cure defects before suit is filed, and \n     encouragement for engaging in alternative dispute \n     resolution--that will lead parties to identify solutions \n     before pursuing grievances in court;\n       A requirement that courts respect the provisions of \n     contracts--particularly important in preserving agreements of \n     the parties on such matters as warranty obligations and \n     definition of recoverable damages;\n       Threshold pleading provisions requiring particularity as to \n     the nature, amount, and factual basis for damages and \n     materiality of defects, that will help constrain class action \n     suits brought on behalf of parties that have suffered no \n     significant injury;\n       Apportionment of liability according to fault, on \n     principles approved by the Senate in two previous measures \n     enacted in the area of securities reform.\n       This legislation--which will apply only to Y2K suits, and \n     only for a limited period of time--will allow plaintiffs with \n     real grievances to obtain relief under the law, while \n     protecting the judicial system from a flood of suits that \n     have no objective other than the obtainment of high-dollar \n     settlements for speculative or de minimus injuries. \n     Importantly, it does not apply to cases that arise out of \n     personal injury.\n       At Intel, we are devoting considerable resources to Y2K \n     remediation. Our efforts are focused not only on our internal \n     systems, but also those of our suppliers, both domestic and \n     foreign. Moreover, we have taken advantage of the important \n     protections for disclosure of product information that \n     Congress enacted last year to ensure that our customers are \n     fully informed as to issues that may be present with legacy \n     products. What is true for Intel is true for all companies: \n     time and resources must be devoted as much as possible to \n     fixing the Y2K problem and not pointing fingers of blame.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of \n     responsible legislation that will protect legitimately \n     aggrieved parties while providing a stable, uniform legal \n     playing field within which these matters can be handled by \n     state and federal courts with fairness and efficiency.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Craig R. Barrett,\n                                           CEO, Intel Corporation.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The key sentence is, the Senate is expected to vote upon a bipartisan \ntext for S. 96, the Y2K Act, which we will strongly support. There is \nno question about the position of the company on this legislation.\n  Finally, we have made nine major changes in this legislation since it \npassed the committee. I voted against it in the committee because I \nthought Senator Hollings was absolutely right--that the legislation at \nthat time was not fair to consumers and to plaintiffs. But as a result \nof the changes that were made, I believed it was appropriate to try to \ncome up with an approach that was fair to consumers and to plaintiffs \nas well as the small companies involved.\n  There are other negotiations that are still going forward. Senator \nDodd, for example, who is the leader on our side on the Y2K issue, has \na number of good and practical suggestions. Senator Kerry has some \nthoughtful ideas on this as well.\n  I am very hopeful that we can resolve the procedural quagmire on this \nissue and quickly get to a vote, up or down. Then as a result of the \nvery useful discussion that we had between the majority leader, Mr. \nLott, and Senator Kennedy and others, we can move on to the juvenile \njustice issue. Because I can assure you, as a result of what we saw in \nSpringfield, OR, last year, we wish to have some positive contributions \non that.\n  Senator Gordon Smith and I have a bipartisan bill which has already \npassed the Senate once. I am hopeful we can deal with this Y2K issue \nexpeditiously and then go on to the topic that millions of Americans, \njust as Senator Hollings has said this afternoon, are talking about and \nwant to see the Senate respond to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise and make some \ncomments about the Y2K legislation designed to make sure that we spend \nour time and effort fixing this problem and not suing one another.\n  I really believe in the legal system. I had served as a lawyer my \nentire adult life, until 2 years ago, when I joined this Senate. I \nserved as attorney general of Alabama. I was in private practice 12 \nyears as U.S. attorney for the southern district of Alabama. During \nthat time, I was involved in a lot of important legal issues.\n  I respect the law. I believe in our Constitution and our legal \nsystem. I have been to China, and I have heard the people in China say \nthat what they need most of all right now for a modern economy is a \ngood legal system.\n  I have been to Russia. I have heard the people in Russia talk about \ntheir need for an honest, fair, and efficient legal system.\n  We have a great legal system. We certainly ought not, as the Senator \nfrom South Carolina suggests, have a rush to judgment. But the problems \nthat have occurred over a period of years involving excess litigation \nare not new. It has been occurring for a number of years, and it calls \non us to think objectively and fairly as to how we are going to handle \ndisputes.\n  This piece of legislation involves, as the Senator from Oregon just \nnoted, one problem, a Y2K computer problem. It will terminate itself \nwhen that problem is over. But most of all, it is a commonsense and \nreasonable way for us to get through this problem without damaging our \neconomy.\n  Let me share this story. These numbers that I am about to give were \nproduced during a hearing at the Judiciary Committee not too long ago. \nWe had some inquiry about the litigation involving asbestos and people \nat shipyards, and so forth, who breathe asbestos and had their health \nadversely affected.\n  What we learned was that over 200,000 cases had been filed, many of \nthem taking years to reach conclusion. Two hundred thousand more were \npending, and it was expected that another 200,000 would be filed out of \nthat tragic problem.\n  What we also found was, when we made inquiry, we asked how much of \nthe money actually paid by those defendant corporations got to the \nvictims of asbestos. I am a person who believes in the legal system. I \nrespect it. I was shocked and embarrassed to find out that the expert \ntestimony was that only 40 percent of the money paid out by the \nasbestos companies actually got to the people who needed it, who were \nsick because of it. The legal fees are 30 and 40 percent. Court fees \nand costs all added to it take up 60 percent.\n  This is not acceptable. It is not acceptable if we care about a \nproblem and how to fix it. That figure did not count the court systems \nthat were clogged and remain clogged to this day by hundreds, even \nthousands of asbestos lawsuits.\n  I say to the Senate, we are facing a crisis.\n  These are some of the comments at the recent ABA, American Bar \nAssociation, convention in Toronto last August. A panel of experts \npredicted that the legal costs associated with the Y2K would exceed \nthat of asbestos, breast implants, tobacco, and Superfund litigation \ncombined. By the way, with regard to these asbestos companies, even \nwith regard to big companies, there are limits to how much they can \npay. Every single asbestos company in America that is still in business \nis in bankruptcy. Every asbestos company still in business is in \nbankruptcy. These are tremendous costs.\n\n  What this American Bar Association study showed was that the cost of \nthis litigation would exceed asbestos, breast implants, a huge amount \nof litigation, tobacco, and Superfund combined. They note that this is \nmore than three times the total annual estimated cost of all civil \nlitigation in the United States.\n  We have too much litigation now. Seminars on how to try a Y2K case--\nthese are lawyers' seminars, trying to teach each other how to file \nthem--are well underway. Approximately 500 law firms across the country \nhave put together Y2K litigation teams to capitalize on the event. They \ncan't wait. Also, several lawsuits have already been filed, making \ntrial attorneys confident that a large number of businesses, big and \nsmall, will end up in court as both plaintiffs and defendants. They are \ngoing to be suing because something went wrong with their computer, and \nthe people they sold the computer to, or are doing business with, are \ngoing to be suing them for problems arising from the computers. We are \ngoing to be spending more money on litigation than on fixing the \nproblem. This report indicates this litigation problem ``would reduce \ninvestment and slow income growth for American workers. Indeed, \ninnovation and economic growth would be stifled by the rapacity of \nstrident litigators.''\n  Well, I would say it is not a matter of whether there is a problem. \nThere have been estimates of $1 trillion in legal costs for this thing. \nI think we do have a problem.\n  What is needed? I think this legislation goes a long way in meeting \nwhat is needed. What is needed is to spend our time and effort fixing \nthe problem promptly. If we have all of our computer companies spending \ntime hiring $500-per-hour lawyers to defend them in court, draining \ntheir resources from which to actually fix the problem, that is not the \nright direction to go in, I submit. In addition to that, when you are \nin litigation, you are not as open and willing to discuss the problem \nhonestly with somebody because you are afraid anything you say and do \nwill be used against you in a lawsuit. Lawyers are always saying, \n``Don't talk about it.''\n  What we really want is the computer companies to get in there with \nthe businesses that are relying on the computers and try to fix the \nproblem at the lowest possible cost.\n  Now, we had one witness who didn't favor this in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Judiciary Committee voted out a bill very similar to \nSenator McCain's bill. I am pleased to support his bill, as well as the \none in the Judiciary Committee. But this company that filed a lawsuit \nand received a substantial verdict was not in favor of the legislation, \nhe said. I asked him how long it took to get his case over. He said 2 \nyears. It took him 2 years to get the case to a conclusion.\n  Now, we are going to have hundreds of thousands of lawsuits in every \ncounty in America, every Federal court, clogged up with these kinds of \ncases, and it will take years to get to a conclusion, and that is not a \nhealthy circumstance for America. I really mean that. That is not good \nfor us, if we care about the American economy. So we need to do that. \nWe need to get compensation to people who suffer losses promptly, with \nthe least possible overhead, the least possible need to pay attorney \nfees, the least possible need to have expert witnesses and prolonged \ntimes to get to it. We need to get it promptly and effectively, and we \nneed to make sure that people who have been fraudulent and \nirresponsible can be sued and can be taken to court and taken to trial. \nThat will happen in this case.\n  Now, some have suggested that we are violating the Constitution if we \ndo that. Well, that is not so. We believe in litigation and in being \nable to get redress in court. This law would provide for that. \nHistorically, the U.S. Senate and the State legislatures, every day, \nset standards for lawsuits. They set the bases of liability. They say \nhow long it takes before you can file a lawsuit. Sometimes the statute \nof limitations is 2 years, sometimes it is 1 year, sometimes it is 6 \nyears. Legislatures set standards for litigation. That is what they do. \nWe are a legislative body and we have a right and an obligation to \nconsider what is best for America in the face of this unique crisis and \nto deal with it effectively.\n\n  Let me ask, if we don't have such a law as this, what will happen? \nWell, I submit that there will be thousands of lawsuits filed. You may \nfile it in one court and maybe they don't have many cases; maybe you \nhave an expeditious judge and you get to trial within a matter of 6 \nmonths. Maybe in another court, it takes 2 years because they have a \nbacklog. But you get to trial within 6 months. And say two people in \nthat court get to trial within 6 months. One of them goes to a jury and \nthe jury says, wait a minute, computer companies can't be responsible \nfor all this; we don't think they are liable. No verdict. Down the \nhall, where another trial is going on, they come forward with a verdict \nof $10 million, or whatever, for this lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\n  Lawsuits are wonderful things for redressing wrongs, but in mass \ndifficulties like this, they tend to promote aberrational distributions \nof limited amounts of resources. So we have a limited amount of \nresources and, as far as possible, we ought to create a legal system \nthat gets prompt payment, consistently evaluating the kind of people \nwho ought to get it. In some States, you will be able to recover huge \nverdicts because the State law would be very favorable. In other \nStates, it would not be.\n  Some have suggested that it would be a horrendous retreat to \neliminate joint and several liability. That is, if six people are \ninvolved in producing and distributing this computer system--six \ndifferent defendants--and one is 5 percent at fault, one of them is 60 \npercent at fault and the others are somewhere in between, and the ones \nmost at fault are bankrupt, they want the one least at fault to pay it \nall if they have the money to do so.\n  Now, people argue about that. That is a major legal policy debate \nthroughout America today. Many States limit joint and several \nliability. Others have it in its entirety, and many are in between. So \nfor us to make a decision on that with regard to this unique problem of \ncomputer Y2K is certainly not irrational. It is important for us.\n  Now, I say to you that the more lawsuits are filed, the longer the \ndelays will be in actually getting compensation to the people who need \nit. Literally, when you talk to people in your hometown and they are \ninvolved in litigation, ask them about major litigation and they will \ntell you it would be unusual, in most circumstances, to get a case \ndisposed of and tried within 1 year. Sometimes it is 3, 4, and 5 years \nbefore they are brought to a conclusion.\n  So I say that a system that promotes prompt payment of damages and \nprompt resolution of the matter is good for everyone. Allocating funds \nto fix this problem is a difficult thing. But the way you do it through \nthe lawsuit system is not good in a situation where we have a massive \nnationwide problem. It is not a good way to do it. We are, again, \ntalking about extraordinary costs and the clogging of courts. So the \nfocus is taken away from actually fixing the problem and more to \nassigning blame, trying to encourage a jury to render the largest \npossible verdict.\n  Now, some would say, why do you have to limit the amount of punitive \ndamages? Well, three times the amount of damages under this bill--\ndamages are limited to three times the actual damages incurred for \npunitive, or $250,000, whichever is greater. They say, why do you want \nto do that? As long as there is a possibility that a jury might render \na verdict for $10 million, lawyers have an incentive not to settle and \ntake that case to a jury.\n  I have talked to lawyers. I know how they think. They say, well, we \ncan settle this case for $200,000. They have offered that. I don't \nthink we are likely to get much more than that, but there is a chance \nthat we can get $1 million or $2 million. I believe we have a couple of \njurors there who are sympathetic with us, and I am inclined to say, \nlet's roll the dice and see. We are not likely to get a whole lot less, \nbut we can get 5 or 10 times as much. That is what I advise you, Mr. \nClient; let's go for it. So what happens is this possibility of \nunlimited verdicts makes it more and more difficult in a practical \nsetting for cases to be settled.\n  You will have more realistic settlements if you have this kind of \nlimitation on the top end of punitive damages.\n  This bill will encourage remediation. It actually encourages prompt \nnegotiation, consolidation, and problem solving. That is the focus of \nit. That is why I favor it.\n  I would just say this. Mr. President, the Y2K problem is a unique \nproblem. It has the potential of hurting our economy. One of the \ngreatest assets this Nation has--I can't stress this too much--is the \nstrength and viability of our computer industry. We are world leaders. \nThere is not a State in this Nation that doesn't have some computer \nmanufacturing going on, and certainly not a community in America that \ndoes not depend on the innovation and creativity of the computer \nindustry. They benefit from that creativity.\n  As a matter of fact, I heard one expert say that his belief is, the \nreason our economy is so strong, the reason inflation is not going up, \neven though salaries of our workers are going up faster than inflation, \nis because computers have made our workers more productive and that \nthey can afford to pay them more, because using the high-tech \ncomputers, that are really just now in America coming on line fully and \neffectively and wisely utilized by American business, is really helping \nus increase productivity.\n  This is a marvelous asset for us. Some years ago many of these \ncompanies focusing on innovation and creativity apparently did not \nfully focus on the problem that is going to happen at the year 2000.\n  I mentioned earlier in my remarks how every asbestos company in \nAmerica is now in bankruptcy. Many of those had a lot more business \nthan just bankruptcy. They made asbestos. They made a lot more things \nthan just asbestos. Yet their whole company was pulled down by this.\n  If we don't get a handle on this, think about it. We have the \ncapacity to severely damage, by placing in bankruptcy, the most \ninnovative, creative, beneficial industry perhaps this Nation has \ntoday, the thing that is leading us into the 21st century. I think this \nis a matter of critical importance. It is quite appropriate for the \nCongress to legislate on it. It is clearly a matter of interstate \ncommerce. These computers are produced in one State and sold in all 50 \nStates.\n  I really believe it is a situation that is appropriate for the \nCongress to respond to. It is appropriate for us to bring some \nrationality to the damages that will be paid out by these companies, to \nlimit the amount of money they spend on litigation, to make sure the \nmoney gets promptly to those who need it, and otherwise to allow them \nto continue as viable entities producing every year more, better, and \nmore creative products that make us more competitive in the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I don't have any Microsoft business in my State. But I \nknow the Department of Justice sued them for antitrust. I think that is \nfine. We will just see how that chase comes out.\n  In a way, it is sort of odd. I remember saying at the time that most \ncountries which have a strong industry in their nation that is \nexporting and selling all over the world and improving the lives of \nmillions of people do not sue them; they support them. But in America \nwe tend to sue them when they get big. This idea that you are big, you \nhave a deep pocket, and we ought to sue, I think, is not a healthy \nthing at this time.\n  Again, I think, as the Senator from Oregon mentioned, this is a one-\ntime piece of legislation. For those who are troubled about any changes \nin our tort system, I really think that is not a wise approach. We need \nto make some changes. We have always changed our legal system. When \nthere is a problem, we ought not hesitate to improve it. But if you \nare, remember, this is just a one-time problem.\n  Looking at a report from the Progressive Policy Institute, they \nconcluded with these remarks:\n\n       Perhaps the most important big winner from liability \n     limitation [that is, this bill] will be the United States \n     economy and by extension U.S. consumers who will not have to \n     indirectly bear up to $1 trillion in cost with a healthy \n     share going to lawyers.\n\n  I like lawyers. I respect them. But they are not producers. They are \nnot making computers. They are not fixing computers. What they are \ndoing is filing lawsuits and taking big fees for it. And they will have \nat least a one-third contingent fee and usually maybe more than 40 \npercent.\n\n       By promoting attempts to Y2K remediation and lowering the \n     likelihood of litigation, the rules instituted by this \n     legislation will benefit everyone, not just a few. In the \n     last State of the Union address, President Clinton urged \n     Congress to find solutions that would make the Y2K problem \n     the last headache of the 20th century rather than the first \n     crisis of the 21st.\n\n  I think that is a good policy. The President has recognized the need \nfor that. It has had bipartisan support in our committee, bipartisan \nsupport in this Senate--Republicans and Democrats. But there do remain \na few who, through any way possible, are really frustrated by this \nlegislation and are attempting to undo it. In light of the crisis we \nare facing, the threat it poses to small businesses that need their \nsystems fixed, and through our creative\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\nand imaginative computer industry which leads the world, I believe we \nmust act.\n\n  I very much appreciate the leadership of Senator John McCain. He is a \ntrue leader in every sense of the word. He is a man of courage; he \nunderstands technology. He has done a great job on it.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senator Orrin Hatch and the Members \nof the Judiciary Committee who have likewise worked on this \nlegislation.\n  There are two separate bills. But they are very similar, and in \nconclusion they are very similar.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Members of this body for their attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the debate on this bill, S. \n96. It is an important bill. It is an important bill because it \nprotects American business.\n  There are elements of this bill which I think are wise policy. I am \ncertain that at the end of the debate, if the amendment process is a \nreasonable one, we will pass legislation along these lines protecting \nbusiness.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to state unequivocally my strong \nsupport for a Y2K bill.\n  Let me begin by stating how important Y2K remediation is to \nconsumers, business, and the economy. This problem is of particular \ninterest in my State of Utah which has quickly become one of the \nNation's leading high tech States.\n  Working together, Senator Dianne Feinstein and I have produced a \nbill--S. 461, the Year 2000 Fairness and Responsibility Act--that \nencourages Y2K problem-solving rather than a rush to the courthouse. It \nwas not our goal to prevent any and all Y2K litigation. It was to \nsimply make Y2K problem-solving a more attractive alternative to \nlitigation. This benefits consumers, businesses, and the economy. The \nbill was voted out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  But, Senator McCain's bill is the focus of the present debate. With \nsome distinctions--this bill accomplishes the same ends as Senator \nFeinstein's and my bill. Let me say that I support a strong bill. I do \nnot care who gets the credit. This is of no importance to me. What is \nimportant is that the Nation needs Y2K legislation. I thus will support \nany mechanism that is able to pass Congress. Let me explain why.\n  The main problem that confronts us as legislators and policymakers in \nWashington is one of uniquely national scope. More specifically, what \nwe face is the threat that an avalanche of Y2K-related lawsuits will be \nsimultaneously filed on or about January 3, 2000, and that this \nunprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer industry's \nability to correct the problem. Make no mistake about it, this super-\nlitigation threat is real; and, if it substantially interferes with the \ncomputer industry's ongoing Y2K repair efforts, the consequences for \nAmerica could be disastrous.\n  Most computer users were not looking into the future while, those who \ndid, assumed that existing computer programs would be entirely \nreplaced, not continuously modified, as actually happened. What this \ndemonstrates is that the two-digit date was the industry standard for \nyears and reflected sound business judgment. The two-digit date was not \neven considered a problem until we got to within a decade of the end of \nthe century.\n  As the Legal Times recently pointed out, ``the conventional wisdom \n[in the computer business was] that most in the industry did not become \nfully aware of the Y2K problem until 1995 or later.'' The Legal Times \ncited a LEXIS search for year 2000 articles in Computerworld magazine \nthat turned up only four pieces written between 1982 and 1994 but 786 \npieces between 1995 and January 1999. Contrary to what the programmers \nof the 1950s assumed, their programs were not replaced; rather, new \nprogrammers built upon the old routines, tweaking and changing them but \nleaving the original two-digit date functions intact.\n  As the experts have told us, the logic bomb inherent in a computer \ninterpreting the year ``00'' in a programming environment where the \nfirst two digits are assumed to be ``19'' will cause two kinds of \nproblems. Many computers will either produce erroneous calculations--\nwhat is known as a soft crash--or to shut down completely--what is \nknown as a hard crash.\n\n  What does all this mean for litigation? As the British magazine The \nEconomist so aptly remarked, ``many lawyers have already spotted that \nthey may lunch off the millennium bug for the rest of their days.'' \nOthers have described this impending wave of litigation as a feeding \nfrenzy. Some lawyers themselves see in Y2K the next great opportunity \nfor class action litigation after asbestos, tobacco, and breast \nimplants. There is no doubt that the issue of who should pay for all \nthe damage that Y2K is likely to create will ultimately have to be \nsorted out, often in court.\n  But we face the more immediate problem of frivolous litigation that \nseeks recovery even where there is little or no actual harm done. In \nthat regard, I am aware of at least 20 Y2K-related class actions that \nare currently pending in courts across the country, with the threat of \nhundreds more to come.\n  It is precisely these types of Y2K-related lawsuits that pose the \ngreatest danger to industry's efforts to fix the problem. All of us are \naware that the computer industry is feverishly working to correct--or \nremediate, in industry language--Y2K so as to minimize any disruptions \nthat occur early next year.\n  What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to \ndefend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not \nget spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology \nconsumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money \nbetween now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--\nwill largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and \nhardship will be.\n  To better understand the potential financial magnitude of the Y2K \nlitigation problem, we should consider the estimate of Capers Jones, \nchairman of Software Productivity Research, a provider of software \nmeasurement, assessment and estimation products and services. Mr. Jones \nsuggests that ``for every dollar not spent on repairing the Year 2000 \nproblem, the anticipated costs of litigation and potential damages will \nprobably amount to in excess of ten dollars.''\n  The Gartner Group estimates that worldwide remediation costs will \nrange between $300 billion to $600 billion. Assuming Mr. Jones is only \npartially accurate in his prediction--the litigation costs to society \nwill prove staggering. Even if we accept The Giga Information Group's \nmore conservative estimate that litigation will cost just $2 to $3 for \nevery dollar spent fixing Y2K problems, overall litigation costs may \ntotal $1 trillion.\n  Even then, according to Y2K legal expert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost \nwould greatly exceed the combined estimated legal costs associated with \nSuperfund environmental litigation . . . U.S. tort litigation . . . and \nasbestos litigation.''\n  Perhaps the best illustration of the sheer dimension of \nthe litigation monster that Y2K may create is Mr. Jinnett's suggestion \nthat a $1 trillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs ``would \nexceed even the estimated total annual direct and indirect costs of--\nget this--all civil litigation in the United States,'' which he says is \n$300 billion per year.\n\n  These figures should give all of us some pause. At this level of \ncost, Y2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the \nalready crowded court system to deal with it.\n  Looking at a rash of lawsuits, we must ask ourselves, what kind of \nsignals are we sending to computer companies currently engaged in or \ncontemplating massive Y2K remediation? What I fear industry will \nconclude is that remediation is a losing proposition and that doing \nnothing is no worse an option for them than correcting the problem. \nThis is exactly the wrong message we want to be sending to the computer \nindustry at this critical time.\n  I believe Congress should give companies an incentive to fix Y2K \nproblems right away, knowing that if they don't make a good-faith \neffort to do so, they will shortly face costly litigation. The natural \neconomic incentive of industry is to satisfy their customers and, thus,\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nprosper in the competitive environment of the free market. This acts as \na strong motivation for industry to fix a Y2K problem before any \ndispute becomes a legal one.\n  This will be true, however, only as long as businesses are given an \nopportunity to do so and are not forced, at the outset, to divert \nprecious resources from the urgent tasks of the repair shop to the \noften unnecessary distractions of the court room. A business and legal \nenvironment which encourages problem-solving while preserving the \neventual opportunity to litigate may best insure that consumers and \nother innocent users of Y2K defective products are protected.\n  There are not at least 117 bills pending in State legislatures. Each \nbill has differing theories of recovery, limitations on liability, and \nchanges in judicial procedures, such as class actions. This creates a \nwhole slew of new problems. They include forum shopping. States with \ngreater pro-plaintiff laws will attract the bulk of lawsuits and class \naction lawsuits. A patchwork of statutory and case law will also result \nin uneven verdicts and a probable loss of industry productivity, as \nbusinesses are forced to defend or settle ever-increasing onerous and \nfrivolous lawsuits. Small States most likely will set the liability \nstandard for larger States. This tail wagging the dog scenario \nundoubtedly will distort our civil justice system.\n  Some States are attempting to make it more difficult for plaintiffs \nto recover. Proposals exist to provide qualified immunity while others \ncompletely bar punitive damages. These proposals go far beyond the \napproach taken in the Judiciary and Commerce Committees' bills of \nsetting reasonable limits on punitive damages. Other States may spur \nthe growth Y2K litigation by providing for recovery without any showing \nof fault. A variety of different and sometimes conflicting liability \nand damage rules create tremendous uncertainty for consumers and \nbusinesses. If we want to encourage responsible behavior and \nexpeditious correction of a problem that is so nationally pervasive, \nwe should impose a reasonable, uniform Federal solution that \nsubstantially restates tried and true principles of contract and tort \nlaw. If there is an example for the need for national uniformity in \nrules, this has to be it.\n\n  The most appropriate role we in Washington can play in this crisis is \nto craft and pass legislation that both provides an incentive for \nindustry to continue its remediation efforts and that preserves \nindustry's accountability for such real harm as it is legally \nresponsible for causing.\n  This will involve a delicate balancing of two equally legitimate \npublic interests: the individual interest in litigating meritorious \nY2K-related claims and society's collective interest in remediating Y2K \nas quickly and efficiently as possible. We need to provide an incentive \nfor technology providers and technology consumers to resolve their \ndisputes out of court so that precious resources are not diverted from \nthe repair shop to the court room.\n  Let's face it, the only way a bill will pass is if it has significant \nbipartisan support. I think Congress can pass a bipartisan bill that is \nboth fair and effective. Whatever bill is voted upon by this Chamber, \nit should at a minimum contain the following provisions that:\n  Preserves the right to bring a cause of action;\n  Requires a ``problem-solving'' period before suits can go forward. \nThis delay must be reasonable and if so will spur technology providers \nto spend resources in the repair room instead of diverting needed \ncapital;\n  Provides that the liability of a defendant would be limited to some \npercentage of the company's fault in causing the harm. This will assure \nfairness and lessen the push to go after deep pockets;\n  Allows the parties to a dispute to request alternative dispute \nresolution, or ADR during the problem-solving period;\n  Limits onerous punitive damages;\n  Contains a duty to mitigate. Plaintiffs should not be able to recover \nfor losses they could have prevented;\n  Contains a contract preservation provision. This preserves the \nparties' bargain and prevents States from retroactively instituting \nstrict liability;\n  Codifies the economic loss doctrine. This preserves the restatement \nof torts rule that you cannot get economic loss for tort injuries;\n  Allows evidence of reasonable efforts in tort. This section is very \nimportant because it prevents States from retroactively imposing strict \nliability or negligence per se; and\n  Contains a class action provision. The class action provision must \ncontain a section that common material defect must be demonstrated to \ncertify claims. It should also contain a section that allows for \nremoval of State class actions to Federal courts based on minimal \ndiversity.\n  Let me end by emphasizing that the Y2K problem presents a special \ncase. Because of the great dependence of our economy, indeed of our \nwhole society, on computerization, Y2K will impact almost every \nAmerican in the same way.\n  But the problem and its associated harms will occur only once, all at \napproximately the same time, and will affect virtually every aspect of \nthe economy, society, and Government. What we must avoid is creating a \nlitigious environment so severe that the computer industry's \nremediation efforts will slacken and retreat at the very moment when \nusers and consumers need them to advance with all deliberate speed.\n  I recognize that if we are to enact worthwhile Y2K problem-solving \nlegislation this year, we must all work together--Democrats and \nRepublicans--in a cooperative manner which produces a fair and narrowly \ntailored bill. I think we can do this. We can produce a measure which \nhas broad political support, can pass the Congress, and become law.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nand others to try and get this bill through and will do everything in \nour power to assist him and help him to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, all I will say is that we had a couple of \nlong meetings of negotiations on this issue. We have still not resolved \na couple of outstanding problems. They are tough, very difficult. I am \nnot sure we will be able to resolve them, but we will continue \nnegotiating tonight and into tomorrow. It is my understanding that the \nmajority leader will move back on the bill at noon tomorrow, and we \nwill have the morning to continue those negotiations.\n  I hope we can reasonably sit down together and resolve these \nremaining problems. We have resolved almost all of them, but there are \ntwo or three very difficult issues remaining. All I can do is assure my \ncolleagues, I will make every effort to get them resolved as quickly as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4240-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4240-S4242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUVENILE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are many of us who believe that \ntoday's debate should have been focused on protection of another group, \nnot the businesses of America but the children of America, because, try \nas we might to capture public attention about the necessity for Y2K \nlegislation, American's attention is still riveted on Littleton, CO, \nand Columbine High School.\n  We have had meetings across my home State of Illinois, as my \ncolleagues have had across their States, talking to leaders, \nschoolchildren, police, psychologists, virtually every group \nimaginable, about what happened in Littleton, CO.\n  Sadly, it is a repetition of events which have occurred too often in \nour recent history.\n  October 1, 1997, Pearl, MS, a 16-year-old boy killed his mother, went \nto high school, and shot nine students, two fatally.\n  December 1, 1997, West Paducah, KY, three students were killed, five \nwere found wounded in the hallway of Heath High School by a 14-year-\nold.\n  March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, AR, 4 girls and a teacher shot to death, \n10 people wounded, during a false fire alarm in middle school when two \nboys age 11 and 13 opened fire from the woods.\n  April 24, 1998, Edinboro, PA, a science teacher shot to death in \nfront of students at an eighth-grade dance by a 14-year-old.\n  May 19, 1998, Fayetteville, TN, 3 days before graduation, an 18-year-\nold honor student, allegedly opened fire in a\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\nparking lot of a high school, killing a classmate who was dating his \nex-girlfriend.\n  May 21, 1998, Springfield, OR, 2 teenagers were killed and more than \n20 people were hurt when a 15-year old boy allegedly opened fire on a \nhigh school; the boy's parents were killed at their home.\n  Then there is Littleton, CO, 13 victims and the 2 alleged \nperpetrators, dead, as a result of gunfire that killed so many. Time \nand again we have been told these are unusual circumstances and not \nlikely to happen again.\n\n  Sadly, history has proven they have become all too common place. Can \nanyone believe that our hometown, the high school in our home city, is \nimmune from this sort of violence? I don't believe so. Frankly, it is \nbecause there are many troubled children. That is a problem which needs \nto be addressed directly and seriously.\n  It is a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of parents first, \nclassmates, teachers, principals, psychologists, counselors, those who \nsee the warning signs, to bring these children to the attention of \nothers. Troubled children are not new to society. They have been there \nfor many, many years. Troubled children in my generation waited on the \nparking lot to punch you or they threw something at you; troubled \nchildren today find a gun. That troubled child moves from being a sad \nreality to a tragedy, a tragedy in multiple numbers, time and time \nagain.\n  Today I come to the floor with several of my colleagues--Senator \nKennedy, Senator Schumer, Senator Boxer, and others--prepared to offer \nan amendment to this bill to say to my colleagues that protecting \nbusiness is important; protecting children is more important. As \nimportant as the Y2K debate is to many business interests, families \nacross America are not going to stay up tonight watching television and \ntalk about Y2K; they may and they should talk about violence in schools \nand how it is becoming epidemic in America.\n  The legislation we were prepared to offer today, the Juvenile Gun \nViolence Prevention Act, has about eight or nine provisions. We had the \namendment prepared and we had our cloture motion signed, by 16 Members \nof the Senate. We were going to make this a day for at least a debate, \nif not a political confrontation, as to why the Senate fails to \nconsider that legislation at a time when America wonders if we have \nbecome impotent when it comes to dealing with violence in our schools.\n  I am happy to report a development occurred on the floor a short time \nago which really has changed the face of this debate. Senator Trent \nLott, the majority leader, the Republican majority leader, came to the \nfloor. I understand he was apprised of our intentions and he made an \nannouncement that within 2 weeks we will be able to debate these issues \nabout school violence, guns, and related issues here on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Some may say, Well, what else would you do in the U.S. Senate? My \nfriends, for 2 years we have faced committees on Capitol Hill which \nbasically will not report out any bills related to guns. We don't talk \nabout that subject around here. It is as if it is somehow sacred and \nyou can't bring it up and you can't debate it. That is why Senator \nLott's concession today that we will have this chance to vote on \nimportant legislation relative to our schools is so important across \nAmerica.\n  I say to all those who follow the issue, my heart goes out to the \nvictims and their families in Littleton, CO. It goes out, as well, to \nthe other students whose lives will never ever be the same, having \nwitnessed this horror and this violence. It goes out to students across \nAmerica concerned about their schools.\n  How many more of our schools have to be desecrated by bullets and \nblood? How many more of our teachers and students have to be prepared \nto give up their lives at school to defend their classmates? How many \nmore parents will have to search their memories to try to remember the \nlast words they said to their child as he went off to his last day in \nschool, his last day on Earth? How many more deaths? How many more \nfunerals?\n\n  It is time now that America will come together and say to this \nCongress, as representative of the American people, Do something. We \ncan't solve all these problems, we can't make every troubled kid normal \nagain, but please, reduce the firepower of these children who have such \ntwisted minds, these children who are bent on violence.\n  This legislation which we are proposing I hope will become bipartisan \nlegislation. I am sorry to report that it will be almost historic if it \nis, but some Senators have stepped forward in the past from the \nRepublican side to support this legislation. I hope some will show the \ncourage to do that again.\n  This legislation addresses a number of points, some that are so \nobvious it is a shame we have to legislate. Should a gunowner be \nresponsible for the safe storage of his or her gun? Should a gunowner \nwho knows that children are in the house have to put the gun under lock \nand key or put a trigger lock on it? Sixteen States say yes, this is \nthe law. If you don't, you, as a gunowner, will be held criminally \nresponsible. We say this should be a national law. Mr. President, 13 or \n14 children every day in America die by gun violence. Columbine High \nSchool focuses our attention on 1 day and 15 lives, but every single \nday there is a massacre spread across this country that doesn't capture \nour attention like Littleton, CO.\n  We also have a provision which some will find incredible. Did you \nknow that currently under Federal law a child is prohibited, with few \nexceptions, from possessing and purchasing a handgun, but there is no \nprohibition against possessing and purchasing a semiautomatic weapon? \nThat is currently the law. We hope to change it.\n  Did you know that if a firearm dealer willfully and knowingly sells a \ngun to a child in violation of the law, there is no automatic \nrevocation of their license? I think there should be.\n  Did you know, as well, that at gun shows across America all of the \nprovisions of the Brady law for background checks and waiting periods \ndo not apply? We suspect--we are still waiting to hear--that one of the \nweapons used by these children in Littleton, CO, to kill the others was \npurchased through a straw purchaser at a gun show and given to the \nchild. Is America unable to deal with this? I think we can, and we \nshould.\n  Did you know you can buy firearms over the Internet? How in the world \ncould you responsibly sell a firearm over the Internet, not knowing on \nthe other side if the purchaser is 15, 16, 17 years old, or a former \ncriminal, or someone with a history of violent mental illness? To me, \nthese things seem so obvious.\n  I yield for a question from my colleague from California, who has \nbeen a supporter on this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Illinois for putting together this \nvery important piece of legislation which has a number of fine ideas to \nprotect our children. I associate myself with the Senator's remarks.\n  While we deal with the computer problem, we have essentially not been \nable to offer this bill today. It is hard for me to believe that. The \nmajority leader said it would not be right to deal with this because we \nare still coping with the sorrow of Littleton, CO. The best thing we \ncan do in the name of those children is to do something to stop this \nfrom happening again.\n  I had a question for my friend, because I want his reaction, his \ncomment to this. In the 11 years of the Vietnam war, we lost 58,000 \nAmericans, a tragedy that brought this country to its knees. Every \ninstitution was questioned. The country has never been the same. We are \njust getting over it.\n  In the last 11 years, I say to my friend, 400,000 people have been \nkilled in this country by firearms. Let me repeat that: 58,000 killed \nin the 11 years of the Vietnam war; 400,000 killed in the streets of \nthis country. That doesn't even count three times the number of people \nwho wind up in hospitals, nursing wounds that will be with them for the \nrest of their life. That doesn't even put a dollar figure on a couple \nbillion of dollars a year to pay for the wounds to those people. Does \nmy friend think there has to be some outrage here?\n  The people in this country are looking for leadership. Our Chaplain \nled us in the most magnificent prayer I have ever heard him give, and \nhe gives good prayers. I have to say to my friend, I have been praying \nfor too many people who were gunned down, including one of my son's \nbest friends who did nothing more than visit his wife in her law\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\nfirm, when a man walked in with a TEC-9 --the same gun that was used by \nthese kids--and mowed him down as he threw himself over his wife to \nsave her life, which he did. He died.\n  Prayers are very important right now. We turn to God at these \nmoments, but we also have to turn to ourselves. What the Senator is \nsaying is, it is time for this Senate to do something about this \nproblem.\n  I would like to get his reaction to those numbers I put out here. \nAgain, I thank him for this opportunity to comment on his legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from California.\n  My reaction is this: I am concerned about two things. I am concerned \nthat the American people have given up on us. I believe they have come \nto the conclusion that for political reasons we cannot do the obvious; \nwe cannot pass the laws to keep guns out of the hands of kids. I think \nthey are wrong. I hope we can prove them wrong.\n  Certainly the record of the last few decades suggests that we have \nbeen blind to this carnage in our streets, people living in fear of \nwalking down the street in Los Angeles or Chicago, kids living in fear \nof walking on the playground. There is a school on the west side of \nChicago called the Austin Career Academy. When that high school is \nabout to adjourn for the day, let the children go home, the police come \nand close the streets around the schools so that the gang bangers \ncannot drive by and shoot the children as they come out of the schools.\n  That is daily life in too many places in America. We can argue about \nwhat we can do and why the people should give up on this Congress. I \nhope they do not. But we cannot give up on our children, because if we \ndo, we have failed our most fundamental responsibility.\n  I know this is tough, because some of our colleagues, even on the \nDemocratic side and on the Republican side, have great concerns about \nthe gun lobby and what they might do if they vote for any legislation. \nIt is a tough vote, a hard vote, but I hope they will step back for a \nsecond and say we cannot allow this violence and killing to continue in \nAmerican schools.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield one more moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Definitely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to pick up on that point because there is a gun \nlobby. We all see it, we all know it, there are a lot of bucks behind \nit. But there is another lobby out there, the people, and the people \nwant us to do sensible measures to protect our children.\n  I want to make one last point to my colleague, and that is, in my \nhome State of California, the largest State in the Union by far--34 \nmillion people--the No. 1 cause of death among children from the minute \nthey are born until they are 18, the No. 1 cause of death is gunshots--\nNo. 1 cause of death.\n  If we had a disease that was the No. 1 cause of death, we would be \nworking on this floor feverishly until we addressed that disease. This \nis a disease.\n  I have to say to my friend, I watched him take on the tobacco lobby \nand win. There is not a time I do not get on an airplane and realize I \ndo not have to smell that smoke and have that in my lungs that I don't \nthink of him and his courage in that matter. When he came over here, I \njust knew reinforcements were coming for some of these tough issues, \nand this is one of them.\n  This is a tough one, but that is what we are here for. It is very \neasy to vote for the easy bills. It is easy to vote for ``Children's \nAppreciation Day.'' It is easy to do that. It is a little tougher when \nyou take on the gun lobby.\n\n  I hope we are judged by this. My experience is that people respect \nyou, even if they might not agree with you, if you have the guts to do \nsomething about a problem.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please join with \nus. Some of these issues are so easy for you to vote for. For example, \none of them you have in here says if a local district has a proposal in \nfor more cops on the beat, waive the matching fund if the community \npolice are assigned to the schools. That is one that does not even \ntouch a gun. But today we are told by the majority leader that he \nbelieves it would be unseemly to act. That is his view. I respect it. I \ndon't think it is unseemly to act in the wake of this tragedy. I think \npeople want us to act in the wake of this tragedy.\n  Thank you. I yield back to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will close by saying I am happy that the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, has made this commitment publicly on the \nfloor of the Senate that within 2 weeks we will have debate on \nlegislation such as I have described here. The important thing about \nthat debate is not what is said on the floor of the Senate between \nSenators. What is important between now and that 2-week deadline is \nwhat is said by the American people to those who serve in the Senate.\n  For those who are watching the proceedings of the Senate or who read \nthe Record, I hope you will understand that if you are not part of this \ndebate, if you do not pick up your telephone, if you do not take a pen \nand write a letter, if you do not send an e-mail saying, ``For goodness \nsake, do something about violence in our schools and the proliferation \nof guns in the hands of children,'' I can guarantee you that the \noutcome of this debate is going to be a disappointment to families \nacross America.\n  Do not give up on Congress. This is an institution which is serving \nthis country and all of the American families in it. The families have \nto come forward now. They have to be heard from. It is not enough to \nsay the school year is coming to an end, so that will be the end of \nschool violence. There will always be another school year, history \ntells us, sadly, always an opportunity for another tragedy. Let us \nlearn something valuable from the suffering of the families in \nLittleton, CO. Let us vow, Democrat and Republican alike, that we will \ndo everything in our power to reduce school violence and make this a \nsafer place for our children.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate will \nspeak on this resolution today. I know that the families and, indeed, \nall of Colorado appreciate their deep and heartfelt sorrow.\n  On my father's side, as you know, Mr. President, I am Cheyenne, so I \nwould like to begin speaking in the manner of his people.\n  This fan comes from the eagle. The old people call the eagle the \nkeeper of the Earth, the one that watches over the domain of the \nGrandfather Spirit.\n  This pipe carries the smoke with the words and the thoughts from the \npeople who use it to the Creator.\n  This flute is used to carry songs of love, forgiveness, and \nbrotherhood.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the voices of all the council fires \nand pipes send our pleas as Senators as we ask for guidance as we try \nto rid ourselves of violence in this Nation.\n  I would like the great winged brother that he has chosen as our \nnational symbol of freedom and justice to oversee all of his children. \nFurther, I would like the winds to carry the sweetness and harmony and \ntolerance of the flute to the Grandfather Spirit.\n  Mr. President, traditional Indian people do not believe that death is \nfinite. Indeed, they believe that mortal remains return to Mother Earth \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nwhich they came, but the soul, which is the part of you that is \ntimeless, goes on to the next world to be forever in the presence of \nthe Great Spirit in a place that is absent of avarice and greed, devoid \nof hunger and sickness, barren of anger, jealousy, and hate. It is a \nplace of goodness where springtime is forever.\n  That is the place where Indian people believe the innocent victims of \nColumbine High School have journeyed. Although their time on Earth was \nfar too short, the elders remind us that the grace of the Creator made \nour lives so much better by allowing them to be with us for a time, \nhowever short.\n  Columbine High School will go on because our departed friends would \nhave it so, but it will never forget.\n  I have heard the debate thus far on this terrible tragedy, and I have \nto ask: Are more laws the answer? I frankly do not know, Mr. President. \nSeventeen Federal laws and I think over 6 State laws were broken during \nthat terrible tragedy. Would 1 more or 100 more have helped? I do not \nknow.\n  I suppose there will be a rush to judgment. And I expect a torrent of \nproposed legislation, and perhaps some of it will help, perhaps not. \nBut certainly I, as one Senator, will consider any proposal to make \nthings better.\n  Mr. President, none of us have all the answers. But we know we cannot \nlegislate tolerance. We cannot mandate that you love your neighbor. We \ncan pass no law requiring Americans to respect each other. Those \nqualities are learned, as is hate and intolerance.\n  Government has its place, Mr. President, but so do churches, \nfamilies, clubs, schools, teams, and indeed complete communities. I \nhope that we do not confuse who should do what. And let our actions \nreflect the Good Book at least as much as it does the law book. But \nabove all, let us keep the memory of these innocent children and a \nheroic teacher alive as we strive for a solution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, for his fine floor statement. I \nwas especially touched when he brought in the meaning of what was \nhappening in Colorado in relation to his forefathers, the Cheyenne \npeople. It means a lot to me personally to hear those words, because I \nconsider us part of one big family.\n  I do have a perspective that I would like to share with the Members \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, House Concurrent Resolution No. 92 is sponsored by Tom \nTancredo. The House of Representatives approved this resolution earlier \ntoday, exactly 1 week after Columbine High School was tragically \nravaged by two of its students. The school and a large majority of its \nstudents live in the Sixth Congressional District. Congressman Tancredo \nrepresents this district and lives a short distance from Columbine High \nSchool.\n  This resolution is intended to express our feelings of sorrow about \nthe tragedy in Littleton, CO. This resolution is also intended to \nexpress our appreciation for those in the community who responded with \ncourage and compassion, including the students themselves.\n  Today, the State of Colorado observed a moment of silence at 11:21 \na.m. mountain daylight time. This was approximately when the terrorism \nbegan 1 week ago at Columbine High School.\n  Earlier today, the Senate joined Senator Campbell and me in a moment \nof silence and prayer led by the Senate Chaplain. On behalf of \nColorado, and especially the citizens of Jefferson County, I thank you \nfor sharing in this gesture of respect and mourning.\n  My wife Joan and I attended the memorial service this Sunday, April \n25, for those who were killed: Cassie Bernall, Steven Curnow, Corey \nDePooter, Kelly Fleming, Matthew Kechter, Daniel Mauser, Daniel \nRohrbough, Rachel Scott, Isaiah Shoels, John Tomlin, Lauren Townsend, \nKyle Velasquez, and their teacher, William ``Dave'' Sanders.\n  At the memorial service, we shared our profound sense of loss with \nVice President Gore, Colorado Governor Owens, Congressman Tancredo, the \nstudents, teachers, and parents of Columbine High, and the people of \nJefferson County and Colorado.\n  I have never experienced anything that compares to the collective \nfeeling of loss, sadness, and disbelief in Colorado. I would estimate \nthat approximately 75,000 people attended the memorial service. Among \nthose gathered in sorrow, Joan and I witnessed a strong belief in God. \nWe prayed together and searched for answers.\n  During the past week, many of my colleagues have come to the floor to \nshare their condolences and concern for the students and teachers who \nhave lost their lives or who have been injured in this senseless \ntragedy. I do hope that our thoughts and prayers have helped to comfort \nthe students, parents, and teachers of the Columbine High School \ncommunity. Again, I offer my deepest sympathy to those who are \nsuffering.\n  Our Nation continues to grieve with the families and friends of the \nkilled and injured students and teachers. We are still attempting to \nunderstand what happened and why. People are trying to cope with the \nterror that has crept into our lives. It has become obvious at this \npoint that there are no easy answers. We need to examine the problems \nfacing our youth, but it is critical that we take time to carefully \nconsider the solutions being offered.\n  There are things that society can do, but those who are looking for \neasy solutions should take a step back. The families, teachers, and \nstudents of Columbine, and the people of Colorado, need time to mourn \ntheir losses. We need to wait for law enforcement to finish their \ninvestigation. We should study other instances of school violence \nthroughout America and look for a common thread.\n  We need to carefully evaluate all of the evidence and consider the \npossible solutions. In addition, it has been estimated that 17 laws \nwere broken by the two students, and we need to evaluate what the \ncurrent law should have done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a list of those 17 \nlaws printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nViolations of Federal and State Laws by the Alleged Perpetrators of the \n          Crime at Columbine High School, Littleton, Colorado\n\n       Details of the explosives and firearms used by the alleged \n     perpetrators have not been confirmed by law enforcement \n     authorities. The crime scene is still being examined and \n     cleared. It is unknown how the alleged perpetrators came into \n     possession of the explosives and firearms they used.\n       The alleged perpetrators, obviously, committed multiple \n     counts of murder and attempted murder, the most serious \n     crimes of all. And they committed many violations of laws \n     against destruction of property, such as in the school \n     building and the cars in the parking lot outside. All told, \n     the prison sentences possible for these multiple, serious \n     violations amount to many hundreds of years.\n       Additionally, in the course of planning and committing \n     these crimes, the alleged perpetrators committed numerous \n     violations of very serious federal and state laws relating to \n     explosives and firearms, and, depending on details not yet \n     known, may have committed other such violations. \n     Cumulatively, the prison sentences possible for these \n     violations alone amount to many hundreds of years. A partial \n     list of those violations follows:\n       1. Possession of a ``destructive device'' (i.e., bomb). \n     (Multiple counts.) Prohibited under 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53. \n     Each violation is punishable by 10 years in prison and a \n     $10,000 fine. Other explosives violations are under 18 U.S.C. \n     842.\n       Colorado law [18-12-109(2)] prohibits the possession of an \n     ``explosive or incendiary device.'' Each violation is a Class \n     4 felony. Colorado [18-12-109(6)] also prohibits possession \n     of ``explosive or incendiary parts,'' defined to include, \n     individually, a substantial variety of components used to \n     make explosive or incendiary devices. Each violation is a \n     Class 4 felony.\n       2. Manufacturing a ``destructive device'' (i.e., bomb). \n     (Multiple counts.) Prohibited under 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53. \n     Each violation is punishable by 10 years in prison and a \n     $10,000 fine.\n       3. Use of an explosive or incendiary device in the \n     commission of a felony. Prohibited under Colorado law [18-12-\n     109(4)]. A class 2 felony.\n       4. Setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon \n     being triggered. Violation of Colorado law. (Citation \n     uncertain)\n       5. Use of a firearm or ``destructive device'' (i.e. bomb) \n     to commit a murder that is prosecutable in a federal court. \n     Enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. 924(i). Punishable by death \n     or up to life in prison. A federal nexus is through 18 U.S.C. \n     922(q), prohibiting the\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\n     discharge of a firearm, on school property, with reckless \n     disregard for the safety of another person.\n       6. Use of a firearm or ``destructive device'' (i.e., bomb) \n     in a crime of violence that is prosecutable in a federal \n     court. Enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. 924(c). Penalty is 5 \n     years if a firearm; 10 years if a ``sawed-off'' shotgun, \n     ``sawed-off'' rifle or ``assault weapon;'' and 30 years if \n     the weapon is a ``destructive device'' (bomb, etc.). \n     Convictions subsequent to the first receive 20 years or, if \n     the weapon is a bomb, life imprisonment. Again, a federal \n     nexus is through 18 U.S.C. 922(q), prohibiting the discharge \n     of a firearm, on school property, with reckless disregard for \n     the safety of another person.\n       7. Conspiracy to commit a crime of violence prosecutable in \n     federal court. Enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. 924(n). \n     Penalty is 20 years if the weapon is a firearm, life \n     imprisonment if the weapon is a bomb. Again, a federal nexus \n     is through 18 U.S.C. 922(q), prohibiting the discharge of a \n     firearm, on school property, with reckless disregard for the \n     safety of another person.\n       8. Possession of a short-barreled shotgun or rifle. Some \n     news accounts have suggested that the alleged perpetrators \n     may have possessed a ``sawed-off'' rifle. (A shotgun or rifle \n     less than 26'' in overall length, or a shotgun was a barrel \n     of less than 18'', or a rifle with a barrel of less than \n     16''.) A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office \n     reported, possibly, at least one long gun with the stock cut \n     off. Prohibited under 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53. A violation is \n     punishable by 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n       Colorado law [18-12-102(3)] prohibits possession of a \n     ``dangerous weapon'' (defined to include sawed-off guns). \n     First violation is a Class 5 felony; subsequent violations \n     are Class 4 felonies.\n       9. Manufacturing a ``sawed-off'' shotgun or ``sawed-off'' \n     rifle. Prohibited under 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53. Each violation \n     is punishable by 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n       10. Possession of a handgun or handgun ammunition by a \n     person under age 18: Some news accounts report one alleged \n     perpetrator as being 17 years of age. It is yet unclear what \n     firearms were involved in the crime. A person under age 18 is \n     prohibited from possessing a handgun or handgun ammunition, \n     except for legitimate target shooting, hunting, and firearms \n     training activities, and similar legitimate reasons.[18 \n     U.S.C. 922(x), part of the 1994 crime bill.] A violation is \n     punishable by one year in prison.\n       11. Providing a handgun or handgun or handgun ammunition to \n     a person under age 18. Prohibited under the same provision \n     noted in #4, above. Penalty of one year, unless the provider \n     knew the gun would be used in a crime of violence, in which \n     case the penalty is 10 years.\n       12. Age restrictions on purchasing firearms. Again, the age \n     of the second suspect and how the alleged perpetrators came \n     into possession of firearms are unclear. However, licensed \n     dealers may sell rifles and shotguns only to persons age 18 \n     or over, and handguns to persons age 21 or over. [18 U.S.C. \n     922(b)(1)]\n       13. Possession of a firearm on school property. Prohibited \n     under 18 U.S.C. 922(q). Five year penalty. Colorado also \n     prohibits a gun on school property. (Citation uncertain.)\n       14. Discharge of a firearm on school property, with a \n     reckless disregard for another's safety. Prohibited under 18 \n     U.S.C. 922q. Five year penalty.\n       15. Possession, interstate transportation, sale, etc., of a \n     stolen firearm. Prohibited under 18 U.S.C. 922(i) and (j). A \n     violation is punishable by 10 years.\n       16. Intentionally aiming a firearm at another person. \n     Violation of Colorado law.\n       17. Displaying a firearm in a public place in a manner \n     calculated to alarm, or discharging a firearm in a public \n     place except on a lawful target practice or hunting place. \n     Violation of Colorado law.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Whatever the solution, I am convinced that we will never \nalleviate the problem completely, but we certainly can reduce its \noccurrence.\n  It is hard to understand how two students can become so \ndysfunctional, but we need to continue to search for answers. There is \nno simple solution. We must pledge ourselves to do what we can. I ask \nthat the Senate begin by approving this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join \nwith my colleagues in an expression directed by House Concurrent \nResolution 92, which deals with the situation that occurred in \nColumbine High School in Littleton, CO.\n  I come this afternoon with no answers, and I wish I had some. Like \nmost of us, I have thought a great deal about the crisis from the \nmoment we watched it unfolding on national television late last week. I \nguess in all of this, I have been struck by how quickly some people \nrush to explain what happened and offer solutions to prevent such a \nterrible crime from ever happening again. I wish I had a crystal ball \nand could do that. But that is not what has occurred; I don't have a \ncrystal ball that can show all that clearly.\n  The investigation of the crime is not yet completed, and the \ncommunity is still in shock. My guess is it is only natural to react by \ntrying to make some sense out of all of this, to locate the exact point \nwhere something terribly, terribly wrong happened, to tell everyone to \nstay away from that point, and to pass a law that would keep everyone \naway from that point, so that it would shield us and our kids and our \ncommunities from harm. While it may be natural, my guess is that at \nthis time it would be a mistake. It would be a mistake to designate the \npoint and rush to judgment, because that judgment may be different \ntomorrow, based on the facts that are now unfolding.\n\n  I don't believe there is a Senator on this floor who has all of the \nanswers. I am impatient to have more information, and I hope it will \ncome out, because I would like to think that Columbine--the situation \nthat happened in that high school is a point of time we will all stop \nand think about and deal with as an issue which we will never allow to \nhappen again.\n  I just came off the Capitol steps a few moments ago from speaking to \na marvelously beautiful group of students from Payette, and Parma, and \nMiddleton, ID. They asked me, ``Senator, what can you do to make our \nschools safer?'' I said, ``You know, I am not sure I know what to do, \nbecause those young men at that high school in Colorado broke 17 laws, \nState and Federal''--laws that say it is against the law to possess a \ndestructive device, or a bomb; laws that say that manufacturing a \ndestructive device is wrong and against the law; laws that say the use \nof an explosive or incendiary device in the commission of a felony is \nagainst the law. They broke all of those. The law was there and it \ndidn't stop them.\n  How about setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon being \ntriggered? That is against the law. It is a violation of State law in \nColorado. It didn't stop what happened there in Littleton. There is a \nlaw regarding the use of a firearm or destructive device to commit a \nmurder that is prosecutable in a Federal court. That is against the \nlaw. Yet, those two young men defied the law. The use of a firearm or a \ndestructive device in relation to other activities is against the law.\n  I could read all 17 of these laws, and not one of them saved one \nchild or that teacher, that coach, at that high school. Maybe if you \nhad stacked all the laws against the front door, in book form, you \nwould have blocked the entry of those kids with their bombs for just a \nmoment in time, and that school might have been saved. But nobody did \nthat. We could rush to judgment today and pass a lot more laws and take \nthose books of laws and stack them up against the schoolhouse door. My \nguess is that not one more child in America would be safer.\n  Laws are important, and I am not suggesting they are not. They direct \na civil society to, hopefully, do better things. But they need to be \ncarefully-thought-out laws. My guess is that the breaking point is at \nhand, when America as a culture had better turn and look at itself and \nask, ``Why?''\n  When those kids asked me what I could do this afternoon, I asked \nthem, ``What are you, as students, prepared to do?'' It ``ain't cool'' \nto rat on a fellow student. Peer pressure is such that young people \ndon't talk about another young person with their principals or \nsuperintendents--even if the young person said, ``I am going to kill \nsomebody,'' or do something else wrong. It isn't cool. Yet, if you \ndon't do something, maybe it is Columbine that happens.\n  I would like to see our schools become zones for education. Drug-\nfree? Absolutely. Gun-free? Absolutely. But zones for education, not \nprimarily socialization and the mixing and all of the kinds of things \nthat go on in schools. Let's set some rules. How about a dress code? \nHow about random inspection of lockers? If you are going to educate and \nyou are going to make a safe haven for education, maybe it is\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\ntime you bring discipline back to schools and you say to the bad \nactors: You are out.\n  I don't know that that is the answer, but I think it is time our \nsociety talks about it, because we have passed a lot of gun laws in the \nlast decade in this Congress and children died last week in Littleton, \nCO, in spite of all those gun laws we passed, all those bomb laws we \npassed.\n  I don't think there is a Senator on the floor who is going to rush \nout and say it is against the law to buy a pipe--nor should they--or \nagainst the law to go out and buy a propane canister to fuel your \nbarbecue. But those were tools used in bombs in Littleton's high \nschool. There is no Senator who will do that, because there may not be \nany political bounce in it and it just would not make common sense.\n\n  So let us let the survivors mourn in Littleton, CO. Let us let that \ncommunity heal. Let's let the law enforcement people try to make sense \nof what made these young men tick, by their diaries, by their web page, \nby their play-acting, by the evil that invaded their hearts. Then maybe \nwe, as public people, can help reshape our very wonderful culture.\n  Yes, maybe it will take some changes in law. There is no disputing \nwhat I represent, and most people in this body know I am a strong \nsupporter of second amendment rights. I am also a strong supporter of \nfirst amendment rights. I am not going to trample on those rights, and \nI am going to supply formidable debate and opposition to anybody who \nwill on this floor try to reshape them in the name of safety and \nsecurity. But I am willing to put those rights on the line, and I am \nwilling to say--to a culture that has failed to recognize that along \nwith rights comes responsibility--that it is now time to get \nresponsible.\n  That is what I told those young people a few moments ago on the steps \nof their Nation's Capitol--that I was going to fight to secure for them \nthe kind of freedoms my forebears had fought to secure for me; that I \nhad accepted the responsibility that came with those rights and they, \ntoo, must; that passing laws in the U.S. Congress does not a safer \nworld make, unless the laws are enforceable and unless people genuinely \nagree with them.\n  So I think it is appropriate that our leader has asked us to take \npause, not rush to judgment, not play to the politics of the moment, \nbut to take a deep breath and think awhile, let a community heal just a \nbit, speak to it in the form of the resolution that is now before us, \nallow the investigators to patch together this weird and terribly evil \nstory. And then let's examine it as a Congress, as an American culture, \nand say to ourselves we must become more responsible--responsible as \nlegislators, responsible as parents, responsible as a culture, in \ntaking our rights in a way that demonstrates the responsibility that \ngoes with them.\n  I say to the citizens of Littleton, CO, how terribly sorry I am. My \nwife and I mourn with them. We have three beautiful children and a \ngrandbaby, and we are so glad that they are safe and happy today. We \nknow there are parents in Littleton, CO, who have lost something that \ncan never and will never be replaced. So I am pleased that today, as a \nCongress and as a Senate, we are speaking to the people of Littleton, \nCO, and then we will step back and allow the healing process to begin \nas the investigative work is completed. Then, and only then, is it \nright and proper that we engage. And I will not be a vehicle to \nobstruct that engagement. That would be wrong. But we will soon have a \njuvenile crime bill on the floor. That is the appropriate place to talk \nabout how to deal with this issue, and from sound information make \nquality judgments about how we may help our culture reshape itself in a \nresponsible and caring fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges for Angela Williams and David Goldberg be granted for the \n106th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we consider this resolution before the \nSenate to remember those who lost their lives just one short week ago \nin Littleton, Colorado, we are once again reminded of an event which is \nheart-wrenchingly tragic and one that bears out the need for educators, \nparents, and government officials to work together to ensure that the \nclassroom is a safe place for all students.\n  The tragic events last Tuesday at Columbine High School serve as yet \nanother warning that something has gone terribly wrong in our nation. \nSchools are not the idyllic places that they once were. They are less \nand less safe havens, conducive to study, but, rather, increasingly, \nare proving to be unstable communities, teetering on the brink of \nviolent outbursts.\n  It makes me long for the old high school which I attended and from \nwhich I graduated 65 years ago. It makes me long for the little two-\nroom schoolhouse in which I began my studies along about 1923. \nSometimes I think schools are too large these days. They don't allow \nfor the personal attention that teachers could otherwise show students. \nThey are conducive, I think, by their very largeness to the creation of \ngangs, hate groups, and so on.\n  The scene of screaming students rushing outside through schoolhouse \ndoors, some hobbling or clenching a gunshot wound to the arm or leg, \nand others overwhelmed with fear for their own lives, has become all \ntoo familiar to this nation during the past few years. From West \nPaducah, Kentucky, to Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, Oregon; and now \nto the community of Littleton, Colorado, gun shots have shattered the \nsilence and tranquillity of an otherwise typical high school day, \nabruptly ending the innocence of youth, and launching families and \nfriends into some of the most difficult days of life that no human \nbeing should have to confront.\n  We would have never dreamed of this kind of thing in my school days.\n  Mr. President, there is a crying need to do more to protect our \nchildren. But, the unfortunate reality of the situation is that there \nis no single-step panacea to prevent further bloodshed at schools \nacross the country. One could make many suggestions. Many suggestions \nare readily obvious. But the problem of school violence does not begin \nand end on school grounds. It is much more pervasive. It reaches beyond \nthe schoolyard gates, into our communities and into our homes.\n  It is unfortunate that we live in a country where criminals find ways \nto get around the law and do evil, but it happens. Hatred is a powerful \ndemon that can draw people to do things we do not truly understand. I \nhave seen it in my own lifetime, and, I try, whenever possible, to help \nteach young people to avoid such egregious mistakes. Of course, the \nyoung are not alone in the making of these mistakes. But mine is only \none voice. But it is one voice.\n  I often take time out to talk with the pages here. I don't have to do \nit. Nobody makes me do it. Nobody tells me to do it. But I like to talk \nto these young people. These are fine young people, these pages of ours \non both sides of the aisle. I often pause to take a half hour with them \nto talk about wholesome experiences, and to relate good stories from \nChaucer, and from other great authors, as I feel that if I can do a \nlittle good with these young people here, who knows where this \ninfluence will stop?\n  While it is my intention to make any and all efforts to prevent this \nkind of tragedy before it visits another region of the country, it is \nessential that we take up the effort and the responsibility to raise \nour children, to nurture them, to protect them, to guard them as much \nas we can from these evil influences that are always ready to prey upon \nthem, and it is my desire always to try to provide these young people \nwith a solid foundation, to encourage them to engage in wholesome \npursuits and to read from good literature, and in this way I think \nadults can help to\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nprovide them with a solid foundation--spiritually, emotionally, and \nintellectually. We have to indulge with caution any idea that there can \nbe morality without religion. Protecting our Nation's children should \nbe a team effort, not simply a matter of public policy.\n\n  If we ever have a hope of preventing violence in the classroom, \nparents must take an active role in their child's life and monitor \ntheir child's behavior for unusual actions or alarming conduct. \nTeachers carry similar responsibilities and must no longer ``chalk up'' \nunusual behavior to the simple conclusion of a student having a bad \nday. We have witnessed too many oversights like this which have \nsnatched the lives of other innocent children caught in the line of \nfire.\n  Moreover, we should not be surprised, given the excessive and \nmindless violence--I tell you, it is excessive, because I see it when I \nturn on the television--mindless violence, excessive violence. We \nshould not be surprised then, given the excessive and mindless violence \ninfiltrating, permeating, the television airwaves and now the Internet, \nthat we really have a problem in today's society. It is not a hidden \nfact that I am no fan of the muck that spews out over the tube or the \nobscenities rumbled by so-called actors and actresses in a TV drama, \nbut there is little that we in Congress can do to regulate children \nfrom jumbling their brains with this nonsense.\n\n  Parents must no longer give their children free rein of the remote \ncontrol or unmonitored access to dial up those polluted websites \nrunning rampant over the Internet. Children, with their inquisitive \nyoung minds, too often repeat what they see on TV or read about over \nthe Internet, and with little guidance from parents, it is next to \nimpossible to prevent this often fatal ``copycat'' action from \nrecurring.\n  Probably most disappointing to me is that in watching the news \nrecently, it seems that the tragic news of a school shooting has become \nsomewhat of a feeding frenzy for the media to hit the airwaves with \nexplicit details, often those that are too easily digested by a \nlistening youngster experiencing emotional distress. It seems \ncounterproductive, even dangerous, to offer what amounts to free \nadvertising by reporting on the Internet websites that hand out free \nexplanations on how to make a bomb or where to obtain a gun. Mr. \nPresident, when is enough enough?\n  Efforts to end school violence can be, and will likely be, undone by \nthis practice of revealing too much information with little thought of \nthe future implications. I urge the media to think about the possible \nconsequences of their actions before trying to beat the other news team \nto the latest punch line. Supplying children with information that \ncould lead to the perpetuation of school violence is not the solution. \nChildren need not be confronted with all of the finite details of the \ngory pictures as they sit down to the breakfast table with their \nparents.\n  The tragedy at Columbine High School may be impossible to ever, ever \ntruly understand. But that should not deter us from seeking answers and \nworking for solutions. It is time to stop wringing our hands over this \nissue and take action so that we in Congress can support measures that \nmight prevent a recurrence of this nightmare.\n  I am concerned that we may be approaching the day when our nation's \nstudents spend more time in the classroom thinking about the potential \nfor a gun pop than a pop quiz. A day when teachers are too preoccupied \nwith their own fear of a gun emerging into their classroom to teach \ntheir students the basic grammatical structure or algebraic formula \nproperly. Today's children deserve the opportunity to get an education. \nToday's teachers deserve the opportunity to teach. They deserve this \njust as much as the children and the teachers of yesteryear. We must \nall do whatever we can to ensure that today's children and those of the \nfuture have an opportunity to excel academically in an environment free \nfrom guns, knives, and other weapons.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lieberman in the upcoming \nweeks to author legislation that would establish a National Commission \non School Violence to help get at the root of this problem if that is \npossible. It is my hope that by joining forces between educators, \nchildren, parents, media, and others, we will gain a more vivid \nperspective on what leads to violent behavior behind the schoolhouse \ndoors, and that we can begin to remedy this harrowing problem \novertaking our nation's schools. I urge teachers and parents, church \nand civic leaders to do the same. This type of disaster can occur \nanywhere--we must act now if we are to prevent a replay of this \nnightmare in another American community.\n  I hope parents throughout the Nation are thinking soberly, soberly \nabout this problem.\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day\n\n     And as my fingers pressed it still\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n     I came again when days were past.\n     The bit of clay was hard at last.\n\n     The form I gave it, it still bore,\n     And I could change that form no more.\n\n     I took a piece of living clay\n     And gently formed it day by day.\n\n     And molded with my power and art.\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n     I came again when years were gone,\n     He was a man I looked upon.\n\n     He still that early impress wore,\n     And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  There is a lesson in this for all of us. I hope we will learn it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 92) expressing the \n     sense of Congress with respect to the tragic shooting at \n     Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution and \nto express my deepest, heartfelt sympathy for the families of the \nvictims of Columbine High School shootings.\n  At a time like this, words seem to lose their meaning, and there is \nlittle that we can say to adequately express our regret and sorrow. \nThere is no way to explain the senseless violence that claimed the \nlives of the students and teacher in Littleton, and we struggle to \nunderstand and explain the inexplicable.\n  Schools are supposed to be safe havens where teenagers--children--are \nsupposed to grow and learn, not plot to murder their peers. What \nhappened in Colorado simply defies explanation or comprehension. During \ntrying times like this, we must fall back on our faith. Our faith in \nGod, and family, and community. Our beliefs have been shaken, and we \nmust rely on each other and trust that the Lord will help see us \nthrough the confusing darkness that has descended on our Nation after \nthis terrible catastrophe.\n  A similar tragedy occurred at a high school in Paducah less than a \nyear and a half ago. Unfortunately, this is an experience that we in \nKentucky have been through and we grieve with our friends in Colorado. \nThe children of Colorado and their families will continue to be in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent \nresolution.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss the direction of our nation's dairy policy. When Congress \npassed the 1996 Farm Bill, we passed the most significant reform of our \nagricultural system since the Great Depression. In that bill, we \nordered USDA to update our outdated milk pricing laws--something that \nhad not happened for 60 years.\n  In taking these market oriented actions to drag dairy policy into--if \nnot the 21st century--at least the second half of the 20th century, \nCongress may have spoken more boldly that we were willing to act. \nCongress has tried to put the brakes on USDA's milk pricing reform \nefforts from the moment they began. And now, mere days after USDA \nannounced the reformed system, there are those who are seeking to \ninsulate their home states from it by legislating compacts to set the \nprice of milk artificially high in their regions.\n  These actions cannot stand. Though I understand my colleagues desire \nto protect the dairy farmers in their regions, I cannot let them do so \nat the expense of the productive dairy farmers in the upper Midwest--or \nat the expense of a national milk pricing system that, for the first \ntime in sixty years, is market oriented and fair.\n  Expanding the anti-competitive Northeast dairy compact would \nregionalize the dairy industry and institutionalize market distorting, \nartificially high prices in one area of the country--just as the rest \nof the country is moving toward a simplified and more equitable system.\n  Dairy markets are truly national in nature. My region of the country, \nthe Upper Midwest, has learned this lesson all too well. We have seen \nour competitive dairy industry decline, damaged by the distortion \ncaused by an outmoded milk marketing order system. That system requires \nthat higher prices be paid to producers the farther they are from \nWisconsin. Sixty years ago, when the Upper Midwest was the hub of dairy \nproduction and the rest of the country lagged far behind, this regional \ndiscrimination had some justification. It encouraged the development of \na dairy industry capable of producing a local supply of fluid milk in \nevery region. But today, that goal is largely accomplished, and the \ncontinuation of the discriminatory pricing policy serves only to fuel \nthe decline of the dairy industry in the Midwest.\n  The new system proposed by USDA is not all that we in the Upper \nMidwest would want. But it is an improvement in the current system, and \na move toward a national compromise on this divisive issue. It is a \nstep forward.\n  The legislation introduced today to continue the Northeast Dairy \ncompact is just the opposite--a step backwards. It would remove a \nregion from the new national dairy pricing system and move toward a \nBalkanized dairy policy. It hurts consumers in the affected region--\nconsumers who will pay artificially high prices for their milk. And it \nhurts our hopes of achieving long-overdue unity on dairy pricing \nreforms that are fair and good for all regions of the country.\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose the expansion of regional milk \npricing cartels like the Northeast Compact, and I ask my colleagues to \ndo the same. Lets enter the next millennium with a dairy policy that is \nmarket-oriented and consumer friendly--not one that ties us to the \nunjustified protectionism and unnecessary inequities of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4247-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATING MISSOURI HOME EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as a parent and former teacher, it is a \nprivilege for me to be able to recognize Missouri home schoolers, who \nwill observe Missouri Home Education Week during May 2-8, 1999.\n  Home schooling has been legal in Missouri since the state's founding \nin 1821. Since that time, and especially in the last two decades, home \nschoolers have faced numerous challenges and successes.\n  Fortunately, legislators are increasingly recognizant of the \nimportance of local decision-making and parental involvement in our \nchildren's education. Home Education Week reminds us that parents are \nthe first and best educators of their children. Study after study has \nshown that parental involvement is the most important factor in a \nchild's academic achievement.\n  It is, therefore, appropriate that we celebrate Home Education Week \nby acknowledging the hard work, dedication, and commitment to academic \nexcellence of the more than 4,300 home school families in my home \nstate. Recently, the Washington Post lauded the academic achievement of \nthese families. The Post article describes a study of home-schooled \nchildren, stating that they ``score well above the national median on \nstandardized tests [and] often study above their normal grade level.''\n  It was an honor for me to proclaim Missouri's first Home Education \nWeek in 1989. Now, in 1999, I look forward to the continued success of \nMissouri home school families, and to working with them to promote the \nkind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in \nguiding the course of their children's education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4247-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4247-S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANTITRUST SUITS AND SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles \nwritten by Karen Kerrigan and Raymond J. Keating of the Small Business \nSurvival Committee, along with a letter addressed from Karen Kerrigan \nto certain Members of Congress, be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Small Business Survival Committee, or SBSC, is a \nnonpartisan, nonprofit small business advocacy group with more than \n50,000 members. These materials give a small business perspective on \nrecent actions of the Department of Justice's Antitrust division, and \nof the action against Microsoft in particular.\n  As the SBSC point out, we are in an era of renewed activism on the \npart of the Antitrust Division. Since 1994 that Division has pursued \nmore than 274 antitrust cases. The Antitrust Division was set up to \nprotect consumers and our free enterprise system. But these materials \ndemonstrate that it is questionable whether this new activism is in \nfact helpful to small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  In particular, the SBSC questions whether the government's action \nagainst Microsoft, along with the concomitant actions of the state \nattorneys general, will not actually hurt small businesses and \nentrepreneurs who have profited from Microsoft's innovative practice. \nWorse, significant harm may be done to our ability to compete and to \nour very system of free enterprise, by the draconian measures being put \nforward in these talks.\n  Breaking up Microsoft or worse yet subjecting it and its suppliers to \ngovernment approved contracting procedures will destroy business \nflexibility and substitute bureaucratic empire-building for free market \ncompetition as the force behind new initiatives. This would be tragic \nfor all Americans as it would deny us the economic growth, innovation \nand freedom that open competition has provided for so long.\n  I hope my colleagues will study these and other materials as we \nconsider the proper course for antitrust law in our political and \neconomic systems.\n\n             [From the Business Journal, January 18, 1999]\n\n              Big Antitrust Cases Will Hurt `Little Guys'\n\n                           (By Karen Kenigan)\n\n       Small-business owners seldom go running to the federal \n     government for protection when competition threatens their \n     market position.\n       But that, unfortunately, has become the strategy for some \n     big businesses who see their market share eroding due to \n     aggressive competition from a rival.\n       The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is \n     currently being used by America's top CEOs who give up on the \n     marketplace, essentially using the government as a temporary \n     cushion against bleeding market share.\n       But make no mistake, due to the desperate pleadings of such \n     big corporations, small businesses as consumers, suppliers--\n     and even competitors--of successful big companies under \n     attack will suffer from this excessive meddling in the \n     marketplace.\n       Headed by Joel Klein, the antitrust division is operating \n     with renewed vigor. If you care to take a look at Justice's \n     web site, it proudly lists more than 274 antitrust cases \n     brought by the U.S. government since December 1994 (along \n     with amicus curiae briefs in 31 other cases).\n       ``The criteria for antitrust investigations or lawsuits \n     seems to be if a company merges or wildly succeeds, then it \n     may be ripe for antitrust action. When government moves \n     against successful businesses, the entrepreneurial sector of \n     the economy pays a price, too,'' said Small Business Survival \n     Committee chief economist Raymond Keating.\n       Keating argues that antitrust actions generally seek to \n     supplant the wisdom of consumers with government regulators \n     as the final arbiter to protect politically connected \n     businesses that fail to adequately compete. He says small \n     businesses that have gained from the success and innovation \n     of companies under attack--Microsoft Corp. being a good \n     example--will ultimately lose from aggressive antitrust \n     action.\n       Most troublesome is the permanent damage inflicted on the \n     company under attack and the impact on its small-business \n     suppliers.\n       Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman recently said \n     that the companies of Silicon Valley that encouraged Justice \n     action against Microsoft are displaying ``suicidal'' \n     behavior. The door has been opened for new regulations in an \n     ``industry relatively free from government intrusions,'' he \n     warned the industry at a CATO-sponsored event.\n       A new period has dawned in corporate America where some \n     feel safe running to the government for protection and solace \n     rather than responding to competition with better ways to \n     serve consumers.\n       An activist antitrust division has helped to fuel this \n     rather co-dependent behavior. Its doors are thrust open to \n     all pleaders who wish to use the government to sideline or \n     district the competition. A costly government investigation \n     is one way to put the best brains of a business competitor \n     into nonproductive status, warding off potential bad press \n     and other fallouts that often accompany an antitrust \n     challenge.\n       The government's pursuit of Microsoft is a bogus venture, \n     according to Citizens Against Government Waste. In October, \n     the group released a survey that showed 83 percent of the \n     public views the case against Microsoft as a waste of federal \n     and state taxpayer funds.\n       ``With new evidence every day of the weakness in the \n     government's case, it's only a matter of whether the \n     government wants to wait 13 years, as it did in the IBM \n     case,'' said CAGW president Tom Schatz.\n       According to the antitrust division's own literature, its \n     work is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers and \n     our system of free enterprise. What's becoming more clear is \n     that its work is doing much more to thwart competition by \n     protecting whiny competitors at the expense of free \n     enterprise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From Small Business Reg Watch, December 1998]\n\n                    Is Antitrust Anti-Entrepreneur?\n\n                        (By Raymond J. Keating)\n\n       Once again, merger activity in the U.S. economy has \n     accelerated. Among the proposed or consummated corporate \n     marriages of 1998 are Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz, \n     American Online Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp., \n     Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust Co., Unum Corp, and \n     Provident Cos., Tyco International Ltd. and AMP Inc., MCI \n     Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc., Cargill Inc. and \n     Continental Grain Co., Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., \n     Wells Fargo & Co. and Northwest Corp., AT Corp. and \n     TeleCommunications Inc., Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp., along \n     with a host of others.\n       Of course, such mergers raise the antennae of government \n     antitrust regulations at the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) \n     and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These days, however, \n     it does not seem to take very much to get the attention of \n     the rather activist antitrust division headed by Joel Klein \n     at the DoJ. Indeed, at the DoJ's website, the antitrust \n     division lists 274 antitrust cases brought by the U.S. \n     government since December 1994, along with Amicus Curiae \n     briefs in 31 other cases.\n       And a proposed merger certainly is not required to warrant \n     antitrust attention. For example, an antitrust case was filed \n     in early October 1998 against Visa USA and Master-Card \n     International. The FTC has filed suit against Intel Corp. And \n     of course, DoJ is now in court against Microsoft Corp.\n       The criteria for antitrust investigations or lawsuits seems \n     to be if a company merges or wildly succeeds, then it may be \n     ripe for antitrust action. Of course, this problem springs \n     from the combination of vague legislation (i.e., primarily \n     the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914) with \n     zealous government lawyers and regulators.\n       While at first glance the issue of antitrust may seem \n     remote to most small businesses and entrepreneurs, it does \n     have an impact on and should be a concern to the \n     entrepreneurial sector of our economy. In general, antitrust \n     actions are anti-entrepreneur, and the reasons go far beyond \n     the basic idea that the next Microsoft lurks among today's \n     small or start-up firms, and will some day have to face the \n     wrath of antitrust regulators.\n       Entrepreneurs as Consumers. Perhaps most obviously, small \n     businesses are affected by antitrust regulation in their role \n     as consumers. For example, small businesses are customers in \n     almost every industry touched by antitrust actions--from \n     telecommunications to computers to gasoline to grain to the \n     Internet.\n       Any time our most successful businesses come under \n     regulatory assault, consumers are bound to lose. Entangle \n     companies in antitrust litigation and resources are diverted \n     away from serving consumers, and instead put toward battling \n     the government. Just ask IBM. The increased costs of \n     government arrogantly overruling decisions made in the \n     marketplace ultimately fall on the backs of consumers. After \n     all, the consumer acts as final judge and jury in the \n     marketplace. They ultimately decide the success or failure of \n     mergers, who gains market share, and who loses market share. \n     Transfer this power to government bureaucrats, and \n     consumers--including small businesses--obviously suffer.\n       Entrepreneurs as Suppliers. In addition, government \n     overriding the wisdom of millions of individuals in the \n     marketplace directly hurts small business and entrepreneurs \n     who supply goods and services to the firm under antitrust \n     assault. Businesses who serve customers well and gain market \n     share as a result, or those pulling off successful mergers, \n     create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small \n     enterprises. Consultants, construction businesses, food \n     services, dry cleaners, retail stores, and seemingly \n     countless other suppliers grow up around these larger \n     businesses. These smaller businesses inevitably get hit with \n     the fallout from an antitrust attack on the larger companies.\n       Entrepreneurs as Competitors. Some might believe that \n     smaller enterprises favor antitrust action as a means to \n     hobble a dominant competitor. In fact, an overwhelming number \n     of antitrust assaults begin with a faltering or less \n     efficient firm trying to get the government to impede their \n     successful competitor.\n       However, this most certainly is a case against antitrust \n     action, not for it. The only possible beneficiary would be \n     the firm seeking government protection, and any resulting \n     advantage for that business would at\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n     best be temporary as the market would still be working to \n     weed out inefficiencies and reveal their shortcomings--and \n     justifiably so.\n       In general, the entrepreneurial sector of the economy gains \n     nothing by having government step in and punish success, or \n     dictate which companies are allowed to merge.\n       Entrepreneurs vs. Regulators. Indeed, any further \n     empowerment of regulators does not serve the over-regulated \n     entrepreneur at all. Government stepping in and dictating \n     business practices, assaulting efforts to gain market share, \n     and punishing success goes far in shaking the confidence in \n     and of business. Under such circumstances, the business \n     environment becomes inclement for all. And one can easily \n     envision robust antitrust regulation spilling into other \n     regulatory arenas.\n       Entrepreneurs and Economics. The fundamental problem with \n     antitrust regulation is that it rests on unsound economics. \n     In reality, the economy is not the sterile, neat model of \n     perfect competition taught in economics textbooks and desired \n     by government lawyers. Instead, it is a tumultuous, ongoing \n     struggle among enterprises to create temporary monopolies \n     through innovation, invention and efficiencies. Those \n     temporary monopolies are subsequently attacked and surpassed \n     by competitors. Entrepreneurs, unlike many in government, \n     understand this rivalry between current and future \n     competitors.\n       Indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to think of a \n     true monopoly--i.e., one supplier in an industry with no real \n     or close substitutes--ever emerging from the competitive \n     marketplace. Where true monopolies have existed, it was the \n     government that either created, aided, or protected it (e.g., \n     telephony, electricity, and education). The vaunted idea of \n     predatory pricing--whereby a business lowers it prices below \n     cost in order to destroy competitors, monopolize the market, \n     and then hike prices dramatically--fails the reality test. \n     It's never happened. The potential losses such a strategy \n     would have to incur would be enormous and unpredictable. And \n     even if it were to eventually succeed, consumers would have \n     benefited enormously, and subsequent price increases would \n     bring competitors back into the market.\n       Antitrust regulation at its core is contradictory. It \n     purports to protect consumers from evil monopolies and so-\n     called ``anti-competitive activity,'' but it is, in fact, \n     consumers who make the final decisions in the market. In this \n     light, antitrust regulation is revealed to be little more \n     than another elitist government effort to protect us from \n     ourselves. Antitrust actions generally seek to supplant the \n     consumer with the government regulator as final arbiter in \n     order to protect politically connected businesses who fail to \n     adequately compete.\n       In the end, small businesses and entrepreneurs are not \n     immune to the costs of government antitrust activism. None of \n     us are.\n\n                               Exhibit 1.\n\n\n                            Small Business Survival Committee,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     U.S. House of Representative, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Hastert and Senator Lott: The Small Business \n     Survival Committee (SBSC), a nonpartisan, nonprofit small \n     business advocacy group with more than 50,000 members, is \n     very concerned about the growing antitrust activism exhibited \n     by the U.S. Department of Justice. It often seems that an \n     antitrust regulatory assault is launched simply because a \n     business has served consumers well, become successful, and/or \n     frustrated its competitors who now seek political remedies to \n     their own economic challenges.\n       SBSC believes this is the case with the current antitrust \n     assault against the Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft is the \n     most successful U.S. company in recent memory. The firm \n     gained market share by serving consumers well, not, for \n     example, through any kind of government assistance. One would \n     think that such a U.S. business exhibiting such global \n     leadership would be praised, not punished.\n       You may be wondering, why should small business be \n     concerned about the welfare of corporate giants and their \n     battles with DoJ? As the attached report points out, what \n     eventually happens with these various antitrust cases will \n     have a dramatic impact on small businesses both as consumers \n     and as entrepreneurs. I would even argue that renewed DoJ \n     activism has helped to embolden the regulatory spirit, \n     across-the-board, within the federal government.\n       What eventually happens with the Microsoft case-Whether it \n     be more regulation, or one or more of the various \n     ``remedies'' that have been publicly floated and discussed \n     (most recently by the state AG's)--will have a deep and long-\n     lasting impact on the high-tech industry. Small businesses, \n     entrepreneurs and their workforce will be the ultimate \n     losers--not to mention the economy and all consumers. The \n     ``remedies'' being discussed by opponents of Microsoft, as \n     well as the wish-list drawn up by the attorneys general who \n     have joined the federal government's lawsuit are draconian-\n     plain and simple. As a country whose free enterprise system \n     has made the United States the envy of the world, SBSC is \n     both ashamed and disturbed that these ``remedies'' are even \n     being discussed.\n       The very notion of monopoly or monopoly power in today's \n     dynamic, extremely fluid computer market is rather \n     preposterous. Make no mistake, Microsoft competes against \n     current, emerging and future competitors. Does anyone \n     seriously doubt that it Microsoft slips and does not stay at \n     the cutting edge. It will falter just like any business in a \n     highly competitive industry?\n       In the accompanying materials, SBSC discusses many of these \n     antitrust issues, as well as others. I particularly draw your \n     attention to the report by our chief economist Raymond J. \n     Keating which asks the question ``Is Antitrust Anti-\n     Entrepreneur?'' The answer, as you shall see, is ``yes.''\n       Finally, I would like to mention two recent articles in the \n     Seattle Times and New York Times which report on a wish list \n     of punishments against Microsoft contemplated by the state \n     attorneys general. I say the least, these are quite \n     disturbing.\n       The 19 state attorneys general who joined the federal \n     government's misguided antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft \n     are considering several punishments if the government's \n     lawsuit succeeds, including breaking the company into two or \n     three parts based on product lines, breaking the company into \n     three equal parts with each possessing Microsoft's source \n     code and intellectual property, or forcing the company to \n     license or auction off its Windows trademark and source code \n     to other companies. Other proposals reportedly under \n     consideration include extensive fines, giving government \n     regulators ongoing access to the company's e-mail and \n     documents, that Microsoft seek government approval before \n     acquiring any software company, and forced standardization of \n     Microsoft contracts.\n       These would be outrageous governmental intrusions into one \n     of the top U.S. businesses in the world. If carried out, the \n     precedents set for current and future businesses would be \n     quite dangerous.\n       Unfrotunately, Microsoft has been cornered into a quagmire \n     that no American company should be forced into by its own \n     government. From our perspective the ``settlement talks'' now \n     taking place are a bogus set up against Microsoft. Having \n     approached ``settlement'' with reasonable alternatives to the \n     draconian regulations and ``remedies'' sought by those \n     hounding the company, the federal government and attorneys \n     general will undoubtedly portray Microsoft as \n     ``unreasonable'' and ``greedy'' because they will not forsake \n     principles that could cause long-term damage to the industry. \n     Of course, they owe their biggest competitors nothing since \n     they are the ones who instigated the suit and prodded the DoJ \n     in the first place.\n       This good-old boy gang up by the government and \n     participating AG's is a farce and a waste of tax dollars. \n     They have lost perspective, and their law-enforcement \n     priorities are horribly misplaced.\n       I urge Members of Congress to review the following \n     materials, and take a close look at current antitrust \n     policies, which work against entrepreneurship, business, U.S. \n     economic leadership and consumers. We believe the Congress \n     has the obligation to ask why the DoJ is placing such a \n     priority on the ``get Microsoft'' effort when more important \n     law enforcement issues appear to be in the greater national \n     interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4249-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4249-S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DAIRY COMPACTS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to \nlegislation introduced today by my colleagues Senator Jeffords, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Cochran and Senator Specter. They have introduced a \nmeasure which will further aggravate the inequities of the Federal Milk \nMarketing Order system. Their legislation will make permanent and \nexpand the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and will authorize the \nestablishment of a southern dairy compact.\n  Despite the discrimination against dairy farmers in Wisconsin under \nthe Federal Dairy policy known as the Eau Claire rule, the 1996 Farm \nBill provided the final nail in the coffin when it created and \nauthorized for 3-years, the existence of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sounded benign in 1996, \nbut its effect has been anything but, magnifying the existing \ninequities of the system.\n  The bill which authorized the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact \nestablished a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, \nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. This \ncommission set minimum prices for fluid milk higher even than those \nestablished under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Never mind that the \nFederal milk marketing order system, under the Eau Claire rule, already \nprovided farmers in the region with minimum prices higher than those \nreceived by most other dairy farmers throughout the nation.\n  The compact, which controlled three percent of the country's milk, \nnot only\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nallowed the six States to set artificially high prices for their \nproducers, it allowed them to block entry of lower priced milk from \nproducers in competing States. To give them an even bigger advantage, \nprocessors in the region get a subsidy to export their higher priced \nmilk to noncompact States. It's a windfall for Northeast dairy farmers. \nIt's also plainly unfair and unjust to the rest of the country.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (NEIDC) is set \nto expire at the implementation of USDA's new Federal Milk Market Order \nsystem. According to the Omnibus Appropriations measure passed last \nyear, the expiration date of the NEIDC is scheduled for October 1, \n1999. Now, Members of Congress are pushing for an extension and \nexpansion of the existing milk cartel and for the authorization of \nanother.\n  To make clear the magnitude of this legislation on producers and \nconsumers we need to only look at the numbers. Currently, three percent \nof milk is under a compact, conceivably, under this new measure, over \n40% of this country's milk will be affected. More importantly, one \nhundred percent of this country's milk prices will be affected--in \nWisconsin, prices will be adversely affected.\n  These compacts amount to nothing short of government-sponsored price \nfixing. They are unfair, and bad policy. Now, my colleagues would like \nyou to make this compact permanent, expand it to include other states, \nand authorize a southern dairy compact. After three years, we know that \ndairy compacts:\n  Blatantly interfere with interstate commerce and wildly distort the \nmarketplace by erecting artificial barriers around one specially \nprotected region of the Nation;\n  Arbitrarily provide preferential price treatment for farmers in the \nNortheast at the expense of farmers in other regions who work just as \nhard, who love their homes just as much and whose products are just as \ngood--maybe better in Wisconsin;\n  Irresponsibly encourage excess milk production in one region without \nestablishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts basic \neconomic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will drive \ndown milk prices for producers everywhere else in the country;\n  Raises retail milk prices on the millions of consumers in the Compact \nregion;\n  Imposes higher costs on every taxpayer because we all pay for \nnutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch \nprograms that provide milk and other dairy products.\n  As a price-fixing device, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was \nunprecedented in the history of this Nation. As a dairy cartel, it is a \npoor legislative fix and bad precedent to deal with low milk prices.\n  Wisconsin's dairy farmers are being economically crippled by federal \ndairy policies. It's time to bring justice to federal dairy policy, and \ngive Wisconsin Dairy farmers a fair shot in the market place.\n  I urge my colleagues not to buy into the rhetoric surrounding this \nissue. I urge you to work together towards fair national dairy policy. \nA policy that provides all dairy producers a fair price for their \ncommodity, a policy that allows all of this country's dairy producers \nto succeed on the basis of hard work and a good product.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and to join me in the \nfight against its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4250-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4250-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER RELATIVE TO RESERVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n        FORCES TO ACTIVE DUTY--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I have today, pursuant to section 12304 of title 10, United States \nCode, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of \nTransportation with respect to the Coast Guard, when it is not \noperating as a service within the Department of the Navy, under their \nrespective jurisdictions, to order to active duty any units, and any \nindividual members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, \nof the Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual Ready Reserve \nmobilizations category and designated essential under regulations \nprescribed by the Secretary concerned.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas; to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1617\n\n       Whereas, By act of Congress, each state is invited to \n     provide and furnish statues, not exceeding two in number, of \n     deceased persons who have been citizens thereof and \n     illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished \n     civic or military services, such as the state shall determine \n     to be worthy of national commemoration in a national statuary \n     hall; and\n       Whereas, The state of Kansas has had one citizen, Dwight \n     David Eisenhower, who stands alone in the history of this \n     state in achievement of a distinguished career in both the \n     civic and military services, a man whose destiny led him from \n     a boyhood home in Abilene, Kansas, to lead the armies of his \n     nation and those of the free world in one of the greatest and \n     most historic military engagements of all time and to lead \n     the people of his nation in peace as the 34th president of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, Dwight David Eisenhower, citizen of Kansas, \n     General of the Army, President of the United States and \n     honored and respected friend of presidents, kings and leaders \n     and peoples of the free world is eminently worthy of national \n     commemoration in a national statuary hall; and\n       Whereas, The state of Kansas in years past did provide for \n     the placing of two statues of distinguished citizens of \n     Kansas in statuary hall; and\n       Whereas, One of such statues is of the Honorable George W. \n     Glick, a man who although he did not hold national office or \n     win national or international acclaim, was a most honored and \n     distinguished governor and legislative and civic leader in \n     the state of Kansas; and\n       Whereas, Governor Glick can best be honored by locating his \n     statue in a place of honor in the capitol of the state of \n     Kansas where it may be enjoyed by our citizens and visitors; \n     and\n       Whereas, The people of the state of Kansas wish to furnish \n     a statue of Dwight David Eisenhower for placement in Statuary \n     Hall in the capitol of this nation, with such statue \n     hopefully being provided by the citizens of the state of \n     Kansas through the efforts of the Eisenhower Foundation, \n     Inc.; and\n       Whereas, The creation of the statue of Dwight David \n     Eisenhower depends upon the willingness of the trustees of \n     the Eisenhower Foundation, Inc. to organize a solicitation \n     through appropriate representatives of the civic, fraternal \n     and patriotic organizations of this state and the handling by \n     such trustees of the funds so solicited; and\n       Whereas, A suitable statue of Dwight David Eisenhower must \n     be created by a gifted and experienced sculptor who should be \n     chosen by a committee of select persons suitably qualified to \n     recommend the selection of such sculptor, and the trustees of \n     the Eisenhower Foundation should name such a select \n     commission; and\n       Whereas, When an appropriate sculptor has been selected to \n     create the statue of Dwight David Eisenhower, the trustees of \n     the Eisenhower Foundation, Inc. would be suitable to contract \n     with the sculptor with funds obtained as indicated in this \n     preamble for the creation of such a statue; and\n       Whereas, When the statue of Dwight David Eisenhower is \n     completed, necessary plans need to be made and action needs \n     to be taken to transport the statue to Washington, D.C. for \n     installation in Statuary Hall and for the return of Governor \n     Glick's statue to Kansas for installation in the state \n     capitol in Topeka; and\n       Whereas, Should the Eisenhower Foundation, Inc. be unable \n     or unwilling to perform the functions described in this \n     preamble, the responsibility for the creation and \n     installation of the statue of Dwight David Eisenhower should \n     be assumed by the Kansas Department of Commerce and Housing; \n     and\n       Whereas, Kansas has another hero, Amelia Earhart, a native \n     of Atchison, who as a pioneer for women in aviation lost her \n     life under still unknown circumstances, as is a Kansas worthy \n     of recognition by placing a statue of her in Statuary Hall. \n     Further, it is appropriate that the statute of Amelia Earhart \n     be substituted for that of another Atchison native, former \n     U.S. Senator John James Ingalls, whose statute should be \n     returned to Kansas for an appropriate placement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, That the legislature of \n     the state of Kansas respectfully requests that the Congress \n     of the United States return the statute of George W. Glick \n     earlier presented by the state of Kansas for placement in \n     Statuary Hall and accept in return, for placement in Statuary \n     Hall, a statue of Dwight David Eisenhower, a citizen of the \n     free world, and worthy of national commemoration in Statuary \n     Hall; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the legislature of the state \n     of Kansas, on behalf of the people of this state and on \n     behalf of this state itself, respectfully requests the \n     trustees of the Eisenhower Foundation, Inc. to appoint a \n     commission of representatives of civic, fraternal and \n     patriotic organizations of this state, and to convey to such \n     commission a charge to organize a solicitation for funds for \n     the creation of a statue of Dwight David Eisenhower as \n     contemplated by this resolution. Such trustees are further \n     requested to provide management assistance to such commission \n     and to receive and employ the funds so obtained to acquire \n     such statue for placement in Statuary Hall in the capitol of \n     this nation. Such trustees are further requested to appoint a \n     committee of persons suitably qualified to select a gifted \n     and experienced sculptor to create a suitable statue of \n     Dwight David Eisenhower. Such trustees are further requested \n     to contract with such sculptor with funds obtained as \n     indicated in this resolution for the creation of such statue. \n     Thereupon such trustees are further requested to make the \n     statue so created of Dwight David Eisenhower available for \n     placement in Statuary hall, the same to then be owned by the \n     Congress of the United States; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the City of Atchison and the \n     Atchison Chamber of Commerce should be tasked to find funds \n     for the costs of the creation, transportation and \n     installation of the statue of Amelia Earhart in Statuary Hall \n     and for returning the statute of Senator Ingalls to Kansas; \n     and\n       Be it further resolved, That should be efforts of the \n     Eisenhower Foundation, Inc. and the commission of \n     representatives of civic, fraternal and patriotic \n     organizations of this state be unable to fulfill the object \n     of this resolution, and the City of Atchison and the Atchison \n     Chamber of Commerce be unable to successfully fund the \n     placement of a statue of Amelia Earhart in Statuary Hall and \n     transporting the statue of Senator Ingalls back to Kansas, \n     the Kansas Department of Commerce and Housing is tasked to \n     take action ultimately providing a statue of Dwight David \n     Eisenhower and Amelia Earhart for placement in Statuary Hall; \n     and\n       Be it further resolved, That the cost of the creation of \n     the statue of Dwight David Eisenhower, as well as the costs \n     for transporting the statue of Dwight David Eisenhower to \n     Washington, D.C. and transporting the statue of Governor \n     Glick to the state capitol in Topeka, plus incidental costs \n     for installation of statues in their permanent locations and \n     the essential costs of any unveiling ceremonies should be \n     borne by the state of Kansas through the use of private or \n     public funds; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the secretary of state is \n     directed to transmit enrolled copies of this resolution to \n     the President of the Senate of the United States, the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives of the United States, each \n     member of the Kansas delegation in the Congress of the United \n     States, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the state of \n     Kansas and to each of the trustees of the Eisenhower \n     Foundation, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-40. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Vermont; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                         Joint House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Veterans' Administration (VA) hospitals provide \n     medical care for veterans, including men and women, who have \n     risked their lives to protect the security of our nation, and\n       Whereas, the mission of the White River Junction VAMROC is \n     to ``serve veterans and their families in a proficient, \n     dependable and compassionate manner within an environment \n     that focuses on quality health care, benefits & services, \n     research & education and support of the Department of \n     Defense,'' and\n       Whereas, in 1932, White River Junction was chosen by the \n     Veterans' Administration as a site for a regional hospital \n     which was then built on a 176-acre site donated by the Town \n     of Hartford for that purpose, and\n       Whereas, building 1 was completed in 1938 and successive \n     buildings have been built and the facility and its services \n     have been continuously expanded and improved since that date, \n     and\n       Whereas, the White River Junction VAMROC has steadfastly \n     provided quality health care and efficient benefit \n     administration to veterans who have served with dedication \n     and courage to protect and defend the United States, and has \n     provided solace and community to veterans and their families, \n     and\n       Whereas, the White River Junction VAMROC has developed into \n     an outstanding teaching hospital, utilizing cutting edge \n     technology, and is an essential source of learning \n     opportunities for medical students and physicians in training \n     in a northern New England teaching hospital with the \n     potential to encourage rural physician placement, and\n       Whereas, the White River Junction VAMROC has developed into \n     a premier research facility, conducting studies on Gulf War \n     illnesses, and delivery of cost-effective outpatient \n     services, and\n       Whereas, the current and possible future funding reductions \n     threaten to harm vital\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\n     infrastructures that are indispensable for optimal patient \n     care such as the in-patient surgical unit, anesthesia staff, \n     medicine and psychiatry units, and\n       Whereas, the current financial crisis at the White River \n     Junction VAMROC may be mitigated if new and creative funding \n     options were explored, including innovative research on the \n     delivery of health services to veterans, and\n       Whereas, the priority of serving veterans must be absolute \n     and irrevocable, and must be the foundation for medical care \n     at this hospital, regardless of any new models of health care \n     delivery, and\n       Whereas, any eliminated services would be very difficult \n     and costly to replace or restart and would threaten the level \n     of care of other services of both in-patient and out-patient \n     units, now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives, That \n     the General Assembly urgently requests that the United States \n     Congress maintain stable and permanent funding of the White \n     River Junction VAMROC, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Governor and the Vermont Congressional \n     Delegation, are urgently requested to support the White River \n     Junction VAMROC to strengthen its capacity to provide \n     Vermont's veterans with medical care and benefit services, to \n     serve as a premier teaching facility, and to engage in \n     essential research of benefits to veterans and the practice \n     of medicine in Vermont, and be it further\n       Resolved, That Vermont's Congressional Delegation in \n     conjunction with the Veterans' Administration and veteran \n     service organizations are requested to investigate the \n     broadening of the White River Junction VAMROC patient base, \n     provided that the priority of serving Veterans remains \n     absolute and irrevocable, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be directed to send a \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, William Jefferson Clinton, Vice President Albert \n     Gore, Veterans' Administration Secretary Togo D. West, Jr., \n     Vermont Governor Howard Dean, New Hampshire Governor Jean \n     Shaheen, New Hampshire Senate President Clesson Blaisdell, \n     New Hampshire House Speaker Donna Sytek, to each member of \n     the Vermont and New Hampshire Congressional Delegation, and \n     to all Veterans' organizations registered with the State \n     Veterans' Affairs Office at 118 State Street, Montpelier, VT.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-41. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of North Dakota; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 3039\n\n       Whereas, employers pay a federal employment security tax \n     under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [68A Stat. 439; 26 \n     U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] as a payroll tax that produces revenue \n     dedicated solely to use in the federal-state employment \n     security system; and\n       Whereas, employers' payroll taxes pay for administering the \n     employment security system; providing veterans' reemployment \n     assistance, and producing labor market information to assist \n     in matching workers' skills with the employment needs of \n     employers; and\n       Whereas, congressional appropriations have remained flat in \n     Wagner-Peyser funding, despite adequate availability of funds \n     from dedicated employer taxes because the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act accounts are used for federal budget \n     deficit reduction; and\n       Whereas, congressional appropriations have not kept pace \n     with fixed costs of operating the employment security system, \n     creating problems similar to the problems the gas tax creates \n     for transportation; and\n       Whereas, states cannot support an infrastructure to \n     administer the employment security system, provide veterans' \n     reemployment assistance, and produce labor market \n     information, without adequate, predictable resources; and\n       Whereas, delivering services with inadequate federal \n     funding is a major challenge facing the State of North Dakota \n     and Job Service North Dakota: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of North Dakota, \n     the Senate concurring therein, That the Fifty-sixth \n     Legislative Assembly urges the Congress of the United States \n     to enact legislation to return adequate funds to states to \n     fund the employment security system and give a fair return to \n     employers for the taxes employers pay under the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the Secretary of State send \n     copies of this resolution to the Speaker and Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, to the President Pro \n     Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, to the \n     news media of North Dakota, and to each member of the North \n     Dakota Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-42. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the state of Maine; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Joint Resolution No. 1388\n\n       Whereas, We your Memorialists, the Members of the One \n     Hundred and Nineteenth Legislature of the State of Maine, now \n     assembled, in the First Regular Session, most respectfully \n     present and petition the President of the United States and \n     the United States Congress, as follows:\n       Whereas, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination \n     of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women was adopted by \n     the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979, \n     became an international treaty on September 3, 1981 and as of \n     December 1997 has been ratified or acceded to by 161 nations; \n     and\n       Whereas, although the United States is considered a world \n     leader in human rights, supports and has a position of \n     leadership in the United Nations, was an active participant \n     in the drafting and is a signatory of the convention, the \n     United States is one of the few nations that have not \n     ratified the treaty; and\n       Whereas, the spirit of the convention is rooted in the \n     goals of the United Nations and the United States, which seek \n     to affirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \n     and worth of the person and in the equal rights of men and \n     women; and\n       Whereas, the convention provides a comprehensive framework \n     for challenging the various forces that have created and \n     sustained discrimination based on sex against half of the \n     world's population and the 161 nations that have ratified the \n     convention have agreed to follow the convention \n     prescriptions; and\n       Whereas, although women have made major gains in the \n     struggle for equality in social, business, political, legal \n     and educational fields, there is much more to be \n     accomplished; and through its support, leadership and \n     prestige, the United States can help create a world where \n     women are no longer discriminated against and have achieved \n     one of the most fundamental of human rights, equality; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, request the President \n     of the United States and the United States Congress to ratify \n     the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \n     of Discrimination Against Women; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable William J. Clinton, President of the United \n     States; the President of the United States Senate; the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States; \n     the President of the Senate or the equivalent officer in the \n     49 other states; the Speaker of the House or the equivalent \n     officer in the 49 other states; the United Nations Secretary-\n     General, Kofi Annan; and each member of the Maine \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-43. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, The veterans who are treated at the Iron Mountain \n     VA Medical Care Facility (VAMCF) have served our country with \n     extreme dedication. They are deserving of our respect and \n     care every day, not just on Veterans Day. We urge \n     administrators and directors at the Veterans Affairs Health \n     Administration to prevent the implementation of a policy that \n     would greatly reduce the level of quality health care \n     services for our veterans, especially in the Upper Peninsula \n     and northern Wisconsin; and\n       Whereas, The Iron Mountain VA Medical Care Facility covers \n     a patient service area of over 25,000 square miles. Veterans \n     from the Upper Peninsula and northern Wisconsin depend on the \n     full range of services provided by this facility. It is \n     callous to ask veterans suffering from illness to travel \n     approximately 300 miles (Sault Ste. Marie to Iron Mountain) \n     and then another 200 miles (Iron Mountain to Milwaukee) by \n     bus to receive care. This is what the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs is asking of our veterans in the Upper Peninsula. In \n     December of 1998, the VA bus broke down on the way to \n     Milwaukee with 34 veterans who needed care. A second bus was \n     called from Milwaukee to pick up the veterans and it also \n     broke down. This is not a situation that facilitates a return \n     to health; and\n       Whereas, There is a need for an increase of hospital beds \n     in Iron Mountain, not a decrease. Several years ago, this \n     hospital had approximately 200 beds. The decrease to the \n     current 17 beds far surpasses the national decrease of VA bed \n     utilization and places a tremendous hardship on our veterans \n     and their families; and\n       Whereas, By providing quality outpatient services to \n     veterans closer to their homes, the quality of care and the \n     number of veterans served has been substantially improved. It \n     does not make sense to reduce services to a facility that is \n     providing much needed and necessary services. It is wrong to \n     force our veterans to travel many hours, in harsh conditions, \n     away from their families, and more appropriate to continue to \n     provide the full range of services our veterans deserve at \n     the Iron Mountain VA Medical Care Facility: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the \n     Veterans Affairs Administration to prevent the reduction of \n     hospital bed capacity at the Iron Mountain Veterans \n     Administration Medical Care Facility; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, Dr. Togo West, Jr., \n     Secretary, Veterans Health Administration, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, \n     Undersecretary of Health, VA Administration, Dr. Hershel \n     Gober, Deputy Secretary for Health, VA Administration and Dr. \n     J.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n     Cummings, Regional VA Network Director, Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-44. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Montana; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                           Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, it is widely believed that the grizzly bear is \n     classified as ``threatened'' or ``endangered'' only as a \n     result of an arbitrary designation of habitat areas by the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and that the \n     grizzly bear is, in reality, neither ``threatened'' nor \n     ``endangered'' because the State of Montana successfully \n     maintained a viable, breeding population of grizzly bears for \n     years prior to the arbitrary USFWS classification; and\n       Whereas, grizzly bear populations continue to thrive, \n     breeding and maintaining their populations in suitable \n     habitat in other areas; and\n       Whereas, the habitat in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness is \n     considered to be an inadequate ecosystem for supporting \n     grizzly bears; and\n       Whereas, predation by grizzly bears is known to impose \n     uncompensated costs and hazards to livestock growers and \n     other citizens; and\n       Whereas, enforcement by federal agencies of arbitrary and \n     capricious rules and regulations devised to exclude any real \n     or imagined intrusion or disturbance to grizzly bears in \n     recovery areas has caused the loss of many millions of \n     dollars in personal and corporate income, the loss of many \n     jobs, the displacement of families, the loss of needed \n     revenue to the State of Montana, and the virtual closing of \n     large areas of national forest land in Montana to traditional \n     uses, such as lumbering, driving for pleasure, gathering \n     firewood, and berry picking; and\n       Whereas, the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank Church River-of-\n     No-Return wilderness complex is the only remaining wilderness \n     in the geographical area where wilderness travelers can \n     pursue a wilderness experience without fear of encountering \n     grizzly bears; and\n       Whereas, introduction of grizzly bears into the Selway-\n     Bitterroot Wilderness will complicate or further frustrate \n     efforts to increase populations of anadromous salmon that \n     traditionally spawn in the rivers and streams of the Selway-\n     Bitterroot Wilderness; and\n       Whereas, introduction of grizzly bears into the Selway-\n     Bitterroot and Frank Church River-of-No-Return wilderness \n     complex will further increase the rate of bear predation of \n     the northern Idaho elk herd, a herd that is an important \n     asset to outfitters, guides, and residents of western Montana \n     and northern Idaho; and\n       Whereas, social benefits derived from the bear introduction \n     program are drastically out of proportion to the costs to the \n     public of capturing, transporting, examining, releasing, \n     monitoring, and otherwise managing an introduced population \n     of grizzly bears, and those funds are more urgently needed to \n     help finance real and essential social programs; and\n       Whereas, programs undertaken under the authority of Public \n     Law 93-205, the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, \n     including the grizzly bear recovery program, place the lives, \n     property, and freedom of local citizens and visitors in \n     jeopardy of the wrath of the United States government in the \n     event of accidental or mistaken actions by citizens that \n     could be judged as infringement on a listed species or the \n     habitat of a listed species and further expand the body of \n     laws and regulations of which United States citizens might \n     become victims when applied: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana,\n       (1) That grizzly bears not be released into the Selway-\n     Bitterroot and Frank Church River-of-No-Return wilderness \n     complex as part of the federal grizzly bear recovery program.\n       (2) That control of grizzly bear populations by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service be ended and that the \n     management of grizzly bears within the borders of Montana and \n     Idaho be returned to the fish and wildlife agencies of those \n     respective states.\n       (3) That the grizzly bear be removed from the list of \n     threatened or endangered species, based on evidence of the \n     viability of grizzly bear populations in Montana, Idaho, \n     Wyoming, Alaska, and Canada.\n       (4) That if the United States government persists in its \n     proposal to introduce grizzly bears into the Selway-\n     Bitterroot and Frank Church River-of-No-Return wilderness \n     complex and succeeds in placing grizzly bears in those areas, \n     the United States government be held financially liable for \n     any damages to livestock and other domestic animals and to \n     property, for loss of life, and for personal injury arising \n     from the actions of the grizzly bears and of United States \n     government agents engaged in the grizzly bear recovery \n     program, including economic losses suffered by individuals or \n     communities as a result of actions related to the program.\n       (5) That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the members of the Montana and Idaho \n     Congressional Delegations, the Director of the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the United States \n     Senate, and the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-45. A resolution adopted by the House of Legislature of \n     the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, After considerable debate, Congress and the \n     administration agreed in 1998 to a transportation measure \n     that set place a formula for transportation spending. This \n     agreement provided that unanticipated revenues would go to \n     specific types of projects; and\n       Whereas, Historically low costs for gasoline have spurred a \n     significant increase in gas tax revenue. In addition to the \n     direct impact of the lower price per gallon while the tax per \n     gallon is constant, the glut of oil in the marketplace has \n     also encouraged the purchase and use of larger, less fuel \n     efficient vehicles. As a result, gas tax revenues are higher \n     than expected; and\n       Whereas, The administration has responded to the increased \n     money available by proposing several new programs. A great \n     number of these proposals are outside of the agreed upon \n     provisions for transportation spending. The proportions and \n     projects agreed upon provide a reliable tool for states in \n     projecting how to meet future needs. It would be wrong for \n     the federal government to ignore the agreement and the \n     ability of the states to fill transportation needs as best \n     serves their citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to refrain from divesting transportation money from \n     the purposes and formula already in place; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-46.

The 1998 multi-billion dollar settlement extends \n     over twenty-five years and includes the payment of money \n     directly to the states and to funds established to address \n     specific components of the settlement; and\n       Whereas, In the time since the settlement was reached, \n     federal officials have raised various proposals for the \n     federal government to claim portions of the settlement money. \n     This possibility prompted legislation in the 105th Congress \n     seeking to prohibit the federal government from seizing any \n     state tobacco settlement funds. Legislation has been \n     introduced in the 106th Congress, H.R. 351 and S. 346, to \n     safeguard the states' money by prohibiting the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services from considering this money \n     recoverable under Medicaid; and\n       Whereas, The settlement reached by the states and the \n     tobacco industry was the result of risks, expenses, and \n     initiatives of the states. They have every right to the funds \n     to cover state health damages and costs. In carrying out the \n     settlement provisions, the states must have the assurance \n     that there will not be impediments to the settlement from any \n     federal agency, including directives on how any of the funds \n     can be spent. There can be no cloud of uncertainty hanging \n     over the states as they project future activities in carrying \n     out the directives of the agreement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress to enact legislation to prohibit the \n     federal government from claiming any tobacco settlement money \n     from the states or directing how the states expend these \n     funds; and be it further\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       PM-48.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature requests the Congress to \n     enact legislation to keep the U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services from further asserting or making good on a \n     claim to the settlement proceeds. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature requests the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation to work closely with those members \n     of Congress who will sponsor legislation to see that the \n     proceeds of the settlement be paid to and retained by the \n     states. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of Montana's Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, Two years after filing suit against the tobacco \n     industry, Texas' attorney general announced on January 16, \n     1998, that the industry had agreed to the largest settlement \n     in the history of tobacco litigation; and\n       Whereas, Tireless negotiations between Texas and the \n     defendants ensued, resulting in a memorandum of understanding \n     signed in July 1998 that resolved all outstanding differences \n     and settled Texas' lawsuit against the tobacco industry; and\n       Whereas, The federal government played no role in the \n     litigation for Texas' $17.3 billion settlement with the \n     tobacco companies and has declined to bring its own lawsuit \n     against the industry, but now, through the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, asserts that it is entitled to a \n     significant share of state settlements on the basis that it \n     represents the federal share of Medicaid costs; and\n       Whereas, Texas bore all of the risk and expense in the \n     litigation and settlement negotiations, receiving no \n     assistance from the federal government, and is entitled to \n     all of the funds negotiated in the tobacco settlement \n     agreement; and\n       Whereas, United States Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison of \n     Texas and Bob Graham of Florida have introduced bipartisan \n     legislation, S. 346, to prohibit the federal government from \n     seizing any part of the tobacco settlement, and similar \n     legislation, H.R. 351, has been introduced in the U.S. House \n     of Representatives; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States \n     not to make federal claims against the proceeds of the Texas \n     tobacco settlement; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, Following an effort that involved considerable \n     expense, time, and risk, the states have reached a settlement \n     with tobacco companies in response to litigation initiated to \n     recover damages to the states related to the public's health. \n     This lawsuit was based on state claims for costs they \n     incurred related to tobacco and on long-term concerns for \n     public health and the vulnerability of children. State laws \n     on consumer protection, health, and other areas provided the \n     foundation for the legal actions; and\n       Whereas, Throughout the process of litigation, the states \n     bore the burdens of bringing the case, without the assistance \n     of the federal government. The terms of the settlement \n     provided for the states' responsibilities in directing \n     certain amounts to specific programs to remedy problems \n     caused by tobacco products; and\n       Whereas, In the time since the settlement was first \n     announced and finalized, some units of the federal government \n     have been making claims on portions of the tobacco settlement \n     funds. The administration's claims are apparently based on \n     efforts to recoup money channeled through the state for the \n     federal component of overall Medicaid costs; and\n       Whereas, The federal government's efforts to claim portions \n     of the states' tobacco settlement are inappropriate. The \n     states, acting together and on the basis of damages to the \n     states--not the federal government--earned this settlement. \n     There are measures before the Congress that would prohibit \n     federal agencies from trying to recoup funds as a result of \n     this agreement; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to prohibit any agency \n     of the federal government from recouping any of the tobacco \n     settlement funds due the states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-55. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, The provisions set forth in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 415 for \n     determining the primary insurance amount of a person \n     receiving social security were amended in 1977 by Public Law \n     95-216; and\n       Whereas, Those amendments resulted in disparate benefits \n     according to when a person initially becomes eligible for \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, Persons who were born during the years 1917 to \n     1926, inclusive, and who are commonly referred to as ``notch \n     babies,'' receive lower benefits than persons who were born \n     before that time; and\n       Whereas, The payment of benefits under the social security \n     system is not based on need or other considerations related \n     to welfare, but on a program of insurance based on \n     contributions by a person and his employer, and\n       Whereas, During the 105th session of Congress, H.R. 3008 \n     and S. 2003 were introduced in the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate, respectively, to provide compensation for the \n     inequities in the payment of social security benefits to \n     persons based on the year in which they initially become \n     eligible for such benefits, but no action has been taken on \n     such legislation; and\n       Whereas, The discrimination between persons receiving \n     benefits is contrary to the principles of justice and \n     fairness; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That Congress is hereby urged to enact legislation \n     that provides for the payment of lump sums to persons who \n     became eligible for social security benefits after 1981 and \n     before 1992 and have received lower benefits as a result of \n     the changes in the computation of benefits enacted by Public \n     Law 95-216, as compensation for the reduced benefits they \n     have been paid; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-56.

In \n     recent years, the zebra mussel, ruffe, and goby have posed \n     significant challenges to the delicate balance of the most \n     important fresh water resource of North America and the \n     largest and most accessible source of fresh water in the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, With changing technologies in the shipping \n     industry and in the ability to monitor and test water, there \n     are opportunities to make progress in the effort to halt the \n     introduction of more nonindigenous species into the Great \n     Lakes. Congress can contribute enormously to this work \n     through stronger legislation to prohibit the dumping of \n     ballast water in the Great Lakes water system and grants to \n     promote better compliance; and\n       Whereas, The quality of the Great Lakes will play a large \n     role in shaping the future not only for Michigan and the \n     United States, but for all of North America; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to strengthen measures to prohibit the \n     dumping of shipping ballast water into the Great Lakes and \n     connecting waterways; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4256-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4256-S4257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Murkowski, \n             and Mr. Santorum):\n       S. 881.

A bill to ensure confidentiality with respect to medical \nrecords and health care-related information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             the medical information protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical \nInformation Protection Act of 1999. Trying to find the right balance \nbetween legitimate uses of health care data and the need for privacy \nhas been a very difficult road to go down; however, I feel that great \nprogress has been made and that the legislation that I am introducing \nstrikes the right balance between the desire the patient has for \nincreased confidentiality and the need our health care system has for \ninformation that will enable it to provide a higher quality of care. I \nam pleased that Senators Mack, Murkowski and Santorum have joined me as \nco-sponsors of this legislation and I am hopeful that a number of other \nsenators will soon join us as well. In addition, I am pleased to \ninclude in the record a list of groups that have come out in support of \nthis legislation. I am grateful for the many comments and suggestions I \nhave received from a wide variety of organizations and individuals.\n  Most of us wrongly assume that our personal health information is \nprotected under federal law. It is not. Federal law protects the \nconfidentiality of our video rental records, and federal law ensures us \naccess to information about us such as our credit history. However, \nthere is no current federal law which will protect the confidentiality \nof our medical information against unauthorized use and ensure us \naccess to that same sensitive information about us. This is a \ncircumstance that I believe should and must change.\n  At this time, the only protection of an individual's personal medical \ninformation is under state law. These state laws, where they exist, are \nincomplete, inconsistent and in most cases inadequate. At last check, \nthere were approximately 35 states with 35 unique laws governing the \nuse and disclosure of medical information. Even in those states where \nthere are existing laws, there is no penalty for releasing and \ndisseminating the most private information about our health and the \nhealth care we have received.\n\n  As our health care delivery systems continue to expand across state \nlines, efficiency, research advances and the delivery of the highest \nquality of care possible depend upon the flow of information. This year \nalone, a large number of states have either considered passing new \nlegislation or have attempted to modify existing laws. As states act to \nmeet the concerns of their residents, the patchwork of state laws \nbecome ever more complex. If this trend continues, the high quality \ncare and research breakthroughs we have come to expect and demand from \nour health care system would be jeopardized because health care \norganizations would be forced to track and comply with multiple, \nconflicting and increasingly complex state laws.\n  Clearly, in today's world, health information must be permitted to \nflow across state lines if we are to expect the highest level of health \ncare. For example, in Utah, Intermountain Health Care (IHC), the \nlargest care provider based in my state also provides care in four \nother western states. IHC currently maintains secure databases of \npatient information which each of its member facilities in Utah, \nNevada, Idaho and Wyoming draw upon to provide and improve care. \nRequiring them to comply with multiple state laws does not add to the \nquality of health care they provide, but does add to the cost of health \ncare they provide. Many IHC patients live in one state yet their \nclosest hospital, clinic or physicians office is in another state. I am \nsure this example appears throughout the country in one form or another \ngiven the consolidation of the health care industry and the large \npercentage of us who live near state lines.\n  In addition, we are seeing an emergence of telemedicine and health \ncare services over the internet that adds another degree of complexity \nto this entire circumstance. Technology is not only improving the \nquality of care and improving patient access to services, it is also \nmaking the need for one strong federal law more critical. The majority \nof providers, insurers, health care professionals, researchers and \npatients agree that there is an increasingly urgent need for uniformity \nin our laws that govern access to and disclosure of personal health \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that if we do not act by August \nof 1999 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n(HIPAA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \nput in to place regulations governing health information in an \nelectronic format. Thus, we could have a circumstance where paper based \nrecords and electronic based records are treated differently. I do not \nbelieve Congress wants to protect one form of medical records and not \nanother, and I do not think that we should permit the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to implement regulations without further \ndirection from the Congress. Congress should not neglect its \nresponsibility and duty to legislate and provide appropriate direction \nto the executive branch. I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass \nlegislation that would give HHS clear direction and provide each \nAmerican with greater protection of their health information.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a list of \ngroups supporting this legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) individuals have a right of confidentiality with \n     respect to their personal health information and records;\n       (2) with respect to information about medical care and \n     health status, the traditional right of confidentiality is at \n     risk;\n       (3) an erosion of the right of confidentiality may reduce \n     the willingness of patients to confide in physicians and \n     other practitioners, thus jeopardizing quality health care;\n       (4) an individual's confidentiality right means that an \n     individual's consent is needed to disclose his or her \n     protected health information, except in limited circumstances \n     required by the public interest;\n       (5) any disclosure of protected health information should \n     be limited to that information or portion of the medical \n     record necessary to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure;\n       (6) the availability of timely and accurate personal health \n     data for the delivery of health care services throughout the \n     Nation is needed;\n       (7) personal health care data is essential for medical \n     research;\n       (8) public health uses of personal health data are critical \n     to both personal health as well as public health; and\n       (9) confidentiality of an individual's health information \n     must be assured without jeopardizing the pursuit of clinical \n     and epidemiological research undertaken to improve health \n     care and health outcomes and to assure the quality and \n     efficiency of health care.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) establish strong and effective mechanisms to protect \n     against the unauthorized and inappropriate disclosure of \n     protected health information that is created or maintained as \n     part of health care treatment, diagnosis, enrollment, \n     payment, plan administration, testing, or research processes;\n       (2) promote the efficiency and security of the health \n     information infrastructure so that members of the health care \n     community may more effectively exchange and transfer health \n     information in a manner that will ensure the confidentiality \n     of protected health information without impeding the delivery \n     of high quality health care; and\n       (3) establish strong and effective remedies for violations \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to strengthen provisions in the Energy Policy Act of \n1992 and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of \n1974 with respect to potential Climate Change; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 energy and climate policy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \ncosponsored by Senator Hagel, who is here, Senator Byrd, Senator Craig, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Grams, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Enzi, and, \nof course, Senator Hagel.\n  This is a bill that deals with the issue of the potential climate \nchange that we have heard so much about in this body over the last \nseveral months.\n  Our specific bill would do three things, Mr. President. First, the \nbill would create a new $2 billion research, development, and \ndemonstration program designed to develop and enhance new technology to \nhelp stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.\n  This would be a cost-shared partnership with industry to spur \ninnovation and technology so that we can use this technology and have \nit deployed in the United States, as well as have it exported around \nthe world. Think about the tremendous advancements that have been made \nin technology in the last decade, Mr. President. Apply the same basis \nof need for that technology to be used to reduce greenhouse gases and \naddress climate change. The necessity of doing this, Mr. President, is \nobvious.\n  We have seen discussed and examined the costs of Kyoto. The cost of \ncomplying with Kyoto is estimated to be up to $338 billion in lost \ngross domestic product by the year 2010. That equates to $3,068 per \nhousehold by that year. So it is a substantial investment and deserves \nour attention now.\n  Our bill would improve the provisions in existing law which promote \nvoluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Our emphasis remains \non encouraging voluntary action and not creating new regulatory \nburdens.\n  Finally, our bill would establish greater accountability and \nresponsibility for climate change and related matters within the \nDepartment of Energy by establishing a statutory office of global \nclimate change. Somebody needs to be accountable in the Department of \nEnergy for policies in this area. While the Secretary is ultimately \naccountable, we want to see greater program direction and focus in this \narea. It is justified, Mr. President, when we think of the costs \nassociated with meeting the demands and requirements of Kyoto. We can \ndo this and achieve this through technology, and it is an investment \nwell spent.\n  Now, there are other commonsense approaches we continue to work on \nthat we or others will later propose in separate bills or as amendments \nto this bill as we get into the debate. For example, we would like to \nprotect the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program from politics \nand ensure that it is conducting high-quality, merit-based, peer-\nreviewed science; we would like to remove regulatory obstacles that \nstand in the way of voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction; we \nwould like to promote voluntary agricultural management practices that \nsequester, or trap, additional carbon dioxide in biomass and soils; we \nwould like to promote forest management practices that sequester \ncarbon. Mr. President, we encourage the growth of more trees.\n  We would like to promote U.S. exports of clean technologies to \nnations such as China and India, who are belching greenhouse gases and \nchoking on their own pollutants. For this to be a global approach to a \nglobal issue, the developing countries must be engaged in the \nsolution--unlike Kyoto, where there is a mandate that developing \ncountries simply get a free ride. The recognition is--if you buy that \nlogic--there is no net gain, no substantial decrease in emissions. \nUnder our proposal, the technology would be applicable to the \ndeveloping nations, so there would be a substantial net decrease in \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Where sensible and cost effective, we would like to pursue possible \nchanges to the Tax Code to promote certain activities or practices \ndesigned to reduce, sequester, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions.\n  These are all approaches that we plan to pursue, in a bipartisan \nmanner, to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and potential \nclimate change, because we believe the potential threat of human-\ninduced climate change will best be solved on a global basis, and \nsolved with technology and American innovation over the long term.\n  This is the reason we are engaging the developing nations to come \naboard--by getting new technology into the marketplace, get it out \nthere and installed and reduce emissions.\n  Compare our approach with that taken by the Kyoto protocol, which \ngives developing nations a free ride. Kyoto explicitly ignores the \nprovision of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which passed this Senate 95 to \n0 in 1997.\n\n  We are, of course, a body of advice and consent. We gave the \nadministration our advice 95 to 0, so they shouldn't expect our \nconsent. Ninety-five Senators, Mr. President, rarely agree on anything. \nAs a consequence, I think we have spoken relative to the merits of the \ntreaty that was brought before us.\n  Although the President may seek short-term political gain in simply \nsigning a treaty that imposes burdens long after his watch is over--and \nthat is the applicability of these targets--these targets will come \nlong after the current administration is gone. So it is very easy to \nset these targets, because this administration won't be held \naccountable. If the President chooses to ignore our advice, then I \ndon't think he should expect our consent. That is kind of where we are \nnow.\n  If we recall the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it said that all nations must \nbe included in emission targets and that serious economic harm must not \nresult--serious economic harm. But what serious economic harm? Mr. \nPresident, I suggest that a cost to this Nation of $338 billion in lost \nGDP in the year 2010 is significant economic harm.\n  Yet the Kyoto proposal does not include all nations. Only 35 \nindustrial nations are subject to emission limits, even though the 134 \ndeveloping nations will surpass them in emissions by the year 2015. \nMoreover, the Kyoto protocol's regulatory approach requires legally \nbinding quantified emissions reductions of 7 percent below 1990 levels \nby the years 2008-2012. That is roughly a 40-percent decrease in \nemissions from our current baseline. We simply can't get there from \nhere without endangering energy supply, reliability, or our economy.\n  According to the economic analysis of the Department of Energy's \nEnergy Information Administration, if we were to adopt Kyoto, here is \nwhat American consumers could face in the year 2010:\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\n  53 percent higher gasoline prices;\n  86 percent higher electric prices;\n  Upward pressure on interest rates;\n  New inflationary pressures.\n  There goes your surplus.\n  At a recent hearing of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \none witness testified that the economic downturn accompanying the Kyoto \nimplementation would depress tax revenues, erase the surplus we have \nearmarked to shore up Social Security, and reduce the public debt.\n  With the Kyoto approach, we say goodbye to the budget surplus, \ngoodbye to the hopes of saving Social Security, and goodbye to the \neconomic prosperity in this country today.\n  What do we get for enduring this economic pain? Do we stabilize the \ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere under Kyoto? The answer \nis clearly no. Do we even reduce global greenhouse gas emissions? No, \nbecause any reductions by the 35 developed nations and the parties to \nthe treaty would be overwhelmed by the growing emissions from the 134 \nnations that aren't covered by the Kyoto emissions limit.\n  That is what is wrong with Kyoto. Make no mistake about it, Mr. \nPresident, the Kyoto protocol is an expensive, short-term, narrowly \napplied regulatory approach that will erode U.S. sovereignty, punish \nU.S. consumers, and do nothing to enhance the global environment.\n  We are, with this bill and others that will follow, charting a \ndifferent, a new, a progressive course. Ours is a long-term, \ntechnology-based, global effort. If human-induced greenhouse gas \nemissions are indeed changing the climate for the worse--and there \nremains substantial scientific uncertainty at this point--then we \nshould act in a prudent manner to reduce, sequester, or avoid those \nemissions through technology.\n  I would like to address criticisms leveled by the administration \nabout our bill that are based, I hope, on a misunderstanding.\n  A recent administration ``fact sheet,'' after recognizing that there \nare ``positive features'' in the bill, and noting that it ``makes \nimprovements to current law'' regarding voluntary efforts to curtail \nemissions, goes on to incorrectly erroneously state that our bill \n``rolls back energy efficiency and clean energy programs with a long \nhistory of bipartisan support.''\n  The administration ``fact sheet'' is incorrect. Our bill does not \nroll back funding for renewable energy or energy efficiency. Instead, \nit authorizes $200 million per year in new money; it does not \ndeauthorize any existing programs.\n  With that clarification, it would be my hope that the administration \nwould support our bill and join us in a prudent, common sense approach \nto greenhouse gas emissions and climate.\n  Mr. President, I think I had 20 minutes under special orders this \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask that the remainder of my time be available to my \ncosponsor, Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank as well Senator \nMurkowski.\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleague and friend, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and \nother colleagues in introducing the Energy and Climate Policy Act of \n1999. We offer this legislation because we believe it is time that \nCongress take a new, bipartisan approach to dealing with the issue of \nglobal climate change.\n  This legislation turns the debate away from unachievable, U.N.-\nmandated, arbitrary, short-term targets and timetables as dictated by \nthe Kyoto protocol toward a long-term strategy that focuses on sound \nscience, increased research and development, incentives for voluntary \naction, and public-private technological initiatives that are market \ndriven and technology based.\n  Twenty-first century technologies, American ingenuity, and public-\nprivate cooperation--not U.N.-mandated energy rationing--should be, in \nfact, the focus of climate change efforts in the Congress. I hope \nMembers on both sides of the aisle will join this effort.\n  Mr. President, this has never been a debate about who is for or \nagainst the environment. This has never been a partisan issue. I have \nnot met one Member of the Senate--Republican or Democrat--who wants to \nleave their children a dirty and uninhabitable environment. We all \nagree that we have a responsibility to protect our environment. What \nthis debate should be about is bringing some common sense--common \nsense--to this issue.\n  This bill that we are introducing today--the Energy and Climate \nPolicy Act--brings some common sense to the issue of climate change.\n  Senator Murkowski laid out a number of the more specific parts of our \nbill--accountability for one. We put this responsibility in the \nDepartment of Energy where there is someone ``in charge.''\n  Presently we have accountability for global climate change spread \nthroughout the Government. It is in the White House. It is in the EPA. \nIt is in the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Interior, and \nEnergy. All of these organizations have their tentacles wrapped around \nthis issue. So with this, we will focus on accountability, \nresponsibility. Let's get the job done.\n  Second, this bill moves the current focus of climate change policy \naway from short-term, draconian energy rationing and cost increases \nmandated by the United Nations Kyoto protocol toward a long-term \ndomestic commitment to research and development. As Senator Murkowski \npointed out, it adds significant Government funding in a private-public \nenterprise over the next 10 years. It focuses on real science, sound \nscience.\n  Third, this bill continues Congress' commitment to supporting \nvoluntary energy efforts to reduce, sequester, or avoid manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions. It does so by strengthening current law--not \nby creating new international, bureaucratic, governmental regimes in \nwhich we will all be accountable.\n  In short, among other things this bill does, we look at the entire \npicture--the consequences of our actions. That means including \nactivities that naturally lower the levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This bill also addresses the issue of whether such voluntary efforts \nare ``real and verifiable''--Who enforces these kinds of mandates?--the \nrole of agriculture, the role of industry, business, labor, and long-\nterm standard of living consequences: How competitive are our products \nin the world markets?--market driven, technology based. We build on \nwhat is already the foundation of this great, free land and this great, \nfree market economy.\n  This bill also allows all of our enterprises in this country to plan \nfor the future and build commitments into outyear planning and \ninvestment decisions. Kyoto doesn't talk about that. Who finances these \nefforts?\n  This is the best way to deal with the issue of climate change: a \nlong-term commitment based on American ingenuity, exports, scientific \ncertainty, 21st century technology, and market principles.\n  By doing these things we can walk away from the disastrous path that \nthis administration and the Kyoto protocol would lead us and focus our \nefforts instead on a positive, bipartisan, achievable commonsense \napproach.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at what we are introducing \ntoday. It is a bipartisan bill. It does make sense. I look forward to \nworking with the Presiding Officer and others this year and into next \nyear in crafting something that is achievable and workable and good for \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 882\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy and Climate Policy \n     Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Although there are significant uncertainties \n     surrounding the science of climate\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n     change, human activities may contribute to increasing global \n     concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which \n     in turn may ultimately contribute to global climate change \n     beyond that resulting from natural variability;\n       (2) the characteristics of greenhouse gases and the \n     physical nature of the climate system require that any \n     stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations \n     must be a long-term effort undertaken on a global basis;\n       (3) since developing countries will constitute the major \n     source of greenhouse gas emissions early in the 21st century, \n     all nations must share in an effective international response \n     to potential climate change;\n       (4) environmental progress and economic prosperity are \n     interrelated;\n       (5) effective greenhouse gas management efforts depend on \n     the development of long-term, cost-effective technologies and \n     practices that can be developed, refined, and deployed \n     commercially in an orderly manner in the United States and \n     around the world;\n       (6) in its present form as signed by the Administration, \n     the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention \n     on Climate Change fails to meet the minimum conditions of \n     Senate Resolution 98, 105th Congress, which was adopted by \n     the Senate on July 25 1997 by a vote of 95-0;\n       (7) The President has not submitted the Kyoto Protocol to \n     the Senate for debate and advice and consent to ratification \n     under Article II, Section 2, clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution and has indicated that the Administration has no \n     intention to do so in the foreseeable future, or to implement \n     any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification \n     in the Senate.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to strengthen \n     provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13381 \n     et seq.) and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and \n     Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5901 et seq.) to--\n       (1) further promote voluntary efforts to reduce or avoid \n     greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency;\n       (2) focus Department of Energy efforts in this area; and\n       (3) authorize and undertake a long-term research, \n     development, and demonstration program to--\n       (A) develop new and enhance existing technologies that \n     reduce or avoid anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases;\n       (B) develop new technologies that could remove and \n     sequester greenhouse gases from emissions streams; and\n       (C) develop new technologies and practices to remove and \n     sequester greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Murkowski, Hagel, Craig, Hutchinson, Grams, and Roberts, in \ncosponsoring the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999 which was \nintroduced earlier today. The legislation provided in this bill is one \nof a number of options that the U.S. could undertake to improve energy \nefficiency and security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the \ncomplex issue of climate change will not be solved by a single bill or \naction, this legislaiton provides additional funding for research and \ndevelopment for important programs that I have long supported, like \nclean coal technologies, an American-developed initiative. The bill \nwould also take steps to coordinate and implement energy efficiency \nresearch as well as begin the process of better reporting greehouse gas \nreductions at the Department of Energy.\n  If substantial steps are going to be taken globally to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we must accelerate the development and \ncommercialization of new technologies, anticipate changing conditions, \nand encourage public/private partnerships. Both developing and \nindustrialized nations must find ways to tackle this complex and multi-\nfaceted problem. There is no single answer--there is no one silver \nbullet to fix this issue.\n  Any viable climate change policy must include efforts to develop \ncleaner and more efficient fossil fuel-based energy production in order \nto meet growing energy needs. Clean coal technologies must be a part of \nthat solution. When one examines the increase in global greenhouse gas \nemissions over the next several decades, the utilization of clean coal \ntechnologies is essential. Nations that are serious about reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions in the long term, especially many of the \nlargest developing nations like China, cannot ignore clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  In 1984, I proposed, and the Congress adopted, a $750 million Clean \nCoal Technology program. Originally, the program was designed to \nachieve long-term, real reductions in acid rain. Since then, the \nprogram has expanded, thanks to a joint government-industry investment \nof more than $6 billion. This investment has led to 40 first-of-a-kind \nprojects in 18 states, including an array of high-technology ideas that \ncan spearhead a new era of clean, efficient power plants which will \ncontinue to burn our nation's abundant coal resources. Much useful \ntechnology has resulted from this synergy of effort between government \nand private investment by incorporating leading-edge federal \nlaboratories and practical business applications. More needs to be \ndone, and the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999 seeks to fuel this \nsynergy by encouraging more public-private projects in all areas of \nenergy production and use. This boost will help to move ideas into \nreality.\n\n  It is critical that the U.S. find better ways to use our own energy \nresources by encouraging more research and development. These \ninitiatives have both environmental and economic benefits. This bill \nprovides an additional $200 million per year for ten years for \nresearch, development, and demonstration programs through competitive \ngrants. It would also take further steps to coordinate and implement \nenergy research and development. These programs build upon the many \nvoluntary efforts that government at all levels and industry have \nalready undertaken to improve energy use as well as to reduce, avoid, \nor sequester greenhouse gas emissions. All sectors of the economy \nshould be able to benefit from these programs.\n  In addition to its many benefits at home, the clean coal technology \nprogram can also provide an economically beneficial and environmentally \nsound solution in the international market. According to the coal \nindustry, coal production will continue to increase\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\nworldwide. Coal can be a cost-competitive source of fuel for \nelectricity generation, but, like other fossil fuels, it will require \nimprovements in its environmental credentials. Developing nations are \ncurrently searching for cost-effective ways to upgrade their older, \nhigher-polluting power plants and to expand their power production \ncapacity. These nations can learn from our experiences and utilize our \nnew technologies to combat these problems. I note that during the \nrecent visit of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, the U.S. and China both \nagreed that more should be done to employ clean coal technologies.\n  After 2015, China is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's \nlargest emitter of greenhouse gases. Global warming is a global \nproblem. It is not just an American problem. It is not just a European \nproblem. And as such, it requires a global solution. Industrialized \nnations' efforts to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions will be for \nnaught unless reductions are also made by nations like China and India. \nCoal will continue to be a major source of their energy production; \ntherefore, clean coal technologies are essential to their responsible \ngrowth. The U.S. must support further efforts to encourage clean coal \nand other energy efficient technologies and to take them from the \ndrawing board to the marketplace. Funding for these programs is \npointless unless our government works in conjunction with the private \nsector to break down market barriers and prove the viability of such \nprograms in the global market.\n  Research, development, and demonstration programs provide numerous \nbenefits to improve air quality standards, increase our energy \nefficiency, and reduce greenhouse gases. While the intent of this bill \nis independent of the Kyoto Protocol, this legislation, in addition to \nits many other benefits, could help the U.S. in addressing climate \nchange challenges that might result from the implementation of any \nfuture treaty.\n  In its present form, the Kyoto Protocol does not meet the conditions \noutlined in S. Res. 98, which passed the Senate on July 25, 1997; \nnamely, it must include developing country participation as well as \nprovide sufficient detail to explain the economic impact of such an \nagreement for the United States. I recognize that the Protocol is a \nwork in progress. The international negotiations to bring it into \ncompliance with S. Res. 98 will require perseverance and patience and \nare part of a long-term effort to address global climate change. The \nAdministration has not submitted the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for \nits advice and consent and has indicated it has no intention of doing \nso in the foreseeable future. the Administration has indicated that it \nneeds at least two additional years to complete negotiations on the \nBuenos Aires Action Plan which includes negotiating major aspects of \nthe Protocol such as developing country participation, emissions \ntrading, the Clean Development Mechanism, and forest and soil sinks. \nThe Administration has also pledged not to implement any portion of the \nKyoto Protocol prior to its advice and consent in the Senate. I hope \nthat that pledge will continue to be honored.\n  Over the last year and a half, a number of economic studies have been \ncompleted, but we have yet to see a comprehensive analysis of the Kyoto \nProtocol. I remain firmly convinced that it is critical that the United \nStates knows in some detail the probable costs and benefits of the \nspecific actions proposed to address global climate change.\n  In summary, improved resource use, energy efficiency and security, \nand global climate change will all be critical issues for every nation \nin the new millennium. Market-based solutions and research and \ndevelopment funding will play a vital role in addressing these issues. \nBy cosponsoring the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999, I hope that \nU.S. firms can receive additional funding to help increase research and \ndevelopment for important new technologies. These initiatives, in \naddition to other market-based solutions, could provide vehicles for \nreal improvements in energy efficiency as well as reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and an important marketable solution for \nglobal participation in such reductions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Murkowski, Hagel, Byrd, and others, in introducing \nthe Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999. I commend Chairman Murkowski \nand Senators Hagel and Byrd for their leadership on this very important \nlegislation.\n  Sufficient scientific information and public interest exist to \njustify the encouragement and acknowledgment of responsible actions by \nprivate entities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even though all \nscientific, technological, economic, and public policy questions have \nnot yet been resolved.\n  The global climate issue presents profound questions in these areas \nthat require comprehensive, integrated resolution. Current scientific \nresearch, experimentation, and data collection are not adequately \ncoordinated or focused on answering key questions within the United \nStates, as well as internationally.\n  Moreover, public access to scientific, economic, and public policy \ninformation is severely limited. The public's right to know is not \nbeing satisfied. Open and balanced discussion leading to public support \nfor best approaches to climate policy resolution is urgently needed.\n  This measure does not depend on future regulatory mandates, an \napproach preferred by the current Administration to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. It also provides a valid alternative to S. 547, the \nCredit for Voluntary Reductions Act, introduced recently by my friends \nand colleague Senator John Chafee. The key difference between Senator \nChafee's bill and our bill is that our bill is not dependent on the \nKyoto protocol or any other regulatory mandate.\n  It is my belief, Mr. President, that voluntary measures should be \nencouraged through incentives rather than in anticipation of future \ndomestic or international regulatory mandates.\n  Mr. President, I am also very concerned about the Administration's \nstrong desire to drastically cut carbon and its seeming willingness to \ndo so by whatever regulatory measure available. Demonstrative evidence \nof the Administration's thinking on this issue is contained in the \nApril 10, 1998, EPA General Counsel memo to Carol Browner, describing \nEPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act.\n  This memo, in my opinion, clearly overstates EPA's authority to \nregulate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Moreover, this memo is \nindicative of the Administration's penchant for finding regulatory \nfixes for problems. Its allies in this campaign are those in the \ninternational community who are either indifferent to, or against our \neconomic interests. we all know, or should know, that at this moment in \nhistory, when you cap carbon you cap economic growth.\n\n  We need a whole new paradigm for handling this serious political \nissue. People care about it on all sides, and now Congress will be \ninvolved in this issue during this session. Let's get serious about the \nscience and fully inform the American people so that whatever the \noutcome, they'll know that their government was working for them and \nnot against their important economic interests.\n  Let's force the current Administration to stop politicizing science \nand get to the point where the issue is confidently understood. There \nis simply no compelling reason for our government at this time to force \nAmericans to take preventive measures of uncertain competence against a \nproblem that may or may not lie in the earth's future.\n  It is for these reasons that I, along with Senators Murkowski, Hagel, \nand others, are continuing to work on the next step in this very \nimportant response to the climate change issue--a more comprehensive \nproposal that will include provisions that address:\n  (1) Policy mechanisms for assessing the effects of greenhouse gas \nemissions;\n  (2) Accelerated development and deployment of climate response \ntechnology;\n  (3) International deployment of technology to mitigate climate \nchange;\n  (4) The advancement of climate science; and\n  (5) Improving public access to government information on the broad \nspectrum of scientific opinion on the causes and effects of climate \nchange.\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\n  Mr. President, significant green-house gas emission reductions can be \nachieved through voluntary measures that are warranted even as we \nanswer yet unresolved key questions about the global and regional \nclimates.\n  What is required now is an approach that will encourage public \nsupport for appropriate action. I believe this bill paves the way for \nsuch public support, and, by reasonably addressing the important \neconomic and political issues associated with the current climate \nchange debate, sets the proper tone for future discourse that will \nultimately lead to a safe and economically prudent resolution of this \nhighly charged issue.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Hagel by cosponsoring the Energy and \nClimate Policy Act of 1999.\n  This legislation marks a turning point in how we address the \npotential problems associated with global climate change.\n  It addresses these potential problems not by mandating draconian \nreductions in energy use and hiking energy taxes, but by providing \nAmerica's businesses and innovators with the tools they need to make \nlong-term, substantive carbon dioxide emissions reductions.\n  One of the problems with the administration's support of the Kyoto \nProtocol is that while they have already agreed to legally-binding \ngreenhouse gas emissions reductions, the GAO found last year that the \nadministration does not have quantitative performance goals for the \nmoney they intend to spend on their intiatives.\n  In other words, the administration has agreed to a treaty with \nlegally-binding reductions and they clearly want to spend a lot of \nmoney to reach those limits--but they don't have any idea how much of \nan impact all of their spending will have on emissions reductions.\n  This legislation says ``let's take a different road.'' The Murkowski-\nHagel bill will establish a new research, development and demonstration \nprogram that promotes technologies and practices which allow energy \nusers to avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Those technologies include alternative energy technologies, energy \nefficiency technologies, and technologies that take current energy \nproduction processes and make them better and more efficient.\n  The bill will also promote technologies that remove and sequester \ngreenhouse gases from the atmosphere and emissions streams.\n  This bill is aimed at involving the private sector in our \ndecisionmaking processes and bringing them to the table as well. It is \naimed at putting American ingenuity to work whether it be in the home, \nat the business, or out on the farm. The Murkowski-Hagel bill simply \nsays that we recognize our responsibility to reduce or sequester \ngreenhouse gas emissions and we are taking substantive, long-term steps \nto that rising challenge.\n  The Murkowski-Hagel bill does not start from the premise that we are \nto blame for the theoretical impacts of global warming. It doesn't \nattempt to punish American businesses by forcing them to reduce their \nenergy consumption or by bankrupting them through higher energy prices. \nThis bill does not accept the long-held beltway view that Washington \nknows best. It recognizes that American businesses and individuals can \ndo tremendous things when they are challenged to do better and when \nGovernment is their partner rather than their adversary.\n  I sincerely hope that all Members of the Senate can support this \npiece of legislation so that it can pass into law as soon as possible. \nI look forward to continuing to work with Senators Murkowski and Hagel \nand others interested to continue our efforts to both protect the \nenvironment and strengthen the American economy as we enter into the \n21st century.\n  While I am here this morning, I would like to renew my request to \nPresident Clinton that he submit the recently signed Kyoto Protocol to \nthe Senate for ratification. Mr. President, the United States Senate \nhas clearly expressed its interest in this matter and its opposition to \nany attempts to implement the Treaty prior to Senate advice and \nconsent.\n  In the 105th Congress, the Senate undertook a number of activities \nwhich illustrated these concerns. First, S. Res. 98 unanimously \nexpressed the Senate's position on both the projected economic impacts \nof the Treaty and the participation of developing nations.\n  Second, in a series of measures, including the FY99 Energy and Water \nAppropriations Bill, the FY99 Department of Defense Appropriations \nBill, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act, and the \nFY99 VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, the Senate \nexpressed its concern with any attempts at premature implementation and \nAdministration actions which advance the provisions of the Treaty prior \nto Senate advice and consent. It is my understanding that the \nAdministration has largely ignored the provisions of those pieces of \nlegislation.\n  While President Clinton has long maintained that he will not submit \nthe Treaty to the Senate prior to obtaining ``meaningful'' developing \nnation participation, his recent actions clearly demonstrate that he \nwill not withdraw U.S. support, regardless of what the final agreement \nmay be.\n  By signing the Treaty on November 12, 1998, while allowing an \nadditional two years for continued negotiations on elements critical to \nthe Treaty's impact on our nation, he has predetermined the outcome and \nweakened our nation's negotiating position. And despite the Senate's \nunanimous framework provided within S. Res. 98, there has been little \nsubstantive progress towards obtaining any ``meaningful'' participation \namong developing nations.\n  I can only conclude that the Administration's premature signing of \nthis Treaty was based on political considerations that should never \nhave been factored into such an important decision. Under no \ncircumstances should a Treaty be signed until we agree with its \nprincipals. Just briefly, as I conclude, once a Treaty has been signed \nby the United States, it should immediately be sent to the Congress for \nratification, not used for political purposes.\n  So again, I strongly urge the President to submit the Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich he has already signed, to the Senate for ratification. If he \nbelieves it is important enough to sign and to implement through \nbackdoor tactics, then he should also believe it is important enough to \nfor Congress, the people's voice, to have an opportunity to review it, \ndebate it, and vote on its ratification.\n  I believe the Senate must have the opportunity to examine the Treaty \nnow and debate it openly before the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 883. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to reschedule \ncertain drugs that pose an imminent danger to public safety, and to \nprovide for the rescheduling of the date-rape drug and the \nclassification of a certain ``club'' drug; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the new drugs of the 1990s control act\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the best time to target a new drug with \nuncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has \noverwhelmed our communities.\n  That is why I introduced legislation in previous Congresses to place \ntight federal controls on the date rape drug Rohpynol--also known as \nRoofies--which was becoming known as the Quaalude of the Nineties as \nits popularity spreads throughout the United States.\n  My bill would have shifted Rohpynol to schedule 1 of the Federal \nControlled Substances Act. Rescheduling is important for three simple \nreasons:\n  First, Federal re-scheduling triggers increases in State drug law \npenalties, and since we all know that more than 95 percent of all drug \ncases are prosecuted at the State level, not by the Federal Government, \nit is vitally important that we re-schedule.\n  Second, Federal re-scheduling to schedule 1 triggers the toughest \nFederal penalties--up to a year in prison and at least a $1,000 fine \nfor a first offense of simple possession.\n  And, third, re-scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to \nreschedule Quaaludes, Congress passed the law, and the Quaalude \nepidemic was greatly reduced. And, in 1990, I worked to re-schedule \nsteroids, Congress passed the law, and again a drug epidemic that had \nbeen on the rise was reversed.\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n  Despite evidence of a growing Rohpynol epidemic, some argued that my \nefforts to reschedule the drug by legislation were premature. \nAccordingly, I agreed to hold off on legislative action and wait for a \nDrug Enforcement Administration decision on whether to schedule the \ndrug through the lengthy and cumbersome administrative process.\n  As I predicted, the DEA report on Rohpynol--handed down in November--\ncorrectly concludes that despite the rapid spread of Rohpynol \nthroughout the country, DEA cannot re-schedule Rohpynol by rulemaking \nat this time.\n  The report notes, however, that Congress is not bound by the \nbureaucratic re-scheduling process the DEA must follow. Congress can--\nand in my view should--pass legislation to reschedule Rohpynol.\n  Sepcifically the report states: ``This inability to reschedule \n[Rohpynol] administratively * * * does not affect Congress' ability to \nplace [the drug] in schedule 1 through the legislative process''--as we \ndid with Quaaludes in 1984 and Anabolic Steroids in 1990.\n  Let me also note that the DEA report confirmed a number of facts \nabout the extent of the Rohpynol problem:\n  DEA found more than 4,000 documented cases--in 36 States--of sale or \npossession of the drug, which is not marketed in the United States and \nmust be smuggled in.\n  ``In spite of DEA's inability to reschedule [Rohpynol] through \nadministrative proceedings, DEA remains very concerned about the \nabuse'' of the drug.\n  ``Middle and high school students have been known to use [Rohpynol] \nas an alternative to alcohol to achieve an intoxicated state during \nschool hours. [The drug] is much more difficult to detect than alcohol, \nwhich produces a characteristic odor.''\n  ``DEA is extremely concerned about the use of [Rohpynol] in the \ncommission of sexual assaults.''\n  ``The number of sexual assaults in which [Rohpynol] is used may be \nunderreported''--because the drug's effects often cause rape victims to \nbe unable to remember details of their assaults and because rape crisis \ncenters, hospitals, and law enforcement have only recently become aware \nthat Rohpynol can be used to facilitate sex crimes.\n  Nonetheless, ``DEA is aware of at least 5 individuals who have been \nconvicted of rape in which the evidence suggests that [the Rohypnol \ndrug] was used to incapacitate the victim.'' ``The actual number of \nsexual assault cases involving [the drug] is not known. It is difficult \nto obtain evidence that [the Rohypnol drug] was used in an assault.''\n  I would also note that my efforts to re-schedule this drug have \nalready had beneficial results: The manufacturer of Rohypnol recently \nannounced that it had developed a new formula to minimize the potential \nfor abuse of the drug in sexual assaults.\n  This is an important step. But pills produced under the old Rohypnol \nformula are still in circulation, and pills made by other manufacturers \ncan still be smuggled in. Furthermore, the new formula will not prevent \nkids from continuing to ingest this dangerous drug voluntarily for a \ncheap high.\n  In short, stricter, Federal controls remain necessary; and DEA is \npowerless to respond to Rohypnol abuse until the problem gets even \nworse.\n  Therefore, I am reintroducing my bill to re-schedule Rohypnol in \nschedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to take action against this dangerous drug now, \nrather than waiting for the problem to develop into an epidemic.\n  My bill also places ``Special K''--ketamine hydrochloride--a \ndangerous hallucinogen very similar to PCP, on schedule III of the \nControlled Substances Act. Despite Special K's rising popularity as a \n``club drug'' of choice among kids, the drug is not even illegal in \nmost States. This has crippled State authorities' ability to fight \nketamine abuse.\n  For example, in Federal 1997, two men accused of stealing ketamine \nfrom a Ville Platte, Louisiana veterinary clinic and cooking the drug \ninto a powder could not be prosecuted under State drug control laws \nbecause ketamine is not listed as a Federal controlled substance.\n  Similarly, a New Jersey youth recently found to be possessing and \ndistributing ketamine could be charged with only a disorderly persons \noffense.\n  Prosecutors are trying to combat increased Ketamine use by seeking \nlengthy prison terms for possession of the drugs--like marijuana--that \nusers mix with Ketamine, but if it is just Special K, there's nothing \nthey can do about it.\n  I am convinced that scheduling Ketamine will help our effort to fight \nthe spread of this dangerous drug by triggering increases in State drug \nlaw penalties.\n  Without Federal scheduling, many States will not be able to address \nthe Ketamine problem until it is too late and Special K has already \ninfiltrated their communities.\n  Medical professions who use Ketamine--including the American \nVeterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Nurse \nAnesthetists--support scheduling, having determined that it will \naccomplish our goal of ``preventing the diversion and unauthorized use \nof Ketamine'' while allowing ``continued, responsible use'' of the drug \nfor legitimate purposes. [Letter from Mary Beth Leininger, D.V.M., \nPresident of the American Veterinary Medical Association]\n  And the largest manufacturer of Ketamine has concluded that ``moving \nthe product to schedule III classification is in the best interest of \nthe veterinary industry and the public.'' [Letter from E. Thomas \nCorcoran, President of Fort Dodge Animal Health, a Division of American \nHome Products Corporation].\n  Scheduling Ketamine will give State authorities the tools they \ndesperately need to fight its abuse by young people--and end the legal \nanomaly that leaves those who sell Ketamine to our children beyond the \nreach of the law--even when they are caught ``red-handed.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  In addition to raising controls on Rohypnol and Ketamine, the \nlegislation I am introducing today would increase the ability of the \nAttorney General to respond to new drug emergencies in the future.\n  Our Federal drug control laws currently allow the Attorney General \nlimited authority to respond to certain new drugs on an emergency \nbasis--by temporarily subjecting them the strictest Federal control \nwhile the extensive administrative procedure for permanent scheduling \nproceeds.\n  But the Attorney General has not been able to use this authority to \nrespond to the Rohypnol and Special K emergencies--because she does not \nhave authority to--move drugs from one schedule to another, or to \nschedule drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has allowed \ncompanies to research but not to sell.\n  This amendment would grant the administration this important \nauthority by--authorizing the Attorney General to move a scheduled \ndrug--like Rohypnol--to schedule I in an Emergency; by applying \nemergency rescheduling authority to ``investigational new drugs''--like \nSpecial K--that the Food and Drug Administration has approved for \nresearch purposes only, but not for marketing.\n  And by providing that a rescheduling drug remains on the temporary \nschedule until the administrative proceedings reach a final conclusion \non whether to schedule. This legislation would give the Attorney \nGeneral the necessary tools to respond quickly when evidence appears \nthat a drug is being abused. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the National Military Museum Foundation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                NATIONAL MILITARY MUSEUM FOUNDATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Torricelli, legislation to create a \nNational Military Museum Foundation. The purpose of this legislation is \nto encourage and facilitate private-sector support in the effort to \npreserve, interpret and display the important role the military has \nplayed in the history of our nation. This legislation is, in my \njudgment, crucial at this particular moment in history, when we are on \nthe verge of jeopardizing two-centuries worth of military artifacts and \nnegating the possibility of such collections in the future.\n  It has been the long-standing tradition of the U.S. Department of War \nand its successor, the Department of Defense, to preserve our historic \nmilitary artifacts. Since the days of the revolution to the conflict in \nBosnia, Americans have been proud of the role that our military has had \nin safeguarding our democracy, and we have tried to ensure that future \ngenerations will know that role. Over the years we have accumulated a \npriceless collection of military artifacts from every period of \nAmerican history and every technological era. The collection includes \nflags, uniforms, weapons, paintings and historic records as well as \nfull-size tanks, ships and aircraft which document history and provide \nprovenance for our nation and armed services.\n  In recent years, however, the dedicated individuals who identify, \ninterpret, catalog and showcase those artifacts have found themselves \nshortchanged and shorthanded. With financial resources diminishing, not \nonly are we cheating ourselves out of the military treasures currently \nwarehoused out of public sight, but we are in danger of lacking the \nfunds to update our collections with new items.\n  ``A morsel of genuine history,'' wrote Thomas Jefferson to John Adams \nin 1817, ``is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.'' Mr. \nPresident, today, significant pieces of our military history are being \nlost, shoved into basements, or subject to decay. With each year also \ncomes less funding, and our artifacts are multiplying at a pace that \nexceeds the capabilities of those who are trying to preserve them. \nSince 1990 alone, the services have closed 21 military museums and at \nleast eight more are expected to close in the next few years.\n  We cannot let this proceed any further. Military museums are vital to \ndocumenting our history, educating our citizenry and advancing our \ntechnology. More than 86 museums in 31 states and the District of \nColumbia daily instill Americans from veterans to new recruits to \nelementary school students with a sense of the sacred responsibility \nthat military servicemen bear to defend the values that have made this \ncountry great.\n  Military museums teach our servicemen the history of their units, \nenhancing their understanding both of the team of which they are a part \nand the significance of the service they have pledged to perform. And \nwhen a museum makes history come alive to young children, those \nchildren learn for themselves that what this country stands for and the \nsacrifices that have been made to preserve the freedoms we often take \nfor granted.\n  Many of our servicemen have learned their military history through \nthese artifacts rather than textbooks, and many of our technological \nadvances have come as a direct result of these artifacts. The ship \nmodels and ordinances at U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, MD, \nfor example, have been used by the Academy's Departments of Gunnery and \nSeamanship. It has also been reported that a study of an existing \nmissile system, preserved in an Army museum, saves the Strategic \nDefense Initiative $25 million in research and analysis costs. These \nmuseums serve as laboratories where engineers can learn from the \nlessons of the past without going through the same trial and error \nprocess as their predecessors.\n  Yet without adequate funding, these benefits will be lost forever. \nAccording to a 1994 study conducted by the Advisory Council on Historic \nPreservation entitled, ``Defense Department Compliance with the \nNational Historic Preservation Act,'' the Department of Defense's \nmanagement of these resources has been ``mediocre,'' with the cause \nattributed to ``inadequate staffing and funding.''\n  More than 80 percent of the museums studied said their survival \nrelies heavily on outside funding. When asked about their greatest \nneeds, the response was nearly always staff and money. And those \nmuseums that reported sufficient staffing from volunteers nevertheless \nsaid that the dearth of funds for restoration and construction \nparalyzed them from fully utilizing the available labor.\n  According to the study, money is so tight that brochures and \npamphlets are often unaffordable, leaving visitors with no explanations \nabout the objects that have come to see. A young child might be duly \nimpressed by the sight of a stern-faced general, but the historical \nlesson is greatly diminished if the child is not told the significance \nof the event portrayed or why the general looked so grim that day.\n  Perhaps most distressing, the study reported ``substantial \ncollections of rare or unique historical military vehicles and \nequipment that are unmaintained and largely unprotected due to lack of \nfunds and available expertise.'' In addition, the museums were found to \nbe struggling so much with the care of items already in house, that \nthey were unable to accept new ones. With a new class of military \nartifacts from the Vietnam and Gulf Wars soon to be retired, one \nwonders whether those artifacts will be preserved. If we do not take \naction to save what we have and acquire what we don't, future \ngenerations will see these pockets of negligence as blank pages in the \nliving history books that these museums truly are.\n\n  Only a Foundation can address these problems. The alternate \nsolution--to press the services to devote more money to these \ninstitutions--is implausible in this budgetary climate. The Secretary \nof Defense must place his highest priority on the readiness of our \nforces. Closely allied to that priority is the effort to improve the \nquality of life for our citizens on active duty. And, as aging \nequipment faces obsolescence, the Secretary has indicated that the \nfuture will bring an increased emphasis on replacing weapons systems. \nBy all realistic assumptions, the amount of funds appropriated for \nmuseums is likely to continue downward.\n  My bill recognizes the growing need for a reliable source of funding \naside from federal appropriations. A National Military Museum \nFoundation would provide an accessible venue for individuals, \ncorporations or other private sources to support the preservation of \nour priceless military artifacts and records. A National Military \nMuseum Foundation could also play an important role in surveying those \nartifacts that we know to exist. Currently, these is no museum \noversight or coordination of museum activities on the DOD level. A \nwide-ranging Foundation survey would therefore not only eliminate \nduplication, but would most likely discover gaps in our collections \nthat must be filled before it is too late.\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\n  Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Defense would \nappoint the Foundation's Board of Directors and provide basic \nadministrative support. To launch the Foundation, the legislation \nauthorizes an initial appropriation of $1 million. It is anticipated \nthat the Foundation would be self sufficient after the first year. This \nis a small price to pay to save some of our most precious treasures.\n  This legislation is modeled on legislation that established similar \nfoundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the National Fish \nand Wildlife Foundation, both of which have succeeded in raising \nprivate-sector support for conservation programs. My bill is not \nintended to supplant existing Federal funding or other foundation \nefforts that may be underway, but rather to supplement those efforts.\n  The premise for establishing a national foundation is, in part, to \nelevate the level of fund raising beyond the local level, supplementing \nthose efforts by seeking donations from potentially large donors. I \nalso want to emphasize the inclusiveness of the Foundation, which will \nrepresent all the branches of our armed services.\n  Mr. President, statistics reveal that foundations established without \nthe mandate of a federal statute and the backing of an established \nagency seldom succeed. With ever-diminishing federal funds, we cannot \nexpect the Department to put our military museums ahead of national \nsecurity. Truly, an outside source committed to sustaining our museums \nis imperative. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 885. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide incentives for the development \nof drugs for the treatment of addiction to illegal drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n            the new medicines to treat addiction act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the New Medicines to \nTreat Addiction Act of 1999, legislation that builds upon my efforts in \nprevious Congresses to promote research into and development of new \nmedicines to treat the ravages of hard core drug addiction.\n  Since the first call to arms against illegal drugs, we have learned \njust how insidious hard-core drug addiction is, even as the ravages of \nsubstance abuse--on both the addict and the addict's victims--have \nbecome ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a seemingly \nintractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in the heated \nrhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to find a \ncure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition that we \nhave not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, like \nall serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, and \nrefuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture.\n  Throughout my tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \ncalled for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the \nspecific steps I advocated was the creation of incentives to encourage \nthe private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area \nwhere promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to \nproduction of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the New \nMedicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1999, will hopefully change that. \nIt takes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--\nhardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because \nthese addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and \nin part because this population commits such a large percentage of \ndrug-related crime.\n\n  In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, \n``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.'' In that report, I posed \nthe question, ``If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find \na medical `cure' for this disease?'' The report gave the answer ``No.'' \nUnfortunately, now a decade later, the answer remains the same. \nDeveloping new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among \nour highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this \nmodest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to \naddress the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we \neffectively throw up our hands and do nothing.\n  Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing \nmedications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a \nheightened understanding of the physiologist and psychological \ncharacteristics of drug addiction and a greater base of neuroscientific \nresearch.\n  One example of this promising research is the recent development of a \ncompound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against \nthe effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by \nstimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks \ncocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a \nwhole new avenue for combating addiction.\n  Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat \ncocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance \nabuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the \nnecessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines.\n  Privarte industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies \nfor a variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties \ndistributing medication to the target population, and fear of being \nassociated with substance abusers. We need to create financial \nincentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market \nthese treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between \nprivate industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active \nmarketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to \nall addicts in need of treatment.\n  While pharmacotherapies alone are not a ``magic bullet'' that will \nsolve our national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to \nfill a gap in current treatment regimens. The disease of addiction \noccurs for many reasons, including a variety of personal problems which \npharmaco therapy cannot address. Still, by providing a treatment \nregimen for drug abusers who are not helped by traditional methods, \npharmacotherapy holds substantial promise for reducing the crime and \nhealth crisis that drug abuse is causing in the United States.\n\n  The New Medicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1999 would encourage and \nsupport the development of medicines to treat drug addiction in three \nways.\n  It reauthorizes and increases funding for Medications Development \nProgram at the National Institute of Health, which for years has been \nat the forefront of research into drug addition.\n  The bill also creates two new incentives for private sector companies \nto undertake the difficult but important task of developing medicines \nto treat addiction.\n  First, the bill would provide additional patient protections for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, \npharmacotherapies could be designated `orphan drugs' and qualify for an \nexclusive seven-year patent to treat specific addiction. These \nextraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of \npharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that \ninvest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was \ncontained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but \nwas never acted on by Congress.\n  Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but \nshift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to \nthe government. This approach would create a financial incentive for \ndrug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to \navoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance \nabusers.\n  The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop \nstrict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats \ncocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the government must \npurchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed \nit. The purchase rights for the patent rights is established by\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nlaw: $100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million \nfor a drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the government has purchased \nthe patent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and \ndistributing it to clinics, hospitals, state and local governments, and \nany other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs.\n  This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market \ninefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to \ntreat addiction and require the government to take on the \nresponsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform.\n  America's drug problems is reduced each and every time a drug abuser \nquits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer \nhospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected \nchildren. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment \noptions such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on \nadvancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much \nin years to come. The question isn't ``Can we afford to pursue a \npharmacotherapy strategy?'' but rather, ``Can we afford not to?''\n  Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to \nspeed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in \npharmaco therapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without \nrectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, \napproach to addressing one of our Nation's most serious domestic \nchallenges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                 S. 885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to impose a \nmoratorium on the foreign visitors program at the Department of \nEnergy's (DOE) nuclear laboratories. The bill prohibits the Secretary \nof Energy from admitting any person from a ``sensitive country'' to our \nnational laboratories, unless the Secretary of Energy personally \ncertifies to the Congress that the visit is necessary for the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  A ``sensitive country'' is a country that is considered dangerous to \nthe United States and that may want to acquire our nuclear weapons \nsecrets.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of \nthe Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly ten \nyears. Beginning in 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding \nand personnel dedicated to protecting our nation's nuclear secrets. \nYear after year, the Committee has provided additional funds and \ndirected many reviews and studies in an effort to persuade the \nDepartment of Energy to take action. Unfortunately, this and prior \nadministrations failed to heed our warnings. Consequently, a serious \nespionage threat at our national labs has gone virtually unabated and \nit appears that our nuclear weapons program may have suffered extremely \ngrave damage.\n  Now, the administration has finally begun to take affirmative steps \nto address this problem. While I welcome their efforts, I am \ndisappointed that it took a some bad press to motivate them rather than \na known threat to our national security. Nevertheless, the Department \nof Energy has begun the process of repairing the damage caused by years \nof neglect, but it will take time to make the necessary changes. In \nfact, it may take years.\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\n  In the interim, we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our \nnational labs. I understand that a moratorium on the foreign visitors \nprogram may be perceived as a draconian measure. Until the Department \nfully implements a comprehensive and sustained counterintelligence \nprogram, however, I believe that we must err on the side of caution. \nThe stakes are too high.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MORATORIUM ON FOREIGN VISITORS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--The Secretary of Energy may not admit to \n     any facility of a national laboratory any individual who is a \n     citizen of a nation that is named on the current Department \n     of Energy sensitive countries list.\n       (b) Waiver Authority.--(1) The Secretary of Energy may \n     waive the prohibition in subsection (a) on a case-by-case \n     basis with respect to specific individuals whose admission to \n     a national laboratory is determined by the Secretary to be \n     necessary for the national security of the United States.\n       (2) Before any such waiver takes effect, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives a \n     report in writing providing notice of the proposed waiver. \n     The report shall identify each individual for whom such a \n     waiver is proposed and, with respect to each such individual, \n     provide a detailed justification for the waiver and the \n     Secretary's certification that the admission of that \n     individual to a national laboratory is necessary for the \n     national security of the United States.\n       (3)(A) A waiver under paragraph (1) may not take effect \n     until a period of 10 days of continuous session of Congress \n     has expired after the date of the submission of the report \n     under paragraph (2) providing notice of that waiver.\n       (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only \n     by an adjournment of the Congress sine die; and\n       (ii) there shall be excluded from the computation of the \n     10-day period specified in that subparagraph Saturdays, \n     Sundays, legal public holidays, and any day on which either \n     House of Congress in not in session because of adjournment of \n     more than three days to a day certain.\n       (4) The authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1) may \n     not be delegated.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe air transportation tax changes made by the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1977; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      Air passenger taxes on flights to and from alaska and hawaii\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, along with Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nStevens, and Mr. Inouye, I am introducing legislation that will provide \na measure of relief to the citizens of Alaska and Hawaii who must rely \non air transport far more than citizens in the lower 48.\n  When Congress adopted the balanced budget legislation in 1997, one of \nthe provisions of the tax bill re-wrote the formula for calculating the \nair passenger tax for domestic and international flights. As part of \nthis formula change, Congress adopted a per passenger, per segment fee \nwhich disproportionately penalizes travelers to and from Alaska and \nHawaii who have no choice but to travel by air.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would reinstate the prior \nlaw 10 percent tax formula for flights to and from our states. In \naddition, the $6 international departure fees that are imposed on such \nflights would be retained at the current level and would not be \nindexed. I see no reason why passengers flying to and from our states \nmust face a guaranteed increase in tax every year because of inflation. \nWe don't index tobacco taxes, we don't index fuel taxes; why should \ngovernment automatically gain additional revenue from air passengers \nsimply because of inflation?\n  Mr. President, this legislation requires that intrastate Alaska and \nHawaii flights will be subject to a flat 10 percent tax if such flights \ndo not originate or terminate at a rural airport in our states. In \naddition, the definition of a rural airport is expanded to include \nairports within 75 miles of each other where no roads connect the \ncommunities. This provision not only benefits Alaska, but many island \ncommunities throughout the United States. In many towns in Alaska, air \ntransport is the only viable means of transportation from one community \nto another. There is no reason these airports should be denied the \nbenefit of the special rural airport tax rate simply because our state \ndoes not have the transportation infrastructure or geographic \ndefinition that exists in most of the lower 48.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for investment necessary to revitalize communities within \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               commercial revitalization tax act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Cochran, the Commercial Revitalization Tax \nCredit Act of 1999. This bill is identical to the bipartisan and widely \nsupported legislation I sponsored during the last session of Congress.\n  This measure will create jobs, expand economic activity, and \nrevitalize the\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\nphysical structure and value of residential and commercial buildings in \nAmerica's most distressed urban and rural communities.\n  The bill provides a targeted tax credit to businesses to help defray \nthe cost of construction, expansion, and renovation in these areas, and \nin the process will generate billions in privately based economic \nactivity in those areas that need the most help in our country.\n  As we continue to look for ways to combat the decay of our inner \ncities and to raise the standard of living in many of our rural areas, \nI believe, and numerous studies demonstrate, that reversing the \nphysical deterioration in America's cities has numerous and far \nreaching economic benefits. Revitalization in decaying neighborhoods \nlifts the hopes and expectations of the residents of those areas that \neconomic growth and opportunity is coming their way. Indeed, one of the \nkey recommendations of a top-to-bottom review of law enforcement in \nthis city, our Nation's Capital, was to improve the many abandoned \nbuildings in Washington, D.C. that create an atmosphere conducive to \ncrime and despair.\n  The Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act will build upon the \nempowerment zone/enterprise community program that is now unfolding \nover 100 communities in the United States. Texas has five of these \nspecially designated areas: Houston, Dallas, El Paso, San Antonio, and \nWaco, as well as one rural zone in the Rio Grande valley covering four \ncounties. Not only will these cities qualify for the credit under my \nbill, but so will the 400 communities in the United States that sought \nsuch designation but were not selected. State-established enterprise \nzones and other specifically designated revitalization districts \nestablished by State and local governments will also be able to \nparticipate. In all, over 1,000 areas will qualify for this credit \nnationwide.\n  Our bill contains the following principle features: A tax credit that \nmay be applied to construction amounting to at least 25 percent of the \nbasis of the property, in designated revitalization areas; qualified \ninvestors could choose a one-time 20-percent tax credit against the \ncost of new construction or rehabilitation. Alternatively, a business \nowner could take a five percent credit each year over a 10-year period. \nTax credits would be allocated to each state, according to a formula, \nwith States and localities determining the priority of the projects. In \nall, $1.5 billion in tax credits would be allocated under this tax \nbill.\n  Mr. President, with a minimum level of bureaucratic involvement and \nthrough a proven tax mechanism, this initiative will make a significant \ndifference in the lives of thousands of families in need and for the \neconomies of hundreds of distressed urban and rural communities across \nthis Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this sound and \neffective pro-growth initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 890. A bill to facilitate the naturalization of aliens who served \nwith special guerrilla units or irregular forces in Laos; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               hmong veterans' naturalization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act of 1999. I \ncommend the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] and our colleague in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Vento, for their commitment \nto this important issue.\n  I honor the service of the Lao and Hmong veterans to the United \nStates, and appreciate the great personal risk they faced when they \nchose to help this country. I am pleased that many of them have chosen \nto make the United States, and my home state of Wisconsin, their \nadopted homeland.\n  In my view, Mr. President, this bill, which would expedite the \nnaturalization process for 45,000 Lao and Hmong veterans and their \nspouses, is the least we can for the help repay the huge debt we owe \nthese brave individuals. I have had the opportunity to meet many Lao \nand Hmong veterans and their families as I travel throughout Wisconsin. \nI am struck by the profound importance they place on becoming citizens \nof the United States. This bill would help them reach that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 891 A bill to amend section 922(x) of title 18, United States \nCode, to prohibit the transfer to and possession of handguns, \nsemiautomatic assault weapons, and large capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices by individuals who are less than 21 years of age, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 The Juvenile Gun Loophole Closure Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nclose what I believe is a major loophole in our federal gun laws--a \nloophole which permits 18-20 year-olds to possess handguns, \nsemiautomatic assault weapons, and large capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices.\n  Firearms trace data collected as part of the Youth Crime Gun \nInterdiction Initiative (YCGII) paint a disturbing picture of crime gun \nactivity by persons under 21. In the most recent YCGII Trace Analysis \nReport, the age of the possessor was known for 32,653, or 42.8 percent, \nof the 72,260 crime guns traced. Of these 32,563 guns, approximately \n4,840, or 14.8 percent, were recovered from 18-20 year-olds. Indeed, \nthe most frequent age of crime gun possession was 19 years of age, and \nthe second most frequent was 18 years of age.\n  At the same time, according to the 1997 Uniform Crime Reports, the \nmost frequent age arrested for murder was 18 years of age, and the \nsecond most frequent was 19 years of age. Those aged 18-20 accounted \nfor 22 percent of all arrest for murder in 1997.\n  There are indications that the 18-year old girlfriend of one of the \ntwo gunmen involved in the tragic Littleton, Colorado school shooting \npurchased at least two of the firearms used in the attack. Handgun \npossession by persons 18 or over is not forbidden by Colorado law.\n  The 1968 Gun Control Act prevents federally licensed gun dealers from \nselling handguns to anyone under the age of 21. This ban does not apply \nto sales of handguns by unlicensed persons, however. Federal law only \nstops such persons from selling handguns to anyone under the age of \n18--thus neglecting to ban sales to the 18-20 year-olds who account for \nsuch a significant portion of crime gun traces and murders. In another \ninexplicable oversight, federal law also fails to ban private sales of \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices to persons even under the age of 18.\n  My bill would correct these flaws in our federal gun laws. It would \nban sales by unlicensed individuals of handguns, semiautomatic assault \nweapons, and large capacity ammunition feeding divides to persons under \nthe age of 21. Indeed, it would ban possession of these deadly weapons \nby persons under 21, with exceptions made for young persons who are \nmembers of the Armed Forces or National Guard or use these firearms in \nself-defense against an intruder to their residences.\n  This is a common-sense measure that will keep guns out of the hands \nof those most likely to use guns irresponsibly and dangerously. I urge \nthe Senate to pass this bill into law soon. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the subpart F exemption for active financing income; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                Subpart F Exception for Active Financing\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation on \nbehalf of myself, Mr. Baucus. Mr. Mack, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Murkowski, and \nMr. Breaux. This bill would permanently extend the exclusion from \nSubpart F for active financing income earned on business operations \noverseas. This legislation permits American financial services firms \ndoing business abroad to defer U.S. tax on their earnings from their \nforeign financial services operations until such earnings are returned \nto the U.S. parent company.\n\n  The permanent extension of this provision is particularly important \nin today's global marketplace. Over the last few years the financial \nservices industry has seen technological and global changes that have \nchanged the very nature of the way these corporations do business both \nhere and abroad. The U.S. financial industry is a global leader and \nplays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international \nmarketplace. It is essential that our tax laws adapt to the fast-paced \nand ever-changing business environment of today.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide a consistent, \nequitable, and stable international tax regime for this important \ncomponent of our economy. A permanent extension of this provision will \ngive American companies much deserved stability. The current ``on-\nagain, off-again'' system of annual extension limits the ability of \nU.S.-based firms to compete fully in the marketplace and interferes \nwith their decision making and long-term planning. The activities that \ngive rise to this income are long-range in nature, not easily stopped \nand started on a year-to-year basis. Permanency is the only thing that \nmakes sense. After all, the vast majority of the provisions in the tax \ncode are permanent; it is only a select few that are subjected to this \nannual cycle of extensions.\n  This legislation will give U.S. based financial services companies \nconsistency and stability. The permanent extension of this exclusion \nfrom Subpart F provides tax rules that ensure that the U.S. financial \nservices industry is on an equal competitive footing with their foreign \nbased competitors and, just as importantly, provides tax treatment that \nis consistent with the tax treatment accorded most other U.S. \ncompanies.\n  This legislation provides the U.S. financial services industry the \ncertainty that they will be able to compete with their foreign \ncompetitors now and into the 21st century. This is important to our \nfuture economic growth and continued global leadership of American \ncompanies in the financial services industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT SUBPART F EXEMPTION FOR ACTIVE FINANCING \n                   INCOME.\n\n       (a) Banking, Financing, or Similar Businesses.--Subsection \n     (h) of section 954 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to special rule for income derived in the active \n     conduct of banking, financing, or similar businesses) is \n     amended by striking paragraph (9).\n       (b) Insurance Businesses.--Subsection (a) of section 953 of \n     such Code (defining insurance income) is amended by striking \n     paragraph (10) and by redesignating paragraph (11) as \n     paragraph (10).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years of a foreign corporation \n     beginning after December 31, 1998, and to taxable years of \n     United States shareholders with or within which such taxable \n     years of such foreign corporation end.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Hatch in introducing legislation to permanently extend the \nexception from Subpart F for active financing income earned on overseas \nbusiness.\n  United States companies doing business abroad are generally allowed \nto pay U.S. tax on the earnings from the active operations of their \nforeign subsidiaries when these earnings are returned to the U.S. \nparent company. Until recently, U.S.-based finance companies such as \ninsurance companies and brokers, banks, securities dealers, and other \nfinancial services firms, have not been afforded similar treatment. The \ncurrent law provision that is intended to afford America's financial \nservices industry parity with other segments of the U.S. economy \nexpires at the end of 1999. Our legislation, intended to keep the U.S. \nfinancial services industry on an equal footing with foreign-based \ncompetitors, would make this provision permanent.\n  The financial services sector is the fastest growing component of the \nU.S. trade in services surplus (which is expected to exceed $80 billion \nthis year). It is therefore very important that Congress act to \nmaintain a tax structure that does not hinder the competitive efforts \nof the U.S. financial services industry. That would be the case if the \nactive financing exception to Subpart F were permitted to expire.\n  The growing interdependence of world financial markets has \nhighlighted the urgent need to rationalize U.S. tax rules that \nundermine the ability of American financial services industries to \ncompete in the international arena. It is important to ensure that the \nU.S. tax treatment of worldwide income does not encourage avoidance of \nU.S. tax through the sheltering of income in foreign tax havens. \nHowever, I believe it is possible to adequately protect the federal \nfisc without jeopardizing the international expansion and \ncompetitiveness of U.S.-based financial services companies, including \nfinance and credit entities, commercial banks, securities firms, and \ninsurance companies.\n  This active financing provision is particularly important today. The \nU.S. financial services industry is second to none, and plays a pivotal \nrole in maintaining confidence in the international marketplace. \nThrough our network of tax treaties, we have made tremendous progress \nin negotiating new foreign markets for this industry in recent years. \nOur tax laws should complement, rather than undermine, this trade \neffort.\n  As is the case with other tax provisions such as the Research and \nDevelopment tax credit, the temporary nature of the U.S. active \nfinancing exception denies U.S. companies the certainty enjoyed by \ntheir foreign competitors. U.S. companies need to know the tax \nconsequences of their business operations. Over the last two years, \nU.S. companies have implemented numerous system changes in order to \ncomply with two very different versions of the active financing law, \nand are unable to take appropriate strategic action if the tax law is \nnot stable.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and \nprovide a consistent, equitable, and stable international tax regime \nfor the U.S. financial services industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 893. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, to provide \nequitable treatment with respect to State and local income taxes for \ncertain individuals who perform duties on vessels; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 transportation worker tax fairness act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nTransportation Worker Tax Fairness Act. This legislation will ensure \nthat transportation workers who toil away on our nation's waterways \nreceive the same tax treatment afforded their peers who work on the \nnation's highways, railroads, or navigate the skies.\n\n  Truck drivers, railroad personnel, and airline personnel are \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\ncovered by the Interstate Commerce Act, which exempts their income from \ndouble taxation. Water carriers, who work on tugboats or ships, were \nnot included in the original legislation. This treatment is patently \nunfair. The Transportation Worker Tax Fairness Act will rectify this \nsituation by extending the same tax treatment to personnel who work on \nthe navigable waters of more than one state.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will have no impact on the federal \ntreasury. This measure simply allows those who work our navigable \nwaterways protection from double taxation.\n  This matter came to my attention through a series of constituent \nletters from Columbia River tug boat operators who are currently facing \ntaxation from Oregon as well as Washington state. I am committed to \npursuing this avenue of relief for my constituents, as well as hard \nworking tug boat operators across the nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake permanent the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and to ratify a \nSouthern Dairy Compact. I am so pleased to be joined by 38 of my \ncolleagues as original cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  In 1996, Senator Leahy and I fought an uphill battle and secured \neleventh hour passage of this landmark legislation. We were met with \nresistance in every step of the legislative process, yet we succeeded \nin passing the Compact as a three-year pilot program.\n  The Northeast Compact has a proven record of effectiveness. All eyes \nhave been on New England since the compact became law. The Compact has \nbeen studied, audited, and sued--but has always come through with a \nclean bill of health. Because of the success of the Compact it has \nserved as a model for the entire country. Since the Northeast Compact \nwas approved by Congress as part of the 1996 Farm Bill, it has been \nextremely successful in balancing the interests of processors, \nretailers, consumers, and dairy farmers by helping to maintain milk \nprice stability.\n  The 1996 Farm Bill authorized the Dairy Compact for three years and \nwas originally due to expire in April of 1999. Senator Leahy and I, \nduring the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill, included language that \nextended the life of the Compact for six additional months. The Compact \nwill expire on October 1, 1999, unless congressional action is taken.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the six New England states, 23 states \nhave either passed or are considering legislation for dairy compacts \nthat would help both farmers and consumers in their states. During the \npast year Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have \npassed legislation to form a Southern Dairy Compact. Florida, Georgia, \nMissouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas are also considering joining the \nSouthern Compact. The Oregon legislature is in the process of \ndeveloping a Pacific Northwest Dairy Compact as well.\n  New Jersey, Maryland and New York have passed state legislation \nenabling them to join the Northeast Dairy Compact. Delaware, \nPennsylvania and Ohio may also join if passed in their states. These \nstates have recognized how dairy compacts can help provide stability to \nthe price paid to dairy farmers for the milk they produce, while \nprotecting the interests of consumers and processors. The Dairy Compact \nCommission that was established by the 1996 Compact legislation is made \nup of 26 members from the six New England states. The members, which \nare appointed by each state's governors, consist of consumers, \nprocessors, farmers and other state representatives.\n\n  The legislation being introduced today, establishes that the dairy \ncompacts may regulate only fluid milk, or Class I milk. It ensure that \nthe dairy compacts compensate the Commodity Credit Corporation for the \ncost of any purchases of milk by the corporation that result from the \noperation of the compacts. In addition, the legislation exempts the \nWoman, Infant and Children (WIC) program from any costs related to the \ndairy compacts. More importantly, the Daily Compact operates at no \ncosts to the federal government.\n  A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the \neconomic effects of the Dairy Compact illustrates the Compact's \nsuccess. The OMB reported that during the first six months of the \nCompact, consumer prices for milk within the Compact region were five \ncents lower than retail store prices in the rest of the nation. OMB \nconcluded that the Compact added no federal costs to nutrition programs \nduring this time, and that the Compact did not adversely affect farmers \noutside the Compact region.\n  Helping farmers protect their resources and receive a fair price for \ntheir products in vital to Vermont's economic base and, indeed, its \nvery heritage as a state. Establishing a fair price for dairy farmers \nhas been an on-going battle throughout my time on Capitol Hill. Few \ninitiatives in my long memory have sparked such a vigorous policy \ndebate as the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am so pleased and proud at how \nindustry and government leaders from throughout Vermont and the New \nEngland region pulled together to pass the Compact. I am also impressed \nby the tremendous coalition of support for permanent authorization of \nthe Northeast and Southern Dairy Compacts.\n  The adoption of the Northeast Compact in 1996 simply could not have \nhappened in Congress without the help and dedicated work for the \nveritable army of Compact supporters from throughout Vermont and the \ncountry. This year, our legislation again is supported by Governors, \nState legislators, consumers and farmers from throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, on March 5, 1999, the Basic Formula Price (BFP) paid \nto farmers dropped from $16.27 to $10.27, the largest month to month \ndrop in history, bringing the lowest milk price in about 20 years to \ndairy farmers. In the beginning of April the full impact to farmers was \n$7.07 per hundredweight loss from December of 1998's BFP. This drop in \nprice will have a severe negative impact on dairy producers from \nthroughout the country. In New England, the Dairy Compact that \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nexists will help cushion the price collapse, with no cost to the \nfederal government.\n  Farmers from throughout Vermont and New England have praised the \nCompact for helping maintain a stable price. ``Without the Northeast \nDairy Compact, we would be in real trouble, the price drop would put a \nlot of people of out business.'' Simply it's a blessing--no, that's an \nunderstatement--it's a lifesaver''.\n  Mr. President, earlier today, I joined several of my Senate and House \ncolleagues on the Capitol lawn to announce the introduction of this \nimportant legislation. I was so pleased to see the support and interest \nfor this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Give \nthe states their right to join together to help protect their farmers \nand consumers by supporting this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to continue my support for dairy \nfarmers by introducing legislation which will make permanent the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact and will authorize the Southern \nInterstate Dairy Compact.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has proven itself to be a \nsuccessful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and consumers \nthroughout New England, and we want to make sure that this partnership \ncontinues.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact has done exactly what it was established \nto do: stabilize fluctuating dairy prices and keep New England dairy \nfarmers in business. The Compact provides the perfect safety net for \ndairy farmers. When milk prices are high, dairy farmers receive no \nbenefits. When milk prices are low, the Compact takes effect, providing \ntemporary benefits to dairy farmers. Yet the Compact costs taxpayers \nnothing. I don't need to tell you that a zero cost is very unusual \namong farm programs.\n  The Compact makes a big difference in the lives of dairy farmers in \nNew England. Since the Compact went into effect one and a half years \nago, the attrition rate for farms has declined throughout New England. \nIn fact, the Vermont Department of Agriculture recently announced that \nsince July of last year, there has actually been an increase in farms \nin Vermont. Just a few years ago, an increase in the number of farms \nwould have been unfathomable. Solid dairy prices coupled with the \nsafety net of the Dairy Compact have caused a rebound in the dairy \nindustry in New England. We can achieve similar success in the South \nwith a Southern Dairy Compact.\n  Many of our allies from the South have watched the Northeast Dairy \nCompact survive several legal and political challenges. They have \nwatched milk sales continue without interruption. They have seen the \nparticipation in the WIC nutrition program rise because of help from \nthe compact. And, most important, they see how the compact provides a \nmodest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, too, want \nthe same for their farmers and their farmers deserve the opportunity to \ncreate their own regional compact.\n  Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-supported \nvoluntary programs. And the need for regional compacts has never been \ngreater. Low dairy prices coupled with a disastrous decision on federal \nmilk marketing reform have made the compact more important to us now \nthan ever before. Our legislation is a huge step toward ensuring that \nthe safety net of the Compact will continue.\n  The fight to continue the Northeast Compact and create the Southern \nCompact, however, will be tough. Opponents of regional compacts--large \nand wealthy milk manufacturers, represented by groups such as the \nInternational Dairy Foods Association--will again throw millions of \ndollars into an all-out campaign to stop the compacts. And they will \nsay anything to stop it.\n  Some of the most common anti-Compact rhetoric that I have heard \nsuggests that the Compact creates a barrier for trade between states \nwithin the Compact and states outside of it. On the contrary, as \nreported by the Office of Management and Budget, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact has in fact prompted an increase in interstate dairy sales--\nparticularly for milk coming into New England.\n  Another common anti-Compact argument concerns the impact of the \nCompact on consumers. However, New England retail milk prices under the \nDairy Compact continue to be lower on average than the rest of the \nnation.\n  Processor groups who are opposed to dairy compacts simply want milk \nas cheap as they can get it to boost their enormous profits to record \nlevels, regardless of the impact on farmers. But at some point if a lot \nof dairy farmers go out of business, IDFA and others might regret what \nthey have caused.\n  Make no mistake--I do believe that dairy processors deserve to make \ntheir fair share of income. However, the farmers that produce the milk \ndeserve to make a fair living. And a fair living is what dairy compacts \nprovide for farmers.\n  Compacts have been consumer tested and farmer approved, and I look \nforward to making them a permanent part of our dairy industry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues from \nVermont, Senators Jeffords and Leahy, in introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact and to authorize a Southern \nDairy Compact.\n  This legislation will create a much needed safety net for dairy \nfarmers and will bring greater stability to the prices paid monthly to \nthese farmers. The fill authorizes an Interstate Compact Commission to \ntake such steps as necessary to assure consumers of an adequate local \nsupply of fresh fluid milk and to assure the continued viability of \ndairy farming within the compact region. Specifically, states that \nchoose to join the compact would enter into a voluntary agreement to \ncreate a minimum price for milk within the compact region. This price \nwould take into account the regional differences in the costs of \nproduction for milk, thereby providing dairy farmers with a fair and \nequitable price for their product.\n  This bill would authorize Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New \nYork, Maryland, and Ohio to join the existing Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact. New York, New Jersey, and Maryland have already agreed \nto join and the Pennsylvania State Legislature is currently considering \ncompact legislation. Further, it would authorize states in the southern \npart of the country to form a similar compact to provide price \nstability in this region.\n  In order to ensure that this legislation does not provide a negative \nimpact to low-income nutrition programs that use a large quantity of \ndairy products each year, the bill ensures that the Women, Infants and \nChildren (WIC) program and the School Lunch program will not be \nrequired to pay higher prices for milk as a result of any action taken \nby the Compact Commission.\n  Over the past several years, I have worked closely with my colleagues \nin the Senate in order to provide a more equitable price for our \nnation's milk producers. I supported amendments to the Farm Bills of \n1981 and 1985, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 1991, \nthe Budget Resolution of 1995 and the most recent Farm Bill in 1996 in \nan effort to insure that dairy farmers receive a fair price. As a \nmember of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nhave worked to ensure that dairy programs have received the maximum \npossible funding. In the past four years alone, I have worked to obtain \nalmost $1.1 million for dairy research conducted at Penn State \nUniversity. I have also been a leading supporter of the Dairy Export \nIncentive Program which facilitates the development of an international \nmarket for United States dairy products.\n  In recent years, however, dairy farmers have faced the dual problems \nof a record high cost of feed grain and a record drop in the Basic \nFormula Price paid for dairy products. Prices have fluctuated greatly \nover the past several years, setting new record highs and lows, thereby \nmaking any long-term planning impossible for farmers. Most recently, \nafter reaching an all time high in December of 1998, the Basic Formula \nPrice for milk dropped $5.72 per hundredweight to a price of $11.62 for \nMarch 1999. These economic conditions have placed our nation's dairy \nfarmers in an all but impossible position. In order to hear the \nproblems that dairy farmers are facing first hand, I asked Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman to accompany me to northeastern Pennsylvania \non February 10, 1997. We met a crowd of approximately 750 angry farmers \nwho\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nrightfully complained about the dramatic fluctuations in the price of \nmilk.\n  Upon our return to Washington, in an attempt to bring greater \nstability to the dairy market, I introduced a Sense of the Senate \nResolution on February 13, 1997 which passed by a vote of 83-15. The \nResolution stated that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider \nacting immediately to replace the National Cheese Exchange as a factor \nto be considered in setting the Basic Formula Price for Dairy. I \nsuccessfully attached an amendment to the 1997 Supplemental \nAppropriations Act which required the Department of Agriculture to \nreplace the National Cheese Exchange, which had proven to be an \nunreliable source of price information, with a systematic national \nsurvey of cheese producers. As a result of this legislation, the Basic \nFormula Price increased from $12.46 in February of 1997 to $13.32 in \nFebruary of 1998, which represented an increase of .86 cents per \nhundredweight over the course of the year.\n  Unfortunately, this action alone was not sufficient to bring long-\nterm stability to the dairy market. Consequently, on April 17, 1997, I \nintroduced legislation to require the Secretary of Agriculture to use \nthe price of feed grains and other cash expenses in determining the \nbasic formula price for milk. Further, on September 9, 1997, I joined \nwith Senator Feingold of Wisconsin in introducing S. Res. 119, which \nurged the Secretary of Agriculture to set a temporary minimum milk \nprice that was equitable to all milk procedures nationwide and provided \nprice relief to economically stressed milk producers.\n  When we began to see some momentum on the national level to reform \nthe current milk pricing system, we were stopped by a Federal District \nCourt, which in December of 1997 ordered the USDA to scrap the price \ndifferentials in the current milk pricing formula. This change would \nhave had a major negative impact on the dairy farmers in Pennsylvania. \nIn reaction to this decision, on December 4, 1997, I wrote to the \nfederal judge, asking him to stay his decision striking down the \ncurrent Class I dairy pricing formula pending appellate review. Sixty-\nfive Congressman and twenty other Senators signed onto my letter and on \nDecember 5, 1997, the Judge granted the requested stay.\n  After this short victory, we received further bad news earlier this \nyear, when Secretary Glickman released a new rule for setting the Basic \nFormula Price for dairy. While better than the proposed rule released \nlast year, this new pricing formula will compound the already dire \neconomic position of dairy farmers by removing an additional $196 \nmillion each year from the dairy industry nationwide.\n  Our nation's farmers are some of the hardest working and most \ndedicated individuals in America. In the past several years, I have \nvisited numerous small dairy farms in Pennsylvania. I have seen these \nhard working men and women who have dedicated their lives to their \nfarms. The recent drop in dairy prices is an issue that directly \naffects all of us. We have a duty to ensure that our nation's dairy \nfarmers receive a fair price for their milk. If we do nothing, many \nsmall dairy farmers will be forced to sell their farms and leave the \nagriculture industry. This will not only impact the lives of these \nfarmers, but will also have a significant negative impact on the rural \neconomies that depend on the dairy industry for support. Further, the \nlarge-scale departure of small dairy farmers from agriculture could \nplace our nation's steady supply of fresh fluid milk in jeopardy, \nthereby affecting every American.\n  We must recognize the importance of this problem and take prompt \naction. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation as we \ncontinue to work in Congress to bring greater stability to our nation's \ndairy industry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of a Joint \nResolution to reauthorize the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I am \nproud to give my support to this measure and do so without hesitation \nbecause the New England Dairy Compact is a proven success that is \ncritical to the survival of dairy farmers in Maine and New England.\n  First approved by Congress in the 1996 Farm Bill, the New England \nDairy Compact already has a proven track record of quantifiable \nbenefits to both consumers and farmers. The Compact works by simply \nevening out the peaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing \nstability to the cost of milk and ensuring a supply of fresh, \nwholesome, local milk.\n  Over the past eight months, in particular, the Compact has proven its \nworth. As prices climbed and farmers were receiving a sustainable price \nfor milk, the Compact turned off, when prices dropped, the Compact was \nagain triggered. The Compact simply softened and slowed the blow to \nfarmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile fluid milk \nmarket.\n  It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the \nCompact. Not only does the Compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding \ndramatic fluctuation in the retail cost of milk, it also guarantees \nthat the consumer is assured the availability of a supply of fresh, \nlocal milk. We've known for a long time that dairy products are an \nimportant part of a healthy diet, but recent studies are proving that \ndairy products provide a host of new nutritional benefits. Just as we \nare learning of the tremendous health benefits of dairy foods, however, \nmilk consumption, especially among young people, is dropping. It is a \ncrucial, common-sense, first step to reverse this trend, for milk to be \navailable and consistently affordable for young families.\n  Finally, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy \nproducers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm \nfarmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998 report by the \nOffice of Management and Budget showed that, during the first six-\nmonths of the Compact, it did not adversely impact farmers from outside \nthe Compact region and added no federal costs to nutrition programs. In \nfact, this legislation specifically excepts the Women, Infants and \nChildren (WIC) program from any costs related to the Compact.\n  I would like to thank the Senators from Vermont for their leadership \non this critical issue. I look forward to working with them to see this \nimportant resolution passed.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Senate \nJoint Resolution not only in support of the reauthorization and \nmodifications for the very successful Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact, but also to grant the consent of Congress for the formation of \nthe Southern Dairy Compact. This issue is really a state rights issue \nmore than anything else, Mr. President. Quite simply, it addresses the \nneeds of states in two different areas of the country, one in the North \nand one in the South, who wish to work together within their regions \nfor two different and totally independent dairy compacts--in the \nNortheast to continue and modify their current Compact, and in the \nSoutheast where 10 states wish to work closely together--to form a \ncompact for determining fair prices for locally produced supplies of \nfresh milk.\n  As recently as last September, the Congress sanctioned another \ninterstate compact, one that allows states to set regional prices for a \ncommodity. In passing the Texas Compact for the storage of low-level \nradioactive waste, the states of Texas, Maine and Vermont were given \npermission to jointly manage and dispose of their low level waste--and \nare free to set any price they wish for the disposal of the waste. \nCongress has now approved ten such compacts involving 45 states.\n  All we are doing here is continuing another states rights activity--\ndairy compacting, an idea whose time has now come throughout different \nregions of the country. Currently, New Jersey and Maryland have passed \nDairy Compact legislation seeking to join the Northeast Compact. In \naddition. Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio have expressed \ninterest in joining. A state may join the Compact if they are \ncontiguous to a participating state and Congress approves its entry, \nand we are asking for Congressional approval to extend this right also \nto New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact currently encompasses all New England \nstates and builds on the existing Federal milk marketing order program \nfor Class I, or fluid, milk, and only applies to fluid milk sold on \ngrocery store shelves. As you may know, a federal milk marketing order \nis a regulation that already sets a minimum milk price in different \nareas around the\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\ncountry, of which the Northeast region is one, and is voluntarily \ninitiated and approved by a majority of producers in each milk \nmarketing order area, which places requirements on the first buyers or \nhandlers of milk from dairy farmers.\n  Currently, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact allows the New \nEngland milk marketing order region to add a small increment to the \nFederal order price for that region, which is the floor price, so only \nthe consumers and the processors in the New England region pay to \nsupport the minimum price to provide for a fairer return to the area's \nfamily dairy farms and to protect a way of life important to the people \nof the Northeast.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has provided \nthe very safety net that we had hoped for when the Compact passed as \npart of the Freedom to Farm Act, the omnibus farm bill, of 1996. The \nDairy Compact has helped farmers maintain a stable price for fluid milk \nduring times of volatile swings in farm milk prices. In the spring and \nsummer months of 1997 and 1998, for instance, when milk prices \nthroughout most U.S. markets dropped at least 20 cents a gallon while \nconsumer prices remained constant, the payments to Northeast Interstate \nCompact dairy farmers remained above the federal milk marketing prices \nfor Class I fluid milk because of the Dairy Compact--and, I might add, \nat no expense to the federal government. The costs to operate the Dairy \nCompact are borne entirely by the farmers and processors of the Compact \nregion.\n  Also, in considering what has happened to the number of dairy farms \nstaying in business since the formation of the Dairy Compact, it is now \nknown that throughout New England, there has been a decline in the loss \nof dairy farmers since the Compact started. This is a clear \ndemonstration that, with the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the \ndairy producers were provided a safety net--and when there has been a \nrise in the federal milk marketing prices for Class I fluid milk, the \nCompact has automatically shut itself off from the pricing process.\n  Mr. President, over ninety seven percent of the fluid milk market in \nNew England is self contained within the area, and fluid milk markets \nare local due to the demand for freshness and because of high \ntransportation costs, so any complaints raised in other areas about \nunfair competition are a bit disingenuous. In addition, the Compact \nrequires the compact commission to take such action as necessary to \nensure that a minimum price set by the commission for the region does \nnot create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies \nof milk. No other region should feel threatened by our Northeast Dairy \nCompact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at home.\n  It should be noted that, in the farm bill conference in 1996, the \nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture was required to review the dairy compact \nlegislation before implementation to determine if there was \n``compelling public interest'' for the Compact within the Compact \nregion. On August 9, 1996, and only after a public comment period, \nSecretary Glickman authorized the implementation of the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, finding that it was indeed in the compelling \npublic interest to do so.\n  In addition, the Agriculture Appropriations Act for FY1998 directed \nthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to study the economic effects \nof the Compact and especially its effects on the federal food and \nnutrition programs, such as the Womens, Infants and Children program. \nKey findings of the OMB study released in February of 1998, showed \nthat, for the first six months of the Compact, New England retail milk \nprices were five cents per gallon lower than retail milk prices \nnationally. Also, the Compact did not add any costs to federal \nnutrition programs like the WIC program and the school breakfast and \nlunch programs. The GAO study also stated that the Compact economically \nbenefitted the dairy producers, increasing their income from milk sales \nby about six percent, with no adverse affects to dairy farmers outside \nthe Compact region.\n  Mr. President, the consumers in the Northeast Compact area, and now \nother areas around the country, are showing their willingness to pay \nmore for their milk if the additional money is going directly to the \ndairy farmer. Environmental organizations have also supported dairy \ncompacting as compacts help to preserve dwindling agricultural land and \nopen spaces that help combat urban sprawl.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues for the reauthorization of the \nNortheast Compact and the ratification of the Southern Compact.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with 35 of my fellow \nSenators to introduce legislation to re-authorize the Northeast Dairy \nCompact and extend it to New York State. This legislation is vital to \nthe Northeast Region and it will strengthen the economy of upstate New \nYork.\n  The Compact may add a couple of cents to the consumer price of milk \nduring months when the retail price of milk falls below a federally set \nminimum price, but it is a small price to pay to preserve the family \ndairy farm in rural New York.\n  The purpose of the Compact is to stabilize dairy prices and therefore \nenable small dairy farmers to budget their expenditures and plan for \nthe future. The Northeastern Dairy Compact works by ensuring a minimum \nretail price for milk producers. The price paid to farmers for milk has \nfallen from $2.77 in 1960 to $1.36 in 1997. These low milk prices have \nforced many small farmers into insolvency over the years and have put \nthe entire concept of family farms in peril.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact will preserve the American tradition of \nlocal family farms in every region. I believe that this is a tiny price \nto pay to keep local farmers in business, and keep New York State's \nrural identity intact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

I am pleased to be joined by Senators Wellstone, Thomas, \nSarbanes and Brownback as original cosponsors.\n  While much time on the Senate floor has been devoted to America's \nresponse to the natural disaster wrought by Hurricane Mitch in Central \nAmerica and the human disaster wrought by the horrifying aggression in \nthe Balkans, little has been devoted to those organizations conducting \nhumanitarian relief efforts in those areas.\n  I am proud to note that several Oregon humanitarian organizations \nhave been on the front lines in both Central America and the Balkans--\nparticularly in Kosovo. Mercy Corps International based in Portland, \nOregon, is one of the largest humanitarian agencies helping Kosovar \nAlbanian refugees and first began work in that area in 1993. Over the \npast six years, the agency has provided more than $30 million in relief \nand development aid to 250,000 people in the area.\n  Whether it be providing food, blankets, clothing, hygiene and cooking \nutensils to the first onslaught of refugees, or managing refugee camps \nin Senekos, Mercy Corps International has made humanitarian aid a \npriority in a desperate situation.\n  In Central America, Mercy Corps' Hurricane Mitch relief efforts \nincluded evacuating thousands of children and families, delivering \nhousing materials for tents and temporary shelter, and providing more \nthan 200,000 pounds of\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nfood to the hungry and 60 tons of clothing and blankets to the \nhomeless. I am truly proud of Oregon's Mercy Corps International.\n  Mercy Corps is not alone as a humanitarian presence in Oregon. \nPortland's Northwest Medical Team International has provided disaster \nresponse and emergency relief to refugees of wars and to victims of \nhurricanes, floods and famines. Each year, Northwest Medical Teams \nInternational recruits, equips and dispatches volunteer surgical, \nmedical and redevelopment teams to areas of the world in need of this \ntype of humanitarian aid and assistance.\n  Northwest Medical Teams International ships more than $50 million in \nhumanitarian assistance to over 50 countries each year. Currently, \nNorthwest Medical Teams International is helping to manage the flow of \nhumanitarian aid and to assist refugees in the Balkans and is \ncollecting donations for humanitarian aid in the region through its \nKosovo Relief Fund.\n  These two Oregon humanitarian organizations embody what is good in \nAmerica--the noble effort to reach out and help a neighbor in need, \nregardless of geography, cultural or linguistic differences. This \noutreach from non-governmental organizations deserves far more than \nthis resolution, it deserves the sincere acknowledgment and thanks from \neach citizen of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4286-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 86--SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL RAILROAD HALL OF FAME, \n                      INC.

Res. 86\n\n       Whereas Galesburg, Illinois, has a profound link to the \n     history of railroading beginning in 1849 when the Peoria and \n     Oquawka Railroad organized;\n       Whereas the citizens of Galesburg supported a railroad to \n     Chicago which was chartered as the Central Military Tract \n     Railroad in 1851;\n       Whereas Galesburg and Chicago were joined by rail in 1854; \n     as a result of this union, the Northern Cross Railroad joined \n     the Central Military Tract Railroad at Galesburg;\n       Whereas in 1886 Galesburg secured the Atchison, Topeka, and \n     Santa Fe Railway and became one of the few places in the \n     world to possess 2 mega-powers of the railroad industry;\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc. has been \n     established in Galesburg and has reserved the name ``National \n     Railroad Hall of Fame'' with the Secretary of the State of \n     Illinois;\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc. is \n     organized and incorporated as a not-for-profit organization \n     under the laws of Illinois;\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc. filed a \n     service mark registration with the Commissioner of Patents \n     and Trademarks of the United States, covering the name and \n     logo of the organization;\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc. has \n     applied for a charter under the State of Illinois;\n       Whereas the objectives of the National Railroad Hall of \n     Fame, Inc. include--\n       (1) perpetuating the memory of leaders and innovators in \n     the railroad industry;\n       (2) fostering, promoting, and encouraging a better \n     understanding of the origins and growth of railroads, \n     especially in the United States; and\n       (3) establishing and maintaining a library and collection \n     of documents, reports, and other items of value to contribute \n     to the education of future railroad students; and\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc. has \n     resolved to erect a monument known as the National Railroad \n     Hall of Fame to honor men and women who actively participated \n     in the founding and development of the railroad industry in \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the National Railroad \n     Hall of Fame, Inc., of Galesburg, Illinois, in its endeavor \n     to erect a monument known as the National Railroad Hall of \n     Fame.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, to submit a resolution in support \nof the establishment of the National Railroad Hall of Fame in \nGalesburg, Illinois.\n  The state of Illinois has played a pioneering role in the growth of \nthe railroad industry. In 1849, the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad was \norganized. The city of Galesburg joined Chicago by rail six years later \nin 1854. In addition, the Carl Sandburg College of Galesburg was one of \nthe first colleges to establish an educational curriculum in \nrailroading.\n  This privately-funded museum will help promote and encourage a better \nunderstanding of the origins and growth of the railroad industry. It \nwill also highlight the efforts of men and women whose hard work and \nresourcefulness helped build one of the nation's best modes of \ntransportation.\n  Already, the Illinois General Assembly, with the unqualified support \nof our state's new governor, George Ryan, has passed a resolution \nsimilar to the one I am introducing today. This resolution is also \nsupported by major railways, railroad organizations, and rail employee \norganizations. Nineteen members of the House of Representatives have \ncosponsored an identical measure in the House. Approval by the Senate \nwill be one more step toward establishing this museum.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely \nfashion so that we can properly honor the railroad industry and its \nmany pioneers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4286-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4286-S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 87--TO COMMEMORATE THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                     INTERNATIONAL VISITORS PROGRAM\n\n  By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Moynihan) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the committee on foreign \nrelations:\n\n                               S. Res. 87\n\n       Whereas the year 2000 marks the 60th Anniversary of the \n     International Visitors Program.\n       Whereas the International Visitors Program is the public \n     diplomacy initiative of the United States Department of State \n     that brings distinguished foreign leaders to the United \n     States for short-term professional programs under the \n     authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act \n     of 1961.\n       Whereas the purposes of the International Visitors Program \n     include--\n       (1) increasing mutual understanding and strengthening \n     bilateral relations between the United States and other \n     nations;\n       (2) developing the web of human connections essential for \n     successful economic and commercial relations, security \n     arrangements, and diplomatic agreements with other nations; \n     and\n       (3) building cooperation among nations to solve global \n     problems and to achieve a more peaceful world;\n       Whereas during 6 decades more than 122,000 emerging leaders \n     and specialists from around the world have experienced \n     American democratic institutions, cultural diversity, and \n     core values firsthand as participants in the International \n     Visitors Program;\n       Whereas thousands of participants in the International \n     Visitors Program rise to influential leadership positions in \n     their countries each year;\n       Whereas among the International Visitors Program alumni are \n     185 current and former Chiefs-of-State or Heads of \n     Government, and more than 600 alumni have served as cabinet \n     level ministers;\n       Whereas prominent alumni of the International Visitors \n     Program include Margaret Thatcher, Anwar Sadat, F.W. de \n     Klerk, Indira Gandhi, and Tony Blair;\n       Whereas a new configuration of domestic forces has emerged \n     which is shaping global policy and empowering private \n     citizens to an unprecedented degree;\n       Whereas each year more than 80,000 volunteers affiliated \n     with 97 community-based member organizations and 7 program \n     agency members of the National Council for International \n     Visitors across the United States are actively serving as \n     ``citizen diplomats'' organizing programs and welcoming \n     International Visitors Program participants into their homes, \n     schools, and workplaces;\n       Whereas all of the funds appropriated for the International \n     Visitors Program are spent in the United States, and such \n     spending leverages private contributions at a ratio of 1 to \n     12;\n       Whereas the International Visitors Program corrects \n     distorted images of the United States, effectively countering \n     misperceptions, underscoring common human aspirations, \n     advancing United States democratic values, and building a \n     foundation for national and economic security;\n       Whereas the International Visitors Program provides \n     valuable educational opportunities for United States citizens \n     through special ``Back to School With International Visitor'' \n     programs and events that increase the knowledge of Americans \n     about foreign societies and cultures, and bring attention to \n     international issues crucial to interests of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the International Visitors Program offers emerging \n     foreign leaders a unique view of America, highlighting its \n     vibrant private sector, including both businesses and non-\n     profit organizations, through farm stays, home hospitality, \n     and meetings with their professional counterparts; and\n       Whereas the International Visitors Program introduces \n     foreign leaders, specialists,\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n     and scholars to the American tradition of volunteerism \n     through exposure to the daily work of thousands of ``citizen \n     diplomats'' who share the best of America with those foreign \n     leaders, specialists, and scholars: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 60th Anniversary of the International \n     Visitors Program and the remarkable public-private sector \n     partnership that sustains it; and\n       (2) commends the achievements of the thousands of \n     volunteers who are part of the National Council for \n     International Visitors ``citizen diplomats'' who for 6 \n     decades have daily worked to share the best of America with \n     foreign leaders, specialists, and scholars.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Bond and I are joining \ntogether in submitting a resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary \nof the International Visitors Program next year. The International \nVisitors Program is the State Department's public diplomacy initiative \nthat brings distinguished foreign leaders to the United States for \nshort-term professional programs under the authority of the Mutual \nEducational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.\n  The International Visitor Program has been wonderfully successful in \nmeeting its public diplomacy mission. Thousands of rising leaders from \nother countries in government, business, labor, academia, and the arts \nhave come to this country and met with their counterparts and with \neveryday Americans from all walks of life. They have learned about our \ndemocratic values and institutions, our entrepreneurial skills, and our \nculture.\n  Future foreign leaders have learned much about this country that has \nhelped them shape their own, or that simply helped them understand this \ncountry's point of view. I wonder how many people in this country know \nthe story of F.W. de Klerk's visit to the United States under the \nInternational Visitor Program, and how influential that visit was in \nhis realization that apartheid in South Africa had to end. Perhaps more \nwell known, at least in my part of the country, were the visits of \nPolish Solidarity Labor leaders who played a pivotal role in \ntransforming Poland to the democratic country it is today. I am sure \nthere are many more stories--most not so dramatic--but with tangible \nresults all over the world. We will never know how many problems have \nbeen prevented because rising leaders had a better understanding of \ndemocracy, of our policies, and our culture.\n  Many up-and-coming political leaders come to visit Members of \nCongress and Senators while they're here. These meetings take a few \nminutes of my time, and I learn as much from my visitor as I hope he or \nshe does from me. Volunteers always tell me that they, too, have \nlearned much from their visitors, and we should not underestimate the \nvalue of this program as a two-way street that helps educate the \nvolunteers, their children, and other people in their communities.\n  But I want to commend and thank those thousands of Americans who have \nopened their homes, their businesses, and their hearts to international \nvisitors with such a tremendous impact on furthering international \nunderstanding. I deeply appreciate it that international visitors do \nnot just come to Washington, but that the program takes them into our \ncountry's heartland so they can get a real education about our country, \noutside the Beltway, as they say. That means that volunteers from all \nover the country are critical for the success of the program.\n  I know in my own State of Illinois, there are six such volunteer \ngroups in Chicago, Freeport, Geneseo, Paris, Sterling, and Springfield. \nI have heard first-hand the deep commitment many Illinoisans have to \nthis program, because I know many enthusiastic volunteers. Because of \nthe commitment of Illinois volunteers, our State is among the most \nactive in the Nation in hosting international visitors, along with the \nmuch larger States of California and Texas.\n  But when we commemorate this anniversary I want to be sure that we're \ncelebrating the contribution and commitment of the thousands of \nvolunteers that make the program meaningful and successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4287-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 267\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Burns) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n96) to regulate commerce between and among the several States by \nproviding for the orderly resolution of disputes arising out of \ncomputer-based problems related to processing data that includes a 2-\ndigit expression of that year's date; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``section'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n     1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\n     avoid projects aimed at curing year 2000 computer date-change \n     problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7.

or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence a legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\n     paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the notice and \n     remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\n     regarding any actual or potential year 2000 problem of that \n     business or organization which would likely result in \n     actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Material Defect Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     an estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A)(i) a substantial majority of the members of the \n     proposed plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (ii) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (iii) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State, or\n\n       (B) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or \n     other governmental entities against whom the United States \n     District Court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n       (d) Effect on Rules of Civil Procedures.--Except as \n     otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section \n     supersedes any rule of Federal or State civil procedure \n     applicable to class actions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 268\n\n  Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to amendment No. 267 proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``section'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n     1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Y2K action.--The term ``Y2K action''--\n       (A) means a civil action commenced in any Federal or State \n     court, or an agency board of contract appeal proceeding, in \n     which the plaintiff's alleged harm or injury resulted \n     directly or indirectly from an actual or potential Y2K \n     failure, or a claim or defense is related directly or \n     indirectly to an actual or potential Y2K failure;\n       (B) includes a civil action commenced in any Federal or \n     State court by a governmental entity when acting in a \n     commercial or contracting capacity; but\n       (C) does not include an action brought by a governmental \n     entity acting in a regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement \n     capacity.\n       (2) Y2K failure.--The term ``Y2K failure'' means failure by \n     any device or system (including any computer system and any\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\n     microchip or integrated circuit embedded in another device or \n     product), or any software, firmware, or other set or \n     collection of processing instructions to process, to \n     calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, to store, to \n     transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related data, \n     including failures--\n       (A) to deal with or account for transitions or comparisons \n     from, into, and between the years 1999 and 2000 accurately;\n       (B) to recognize or accurately to process any specific date \n     in 1999, 2000, or 2001; or\n       (C) accurately to account for the year 2000's status as a \n     leap year, including recognition and processing of the \n     correct date on February 29, 2000.\n       (3) Government entity.--The term ``government entity'' \n     means an agency, instrumentality, or other entity of Federal, \n     State, or local government (including multijurisdictional \n     agencies, instrumentalities, and entities).\n       (4) Material defect.--The term ``material defect'' means a \n     defect in any item, whether tangible or intangible, or in the \n     provision of a service, that substantially prevents the item \n     or service from operating or functioning as designed or \n     according to its specifications. The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendent knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendent.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\n     in proportion to the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant, except that the total liability of a defendant \n     under this clause may not exceed 50 percent of the \n     proportionate share of that defendant, as determined under \n     subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy; and\n       (5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any \n     individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the \n     dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.\n       (b) Person to Whom Notice To Be Sent.--The notice required \n     by subsection (a) shall be sent--\n       (1) to the registered agent of the prospective defendant \n     for service of legal process;\n       (2) if the prospective defendant does not have a registered \n     agent, then to the chief executive officer of a corporation, \n     the managing partner of a partnership, the proprietor of a \n     sole proprietorship, or to a similarly-situated person for \n     any other enterprise; or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\n     to the nature and amount of each element of damages and the \n     factual basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\n     failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including any \n     appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, or \n     alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n     action may recover contribution from any other person who, if \n     joined in the original action, would have been liable for the \n     same damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined \n     based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and \n     of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy; and\n       (5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any \n     individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the \n     dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.\n       (b) Person to Whom Notice To Be Sent.--The notice required \n     by subsection (a) shall be sent--\n       (1) to the registered agent of the prospective defendant \n     for service of legal process;\n       (2) if the prospective defendant does not have a registered \n     agent, then to the chief executive officer of a corporation, \n     the managing partner of a partnership, the proprietor of a \n     sole proprietorship, or to a similarly-situated person for \n     any other enterprise; or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n     parties, other than damage caused only to the property that \n     experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\n     to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, \n     utilities, Government, and safety and defense systems, in the \n     United States and throughout the world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff \n     is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility \n     of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the \n     loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

or\n       (3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to \n     receive pre-litigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet \n     Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated \n     person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to \n     the Internet.\n       (c) Response to Notice.--\n       (1) In general.--Within 30 days after receipt of the notice \n     specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall \n     send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each \n     prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging \n     receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has \n     taken or will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff.\n       (2) Willingness to engage in adr.--The Written statement \n     shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to \n     engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (3) Inadmissibility.--A written statement required by this \n     paragraph is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of \n     the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of \n     evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability \n     for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or \n     otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in \n     compromise negotiations.\n       (4) Presumptive time of receipt.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received \n     7 days after it was sent.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--If a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c)(1); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff,\n\n     the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence at legal \n     action against that prospective defendant.\n       (e) Remediation Period.--\n       (1) In general.--If the prospective defendant responds and \n     proposes remedial action it will take, of offers to engage in \n     alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective \n     plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional \n     60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete \n     the proposed remedial action before commencing a legal action \n     against that prospective defendant.\n       (2) Extension by agreement.--The prospective plaintiff and \n     prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day \n     remediation period by written agreement.\n       (3) Multiple extensions not allowed.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no \n     more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled.--Any applicable \n     statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action \n     to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the \n     notice and remediation period under that paragraph.\n       (f) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the \n     expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in \n     subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's \n     complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the \n     plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as \n     such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after \n     filing of the complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during the appropriate period.\n       (g) Effect of Contractual or Statutory Waiting Periods.--In \n     cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before \n     January 1, 1999, requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over \n     the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (h) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Nothing in \n     this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law \n     or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.\n       (i) Provisional Remedies Unaffected.--Nothing in this \n     section interferes with the right of a litigant to \n     provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil \n     procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in \n     any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both \n     injunctive and monetary relief.\n       (j) Special Rule for Class Actions.--For the purpose of \n     applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a \n     class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of \n     the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named \n     plaintiffs in the class action.\n\n     SEC. 8. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Application With Rules of Civil Procedure.--This \n     section applies exclusively to Y2K actions and, except to the \n     extent that this section requires additional information to \n     be contained in or attached to pleadings, nothing in this \n     section is intended to amend or otherwise supersede \n     applicable rules of Federal or State civil procedure.\n       (b) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2K actions in \n     which damages are requested, there shall be filed with the \n     complaint a statement of specific information as to the \n     nature and amount of each element of damages and the factual \n     basis for the damages calculation.\n       (c) Material Defects.--In any Y2K action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that there is a material defect in a \n     product or service, there shall be filed with the complaint a \n     statement of specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (d) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2K action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect \n     to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts \n     giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 9. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10. APPLICATION OF EXISTING IMPOSSIBILITY OR COMMERCIAL \n                   IMPRACTICABILITY DOCTRINES.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, \n     the applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by the law in \n     existence on January 1, 1999. Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16. Y2K ACTIONS AS CLASS ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) Minimum Injury Requirement.--A Y2K action involving a \n     claim that a product or service is defective may be \n     maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to \n     that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules \n     of civil procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service \n     as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the \n     members of the class.\n       (b) Notification.--In any Y2K action that is maintained as \n     a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice \n     required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct \n     notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall \n     include--\n       (1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the \n     action;\n       (2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and\n       (3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the \n     hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the \n     percentage of the final award which will be paid, including \n     as estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the \n     requested damages were to be granted.\n       (c) Forum for Y2K Class Actions.--\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     Y2K action may be brought as a class action in a United \n     States District Court or removed to a United States District \n     Court if the amount in controversy is greater than the sum or \n     value of $1,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), \n     computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--A Y2K action may not be brought or removed \n     as a class action under this section if--\n       (A) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed \n     plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;\n       (B) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and\n       (C) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the \n     law of that State, or\n     the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other \n     governmental entities against whom the United States District \n     Court may be foreclosed from ordering relief.\n       (D) This section shall become effective three days after \n     the date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 271\n\n  Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to amendment No. 270 proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       In the language proposed to be striken, strike all after \n     the word ``1'' and add the following:\n\n     SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF SECTIONS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Y2K Act''.\n       (b) Table of Sections.--The table of sections for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December \n     31, 1999.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects, including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses and individuals \n     who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly \n     small businesses and individuals who already find the legal \n     system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power of the Congress under \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the \n     United States, the purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before \n     they develop;\n       (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing \n     efforts by providers, suppliers, customers, and other \n     contracting partners;\n       (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to \n     resolve Y2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in \n     order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to \n     initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to \n     encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K \n     problems; and\n       (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the \n     ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real \n     injury to obtain complete relief.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The term ``material defect'' \n     does not include a defect that--\n       (A) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     operation or functioning of an item or computer program;\n       (B) affects only a component of an item or program that, as \n     a whole, substantially operates or functions as designed; or\n       (C) has an insignificant or de minimis effect on the \n     efficacy of the service provided.\n       (5) Personal injury.--The term ``personal injury'' means \n     physical injury to a natural person, including--\n       (A) death as a result of a physical injury; and\n       (B) mental suffering, emotional distress, or similar \n     injuries suffered by that person in connection with a \n     physical injury.\n       (6) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory \n     or possession of the United States, and any political \n     subdivision thereof.\n       (7) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means a contract, \n     tariff, license, or warranty.\n       (8) Alternative dispute resolution.--The term ``alternative \n     dispute resolution'' means any process or proceeding, other \n     than adjudication by a court or in an administrative \n     proceeding, to assist in the resolution of issues in \n     controversy, through processes such as early neutral \n     evaluation, mediation, minitrial, and arbitration.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF ACT.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--This Act applies to any Y2K action \n     brought in a State or Federal court after February 22, 1999, \n     for a Y2K failure occurring before January 1, 2003, including \n     any appeal, remand, stay, or other judicial, administrative, \n     or alternative dispute resolution proceeding in such an \n     action.\n       (b) No New Cause of Action Created.--Nothing in this Act \n     creates a new cause of action, and, except as otherwise \n     explicitly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act expands \n     any liability otherwise imposed or limits any defense \n     otherwise available under Federal or State law.\n       (c) Claims for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death \n     Excluded.--This Act does not apply to a claim for personal \n     injury or for wrongful death.\n       (d) Contract Preservation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in any Y2K \n     action any written contractual term, including a limitation \n     or an exclusion of liability, or a disclaimer of warranty, \n     shall be strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that \n     term would manifestly and directly contravene applicable \n     State law embodied in any statute in effect on January 1, \n     1999, specifically addressing that term.\n       (2) Interpretation of contract.--In any Y2K action in which \n     a contract to which paragraph (1) applies is silent as to a \n     particular issue, the interpretation of the contract as to \n     that issue shall be determined by applicable law in effect at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n       (e) Preemption of State Law.--This Act supersedes State law \n     to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable to \n     a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing \n     in this Act implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of \n     a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n     SEC. 5. PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages are permitted by applicable law, the defendant shall \n     not be liable for punitive damages unless the plaintiff \n     proves by clear and convincing evidence that the applicable \n     standard for awarding damages has been met.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant in such a Y2K action \n     may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (3) No cap if injury specifically intended.--Neither \n     paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies if the plaintiff \n     establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in a Y2K action \n     may not be awarded against a government entity.\n\n     SEC. 6. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and \n     (c), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a \n     Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the \n     judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportional \n     responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage \n     of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall \n     determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault \n     of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or \n     contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (b) Proportionate Liability.--\n       (1) Determination of responsibility.--In any Y2K action, \n     the court shall instruct the jury to answer special \n     interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall \n     make findings with respect to each defendant, including \n     defendants who have entered into settlements with the \n     plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning--\n       (A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each \n     defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all \n     persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff; and\n       (B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant--\n       (i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (ii) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings.--The \n     responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) \n     shall specify the total amount of damages that the\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\n     plaintiff is entitled to recover and the percentage of \n     responsibility of each defendant found to have caused or \n     contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (3) Factors for consideration.--In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier \n     of fact shall consider--\n       (A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have \n     caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; \n     and\n       (B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship \n     between the conduct of each defendant and the damages \n     incurred by the plaintiff.\n       (c) Joint Liability for Specific Intent or Fraud.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the \n     liability of a defendant in a Y2K action is joint and several \n     if the trier of fact specifically determines that the \n     defendant--\n       (A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or\n       (B) knowingly committed fraud.\n       (2) Fraud; Recklessness.--\n       (A) Knowing commission of fraud described.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the \n     defendant--\n       (i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with \n     actual knowledge that the statement was false;\n       (ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be \n     misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the \n     omission, the statement was false; and\n       (iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely \n     on the false statement.\n       (B) Recklessness.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the \n     defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to \n     injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.\n       (3) Right to contribution not affected.--Nothing in this \n     section affects the right, under any other law, of a \n     defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant \n     found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under \n     paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with \n     specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly \n     committed fraud.\n       (d) Special Rules.--\n       (1) Uncollectible share.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon \n     motion not later than 6 months after a final judgment is \n     entered in any Y2K action, the court determines that all or \n     part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for \n     compensatory damages is not collectible against that \n     defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable \n     for the uncollectible share as follows:\n       (i) Percentage of net worth.--The other defendants are \n     jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if \n     the plaintiff establishes that--\n       (I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable \n     damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 \n     percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and\n       (II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.\n       (ii) Other plaintiffs.--For a plaintiff not described in \n     clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the \n     uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant, except that the total \n     liability of a defendant under this clause may not exceed 50 \n     percent of the proportionate share of that defendant, as \n     determined under subsection (b)(2).\n       (B) Overall limit.--The total payments required under \n     subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the \n     amount of the uncollectible share.\n       (C) Subject to contribution.--A defendant against whom \n     judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to \n     any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.\n       (2) Special right of contribution.--To the extent that a \n     defendant is required to make an additional payment under \n     paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution--\n       (A) from the defendant originally liable to make the \n     payment;\n       (B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally \n     liable;\n       (C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable \n     who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than \n     that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; \n     or\n       (D) from any other person responsible for the conduct \n     giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to \n     make the same payment.\n       (3) Nondisclosure to jury.--The standard for allocation of \n     damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the \n     procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to \n     members of the jury.\n       (e) Settlement Discharge.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who settles a Y2K action at \n     any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged \n     from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. \n     Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall \n     enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all \n     obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant \n     arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future \n     claims for contribution arising out of the action--\n       (A) by any person against the settling defendant; and\n       (B) by the settling defendant against any person other than \n     a person whose liability has been extinguished by the \n     settlement of the settling defendant.\n       (2) Reduction.--If a defendant enters into a settlement \n     with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the \n     verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of--\n       (A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant; or\n       (B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.\n       (f) General Right of Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--A defendant who is jointly and severally \n     liable for damages in any Y2K action may recover contribution \n     from any other person who, if joined in the original action, \n     would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for \n     contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and of each person against \n     whom a claim for contribution is made.\n       (2) Statute of limitations for contribution.--An action for \n     contribution in connection with a Y2K action shall be brought \n     not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, \n     nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except than an \n     action for contribution brought by a defendant who was \n     required to make an additional payment under subsection \n     (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date \n     on which such payment was made.\n       (g) More Protective State Law Not Preempted.--Nothing in \n     this section pre-empts or supersedes any provision of State \n     statutory law that--\n       (1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to \n     a lesser amount than the amount determined under this \n     section; or\n       (2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from \n     joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRE-LITIGATION NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall send a written notice by \n     certified mail to each prospective defendant in that action. \n     The notice shall provide specific and detailed information \n     about--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the \n     prospective defendant to remedy the problem;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy;

DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, \n     aware, including information made available by the defendant \n     to purchasers or users of the defendant's product or services \n     concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed as limiting or impairing a party's right to assert \n     defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 11. DAMAGES LIMITATION BY CONTRACT.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages \n     unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was effective or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A party to a Y2K action making a tort \n     claim may not recover damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party; or\n       (2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure (other \n     than damage to property that is the subject of the contract \n     between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there \n     is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused \n     only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable State law.\n       (b) Economic Loss.--For purposes of this section only, and \n     except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and \n     enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action, the term ``economic loss''--\n       (1) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than losses described in subsection \n     (a)(2); and\n       (2) includes amounts awarded for damages such as--\n       (A) lost profits or sales;\n       (B) business interruption;\n       (C) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (D) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (E) losses that must be plead as special damages; and\n       (F) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).\n       (c) Certain Actions Excluded.--This section does not \n     affect, abrogate, amend, or alter any patent, copyright, \n     trade-secret, trademark, or service-mark action, or any claim \n     for defamation or invasion of privacy under Federal or State \n     law.\n       (d) Certain Other Actions.--A person liable for damages, \n     whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which \n     this Act does not apply because of section 4(c), whose \n     liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K \n     failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State \n     law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to \n     the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.\n\n     SEC. 13. STATE OF MIND; BYSTANDER LIABILITY; CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action other than \n     a claim for breach of repudiation of contract, and in which \n     the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the \n     defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that \n     elements of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Limitation on Bystander Liability for Y2K Failures.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any Y2K action for money \n     damages in which--\n       (A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or \n     distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that \n     suffers or causes the Y2K failure at\n       (B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the \n     defendant; and\n       (C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim \n     under applicable law,\n\n     the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in \n     addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the \n     claim, proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known \n     and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.\n       (2) Substantial privity.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), \n     a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, \n     in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of \n     professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either \n     have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff \n     is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such \n     services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by \n     the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the \n     services were being performed.\n       (3) Certain claims excluded.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     is an element of the claim under applicable law do not \n     include claims for negligence but do include claims such as \n     fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \n     negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract \n     or economic advantage.\n       (c) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or \n     otherwise within the control of the party against whom a \n     claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the \n     sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in \n     a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a \n     failure is governed by the terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 14. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) is not personally liable in any Y2K action in \n     that person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\n     the business or organization for more than the greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability is imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) made statements intended to be misleading regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) withheld from the public significant information there \n     was a legal duty to disclose regarding any actual or \n     potential year 2000 problem of that business or organization \n     which would likely result in actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law in existence on January 1, 1999, that \n     establishes lower financial limits on the liability of a \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n     SEC. 15. APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTERS OR MAGISTRATES FOR \n                   Y2K ACTIONS.\n\n       Any District Court of the United States in which a Y2K \n     action is pending may appoint a special master or a \n     magistrate to hear the matter and to make findings of fact \n     and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n     SEC. 16.

The old \nfacility, which has served so faithfully for so many decades, had \nreached the limits of its productivity in February 1997, when the \nrecord snowfall created great stress on the roof. The need for action \nwas immediate, and the Sisseton Community responded quickly.

Local businesses and individuals responded \ngenerously. The new fire hall is now a reality. It has become a true \nemergency operating center that the entire Sisseton community can look \ntoward with pride.\n  I commend the entire community for this exemplary effort, and hold it \nup as a shining example of the sense of community which still exists in \nplaces like Sisseton, SD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4307-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4307-S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAESTRO COLMAN PEARCE\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, when the Mississippi Symphony \nOrchestra concludes its 54th season with its traditional ``Pops \nConcert'' in Jackson on May 7, Maestro Colman Pearce will retire after \ntwelve years as music director and principal conductor. During his \ntenure, Pearce has brought life and vigor to the mission of the \nMississippi Symphony Orchestra. He has projected\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\nenormous energy into the task of developing audiences from preschoolers \nto senior citizens, and all ages in between.\n  Maestro Pearce is a gifted conductor of international renown with a \nbrilliant knowledge of musical styles and repertoire. He is an equally \ngifted pianist and composer. His keen Irish wit, personal charm, \nenthusiasm, and intellect, combined with a willingness to spread the \njoy of music whenever and wherever, and special gifts.\n  When Colman came to Mississippi in 1987, he found a group of superb \nplayers, an enthusiastic Board of Governors, and a loyal army of \nvolunteers known as the Symphony League. He was aware of a financial \ndeficit, of unrest among the musicians, and of declining audience \nsupport. Quickly garnering the support of the board, league and the \nmusicians, Maestro Pearce forged ahead. After a few successful seasons, \nhe led the orchestra into statewide status and it became the \nMississippi Symphony.\n  Colman's musicianship, intellect, vision, and savoir faire have made \nhim an appealing stage presence in venues beyond the formal concert \nhalls. He has taken the MSO everywhere audiences can be found--ball \nparks, schools, city streets, shopping malls, theaters, lakesides, and \nbeaches. Thousands of Mississippians have come to recognize Colman and \nthe musicians by name and by instrument. They have identified with the \nSymphony as a Mississippi ``product'' of which they are proud. The \nSymphony has become an accessible commodity across the State.\n  Upgrading the quality of musical offerings, especially in formal \nconcert halls, has been his major focus. However, he has expanded the \ngoals and outreach to include programs at all levels:\n  Chamber Orchestra.--Twenty-eight core musicians present concerts \nwithin the regular season at Millsaps College Recital Hall and the \nBriarwood Presbyterian Church sanctuary. These concerts are viewed as \n``learning experiences'' since the programs are always sprinkled with \nbiographical data and interesting anecdotes about the composers whose \nworks are being performed. Programming is innovative, often including \ncontemporary music. Colman plays twentieth century music with flair, \nchallenging the understanding and enjoyment of both the musicians and \ntheir audiences.\n  Children's Concerts.--More than 4,000 children in grades three, four, \nand five literally pack Jackson's city auditorium annually when Colman \ndirects the special concerts. He assists teachers in area schools in \nthe preparation of study materials to acquaint students with the \nprogram they will hear.\n  Kinderconcerts.--Programs are planned according to the attention span \nof pre-school children with emphasis on short classical and new music. \nColman has featured the work of Mississippi composer Luigi Zananelli \n(``The Steadfast Tin Soldier''), and an adaptation of the Dr. Seuss \nclassic, ``Green Eggs and Ham'', to the delight of the young audiences.\n  Academic and Performing Arts Complex.--This branch of the Jackson \nPublic School system has been supported by Colman through lectures, by \nallowing students to attend orchestra rehearsals, and through \ninvitations to music and dance students to actually perform with the \nSymphony.\n  Young Artist Competition.--In addition to showcasing young talent \nwhenever possible, Colman has judged competitions, offering insightful \nfeedback to contestants. Winners have often been invited to perform \nwith the Chamber Orchestra.\n  Family Fun Concerts.--In addition to enjoyable and easy listening \nmusic performed by the Symphony, the concerts have featured other \nattractions, such as mimes, dancers, and storytellers, in a casual \nsetting. Colman's final Family Fun Concert featured a performance of \nWalter Anderson's ``Robinson the Cat,'' a work composed by Maestro \nPearce in collaboration with mezzo-soprano Lester Senter Wilson.\n  Pops Concerts.--Old Trace Park at the Reservoir has been the scene of \nthe Symphony Pops for many years, with residents of a five county area \ngathering on the shore (and in the water) for an early summer evening \nconcert of semi-classical and popular music.\n  The Messiah.--Under the direction of Maestro Pearce, the Mississippi \nSymphony Orchestra has presented the ``definitive'' performance of \nHandel's Christmas classic in Thalia Mara Hall each December. Soloists \nare chosen from throughout the state, and choirs from the state's \ncolleges and universities have been showcased. In recent years, the \nfamed Mississippi Chorus has been featured.\n  A native of Ireland with an honors degree from the National \nUniversity of Ireland, Dublin, Colman Pearce studied conducting with \nFranco Ferrara in Hilversum and Hans Swarowsky in Vienna. In 1965, he \nbegan a long association with the Irish National Broadcasting \nOrganization, serving as Co-principal, Principal, and now Conductor \nLaureate of the Irish Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra (now \ncalled the National Symphony Orchestra.) In the years prior to \naccepting his position with the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra and \nsince, he has maintained a busy schedule as a guest conductor in other \nparts of the United States, and in Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Germany, \nFrance, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Iceland, Israel, Hungary, and in the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  Maestro Pearce will now concentrate upon his activities as a pianist, \narranger and composer, his recordings of contemporary works, and upon \nguest conducting from his home in Dublin.\n  Colman leaves the Mississippi Symphony Orchestra financially sound, \nhaving established record setting season ticket sales and significantly \nbroadened the orchestra's constituency.\n  When Colman came to Mississippi twelve years ago, he immediately \naccepted and embraced the best in Mississippians and set about adding \nvalue to the state through his development of the orchestra. With his \nIrish charm, good humor, talent, artistic commitment, and resourceful \nprogramming, he has also won the hearts of many Mississippians who now \nbid him ``Goodbye, and Godspeed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4308-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MR. GEORGE RING\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nGeorge Ring who is being honored by Catholic Community Services, the \nlargest non-profit social service agency in the state of New Jersey. \nHeadquartered in Newark, CCS serves more than 200,000 poor and \ndisadvantaged citizens throughout northern New Jersey. George has been \nan ardent supporter of this organization and is most deserving of this \nhonor.\n  George has served New Jersey and the nation in many capacities. After \ngraduating from Seton Hall University, George joined the United States \nArmy and served from 1966-1969 as a Platoon Leader, Company Commander, \nand General's Aide. He received multiple awards and citations for his \nservice, including the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, \nOak Leaf Cluster, and a Presidential Unit Citation.\n  After working several years in the banking industry, George co-\nfounded Cross Country Cable, Ltd. This firm was involved in the \nownership, construction and operation of cable television and microwave \nsystems inside the United States and around the world. In 1995, he sold \nthis company and formed a new company, Wireless Cable International \nInc. George is the president and CEO of this new company.\n  George has been active at his alma mater and in his community. At \nSeton Hall University, he is a member of the Executive and Finance \nCommittees of the Board of Regents and is a member of the Board of \nTrustees. He is also a recipient of the ``Distinguished Alumnus Award'' \nfrom Seton Hall University and Union High School.\n  In addition, George has served on the boards of several visual arts \nprograms and symphony orchestras as well as New Jersey Public \nBroadcasting. He is a past President of the Watchung-Warren Rotary Club \nand has been active with local youth sports leagues. He has given his \nfinancial support to numerous schools and charities. Catholic Community \nServices has been one of the grateful recipients of George's \ngenerosity. He has spent countless hours fundraising on behalf of CCS. \nFor his acts of philanthropy and his visible role in the community, I \nam proud to recognize George Ring as he is honored by CCS.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4309-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n                 HONORING PROFESSOR M. CHERIF BASSIOUNI\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as reports come in detailing the \nevents in Kosovo, the ``ethnic cleansing'' and terror that has forced \nover a million people from their homes, sadness fills our hearts. Less \nthan two weeks ago I traveled to the Balkans and visited a refugee \ncamp, filled with thousands of people, that had been an empty field \njust weeks before. We are often so immersed in the accounts of those \nsurvivors who have lived through the suffering that we forget about the \nmen and women who have dedicated their lives to ease this pain, and to \nbringing those who abuse human rights to justice.\n  Today, I rise to recognize M. Cherif Bassiouni of Chicago, Illinois \nfor his selflessness and dedication to bringing those who commit crimes \nagainst humanity to justice. Professor Bassiouni, facing great personal \nrisk and many obstacles, has visited many war-torn sections of Bosnia \nand Croatia, documenting the atrocities and crimes that have been \ncommitted there. His 3,500 pages of analysis, backed by 300 hours of \nvideotape and 65,000 documents served as the foundation for the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Professor \nBassiouni has also played a key role in the UN Convention against \nTorture.\n  Professor Bassiouni has often been a powerful voice insisting that \nviolators of human rights be brought to justice. Professor Bassiouni is \na Professor of Law and President of the International Human Rights Law \nInstitute at DePaul University in Chicago. The global impact of his \nwork, dating back to 1964, has led to the creation of the International \nCriminal Court. A citizen of both the United States and Egypt, \nProfessor Bassiouni is known and respected around the world for his \naccomplishments. He is the President of the Association Internationale \nde Troit Penal and President of the International Institute of Higher \nStudies in Criminal Science.\n  Professor Bassiouni has accomplished a great deal in his effort to \nsee that human rights are respected. In 1977, Bassiouni co-chaired the \ncommittee that drafted the U.N. Convention Against Torture. He was \nappointed the independent expert by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights \nto draft the statute establishing international jurisdiction over the \nimplementation of the Apartheid Convention of 1981. Bassiouni was the \nChairman of the U.N. Commission investigating international \nhumanitarian law violations in the former Yugoslavia, work that led to \nthe Ad-Hoc Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague. His many \naccomplishments led to his election in 1995 as Vice-Chairman of the \nU.N. General Assembly Committee for the establishment of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n  For his work leading to the establishment of the International \nCriminal Court, and for his dedication to protecting human rights, \nProfessor Bassiouni has been nominated for the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. \nThe nominating organization, the International and Scientific \nProfessional Advisory Council of the UN has said that Professor \nBassiouni was the ``single most driving force behind the global \ndecision to establish the International Criminal Court.'' This court \nprosecutes and brings to justice internationally, those who have \ncommitted crimes against humanity. His accomplishments in this field \nhave caused Professor Bassiouni to be known as the ``father of the \nInternational Criminal Court.''\n  Professor Bassiouni has been a great asset to the people of all \nnations. It was his dedication and perseverance, in the face of great \nodds, that helped create an institution that holds accountable those \nwho choose to commit human rights abuses. The vision of Professor \nBassiouni has culminated in a system that ensures that those who commit \ncrimes against humanity do not go unpunished.\n  Mr. President, M. Cherif Bassiouni has made an important difference \nin the battle against human rights abuses. It is my pleasure to rise \ntoday to pay tribute to his extraordinary work and to congratulate him \non his Nobel Peace Prize nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4309-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS MANSHIP, SR.\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, Louisiana is today mourning the \nloss of a giant in the news media, Douglas Manship, Sr., the chairman \nemeritus of the Baton Rouge Advocate and the founder of WBRZ-TV in \nBaton Rouge.\n  Douglas Manship devoted nearly all of his 80 years to providing the \ncitizens of Louisiana with timely, objective and thorough coverage of \nthe day-to-day events of our state. In the process, he and his family \nhave always set the standard for excellence in news reporting in \nLouisiana, winning dozens of statewide, regional and national \njournalism awards.\n  For most of this century, the Manship name has been synonymous with \njournalism in Louisiana. In fact, the school of mass communications at \nour state's flagship institution of higher learning, Louisiana State \nUniversity, bears the Manship name and has already trained a generation \nof young journalists to follow the example of journalistic excellence \nset by Douglas Manship and his family.\n  Those of us who knew Douglas Manship knew him as someone totally \ncommitted to his community and just as dedicated to the daily \ndissemination of fair and objective news. In almost every way, Douglas \nManship was what a journalist should be. He believed that a public \ngiven the facts on a particular issue would invariably make the right \ndecision. And he fought tirelessly through his newspaper to throw open \nthe closed doors of public bodies all over Louisiana so that citizens \ncould become better informed about the important business that was \nbeing conducted in their behalf.\n  Of course, Douglas Manship's imminent fairness and objectivity didn't \nstop him from expressing his opinion and using his newspaper to \nchampion a cause when he believed his state and his community could do \nbetter. In the early 1960s, long before other southern media leaders \nrecognized the need for racial integration, Douglas Manship used his \nposition at WBRZ-TV to bring Baton Rouge community leaders together to \ndiscuss ways to peacefully achieve racial integration. WBRZ's \ncourageous advocacy on behalf of desegregation resulted in threats of \nviolence against Manship and his station. But he never backed down. And \nI believe that Baton Rouge made great strides because of principled \nleaders like Douglas Manship who put the well-being of his community \nahead of his economic interests.\n  Nothing distinguished Douglas Manship more than the strength of his \ncharacter and his strong sense, as he put it, of who he was. ``If there \nis any attribute that I have that has any meaning,'' he once said, ``it \nis that I know exactly who I am. That's where you get into trouble . . \n. when you think you are something you are not. I believe that after \nall these years I have learned who I am, what my limitations are.''\n  Mr. President, today we remember Douglas Manship as a principled \ncommunity leader, a courageous and fairminded journalist and a loving \nfather and husband. I know that I join with the entire journalistic \ncommunity of my state in saying that his presence and leadership will \nbe sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4309-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4309-S4310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE ARMENIAN VICTIMS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof the 1.5 million ethnic Armenians that were systematically murdered \nat the hands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. The 84th anniversary \nof the beginning of this brutal annihilation was marked on April 24.\n  During this nine year period, another 250,000 ethnic Armenians were \nforced to flee their homes to escape the certain death that awaited \nthem at the hands of a government-sanctioned force determined to \nextinguish their existence. A total of 1.75 million ethnic Armenians \nwere either slaughtered or forced to flee, leaving fewer than 80,000 in \nwhat is present-day Turkey.\n  I have come to the floor to commemorate this horrific chapter in \nhuman history each year I have been a member of this body, both to \nhonor those who died and to remind the American people of the chilling \ncapacity for violence that, unfortunately, still exists in the world. \nIt is all too clear from the current ethnically and religiously \nmotivated conflicts in such\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\nplaces as Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Sudan that we have not learned the \nlessons of the past.\n  The ongoing campaign of violence and hate perpetrated by Slobodan \nMilosevic and his thugs against the Kosovar Albanians is but the latest \nexample of the campaigns of terror carried out against innocent \ncivilians simply because of who they are. These people are not \ncombatants and they have committed no crimes--they are simply ethnic \nAlbanians who wish to live in peace in their homes in Kosovo. But, \nbecause they are ethnic Albanians, they have been murdered or driven \nout, their possessions have been looted, and their homes have been \nburned. Many more are hiding in the mountains of Kosovo, caught in a \ndangerous limbo, afraid to try to flee across the border to safety and \nunable to go home.\n  On April 13, we marked Yom Hashoah, the annual remembrance of the 6 \nmillion Jews who were exterminated by Nazi Germany. People around the \nworld gathered to light candles and read the names of those who died. \nToday, let us take a moment to remember the victims of the 1915-1923 \nArmenian genocide, and all the other innocent people who have died in \nthe course of human history at the hands of people who hated them \nsimply for who they were.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4310-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4310-S4311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE AT TEMPLE BETH AMI\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the recent Community-Wide Memorial Observance of Yom HaShoah \nV'Hagvurah held at Temple Beth Ami in Rockville, Maryland. I had the \nprivilege of participating in this Holocaust remembrance ceremony \nsponsored by the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington. I \ncommend Temple Beth Ami for hosting this annual event and the Jewish \nCommunity Council for providing the community in Maryland and the \nWashington, D.C. area with so many valuable services year-round.\n  The Holocaust represents the most tragic human chapter of the 20th \ncentury when six million Jews perished as the result of a systematic \nand deliberate policy of annihilation. Holocaust remembrance is an \neffort to pay homage to the victims and educate the public about the \npainful lessons of this horrible tragedy.\n  As my colleagues are aware, this month marks the 54th year since the \nbeginning of the liberation of the Nazi death camps in Europe and the \n56th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The occasion also is an \nopportunity to remember the plight of the passengers aboard the S.S. \nSt. Louis who sought to rebuild their shattered lives outside Europe. \nMost of the 937 men, women and children who fled Germany on the St. \nLouis on May 13, 1939 were seeking refuge from Nazi persecution but \nwere turned back months before the outbreak of World War II.\n  In his moving remarks at Temple Beth Ami, Benjamin Meed, the \nPresident of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and a \nsurvivor himself of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, spoke eloquently before \nthis assembly of the importance of overcoming indifference to genocide. \nBen Meed has dedicated himself to working hard along with many other \nsurvivors to ensure that the memory of millions is still with us, and I \nbelieve that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is a fitting \nand exceptional tribute to his efforts. In his words, the Holocaust \nMuseum is ``the culmination of our devotion to Remembrance.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Benjamin Meed's remarks \nat Temple Beth Ami be entered into the Record at this point.\n\n                        Remarks by Benjamin Meed\n\n       It is a special honor to be among such distinguished \n     colleagues, especially Rabbi Jack Luxemburg, vice chairman of \n     the Washington Jewish Community Council and the Rabbi here at \n     Temple Beth Ami; and Manny (Emmanuel) Mandel, chairman of the \n     Jewish Community Council's Holocaust Remembrance Committee.\n       In this lovely new sanctuary that in itself demonstrates \n     the vibrancy of the Jewish community in our nation's capital, \n     we unite with Jewish people everywhere to remember those who \n     were robbed and murdered by the German Nazis and their \n     collaborators--only because they were born as Jews.\n       Tonight, as we come together, we remember the people, \n     places and events that shaped our memories: Memories of our \n     ``childhood,'' of our parents and siblings, of the world \n     which is now so far away. We remember the laughter of \n     children at play, the murmur of prayers at Shul, the warm \n     love of our family gathered for Shabbos meals. That world was \n     shattered by the German Nazis' war against the Jews, while \n     the world of bystanders around us was indifferent.\n       Our memories are full of sorrow. Our dreams are not dreams, \n     but nightmares of final separation from those we loved. \n     Parading before us, when we sleep, are the experiences we \n     endured--the endless years of ghettoes, labor camps, death \n     camps, hiding places where betrayal was always imminent; the \n     forests and caves of the partisans where life was always on \n     the line. And no matter where we were, we were always hungry.\n       Each of us has our own story. Fifty-five years ago, during \n     the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, I was in Krasinski Square, just \n     outside of the walls of the Ghetto. I usually spent my days \n     in the zoo because I knew that the animals could not denounce \n     me to the German Nazis or to their collaborators. To the \n     animals, I was just another human being. But on this Sunday, \n     as an ``Aryan'' member of the Polish community, I went to \n     church together with the Poles.\n       As we came out of church into the Square, I heard the \n     thunder of guns and the explosion of grenades and I could see \n     that the Jewish Ghetto was on fire. It may have been a warm \n     Spring day, but I stood frozen. In front of us in the Square, \n     a carousel was turning around and around. The music attracted \n     my Polish neighbors and their children. I watched in \n     disbelief as they flocked to the merry-go-round, indifferent \n     to the tragedy so nearby. With every cry for help from my \n     Jewish people, tears swelled in my eyes. But the faces of \n     those around me showed no concern, no compassion, not even \n     any interest.\n       The memory of this scene haunts and enrages me. How was it \n     possible for these people to act ``normally'' while Jews, \n     their neighbors for hundreds of years, burned and died inside \n     the Ghetto walls? But they were not the only ones to ignore \n     our plight. Indeed, the entire world stood by. No doors were \n     opened, no policies were changed to make rescue possible. \n     Why? The question cries out for an answer across the decades.\n       If only there had been a State of Israel sixty years ago, \n     how different this story could have been.\n       Tonight, we especially remember the passengers on the S.S. \n     St. Louis--more than nine hundred men, women and children. \n     Robbed of their possessions, stunned and hurt during \n     Kristallnacht, and threatened with their lives, many of them \n     were forced to sign agreements never to return to Germany. \n     Out on the high seas, powerless to affect their outcome, \n     these nine hundred people floated between political \n     infighting and immigration quarrels, both in Cuba and the \n     United States. Their fates were in the hands of others whom \n     they did not know and with whom they had no influence. \n     Finally accepted by four European nations, many of these \n     passengers were swept into ``the Final Solution'' when \n     Western Europe fell to Nazi Germany. Why were these nine \n     hundred denied entry into this country? Why was this tragedy \n     allowed to happen?\n       If only there had been a State of Israel sixty years ago!\n       This year our commemoration falls within the anniversaries \n     of the discovery of Buchenwald concentration camp. On April \n     11, the troops of the United States 6th Armored Division \n     rolled into the camp, just one mile outside Weimer, the \n     birthplace of German democracy. They were followed by the \n     80th Infantry Division on April 12, just 54 years ago \n     tonight. These were war-weary, war-hardened soldiers, but \n     none of their fierce combat had prepared them for \n     Buchenwald--nor for the hundreds of other such camps that \n     American and Allied soldiers came across in their march to \n     end the war in Europe.\n       We will always be grateful to these soldiers for their \n     kindness and generosity, and we will always remember those \n     young soldiers who sacrificed their lives to bring us \n     liberty.\n       Many American GIs who saw the camps join with us in \n     declaring that genocide must not be allowed to happen again. \n     But despite the echoes from the Holocaust, it has--in \n     Cambodia, in Rwanda, in Bosnia, and now in Kosovo.\n       We remember and our hearts go out to those who are caught \n     in the web of destruction.\n       For many years, we survivors were alone in our memories. We \n     spoke among ourselves about the Holocaust, because no one \n     else wanted to hear our stories. Still, we believed that the \n     world must be told--must come to understand the significance \n     of our experiences.\n       Slowly, acceptance of our memories began--at first, only by \n     our fellow Jews, who realized that what we had witnessed was \n     vitally important to them. In time, other people began to \n     understand the meaning and consequences of our \n     experiences. They listened. We survivors were no longer \n     silent presences. We became the bearers of tales--at once \n     painful and precious.\n       We survivors are now publicly bearing witness. We are \n     offering challenges to the indifference of Western \n     governments, to the complicity of the Church, to the anti-\n     Semitism of Christianity, and to the evil of the \n     perpetrators, collaborators and--not the least--to the \n     bystanders. The movement to remember and to record is being \n     led by survivors who accept the burden that history placed \n     upon us.\n       But whatever we know now, there is still so much that we do \n     not know, we cannot\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\n     know. There were the Six Million whose voices were silenced \n     forever. We the few who survived must speak about them even \n     though we cannot truly speak for them.\n       Although living in almost every state of this Union and \n     following many professions, survivors are united by a common \n     memory. We walk the byways of this great country, \n     appreciative of its blessings of freedom and possibilities. \n     We try to express our gratitude for life by the quality of \n     our lives, offering hope and solace, and teaching the mystery \n     of starting anew.\n       And now, over fifty years later, the world has come to \n     Remember with us. In Germany, France, Austria, and England; \n     in Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina; in Australia and New \n     Zealand, as well as Canada, in Israel, and in our own beloved \n     country, Yom Hashoah is on the calendar and commemorations \n     are held in halls of honor. This is how memory is preserved--\n     by determined, directed, dedication to remembering--by \n     telling and retelling the stories of the holocaust.\n       You who live in this city are privileged to have the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum--the culmination of our \n     devotion to Remembrance--to visit at your convenience. This \n     extraordinary institution, the largest Holocaust Museum \n     outside of Yad Vashem, has had more than twelve million \n     visitors in just five years. People come from near and far, \n     both within the United States and from around the world. This \n     Museum represents the fulfillment of our pledge and more. It \n     contains many documents and artifacts that testify about our \n     experiences as well as photographs and notes from our loved \n     ones. But more--it is an expression of the hope of every \n     survivor--that no one anywhere in the world will ever have to \n     endure what we did.\n       And what lessons did we derive from these horrible \n     experiences? The most important lesson is obvious--it can \n     happen again, the impossible is possible again. Ethnic \n     cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak. It can happen \n     to any one or any group of people. The slaughter in Kosovo \n     and in other places must be brought to an end.\n       Should there be another Holocaust, it may be on a cosmic \n     scale. How can we prevent it? All of us must remain \n     vigilant--always aware, always on guard against those who are \n     determined to destroy innocent human life for no other reason \n     than birthright.\n       Just as we survivors have dedicated ourselves to preserving \n     memory and bearing witness, we are now equally determined to \n     make certain, in the little time we have left, that all \n     survivors live out their years in security and dignity. Most \n     of us have accomplished a great deal, but there are those who \n     have been less fortunate. As you know, some live in \n     distressing circumstances. Many are forsaken, afflicted by \n     illness, and, perhaps worst of all, they carry the nightmares \n     of the Holocaust with them.\n       Although the government of Germany has acknowledged to some \n     degree its responsibility for the robbery and murder of our \n     people, the greatest in history, it has not fully assumed its \n     obligations. Recently, some German companies admitted their \n     use of Jewish slave labor during the Holocaust. The \n     government and these companies have offered what they call \n     reparations. But how can they ever provide compensation for \n     our stolen real property, savings accounts, art, jewelry, and \n     personal belongings--the gold in our teeth, the use of our \n     skills and bodies, the pain and suffering inflicted upon each \n     and every one of us? How can there ever be enough money to \n     pay for the wrongful imprisonment, torture, starvation and \n     murder of six million Jews--in their homes, on the streets, \n     in fields and forests, in the gas chambers? Is there a way \n     that they can restore our families, our youth, our health, \n     our sense of personal security? Absolutely not!\n       Germany wants to project a new image to the world, but it \n     cannot be allowed to buy the honor it deserted during the \n     Holocaust. It must account for the horrible atrocities of its \n     past. We must not permit Germany to shift the focus away from \n     its moral and financial responsibility for the slaughter of \n     our people, acts for which there is no statute of \n     limitations. Germany will be eternally responsible for the \n     murder of the Six Million.\n       At the least, Germany must provide appropriate care for the \n     survivors of their atrocities who need help. More than \n     anything, this is a moral issue. It is not welfare. It is not \n     a business deal. It is a ``debt of honor,'' as Chancellor \n     Adenauer said many years ago.\n       Maybe the claims of Holocaust survivors are unprecedented; \n     but so was the robbery and murder. We will not stop until \n     Germany and all the other nations who participated in the \n     extermination process fulfill their obligations. It is the \n     right thing to do--for them and for us.\n       Let us Remember!\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4311-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S.J.

Mr. President, I am happy to note the overwhelming vote \nthat just occurred to try, in some small way, to express the feeling of \nthis body about the recent tragedy in Littleton, CO. It is a first step \nof perhaps many that will be taken to properly address this tragedy.\n  The massacre that occurred makes us all want to jump to action, \nbecause we are action-oriented individuals and an action-oriented body. \nThat is why we are here--to do things. I think the tendency in a \nsituation like this is to want to jump out and do things so we can \nprevent another tragedy in the future. The problem is, with that \napproach, this situation has actually raised more questions than it has \nprovided answers.\n  I will share with Members some of the leading news articles this \nweek. ``Why?'' Newsweek asks. ``Why?'' U.S. News & World Report asks. \nAgain, a very important question that should be answered.\n  Time Magazine asked, What can schools do? Where were the parents?\n  These are all very, very important questions that should be answered.\n  It is important at this time in the Senate and in the House and \nwithin the leadership of this country to perhaps do a little bit more \nlistening than talking, so we can help find answers as to why this \ntragedy happened in order to attempt to prevent it from happening in \nthe future. This is not the first such tragedy. This is, unfortunately, \na long line of recent incidents.\n  It may prompt some parents or some lawmakers to say ban all video \ngames and movies. It could prompt some people to say ban all guns and \nbomb-making equipment everywhere in every instance. It could prompt \nothers to either call for severe censure of the Internet or the \nabolition of the Internet.\n  I suggest, as respectfully as possible, that now may not be the time \nto push through laws or initiatives, either at the Federal or State \nlevel, before we can get some answers to these very troubling \nquestions.\n  I am not suggesting that nothing be done--absolutely the opposite, \nthat we\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\ndo some things, but after we understand a little bit better why some of \nthese things in these schools actually took place.\n  As an example, let me point out that when TWA Flight 800 exploded \nover Long Island, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National \nTransportation Safety Board spent over 2 years working around the \nclock, hauling wreckage from the ocean and methodically rebuilding this \nairplane, and an exhaustive investigation determined the cause. The FBI \nassigned 600 agents to the case and conducted 4,000 interviews with \neyewitnesses, mechanics, people at the airport--anyone they could find \nwho might be able to provide answers.\n  As a nation, we gladly undertook this massive effort so that millions \nof people who step on airplanes every day, who pack their suitcases and \ntheir briefcases and board airplanes, can feel secure that their \nGovernment is trying to keep them safe.\n  I suggest we undertake a similar effort, that we most certainly \nshould spend the time and the resources to find out what happened in \nColorado, in Mississippi, in Oregon, in Arkansas, so that these parents \nand children and other children can have some answers as to what \nhappened and how we can prevent this before it spreads to more places \nin more States.\n  I am hopeful that as we talk among ourselves and hear from the public \nat home and listen more carefully, we think about the possibility of \ncreating a strong bipartisan commission that is given the resources and \nthe time to ask these questions and to find answers. Hopefully, a \ncommission such as this could be led by some of the strongest Members \non both sides of the aisle, to come up with the answers so we can craft \nthe proper solutions. Some of them will be government solutions as in a \nFederal law; some will be government solutions at a State and local \nlevel; others will be solutions that can happen through our churches, \nour nonprofit organizations, our communities, and in every home in \nAmerica.\n  I suggest now is not the time to rush into action, even though that \nis a natural tendency, but now is a time to listen. If we can spend \nmillions of dollars and thousands of manhours to find out why airplanes \nexplode, why can't we match that effort to find out why some children \nexplode?\n  I look forward to working with the Members of this body to find the \nproper solutions to this critical challenge before our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/27/senate-section/article/S4312-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
