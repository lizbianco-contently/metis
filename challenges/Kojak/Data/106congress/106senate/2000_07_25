Mr. President, I commend the Senate's guest Chaplain \ntoday, Minister Angela Williams, for her eloquent prayer opening \ntoday's session of the Senate. Angela became a licensed minister in \nJanuary of this year, and she is currently an associate minister at \nShiloh Baptist Church in the District of Columbia. I had the privilege \nof attending her first sermon there last November. She is also \ncurrently a graduate student at Virginia Union University in Richmond, \nwhere she is pursuing the degree of master of divinity.\n  Angela's father, J.C. Williams, is also a minister. He served for 28 \nyears with great distinction as a Navy chaplain. He retired in 1998, \nand is now an associate minister in Martinez, GA. Rev. J.C. Williams \nserved as guest Chaplain for the Senate last September.\n  Our guest Chaplain today wears many hats. Angela Williams is also a \ntalented lawyer, and is a graduate of the University of Texas Law \nSchool. As an Assistant United States Attorney in the Middle District \nof Florida, she was selected to serve on the National Church Arson Task \nForce, which was created by the Department of Justice to investigate, \nprosecute, and prevent the epidemic of church arsons that were \nafflicting many parts of the country. From 1996 to 1998, Angela \nWilliams investigated and prosecuted approximately 25 percent of those \nFederal cases nationwide.\n  Angela is also well known to many of us in the Senate and the House \nof Representatives. For the past 2 years, in\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\naddition to her ministry, she has served as a member of my Senate staff \non the Judiciary Committee.\n  All of us on both sides of the aisle and with the Clinton \nadministration who have worked with Angela have great respect for her \nability and dedication. Her principal responsibilities have been in the \narea of law enforcement issues, especially hate crimes, and she \ndeserves great credit for her leadership on this important issue in our \ncountry today.\n  Angela will be leaving my staff at the end of this week. All of us \nwho know Angela wish her well. We have been very impressed with her \ncalling to the ministry and her dedication to it. It has been a \nprivilege to work with her as a member of our Senate family, and we are \ngrateful for her inspiring prayer as guest Chaplain today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, this week will be the last week before we \nbreak for the party conventions--the Republicans in Philadelphia; the \nDemocrats in Los Angeles. We have a full array of legislation that \ncould be considered this week. I am not sure, being a member of the \nlowly minority, as to what issues we will actually address, but the \nAmerican people should pay close attention to what has occurred in this \nChamber in the last 2 weeks.\n  A little bit of history puts it in perspective. Not that many years \nago, we were struggling with annual deficits. It was crippling the \neconomy of the United States and certainly causing a shockwave across \nAmerica as families had to step back and consider the impact of a huge \nnational debt that we passed on to future generations. In fact, our \nnational debt now is approaching $6 trillion, and we collect $1 billion \nin taxes every single day in America to pay interest on our old debt.\n  That $1 billion in taxes does not educate a child; it does not buy a \ntank or a gun; it does not provide health insurance for anyone; it does \nnot improve Social Security or Medicare. It pays interest on old debt.\n  It is debt that was accumulated primarily during the period when \nPresidents Reagan and Bush were in office and some partially during the \nperiod when President Clinton first began, but we have turned the \ncorner. People have come to understand a dramatic thing has occurred. \nWe are now reaching a point where we are not talking about deficits and \ndebt but about the possibility, the opportunity of a surplus. This is \nsomething which America's families and businesses have worked hard to \nearn: a surplus that reflects a strong economy with more and more \npeople working, which reflects the fact we have had the greatest period \nof economic expansion in the history of the United States. In fact, I \nhope we do not become blase about this. This is something that was hard \nto achieve and American families and businesses working with our \nGovernment leaders reached this new point.\n  Having reached the point where we can look ahead and say we have a \nstrong economy and a surplus coming, it is now up to the Congress to \ndecide what to do with that surplus. There are two very different \napproaches as to what to do with the surplus.\n  During the last 2 weeks, the Republican Party has come to the floor \nof the Senate and suggested they know what to do with this surplus. \nThey have suggested we take $1 trillion, approximately half of the \nprojected surplus over the next 10 years or so, and dedicate it to tax \ncuts. Tax cuts are a popular proposal for politicians. Any of us would \nlike to stand before a crowd in our States or hometowns and talk about \ncutting their taxes. But the honest question is, Is that the best thing \nfor us to do at this moment in time?\n  On the Democratic side, we believe that there is a better approach. \nWe believe our first obligation is to pay down the national debt, \nstrengthening Social Security and Medicare and making certain that our \nchildren carry less of a burden in the future. The Republicans say give \ntax cuts, primarily to wealthy people, over $1 trillion worth. We say \ntake that money and pay down the debt. We are not sure if that surplus \nis actually going to be there 2 years, 4 years, 6 years from now. \nWouldn't every family and business in America agree it is more sensible \nto first retire this huge debt that looms over America and its future? \nThat is the Democratic position.\n  Most people believe we should deal with the national debt. The \nRepublican position, with notable exceptions, including the Presiding \nOfficer, who has taken a more conservative approach when it comes to \ndealing with the surplus--is, no, we should cut taxes on a permanent \nbasis and hope for the best. The tough part of it, too, is that this \ncutting of taxes is primarily going to those at the highest income \nlevels.\n  I had a chart last week which showed that 43 percent of the estate \ntax cut proposed by the Republicans went to people making over $300,000 \na year. For people with an average income of $900,000 a year--a show of \nhands is not necessary--the Republicans proposed a $23,000-a-year tax \nbreak. If one is making somewhere in the neighborhood of $75,000 a \nmonth, will another $2,000 a month really make a difference in their \nlife? I find that hard to imagine. Yet when it comes right down to it, \nthat is what we hear from the Republican side: Give the tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest people in America.\n  On our side, we believe this surplus should be used to pay down the \ndebt, strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and then find those \ntargeted tax cuts that can make a real difference in a person's life.\n  Let me give a few examples of targeted tax cuts that cost far less \nthan what the Republicans have suggested but would mean dramatic tax \nrelief to working families. I start with middle-income families worried \nabout paying for college education expenses, as well they should be. \nBetween 1990 and 1998, average tuition and fees increased 79 percent at \npublic universities, 56 percent at private 4-year institutions, \ncompared to a 23-percent increase in the Consumer Price Index and a 41-\npercent increase in per capita disposable income. Families know this. \nWhen children are born, they think ahead: How are we going to pay for \nthis kid's college education?\n  On the Democratic side, we believe if we are talking about changing \ntax policy, let us give to middle-income families the deduction of \ncollege education expenses, a helping hand so that if a son or daughter \nis accepted at a good university, they don't have to make the decision \nthat they can't go because of money. That is our idea. We would have \ndeduction for college education expenses.\n\n  The Republican idea is an estate tax cut that would give an average \n$23,000-a-year tax break to people making $900,000 a year. What is of \nmore value to the future of America: Someone who gets $2,000 a month to \nput it in an investment or another vacation home or a family who takes \na tax break offered on the Democratic side and helps their son or \ndaughter go to the very best college or university into which they can \nbe accepted?\n  Secondly, working families I know are struggling with the concept of \nday care, what to do with the children during the day so they have \npeace of mind in that the children are safe in a quality environment. \nSome working people choose day-care centers in their hometowns. They \ncan be very expensive. I know my grandson is in day care, a very good \none. I am happy he is there. Many families don't have that luxury. They \ncan't turn to good day care because they can't afford it. What about \nthe family who decides that instead of both parents working, one will \nstay home to care for the child? That is a good decision to make, if \none can afford to make it.\n  On the Democratic side--this is another change in tax policy that is \nfar better for America than to give tax breaks to wealthy people--\nSenator Dodd of Connecticut came to the floor and said: Let's help \nfamilies pay for\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\nday-care center expenses with a tax credit or offer a tax credit to \nmothers who will stay at home with children so they will get a helping \nhand, too. I think that is eminently sensible.\n  We know that children in the early stages of their life really are \nforming their minds and their values, and we want them to be in the \nvery best environment. If they get off to a good start, many kids will \ndo well in school and have a great future ahead of them. But on the \nother side of the coin, if children are being pushed and shoved from \none incompetent and dangerous babysitter to the next, it is risky. It \nis something no family would want to face. On the Democratic side, \ninstead of tax breaks for the wealthy, we want to target tax breaks for \nthose who are struggling to find a way to keep a parent at home to \nwatch a child or to pay for day care.\n  A third area we have worked on is the whole question of long-term \ncare. Baby boomers understand this. Their parents and their \ngrandparents are reaching an age where they need special attention, \nspecial help, special care. Much of it is expensive. Families are \nmaking sacrifices for their parents, the elderly, and their families. \nWe think they deserve a helping hand. We understand people are living \nlonger and have special needs. We have proposed a tax break that will \nhelp families who are concerned about long-term care and caring for \ntheir parents and elderly people.\n  These are the types of targeted tax breaks which the Democrats \nsupport: Deduction of college education expenses; help for day care, to \nkeep parents at home so they can watch their children; help for long-\nterm care, to take care of our aging parents. This is our concept of \ntargeted tax relief. The Republican concept of tax relief is a $23,000 \nannual tax break for people making over $300,000 a year.\n  Frankly, I will take this issue anywhere in my home State of \nIllinois. I would like to argue this point as to whether we take a \nhandful of people and give them the most exceedingly generous tax \nbreaks or look at 98 percent of America's families who are struggling \nwith the realities of life.\n\n  I am glad my colleague from Massachusetts is here. I will be happy to \nyield to him at any point. I want to make one point before I do.\n  There are many other issues which are languishing in this Congress \nwhich need to be addressed, issues to which the American people look to \nus for leadership. I will cite a few so one can understand the \nfrustration, many times, of dealing with real-life problems at home and \nthis Disneyland situation on Capitol Hill. The people need to be \nrepresented in this Chamber, not the powerful. The powerful have their \nlobbyists. The special interests have their political action \ncommittees. They have shown extraordinary strength when it comes to \nstopping issues about which people really care. Allow me to address a \nfew.\n  A prescription drug benefit under Medicare: Is there another action \nwe can take in America that is fairer or better for our seniors and \ndisabled than to give them the opportunity to afford prescription \ndrugs?\n  Is it not scandalous that senior citizens in many States get in buses \nand take 100-mile trips over the border to Canada to buy their \nprescription drugs? The same drugs manufactured in the United States, \napproved for sale in the United States, can be purchased in Canada for \na fraction of the cost.\n  Is it not scandalous and disgraceful that senior citizens across \nAmerica, when they receive the prescriptions from their doctor and are \ntold, take this medicine; you will be strong and healthy and \nindependent if you do, can't afford to fill the prescription, go to the \nstore and find they have to choose between food and medicine, fill the \nprescription and take half of what they are supposed to because they \ncan't afford it? That is a reality of life. It is something we should \naddress.\n  The simple fact is, this Congress has failed to come up with a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. We have talked about it for a \nyear and a half or longer. The President has called for it for years. \nThe Republican Congress says no because the pharmaceutical companies, \nwhich are enjoying some of the greatest profits in their history, don't \nwant to see this prescription drug benefit. They know that if we have \nthe bargaining power under Medicare to keep prices under control, their \nprofit margins might slip.\n  So, once again, the powerful and special interest groups are the ones \nthat are prevailing. The Republican answer to this is, well, why don't \nwe turn to the same insurance companies that offer HMOs and managed \ncare and ask them if they would offer a prescription drug benefit. \nExcuse me if I am skeptical, but we know what these companies have done \nwhen it comes to life-and-death decisions on medical care. Too many \ntimes they say no when they should say yes. People are forced into \ncourt before judges to plead and beg and do their very best to get the \nbasic care they need to survive.\n  Is that what we want to see when it comes to life-saving prescription \ndrugs, another battle between America's families and these insurance \ncompanies?\n  We received a report recently about over a million people who have \nlost their HMO Medicare policies--cancelled--because the companies \ndidn't think they were making enough money. The Republicans say that is \nthe answer. We don't think so. It should be a universal, guaranteed \nprogram under Medicare, one that you are confident will allow your \ndoctor to give you a prescription that you can fill and will allow you \nto be able to afford to fill it. That is another issue stopped in this \nCongress by the special interest groups.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights would let the doctors make the \ndecisions, not the insurance companies. We have lost that issue on the \nfloor of the Senate. We raised that issue and the insurance companies \nprevailed. They would not let Senator Kennedy's bill come forward to \ngive people the peace of mind that they were getting the best medical \ncare and that they would not have to fight with a clerk from an \ninsurance company when it came to what they and the people they love \nmight need.\n  As at Columbine High School, all of the press reports about shootings \nin schools and in other places shock America from one coast to the \nother. Can this Congress pass commonsense legislation for gun safety \nfor a background check at gun shows, to make sure criminals and \nchildren don't get their hands on guns? Can we pass legislation to \nrequire a child safety device on every handgun so that kids don't \nrummage through the closet, find a handgun, and shoot themselves or a \nplaymate? No. The answer is we can't because the powerful gun lobby \nstopped that legislation from being passed as well.\n  Prescription drug benefits, Patients' Bill of Rights, commonsense gun \nsafety legislation, and an increase in the minimum wage--Senator \nKennedy has fought for that for years. The minimum wage is $5.15 an \nhour in this country. Imagine trying to live on that, on the $10,000 or \n$12,000 a year in income that it generates. That is next to impossible. \nWe have tried to raise the minimum wage because we believe it is not \nonly fair but it gives people who go to work every day a chance for a \nlivable wage. The Republicans say, no, we can't afford a livable wage; \nwe can't afford to increase the minimum wage, but we can afford to give \na trillion dollar tax break to the wealthiest people in this country.\n  Does that make sense? Is it fair or just? I don't think so.\n  The issues of education and health care, compensation for working \npeople, a Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug benefits, none of \nthese have been addressed. The Republicans will be off to their \nconvention in Philadelphia in a few days. They will take great pride in \ntalking about what they have achieved in Washington. I hope the \nAmerican people will take a look at the list of issues I have referred \nto and ask themselves how many of those issues are important to their \nfamilies. I think many of them are. All of them are stalled because the \npeople don't rule in this Chamber, the powerful do. Those powerful \nspecial interests have stopped our attempts to try to make sure we have \nsensible fiscal policy to keep this economy moving forward, to pay down \nour debt, strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and to make sure \nthat tax cuts help the people who deserve them.\n\n  We have a big agenda in this town and very little of it has been \naddressed. I think it is a commentary on this Congress and its \nleadership that we have failed to respond to the issues that families \nin America care about.\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\n  Before yielding the floor to the Senator from Massachusetts, I ask \nunanimous consent that this editorial from the Chicago Tribune of \nSunday, July 23, 2000, entitled ``Budget Surplus Induces Frenzy,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Budget Surplus Induces Frenzy\n\n       Congressional Democrats have likened the Republicans' tax-\n     cutting frenzy to a ``legislative Wild West.'' But a growing \n     number of Democrats, too, are hitching up their britches and \n     joining the roundup, crossing the aisle to vote for tax cuts \n     as well as their own spending increases. What is prompting \n     all this activity is a federal budget surplus that seems to \n     have taken on a magical life of its own.\n       Capitol Hill is awash in money. Why make hard choices when \n     you can have it all? Blink and you just may have missed the \n     latest incredibly rosy forecast of that gargantuan budget \n     surplus. The economy is now approaching $10 trillion in size \n     and more Americans are working than ever. That means federal \n     tax receipts are soaring--the prime reason that the budget \n     surplus keeps growing.\n       The latest revision by the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimates the surplus at $232 billion for the fiscal year \n     ending Sept. 30--$53 billion higher than the April estimate. \n     Through 2010, the surplus is forecast to be $2.2 trillion. \n     Include Social Security surpluses and it grows to $4.5 \n     trillion. If your mind isn't boggled by these sums, you just \n     aren't paying attention.\n       But before Congress proceeds to spend every last red cent \n     of this money, here are a few cautionary red flags.\n\n\n                           pay down the debt\n\n       The national debt totals $5.6 billion. Reducing the \n     publicly held portion of it--about $3.6 trillion--is akin to \n     giving the whole nation a tax cut because it reduces future \n     debt service. This must be the No. 1 priority.\n\n\n                      get real with spending caps\n\n       They were imposed in 1997 when it looked like the only way \n     for America to dig itself out of a swamp of red ink was to \n     strictly limit discretionary spending. That's what gets spent \n     on everything else after defense, debt service and \n     entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are \n     paid for. Well, the deficit swamp has been drained. The caps \n     remain, but that doesn't mean Congress complies with them. \n     The Republicans have been moving spending in or out of the \n     current fiscal year or calling it an ``emergency,'' allowing \n     them to technically meet the caps but still spend lavishly.\n       This is worse than having no caps at all. It is time to be \n     honest about these spending caps. Establish a new baseline \n     cap; allow for minimal annual increase, then stick to it.\n\n\n              remember projections aren't real money--yet\n\n       That doesn't mean the projected surplus won't become real \n     money. But 10 years is a long time and a lot can change over \n     a decade. If you don't believe that, just remember back to \n     1990 and the projected deficits that seemed to stretch \n     endlessly into the future.\n\n\n              social security and medicare still need work\n\n       Neither presidential candidate has addressed the core \n     demographic problem that looms for these programs: the aging \n     of the giant Baby Boom generation. The Concord Coalition \n     refers to both their Social Security reform plans as ``free \n     lunch proposals.'' There is no free lunch. Expanding tax-free \n     retirement accounts--as Al Gore proposes--or allowing market \n     investment of some portion of Social Security taxes--as \n     George Bush proposes--won't change the fact that the system \n     will become actuarially unsound unless benefits are cut, \n     taxes raised or the retirement age delayed.\n       Add to Medicare's shaky fiscal foundation some looming big \n     ticket items--a prescription drug benefit and some provision \n     for long-term care--that will have to be financed if, as \n     seems increasingly likely, the nation decides they are \n     essential to have.\n\n\n                        listen to alan greenspan\n\n       The spending and tax cut ``debates'' under way now have \n     little to do with the soundness of overall fiscal policy. Is \n     this a good thing to consider? Should we do this? These are \n     not the questions being asked. There is an assumption that \n     the money is there, so why bother with that debate? If \n     they're politically popular--and what's not to like about a \n     tax cut or higher spending--put 'em in the pot. The most \n     recent example of this is the metamorphosis of the GOP drive \n     to end the marriage tax penalty. This has now grown into a \n     generous tax cut for all married people, with a total 10-year \n     price tag of $292 billion.\n       No one can guarantee the economy will continue to prosper \n     as robustly as it has. ``A number of the potential programs, \n     both expenditures and tax cuts in the pipeline, do give me \n     some concern,'' said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan, at his mid-year economic review on Capitol Hill \n     last week. ``The growing surplus has kept the expansion \n     stable. Tax cuts or spending increases that significantly \n     slow the rise of surpluses would put the economy at risk.''\n       Listen to the man.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I point out to our colleagues and friends \nthe Calendar of Business for the Senate. This is the calendar of the \nbusiness pending, the unfinished business, and a list of various pieces \nof legislation reported out of the committees.\n  The American people probably don't have this at their fingertips, but \nif you take the time to look at this when you visit the library, or you \ncan write to Members of the Congress, you will find out that in the \npending business the first order is a bill to extend programs and \nactivities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \nRight next to it, it says May 1, 2000. That means that this has been \nthe underlying and pending piece of legislation. Yet we are denied any \nopportunity to address what is going to be the Federal participation in \nworking with States and local communities in the areas of education. We \ndidn't address it in the rest of May. We received assurances by the \nRepublican leadership that we were going to come back and address those \nissues and questions. We didn't do it in June, and we didn't do it in \nJuly, although we were told we would be able to address these issues in \nevening sessions and have a disposition of that legislation.\n  In the meantime, what have we done? As my friend from Illinois has \npointed out, we have seen a tax cut of over $1 trillion. We had \nsomething else done, too. The House of Representatives have given \nthemselves a pay increase of $3,800 a year. We didn't see the increase \nin the minimum wage. They didn't vote for that. In fact, when Tom DeLay \nwas asked about the increase in the minimum wage, he said: That doesn't \naffect us. What he continued to say is we are not in the business; we \nare overseers of a $2 trillion economy. And he was quite dismissive of \nthe problems and challenges that are affecting working families at the \nlower wrung of the economic ladder.\n  We have not done the American people's business. We are not \naddressing the questions of smaller class sizes. We are not addressing \nthe issue of trying to train teachers to be better teachers. We are not \naddressing the issue of afterschool programs. We are not addressing the \nefforts to try to deal with the problems of the digital divide. We are \nnot dealing with the greater kinds of accountability of the \nexpenditures of funds in terms of education. That is off the agenda. As \nhas been pointed out many times since the founding of the Republic, \ndebates on the floor of the Senate are about priorities.\n  The majority leaders have effectively dismissed debate, discussion, \nand action on education in order to have a trillion dollar tax cut for \nthe wealthiest individuals and a pay increase for themselves. No \nattention to prescription drugs. Thumbs down on that. Thumbs down on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We haven't got time to debate a Patients' \nBill of Rights or a Medicare prescription drug program. We haven't got \nthe time to debate a gun issue to try to make our schools safer. But we \nhave the time to debate a trillion dollar tax cut and a pay increase of \n$3,800.\n  If you take the increase in the minimum wage for 2 years, we are \ntalking about half of what the increase would be for a Member of \nCongress. We can't even debate it. We can't discuss it. We can't vote \non it because that is not part of the agenda of our Republican \nleadership. That is what this is about. It is about priorities. That is \nwhat this election is going to be about, ultimately. No action in terms \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights, even though we are one vote short of \nbeing able to get action, to try to ensure that decisions affecting \nfamilies are made by doctors and trained medical officials and not \naccountants for the HMOs. We are not going to have, evidently, action \non the gun issues to try to make our schools safer and more secure, to \ntry to limit the availability of guns to children in our society that \nresults in more than 10 children every single day being killed. We are \nnot able to do it. We want to indicate to the majority that we are \ngoing to take every step possible to\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\nmake sure we are going to address those issues. We have been cut out \nand closed out to date. But we are not going to do it.\n\n  Here it is Tuesday morning. Quorum calls all day Monday. Quorum calls \nthis morning. Failing to take action on these issues, it is basically \nan abdication of our responsibility. We are not going to go silently \ninto the night.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nbecause I think he has made his case convincingly that there are many \nthings we have failed to do in this Congress which mean a lot to the \nAmerican people.\n  Take a look at the inaction of the Republican-controlled Congress on \nso many issues that are really life-and-death, day-to-day issues that \nfamilies across America expect us to lead on, such as the issue of \ncommonsense gun safety; 30,000 American lives were lost to gun violence \nin 1999. We lose 12 children every single day in America. As many \nchildren are dying in America because of gun violence every day as were \nlost at Columbine High School. It is a reminder that we have a \nsituation with gun violence that is unprecedented in the history of the \nworld. The obvious conclusion from the Republican leadership is, there \nis nothing we can do or want to do to change it.\n  We believe, on the Democratic side, that commonsense gun safety is \nsomething we should enact, and do it very quickly. We passed a bill \nhere on the floor of the Senate. It had a tie vote of 49-49. Vice \nPresident Al Gore cast the deciding vote. We sent it over to the House \nof Representatives. In 2 or 3 weeks, the gun lobby tore it to pieces. \nThey sent it to a conference committee. For over 1 solid year, that \nbill has been stuck in a conference committee because the Republican \nleadership is unwilling to bring forward any gun safety legislation. \nYet we see these statistics where literally thousands of Americans are \nvictims of gun violence.\n  In my State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, there are now \ngathering together summit conferences of leaders from communities \nbecause of the unprecedented killings which are taking place--\nparticularly of our children--with drive-by shootings. Children are \nbeing killed while lying in bed or sitting on the front porch with \ntheir parents. It is becoming too commonplace. The obvious attitude of \nthe Republican leadership is, there is nothing they are willing to do \nto even try to address it.\n  We think if you buy a gun at a gun show, you should go through the \nsame background check as a person who buys a gun from a gun dealer. We \nwant to know if you have a history of violent mental illness. We want \nto know if you have committed a violent felony in the past. We want to \nknow if you have a history of the kind of activity that has required an \ninjunction to protect someone against domestic violence. We think it is \nonly fair and just that we ask people who want to exercise their rights \nunder the second amendment to accept the inconvenience of a few \nquestions being asked. Yet the Republicans apparently disagree. They \nrefuse to move any gun safety legislation.\n  As to the Patients' Bill of Rights, which Senator Kennedy addresses, \nevery day 14,000 Americans are denied their needed medicines; 10,000 \nare denied their needed tests and procedures. You know the stories. You \nknow that in your hometown convenience store there is a little canister \nwhich says, can you leave your change for this little girl, who needs a \ncertain medical treatment, which is even denied by her insurance \ncompany, for which she has no insurance. That is a reality for a lot of \nfamilies who are struggling to pay for expensive medical care. It is \nthe reality of many of these families who turn to these insurance \ncompanies. These companies say: No, it is not one of our recommended \nprocedures; your doctor is just going to have to be told no. I have \ntalked to those doctors who have said to mothers and fathers what their \nchild needs, and then they turn around and find an insurance company \noverruling them.\n\n  We think patients in this country should come first, that quality \nmedical care should be in the hands of professionals and not in the \nhands of insurance company clerks.\n  More than 11 million Americans have been denied an increase in the \nminimum wage for over 2 years. In Illinois, 350,000 people got up and \nwent to work this morning for $5.15 an hour. These are not lazy people. \nThese are hard-working people who are asking this Congress to keep them \nin mind as we give tax breaks to wealthy people, to keep them in mind \nas we approve congressional salaries for those of us who serve in the \nHouse and Senate. But no, the Republican leadership has told us we have \nno time to consider an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Of course, the prescription drug benefit under Medicare--13 million \nseniors in America have no prescription coverage.\n  I met a woman in Chicago who had a double lung transplant. Her \nmedical bills are $2,500 a month for the drugs she needs so her body \nwill not reject these lungs. She can't afford it. She has to turn to \nwelfare and to Medicare. She lives in a basement with her children \nbecause, frankly, she has no income, no resources. She has had times \nwhen she didn't have the money to fill her prescription, and she has \nsuffered irreversible lung damage every time that has happened. That is \nher life every single day.\n  That is what it means to be poor in America--or, even those with \nSocial Security checks who do not think themselves to be poor and able \nto afford prescription drugs.\n  Yet when we propose a plan that offers guaranteed universal coverage \nunder Medicare for prescription drugs, the Republican leadership says: \nNo, we think we ought to turn to these same insurance companies that \nhave treated us so well--I use that term advisedly--under our HMO and \nmanaged-care system and ask them to give prescription drug benefits, \nthe same insurance companies that have been cutting people off when it \ncomes to HMO supplemental policies under Medicare.\n  Over 1 million Americans have been cut off, many in my State of \nIllinois. I don't trust the insurance companies to provide, out of the \nkindness of their hearts, prescription drug benefits. I think there \nshould be guaranteed universal coverage under the Medicare system.\n  Another bill stopped by the Republican Congress is school \nmodernization.\n  We should debate a bill that will allow us to increase the limits of \nimmigrants coming into this country to provide those immigrants to fill \nhighly-skilled jobs and good-paying jobs in this country that can't be \nfilled with American workers. I think it is a reality. It is the No. 1 \ncomplaint of businesses that can't find skilled workers.\n  Yesterday, as I got on the plane in Springfield, IL, a fellow from a \nlocal company, Garrett Aviation, said: Let me tell you that my biggest \nproblem in business is I can't find workers to fill the jobs.\n  The industries come to Congress and say: Allow us to have more people \nimmigrate to the United States who can fill these jobs. I think it is a \nreal problem. If we don't allow this immigration, some of those jobs \nand companies will go overseas.\n  But let's look at it in the long term. What are we doing to improve \nthe workforce in America to make sure we have people who are skilled \nenough to fill these jobs and make these good incomes? Are we \ndedicating our money in our schools and in training to make this \nhappen? I don't think so.\n  In the 1950s, we were afraid of the Russians. When they launched \nSputnik with their advances in science, we passed the National Defense \nEducation Act. We said: We are going to help kids across America pay \nfor their college education. We believed that these kids, once trained, \nwould make America strong so we would not have to worry about this \nthreat from Russia.\n  I know about that program. I was one of the beneficiaries. I borrowed \nmoney from this Government to go to college and law school. I hope many \npeople think that was a good investment. Some may not think so. I paid \nthe money back. Shouldn't we do the same\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nthing again with a national security education act that says we want to \ntrain our workers for the future needs in America to make certain they \ncan fill the jobs with Boeing Aircraft in St. Louis or Motorola in the \nChicago area? We are not doing that.\n  This Congress won't address that. It won't address school \nmodernization. It won't address the question of the deduction for \ncollege education expenses. It won't address the need to improve \nteacher skills. That is something we don't have time for on the agenda \nof this Congress.\n  Businesses across America look to us for leadership. Families across \nAmerica expect us to create opportunities. Time and again, we have seen \ninstead efforts by the Republicans in the Senate to give tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest people in America and to ignore the realities facing our \nfamilies. I think our agenda has to be an agenda closer to the real \nneeds of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7498-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7498-S7500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our colleague from Illinois and others have \ntalked about the things we have not passed and that they would like to \nsee passed in this session. But we have a big problem. We have a \nproblem because the absolutely essential work that this body must do is \nbeing held up. The work on appropriations bills that fund the agencies \nof Government for the next year must be done before the end of the \nfiscal year--September 30.\n  Many of the things my colleague has talked about have already been \npassed and are in conference. But we can't get floor time to do it when \nwe are dealing with filibusters. The Democratic plan has been to stall, \ndelay, and block.\n  We will have an opportunity to vote on cloture on the Treasury-Postal \nbill. That means cutting off a filibuster. But that goes through the \nlengthy process of the 30 hours that are required for debate.\n  We are also ready to take up the energy and water appropriations \nbill. But the minority leader has raised objection to that.\n  Energy and water carries many important things. It carries funding \nfor projects that are vitally important to South Dakota--to river \nStates such as Missouri, to the Nation, the national laboratories in \nNew Mexico, and others.\n  All of these vital appropriations are being held up because the \nminority leader is now objecting to a provision that was included in \nthe bill this year but has been included in four previous bills \nCongress has sent to the President and which have been signed by the \nPresident. The state of affairs is, we are ready for a time agreement. \nIf there are objections to particular items in a bill, we have a \nprocess called amendments. You can move to strike; you can move to \namend. We are ready to do business.\n\n  Let there be no mistake. Let the American people understand. We are \nwatching a series of Democratic stall, moves--delay, stall, and block. \nSometimes we call them a filibuster. But filibusters don't need to be \npeople talking on the floor. It can be refusal to allow a bill to come \nup. It can be filibustered by amendments. Basically, it is the \nDemocratic side that is trying to keep the Senate from doing its work.\n  We have lots of important votes. They may win; we may win some. The \nSenate has its rules. It permits debate and amendment. We are willing \nto do so and debate a commonsense provision that happens to be in this \nbill to see what the will of the Senate is.\n  The provision in the bill as reported out of committee that has \nexisted in four previous appropriations bills, previously signed by the \nPresident, is designed to prevent changes to Missouri River management \nwhich would increase the risk of spring flooding and bring many dire \nconsequences. I intend to lay out some of the problems and a number of \nleaders in this country who oppose it.\n  The provision is very simple. It is also very important. The \nprovision is designed to stop flooding. Out West we hear the Fish and \nWildlife Service is now proposing to tear down dams. Here the Fish and \nWildlife Service wants to take action on flow management to pretend \nthat dams don't exist. They have gone out of their way to try to \ndictate the work of the Corps of Engineers. There are all kinds of \nprocedures--there are public hearings, there are assessments, there are \nimpact statements, and many other things--required before an agency can \ntake action. The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to jump over all that \nand say: Corps of Engineers, you do our bidding. They sent a letter on \nJuly 12 which said: You must establish a plan to increase spring \nflooding on the Missouri River and to cut off the possibility of \neffective barge transportation, environmentally sound barge \ntransportation in the summer and the fall, affecting not only the \nMissouri River but the Mississippi River as well.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to do to the communities, to the \nStates along the Missouri River, what the National Park Service did to \nthe community of Los Alamos when it tried a control burn. We don't need \na controlled flood that the Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed.\n  While we have a lot to debate with our friends in the upper basin \nabout the way the river is managed, I never expected they would ever \nsupport an action simply designed to increase downstream flooding. As \nfar as I know in the debates--and they have been vigorous debates in \nthe past--that was never their intent. I don't know what the intent now \nis of the minority leader. We have fought vigorously and honestly with \nour friends in the upper river States about their desire to keep fall \nwater for their recreation industry. We want to work out ways to help \nthem. We need that late year water to ensure we keep river \ntransportation so our farmers have an economical and environmentally \nsound way of getting their products to the market. We also need flood \ncontrol. We have never had them complain about flood control. Dams were \nbuilt in the middle of the last century, principally to prevent \nflooding on the lower Mississippi and lower Missouri Rivers. Mr. \nPresident, 85 percent of the population in the Missouri River basin \nlives in the lower basin below Gavin's Point. That doesn't include the \nlower Mississippi River which gets that water from the Missouri.\n\n  As with the dams out West, the Fish and Wildlife Service has a theory \nthat we should travel back in time and have rivers that ``mimic the \nnatural flow of the river.'' Dams were built to stop the natural flow \nbecause the natural flow was flooding many hundreds and thousands of \nacres. It was killing people and damaging billions of dollars of \nproperty. One third of our State's food production is in the floodplain \nof the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. In 1994, the Corps of \nEngineers proposed to change the river and have a spring rise.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we communicated our opposition to the \nPresident. Twenty-eight Senators representing States along the Missouri \nand Mississippi and Ohio Rivers signed this letter to the President. \nThe Corps went back to the drawing board and began fresh to develop a \nconsensus plan. Between then and early this year, a consensus among the \nStates--with the exception of Missouri--was developed that included \nconservation measures but had no spring rise.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service, at the table with the States for \nyears, came to Washington, and the next thing we know they are \ninsisting on a spring rise, the will of the States, the comments of the \npeople, the overwhelming objection of State and local officials \nnotwithstanding.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn't want public comments. They \nheard them. They know what the comments are. Don't flood us out. The \nFish and Wildlife Service has no mandate to protect people from the \ndangers of flooding. I invite them out the next time we have a spring \nflood in Missouri to see the devastation, to comfort and console the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones in floodwaters. We lost some this \nyear in floods in Missouri. The public has gone on record strongly \nopposing this spring rise. In 1994, the public opposed it, from \nNebraska to St. Louis to New Orleans to Memphis and beyond. To prevent \nthe risk of downstream flooding in 1995, Congressman Bereuter from \nNebraska put a provision in the energy and water appropriations bill to \nblock any change in river management that included a spring rise.\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nThe same provision was included again in 1996, 1998, 1999, and again by \nthe Senate subcommittee. As I repeat, this provision has been adopted \nby voice vote in the House and has been included in four previous \nconference reports, signed by the President four times before.\n  Let me note two additional realities. According to our State \nDepartment of Natural Resources, not only is this plan experimental, \nbut it could injure species. I quote from the assistant director for \nscience and technology who said the plan calls for a significant drop \nin flow during the summer. This will allow predators to reach the \nislands upon which the terns and plovers--the endangered species--nest, \ngiving them access to the young still in the nest. While the impacts on \nthe pallid sturgeon are more difficult to determine because we know \nless about them, low flows during the hottest weather may pose a \nsignificant threat. In other words, there is a real danger to the \nenvironment and to the endangered species.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey is studying what can be done to encourage \nand protect the habitat for the pallid sturgeon. I visited them. They \ndo not know--and they are the ones who have the most expertise; they \nhave been studying--they do not know yet that anything like a spring \nrise would have any impact on the pallid sturgeon. They say the jury is \nstill out. I can explain that better. They don't know if this would \nprotect the pallid sturgeon. We do know that the spring rise will \nincrease flood risk. It is totally experimental in terms of improving \nhabitat. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources had a very good \nargument that it may make it more dangerous for the endangered species.\n\n  Finally, this proposal by the Fish and Wildlife Service ignores the \nhard and fast and undisputed reality that on the lower Missouri we \nalready have a spring rise, courtesy of the Kansas River, the Osage \nRiver, the Platte River, the Blue River, the Grand River, the Tarkio \nRiver, the Gasconade River, and others.\n  Each flows into the Missouri, and when it rains, the Missouri lifts \nfrom the tributaries into its basins. We already have a spring rise. It \nfloods Missouri regularly. We don't need another source of flooding to \ncarry out some experiment that the Fish and Wildlife Service is trying \nto conduct at the peril of our citizens. We cannot stand the Fish and \nWildlife Service sending an additional ``pulse'' of water downstream \nthat will put it above our heads.\n  When they release water at the last dam in Nebraska, it takes 12 days \nto arrive in St. Louis. In those 12 days, we can experience \nthunderstorms and flash floods in the spring, and there is no way to \nget that water back once it is sent down the river. Unless the Fish and \nWildlife Service can predict 12 days of weather, or 14 days of weather \nfor Cape Girardeau, then they are betting on the safety of the hundreds \nof people whose lives may be put at danger if they put out a spring \nrelease as proposed.\n  As I said, I have worked with them and others. I worked with our \nupstate upper-river people. I have worked with Senator Kerrey, Senator \nSmith, Senator Domenici, and others to fund conservation efforts that \ndo not imperil our citizens. These are the ones on which we ought to be \nfocusing, these are the ones that would be tested, these are the ones \nthat do not flood us.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It is a philosophical issue and it is a \nregional issue. Our Governor is a strong Democrat. He has sent me a \nletter, which I will ask be printed in the Record, which outlines very \nstrongly his opposition. Governor Carnahan wrote:\n\n       An analysis of the flooding that occurred along the \n     Missouri River during the spring of 1995 showed that, had the \n     spring rise proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service been in \n     effect, the level of flooding downstream would have been even \n     greater. The Corps could not have recalled water already \n     released hundreds of miles upstream. If the current plan is \n     implemented and the state incurs heavy rains during the \n     spring rise, there is a real risk that farms and communities \n     along the lower Missouri River will suffer extensive \n     flooding.\n       In addition, a spring rise has a detrimental effect on \n     Missouri agricultural land.

Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: I am writing regarding recent developments \n     surrounding efforts to revise the Missouri River Master \n     Manual. I am especially concerned about proposed plans by the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service for a spring rise and request your \n     continued assistance in averting these plans.\n       The proper management of the Missouri River is critical to \n     the economic and environmental health of the state. As you \n     know, the July 12, 2000, letter from the United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior to the \n     Corps of Engineers outlined plans for a spring rise of 17,500 \n     cubic feet per second. I have consistently opposed a spring \n     rise from Gavins Point Dam as detrimental to the state's \n     interests and would again like to state my opposition to the \n     current proposal. Implementation of a spring rise would \n     result in an increased risk of flooding and would have a \n     negative impact on Missouri farmland. The frequently-cited \n     experimental releases on the Colorado River in no way compare \n     to the situation in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri where \n     so many working farms and river communities would be harmed \n     by the spring rise.\n       An analysis of the flooding that occurred along the \n     Missouri River during the spring of 1995 showed that, had the \n     spring rise proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service been in \n     effect, the level of flooding downstream would have been even \n     greater. The Corps could not have recalled water already \n     released hundreds of miles upstream. If the current plan is \n     implemented and the state incurs heavy rains during the \n     spring rise, there is a real risk that farms and communities \n     along the lower Missouri River will suffer extensive \n     flooding.\n       In addition, a spring rise has a detrimental effect on \n     Missouri agricultural land. Sustaining high river flow rates \n     over several consecutive weeks will exacerbate the problem of \n     poor drainage historically experienced by farmers along the \n     river. The prolonged duration of an elevated water table will \n     limit the productivity and accessibility of floodplain \n     croplands. The combination of an increased risk of flooding \n     and damage to some of the state's most productive farmland \n     poses too much of a risk for the economy and the citizens of \n     Missouri.\n       I support any efforts that would prevent the Corps from \n     initiating the recent proposal to initiate a spring rise. \n     Thank you for your continued support in this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Mel Carnahan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Proposed River Changes Will Further Endanger Species\n\n       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is currently considering \n     changes to the way that it operates the dams along the \n     Missouri River. These dams control the level of reservoirs \n     and the flow of water in the river from South Dakota to St. \n     Louis. The Corps has to take into account all the users of \n     the river and its water and balance the agricultural, \n     commercial, industrial, municipal and recreational needs of \n     those living near the river. As part of this review, the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service is examining the potential effect \n     on three endangered species that may result from the proposed \n     changes. The pallid sturgeon, least tern, and piping plover \n     depend on the river and the areas along its banks for their \n     survival.\n       There are three major problems with the operations plan \n     proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service that may actually \n     harm the species rather than help them recover. The plan \n     would increase the amount of water held behind the dams, thus \n     reducing the amount of river between the big reservoirs by \n     about 10 miles in an average year. The higher reservoir \n     levels would also reduce the habitat for the terns and \n     plovers that nest along the shorelines of the reservoirs. \n     Finally, the plan calls for a significant drop in flow during \n     the summer. This will allow predators to reach the islands \n     upon which the terns and plovers nest giving them access to \n     the young still in the nests. While the impacts on the pallid \n     sturgeon are more difficult to determine because we know less \n     about them, low flows during our hottest weather may pose a \n     significant threat.\n       Some advocates of the proposed plan claim that this plan is \n     a return to more natural flow conditions. However, the \n     proposal would benefit artificial reservoirs at the expense \n     of the river and create flow conditions that have never \n     existed along the river in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and \n     Missouri. Balancing the needs of all the river users is \n     complicated. Predicting the loss of habitat and\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\n     its impact on the terns and plovers should not be subject to \n     disagreements.\n       The Fish and Wildlife Service and Corps of Engineers need \n     to examine the implications of this proposal and recognize \n     its failure to protect these species.\n                                                   Dr. Joe Engeln,\n         Assistant Director for Science and Technology, Missouri \n           Department of Natural Resources.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our Department of Natural Resources \nrepresentatives are as green and pro-environment as any group around. \nThey believe it is a bad idea. Farm groups oppose it. The ports and \nriver transportation and flood control people oppose the spring rise. \nThe Southern Governors' Association opposes the spring rise.\n  There should be an important conservation element in any balanced \nplan, but balance is not in the Fish and Wildlife Service mandate nor \nin its plan. They want to manage a river solely for critters. We need \nto have it managed for people. We cannot have the next flood laid at \nthe doorstep of the Congress that is now considering whether to \nexperiment with the lives and property of millions of people who live \nalong the river.\n  Some say the President may veto the bill, but he signed it four times \nbefore. If he were to do that, he could answer to the people from Omaha \nto Kansas City to Jefferson City to St. Louis to Cape Girardeau to \nMemphis down the delta to New Orleans.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward on this bill. We can debate this \nprovision, but I believe it is important for safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport for this position from the National Corn Growers Association, \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean Association, \nthe Agricultural Retailers Association, the National Association of \nWheat Growers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the \nNational Grain and Feed Association, the Missouri-Arkansas River Basins \nAssociation.\n  I also ask a resolution from the Southern Governors' Association \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We are writing concerning an important \n     provision in the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water \n     Appropriations bill.\n       Section 103 of H.R. 4733 stipulates that changes in the \n     management of the Missouri River cannot be made to allow for \n     alteration in river flows during springtime. Removing this \n     provision would not only affect farmers in Missouri, \n     Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas by potentially flooding their land, \n     but also affect barge traffic movements on the Missouri and \n     Mississippi Rivers. Without proper management of river flows \n     over the course of the year, transportation movements could \n     be hampered by insufficient water levels on the Missouri \n     River and the Mississippi River between Memphis, Tennessee \n     and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n       If an amendment is offered to strike Section 103, we urge \n     you to vote against it. Removing this provision would have \n     significant impacts on productive agricultural lands as well \n     as the movement of agricultural commodities and input \n     supplies along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Soybean Association, Agricultural Retailers \n           Association, Midwest Area River Coalition 2000 (MARC \n           2000), National Association of Wheat Growers, National \n           Corn Growers Association, National Council of Farmer \n           Cooperatives, National Grain and Feed Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Missouri River Flow Management Resolution\n\n\n  sponsored by governor ronnie musgrove of mississippi & governor mel \n             carnahan of missouri, approved march 23, 2000\n\n       Whereas, the flow of commerce on the Mississippi River is \n     essential to the economic welfare of the nation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture \n     reports that 70 percent of the nation's total grain exports \n     were handled through Mississippi River port elevators; and\n       Whereas, more than one half of the nation's total grain \n     exports move down the Mississippi River to Gulf ports; and\n       Whereas, free movement of water-borne commerce on the \n     Inland Waterway System is critical to the delivery of goods \n     to deep-water ports for international trade; and\n       Whereas, the reliability of adequate flows for navigation \n     is a key requirement for fulfillment of delivery contracts, \n     employment in ports and terminals, and energy efficiency; and\n       Whereas, delays and stoppages would threaten the successful \n     implementation of international trade agreements under NAFTA \n     and GATT; and\n       Whereas, the Missouri River contributes up to 65 percent of \n     the Mississippi River flow at St. Louis during low water \n     conditions; and\n       Whereas, reduction of Missouri River flows above St. Louis \n     would result in more frequent and more costly impediments to \n     the flow of commerce on the Mississippi River; and\n       Whereas, the reach of the Mississippi River between the \n     mouth of the Missouri River at St. Louis and the mouth of the \n     Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois is at higher risk for delays \n     and stoppages of navigation because of low-water conditions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Northwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps \n     of Engineers (USACE) is considering several proposed \n     alterations to the current edition of the Master Water \n     Control Manual for the Missouri River that would reduce \n     support of water-borne commerce by restricting the flow of \n     the river during the summer and fall, low-water period at St. \n     Louis;\n       Then let it be resolved that the Southern Governors' \n     Association would strongly oppose any alterations that would \n     have such an effect and would urge the Corps to consult with \n     affected inland waterway states prior to endorsing any \n     proposal that would alter the current edition of the manual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7500-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7500-S7502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business, to extend the morning business for at \nleast 5 minutes so I would have about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about taxes, as \nmy Democratic colleagues have done already this morning. I want to go \nback over what the President said on Saturday in his weekly radio \naddress to the Nation.\n  I also had the honor this week to respond to the President's radio \naddress. But at the time I wrote up the speech, I had not had an \nopportunity to see exactly what the President was going to say. I \nassumed he was going to be talking about taxes this week because that \nis what the Senate concentrated on last week. But I have now had the \nopportunity to look through the President's speech. I want to comment \non some of the things the President talked about, now that I have had \nthe opportunity to see it.\n  I want to go back to Saturday morning, when the President gave his \nradio address. In his speech to the Nation he said:\n\n       Now we have the chance to pass responsible tax cuts as we \n     continue to pursue solid economic policy.\n\n  What the President is talking about is that he is willing to give \nsome kind of tax relief to the American public but only the kind the \nPresident thinks you need; not what your family needs or not what you \nare looking at in your budget this month but what Washington, inside \nthe beltway, has determined you should have and, by the way, what \namounts you should have.\n  But these are targeted tax cuts. In other words, you only can receive \nthese dollars back, or this tax relief, if you do what the President \ntells you to do. If you invest here or if you do this or you do that, \nthen you can receive back or be able to keep some of your hard-earned \nmoney. But if you don't, Washington is going to take it. It is telling \nyou what to do, how to spend your money.\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       Instead of following the sensible path that got us here, \n     congressional Republicans are treating the surplus as if they \n     had won the lottery.\n\n  We are talking about giving the money back to the people who earned \nit, and by the way, the ``risky, budget-busting tax cuts'' we are \ntalking about--that is eliminating the death tax and marriage penalty, \nthe unfair taxes--would be less than 10 percent of the projected budget \nsurplus. It is less than a dime on the dollar, and this is what the \nPresident is saying is going to create complete chaos because somehow \nwe are going to give back to the American taxpayer about 10 percent of \nthe projected surplus. But he says we are acting as if we won it in the \nlottery. It is the President and my colleagues on the Democratic side \nof the aisle who think this is a lottery that they have won; that the \nsurplus is\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nthere and they are somehow going to find the best way of spending it \nfor you. They are going to determine the best way of spending it for \nyou.\n  They say we think it is a lottery when our proposal is to give the \nmoney back to those who earned it, not spending it. Even Alan \nGreenspan--and again we had him before our Banking Committee last week \nwhere we went over the same thing: The surplus is here; what's the best \nthing we can do with the surplus? Mr. Greenspan says: Pay down the \ndebt.\n  We are paying down the debt. A huge amount of these surplus dollars \nis targeted to reducing the debt, but also there is money left that can \nbe and should be given back in the form of tax relief. But he said the \nworst thing we could do is what the President is advocating and my \nDemocratic colleagues are advocating. The worst thing, Alan Greenspan \nsaid, that we could do is spend the money.\n\n  That is what they want to do. They want to find new ways to spend \nit--but, of course, to benefit you. But they want to determine how to \nspend it, so they are going to enlarge Government or fatten existing \nprograms. But who is going to pay the bill? It is going to be \ntaxpayers. If we do not get tax relief today and we allow these dollars \nto be spent to enlarge or fatten the Government, who is going to \nsupport that larger, fatter Government tomorrow? It is going to have to \ncome from possibly even in an increase in taxes. So if we miss this \nopportunity during times of surplus to cut taxes now, you can almost \nbet we are going to be facing the possibility of tax increases in the \nnear future.\n  We are talking about eliminating unfair taxes, and the majority of \nAmericans agree with this. The marriage penalty and the death tax--even \nthe President has called these unfair taxes.\n  The President said in his speech:\n\n       Taken together, the tax cuts passed last year and this year \n     by this Congress would completely erase the entire projected \n     surplus over 10 years.\n\n  Of course, he is talking about the $800 billion tax cut package last \nyear which he vetoed, that is dead and in the wastebasket, and combines \nit with the cuts we have this year, only 10 percent of the surplus. But \nhe puts them together and says Republicans want to give it all back.\n  That is not all bad. It should be given back. We are talking about \novercharges, surpluses. These are dollars over and above what the \nGovernment has projected to need to carry out all of its \nresponsibilities.\n  We have $1.8-plus trillion earmarked to pay for programs the \nGovernment has said we need to do.\n  These dollars are over and above that. Taxpayers fund every agency, \nevery program, every project, every bureaucrat in that $1.8 trillion \nbudget. Taxpayers are the most used, abused, and underappreciated \npeople in our society. In other words, if they can get more money from \nyou by twisting you a little bit harder, they are going to do that.\n  One of my colleagues earlier this morning said if you make $75,000 a \nmonth and you receive through this tax cut another $2,000 a month, \nwould that really make a difference? That is not for him to decide. \nThese are dollars that somebody has worked for and earned.\n  By the way, they are not talking about how much in taxes this \nindividual is already paying on that $75,000, but they are saying: \n$2,000, what difference would it make to them? In other words, \nWashington can use it and spend it better than they can, so it should \nbe no problem that we take these tax dollars away from them, even if \nthey are unfair.\n  Again, the majority of Americans agree, the death tax is unfair. You \nhave paid all your taxes all your life to accumulate your estate, and \nthe Government wants to come in after you die and take more than half \nof it again. It is the same with the marriage tax penalty. Because you \nare married, you are going to be taxed at a higher rate--on average, \nper couple, $1,400 per year--and somehow that is fair.\n  Think of it. If someone asked you, what is your projected income over \nthe next 10 years, would you want to sign a contract committing you to \nspend every single penny of it right now? The President is distorting \nthis whole story. We are talking about a surplus, the overcharge. We \nare not talking about the base wage which the Government is receiving \nin taxes, but he is talking about the surplus.\n  We should give the surplus back. I like to use a story about finding \na wallet. Say this family is sitting around their kitchen table. They \nfind a wallet, and it has $1,000 in it. They say: If we take our \nregular budget and now add this $1,000 to it, we can buy that big-\nscreen TV we always wanted. They say: We have the money; we found it.\n  Congress has found this wallet with all these surplus tax dollars in \nit. I was taught--and I think most parents continue to teach their \nchildren today--that if you find a wallet with money in it, you should \ndo your best to find the owner and give it back, not to run with it and \nsay: Oh, we found this money; how can we better spend it? We can spend \nthis money.\n  That is what is happening here. These are overcharges. Would you \nspend all your money now? All we are saying is we should give it back \nto the taxpayers so they can decide how to spend it best.\n  The President said:\n\n       We should have tax cuts this year, but they should be the \n     right ones.\n\n  We should have tax cuts, but they should be the right ones. The \nPresident 2 years ago in Buffalo, NY, said something to this effect, \nand I will paraphrase it: We could give back all of this surplus, but \nwhat if Americans do not spend it right?\n  That is the same thing he is doing here: We could have tax cuts, but \nthey should be the right ones. In other words, if we give the taxes \nback to the American people, the overcharge, the surplus--we are not \neven talking tax cuts here. That is a misused term. We are not cutting \ntaxes. What we are trying to decide is how much of the surplus should \ngo back to you, the taxpayer, that you have been overcharged.\n\n  The President said: We could give it all back, but what if you don't \nspend it right? In other words, you are smart enough to go out and earn \nyour money, but somehow you are too dumb to know how to spend your \nmoney, and Washington can do that for you and do it better and do it in \nthese targeted programs that are going to help everybody. But it will \nnot let you have the opportunity to spend the money the way that will \nbest benefit your family.\n  Every family is a little different. Your needs are different from \nmine and your neighbors' or even your brothers' and sisters' in raising \ntheir families. You should have the opportunity to decide how this \nprosperity, these extra dollars, should be spent.\n  What the President is saying is, send them to Washington, or keep \nsending this surplus to Washington, and we will decide what is best for \nyou and how best to spend it.\n  The President said: In good conscience, I cannot sign one expensive \ntax break--again, it is not a tax break; it is an overcharge--after \nanother without coherent strategy. In other words, they want to control \nhow these extra tax dollars are spent --not you, taking it out of your \ncontrol. They want to determine exactly how these tax dollars should be \nspent.\n  The President also says he supports this marriage tax penalty we \npassed, but he said it should be a carefully targeted marriage tax \npenalty that will cost less. Why will it cost less? Because the \nPresident eliminates a great number of these couples who currently \nqualify for the marriage tax penalty. He is saying that if you make too \nmuch money, if you itemize, or do not itemize, somehow you will not \nqualify.\n  The President says ``targeted.'' Again we hear that word \n``targeted.'' When we hear that, it means Washington believes it can \nbest determine what you need or what program the Government can create \nor how the Government can spend your tax money.\n  I want to say one other thing before I close, and that is what the \nPresident said at the end of his speech. I agree with these last few \nlines:\n\n       The surplus comes from the hard work and ingenuity of the \n     American people. We owe it to them to make the best use of \n     it, for all of them and for our children's future.\n\n  I agree with that statement. The only thing is we disagree on how to \naccomplish it. ``The surplus comes from hard work and ingenuity of the \nAmerican people. We owe it to them to make the best use of it. . . .'' \nTo me, the best use would be to give the surplus back.\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\n  We are not talking tax cuts at all. We are not talking about reducing \nthe revenues Washington needs to run this Government and its programs. \nWhat we are talking about is the surplus. We owe it to them to make the \nbest use of it. That will be in rebating, returning those dollars to \nyou so you can then decide what is best for your family. Is it braces \nfor one of your children, or dancing lessons? Is it to begin an \neducational fund for your child? He is 5 years old, and you want to \nprepare for his college. You will make that decision, and you will not \nhave to worry or wait for a Government program and then stand there \nwith a hand out asking: Do I qualify, and can I get some of my tax \ndollars back?\n  You will have to wait for somebody in Washington to say yes or no. \nThat is not what should be happening. You should have control over your \ndollars. We all need to pay taxes. We know that. There are a lot of \ngood things the Federal Government does. We know that. But Washington \nshould not have the control of determining how to spend the additional \ndollars, the surplus.\n\n  I strongly urge the President to sign our two tax bills that we want \nto send him: the death tax repeal and the marriage tax penalty. I hope \nthe President will consider them and, as he said in the last line of \nhis speech--again I will read it--we owe it to them to make the best \nuse of it for all of them. And my opinion is to give it in tax relief.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7502-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, in 1993, one of the most interesting times \nin my legislative career was when we in this Chamber voted on President \nClinton's deficit reduction plan. It was a historic vote.\n  As the Presiding Officer will remember, the bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a single vote without a single Republican voting for \nthe President's plan. It came to the Senate and ended up in a tie vote, \nand the Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, broke the tie. It \nwas a very difficult vote for everyone. In the Senate, as in the House, \nnot a single Republican voted for the budget plan.\n  There were people on the other side of the aisle who told of all the \ncalamities that would take place in the country if that passed. Seven \nyears ago, this is what we heard from the other side of the aisle, \nSenate Republicans, from then-Representative Wayne Allard:\n\n       In summary, the plan has a fatal flaw--it does not reduce \n     the deficit.\n\n  Of course, it has reduced the deficit from some $300 billion a year \nto where we now have a surplus.\n  Senator Conrad Burns:\n\n       So we are still going to pile up some more debt, but most \n     of all, we are going to cost jobs in this country.\n\n  What the Senator from Montana said, in truth and in fact, was wrong. \nIn fact, over 20 million new jobs have been created; over 60 percent of \nthose jobs are high-wage jobs. Contrary to what the Senator from \nMontana said, we didn't pile up more debt. We have reduced the debt. We \nhave not only cut down the annual yearly deficit, we have actually paid \ndown the debt--not enough, in my estimation, but we have begun to pay \ndown the debt.\n  Senator Hatch of Utah said:\n\n       Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs.\n\n  Again, not true.\n  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas on August 5, 1993, on the Senate floor:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit four years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower. . . . When all is said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  Everything he predicted is the direct opposite. The economy didn't \nget weaker; it got stronger. The deficit isn't higher; it is lower. \nAmericans aren't paying more taxes; they are paying less taxes. He \nsaid, ``The economy will create fewer jobs.'' Of course, as I have \nindicated, it created more jobs. ``Government will spend more money.'' \nThe fact is, the Federal Government today has 300,000 fewer Federal \nemployees than it had when this statement was made by Senator Gramm. We \nhave a Federal Government today that is smaller than when President \nKennedy was President.\n  He went on to say in September of 1993:\n\n       . . . [T]his program is going to make the economy weaker. . \n     . . Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their \n     jobs as a result of this program.\n\n  Wrong, absolutely wrong; not even close. The program the President \nasked us to vote for, and we did, made the economy stronger. We have \nhad the lowest inflation, the lowest unemployment in more than 40 \nyears. There had been economic growth as high in the past but never any \nhigher than we have had. We hold the record for the longest period of \neconomic growth in the history of this country.\n  Phil Gramm went on to state, on another occasion on the Senate floor:\n\n       I believe that hundreds of thousands of people are going to \n     lose their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that \n     Bill Clinton will be one of those people.\n\n  Well, hundreds of thousands of people didn't lose their jobs; tens of \nmillions of people got new jobs. And President Clinton was reelected. \nAgain, my friend from Texas was wrong.\n\n  The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley:\n\n       I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know \n     this bill will cost jobs.\n\n  Well, my friend from Iowa was wrong, too. It didn't take a rocket \nscientist. It took people with courage to follow a leader who said: Do \nthis and the economy is going to turn around. We did that. We are not \nrocket scientists, but common sense dictated if we did the things that \nwere in that budget, it would make the economy better. It would set a \nnew course in the United States for economic viability. We followed \nthat lead, and here is where we now are.\n  My friend Connie Mack, with whom I came to Congress in 1982, said in \n1993:\n\n       This bill will cost America jobs, no doubt about it.\n\n  Senator William Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee now, said \nback then:\n\n       It will flatten the economy.\n\n  Not true. Quite the contrary. My friend from Delaware went on to say:\n\n       I am concerned about what this plan will do to our economy. \n     I am concerned about what it will do to jobs. I am concerned \n     about what it will do to our families, our communities, and \n     to our children's future.\n\n  Well, he should not have been concerned. Or if he was concerned, I am \nsure he feels much better today because everything about which he was \nconcerned has been to the good of the country. The economy is better. \nIt has been better for families and communities and the future of our \nchildren.\n  Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania:\n\n       People know it's bad policy. . . . Let's do something . . . \n     that creates jobs, that really will solve the deficit, not \n     just feed this monster of government with more and more money \n     for it to go out and spend more and more.\n\n  He was reading a different set of blueprints than everyone else \nbecause he was wrong.\n  Senator Strom Thurmond, longest serving Senator in this body, said in \n1993:\n\n       It contains no real spending cuts to reduce the deficit or \n     improve the Nation's outlook.\n\n  Representative Dick Armey, majority leader in the House:\n\n       The impact on job creation is going to be devastating.\n\n  Dan Burton, Representative from Indiana of longstanding, said:\n\n       The Democratic plan means higher deficits, a higher \n     national debt, deficits running $350 billion a year.\n\n  He was only about $450 billion wrong about the deficit. In fact, it \nhas turned around. We have a $100 billion surplus or more.\n  John Kasich, with whom I came to Congress in 1982, a Representative \nfrom Ohio, said:\n\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\n\n       This plan will not work. If it was to work, then I'd have \n     to become a Democrat . . .\n\n  That is a direct quote. Kasich is retiring from the House this year. \nMaybe he is doing it so he can reregister. It is quite clear that if he \nis a man of his word, he should become a Democrat because he was wrong \nin his prediction.\n  It is good once in a while to revisit history, to talk about what \npeople said will happen, to go back and see what the record is.\n  Let's look at the record not in 1993, and what has transpired that \nhas turned this economy on fire, but let's talk about the future. We in \nthe minority believe in the future. We don't believe in the past, even \nthough once in a while it is important that you look at history. We \nbelieve in the future. We believe the future in this country has been \nhampered, hindered, slowed down by the majority in the Congress, the \nRepublican House, the Republican Senate.\n  We believe we should be able to have up-or-down votes and have a full \ndebate without any restrictions. I know we have people who come and \nsay: Sure, you can debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nbut we are going to limit debate. We want you to have five amendments, \nand we will have five amendments.\n  Let's do it the way we have always done it in the Senate. Let's bring \nout the elementary and secondary education bill, complete it, vote on \nit, and go on to something else.\n  One of the actions we should take when we finish the debate on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is to provide money for \nmodernizing our schools. We need new schools some places. We need to \nrenovate schools in other places. This is important for our children.\n  We need to do something about the health care delivery system in this \ncountry. Forty-five million Americans have no health care. The greatest \npower in the history of the world, and we have 45 million people who \ncan't go to the doctor when they are sick. That is an embarrassment. \nHow can President Clinton go to the G-8 when we have 45 million people \nwho have no health insurance? I, as a Member of the Senate, am not \nproud of that fact. That number is going up 1.5 million every year. \nNext year, it will be almost 47 million. We don't even talk about that \nanymore. We don't talk about the uninsured.\n  We are now talking about a small number of people who are insured. We \nare talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am glad we are doing \nthat. But we are ignoring the 45 million people. We need to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights so we have doctors again taking charge of \npatients, not a clerk in Baltimore determining whether or not someone \ncan have an appendectomy or an MRI.\n  When I was a young man, my first elected job was to the board of \ntrustees. I was elected to the board, and later I became chairman. I \nwas a young man. This was for the largest hospital district in Nevada. \nIt was called the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. When I came there, \nover 40 percent of the seniors who came into our hospital had no health \ninsurance. In those days, when you came to the hospital, you had your \nmother, brother, neighbor, or somebody else who had to sign and be \nresponsible for that bill. If they didn't pay the bill, just as all \nhospitals in America would do, we would go after you with a vengeance. \nWe would go after your wages, your car, your house. We had a very \naggressive collection agency that would go after bills of seniors who \ndid not pay.\n  When I was on the board of trustees, Medicare came to be. Bob Dole \nvoted against that, and he was proud of that. Dick Armey said it was a \nbad idea. Medicare is not a perfect program--far from it--but it has \ngiven dignity to senior citizens because they don't have to beg for \nhealth care. When it came into being, prescription drugs weren't a big \ndeal. Prescriptions did not keep people alive. They did not make people \nlive more comfortable lives. Today, the average senior citizen gets 18 \nprescriptions filled every year. We can't have a program for senior \ncitizens in health care that doesn't include prescription drugs. That \nis part of the future in the Democratic vision. We want prescription \ndrug benefits in Medicare. We want prescription drugs to be more \naffordable for everybody.\n  There is a stereotype out there that someone who gets minimum wage is \na teenager flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. Over 60 percent of the \npeople who draw minimum wage are women, and for over 40 percent of \nthose women, that is the only money they get for their families--\nnothing else. Minimum wage is not just for people flipping hamburgers \nat McDonald's; it is for people earning a living, keeping people off \nwelfare. I think it would be nice if we increased the minimum wage. I \nbelieve people need dignity with work. The minimum wage is one of those \nthings that does just that.\n  I come from the West. I remember with fondness that on my 12th \nbirthday my parents ordered me a 12-gauge shotgun out of the Sears and \nRoebuck catalog. I was 12 years old, and I had a 12-gauge shotgun. They \npaid $28 for it. I loved that gun. I still have it. I got the stock \nreworked. It was bolt action. I have been a police officer and I \ncarried a gun. I have a lot of guns--a rifle, a shotgun, pistols. So I \nunderstand guns. But I still think it is not a bad idea if we have a \nlaw so that crazy people and felons can't buy guns.\n  What have we as Democrats been trying to do? We have been trying to \nclose loopholes, saying that at pawnshops and gun shows where there are \nloopholes, where criminals and crazies buy these guns, we want to close \nthose loopholes. We can't even vote on that. They keep stopping us. We \ndon't have the opportunity to do that. As my friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan, has said--he uses these one-liners--I don't believe you \nneed an assault weapon to go deer hunting. If you do, you should find \nanother hobby. Some of these comments on the gun safety issues reflect, \nI think, what the American people really think.\n  I could talk more, but I think it is too bad that we are here in \nmorning business, not able to address some of these very important \nissues.\n  One of the issues that tears into my heart every time I mention this \nis that we need to do a better job of helping kids to stay in school. I \nsay to my friend from Minnesota, who was a college professor before he \ncame here, at one of the very fine institutions of higher learning in \nAmerica, Carleton College--and we have lots of them--I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota got the best students. But there are a lot of the best \nstudents who didn't have the opportunity to come to his institution. A \nlot of them dropped out of school.\n\n  We have 3,000 children who drop out of high school every day in \nAmerica and 500,000 a year. Every time a kid drops out of school, he or \nshe is less than they could be. I have tried on the Senate floor, with \nmy friend from New Mexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman, to pass legislation \nthat would set up in the Department of Education a branch whose sole \nfunction in life would be to work on the dropout problems we have. The \nHouse passed it. Last year, it was defeated on a straight party line \nvote in this body.\n  I think we need to do something about that. I think we have the \nluxury of doing so. I think we should do something. I know my friend \nfrom Minnesota is an expert in this field. I talk about people having \nno health insurance and people who have health insurance treated \npoorly. What about the problems we have with mental health in this \ncountry? It is an ignored segment of our society. The Federal \nGovernment, I believe, has a role and obligation to do something about \nthe many problems facing Americans today, not the least of which is \n31,000 people who kill themselves every year. We have to better \nunderstand that. I wish we were debating some of these issues today.\n  I didn't want the day to go by, when we have time on the floor, \nwithout talking about some tough votes we have taken and how important \nit was that the 1993 Clinton Budget Deficit Reduction Act passed, how \nimportant it is to the history of this country, and how well we are \ndoing as a result of that, and how much better we could do if we could \nvote on some of these issues I have outlined today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7503-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7503-S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LET'S DO THE SENATE'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Reid\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nfrom Nevada, for his really fine statement. One of the things I most \nappreciate about Senator Reid is, his voice is a quiet voice, but it is \na very firm and strong voice.\n  I come to the floor wondering why it is that on Tuesday morning at 11 \no'clock we are in morning business, which means we can't really do the \nwork of democracy. To me, the work of democracy is to focus on issues \nthat are important to people's lives and to try to make a difference.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, we have a very simple situation \nhere. We in the minority believe we have the right to have a few judges \napproved by the Senate. Our dear friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, \nhas had a judge pending for 1,200 days and he has not even had a \nhearing. We would like that person to have a hearing. Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa has had a judge pending who already had a hearing. We also \nbelieve we have some appropriations bills that need to move forward, \nand there are some strings on that. We want to work, but there are some \nthings that we think, in fairness, we deserve. As a result of that, \nthings have slowed down, which is too bad.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Unfortunately, I am well aware of the situation, and, \nagain, I think we have reached a point where this is raw politics. \nPeople in the country this November can decide about what direction we \nshould take. A calculation can be made that a Presidential race is \ncoming up and we don't want to move any judges anymore, whether it is \nfor the court of appeals or Federal district judges. But when there has \nbeen such a long wait, as a Democrat, I think it is important that \nDemocrats draw the line and insist that some of these highly qualified \nmen and women be able to serve in the judiciary.\n  I want to very briefly emphasize some of what was said this morning. \nI want to be out here on the floor of the Senate right now but not in \nmorning business. I would like to be out here discussing a piece of \nlegislation or with the ability to introduce an amendment to a piece of \nlegislation that would make a positive difference in the lives of \npeople in Minnesota and other people in the United States of America.\n  I was at a public hearing with Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee from \nHouston. It was in Houston in Harris County, which I think is about the \nfifth largest county in America. It was about the mental health of \nchildren. I will never forget the testimony of Matt, who directs the \ncounty correction system. He spoke within a law and order framework. He \nmade it clear that he is a no-nonsense law and order person. But he \nalso said people believe these kids who are locked up are locked up \nbecause they have done something bad. But the truth is--these are his \nstatistics--about 40 percent of these kids are locked up because \nparents couldn't get mental help for them. There was nothing available.\n  I would like to be out on the floor of the Senate introducing \nlegislation and passing legislation that would make it possible for \nthese kids to get the help--so they wouldn't be locked up; so they \ncould go on and live good lives.\n  There is a piece of legislation I have introduced with Senator \nDomenici called the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act. I think it \nis shameful that there is for so many people who struggle with mental \nillness still such discrimination in coverage, and their illness is \ntreated as if it is a moral failing when they don't get the coverage. \nWhen it comes to the stays in the hospital, physician visits, and what \nbills are covered, the coverage isn't there. They go without treatment. \nI would like to be on the floor of the Senate doing the business and \nwork of democracy by trying to pass this legislation.\n  My colleague, Senator Reid, said that a Patients' Bill of Rights is \njust but one step. I agree with him. I think it is important to people \nin the country to make sure that in this health care system they fit \nin; to make sure the providers fit in; and to make sure that the people \nwho are denied access to care which they believe they need for \nthemselves and their families have a right to appeal when there is some \nprotection for them.\n  I would like to pass meaningful patient protection legislation. I \nwould like the floor right now involved in that debate.\n  I introduced a bill for the Service Employees International Union. It \nis a great union. I was at a press conference with Andy Stearn, the \npresident, and other members of the union. This is a union that knows \nhow to organize workers. It is the fastest growing union in America. \nProbably 70 or 75 percent of the membership is women. Probably 70 or 75 \npercent of the membership is people of color. It is a piece of \nlegislation that I think speaks to the No. 1 concern of people around \nthe country; that is, health security for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  What we basically say in this legislation is, as a national \ncommunity, here is what we can agree upon--that there should be health \ncare benefits for the people we represent that is as good as we have in \nCongress. I am determined to introduce a resolution and have a vote on \nthat proposition that the people we represent should have the same \nhealth security that we have.\n  In that legislation, we agree nationally, as a community, that health \ncare coverage should be affordable; that when you have an income below \n$20,000, you pay 0.5 percent and no more of your annual income; between \n$25,000 and $50,000, you pay no more than 5 percent of your income per \nyear; and over $50,000 a year, you would never pay more than 7 percent \nof your annual income.\n\n  Part of the problem with health care is not just the 44 million or 45 \nmillion who are uninsured, but all of the people when it comes to \npaying deductibles and fees just can't afford it any longer. Too many \npeople are not old enough for Medicare. Even if they are, they can't \nafford prescription drug coverage. They are too poor for medical \nassistance. Even if they are, it is by no means comprehensive. They are \nnot lucky enough to work for an employer that can provide them with \naffordable coverage.\n  We also say nationally that we, as a national community, we agree \nthere should be good patient protection legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his leadership. I say to those \nlistening to this debate that Senator Wellstone of Minnesota has been a \nconsistent voice on the floor of the Senate on the issue of health \ncare. Many of us visit that issue and believe it is important. He has \ndedicated his life in Congress and the Senate to champion the cause of \ngood health care for all Americans and is recognized nationally for his \nleadership on issues such as coverage of those who suffer from mental \nillness.\n  To put the agenda of the Senate in perspective for a moment, because \nthe Senator raises an important question about 40 million Americans who \nhave no health insurance, and many who are underinsured today, and the \nfact that this Congress refuses to even debate the issue or discuss the \nissue when we reach out for a good program that Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Wellstone, and I supported to extend health insurance coverage \nto children of working families in many States, and reaching out in \nother areas, but we seem to be reluctant to address what most American \nfamilies have to address every single day--the lack of security, and \nthe lack of peace of mind when it comes to health insurance--I would \nlike the Senator from Minnesota to comment on the fact that we are in \npossibly one of the greatest periods of prosperity in the history of \nthe United States. We are talking about surpluses under the budget that \nmay reach $2 trillion. The only suggestion from the Republican side of \nthe aisle is that we should use $1 trillion of the surplus--almost half \nthe surplus--to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America \nrather than addressing working families who are uninsured and people \nwho are looking for the peace of mind by having some protection when it \ncomes to basic health care.\n  Will the Senator from Minnesota reflect on what we have done on the \nfloor of the Senate over the last 2 weeks in the context of what I \nconsider the high priority he has raised?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Illinois that any time he \nwants to raise such a question, continue to do so. He got a little \nahead of me. This is exactly where I want to go.\n  To finish this proposal on this legislation and what I like about \nit--then I\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nwill talk about this in a broader context--we are saying to States \nwithin this framework, go ahead and decide how you want to do this. \nOnce we agree on universal coverage, once we have agreed it will be \naffordable with good benefits and patient protection for all citizens, \nthen States decide how they want to do it--one insurer, the employer \npays, pay or play, we decentralize. I think it makes all the sense in \nthe world.\n  Then the question is, What is the cost? Over the first 4 years, as \nyou phase it in, it would be $100 billion. If you are looking at the \ntotal cost over 10 years, it would be $700 billion a year. That is not \neven a third of the projected surplus. So the question becomes, What \nare our priorities?\n\n  I argue, based on conversations and meetings I have had with \nMinnesotans--some people do not agree with this point of view, but I \nsay honestly that I do no damage to the truth on the floor of the \nSenate or any other time. I hope when we summarize all of the \ndiscussions from people about how to reduce poverty, how to have good \nwelfare reform, how to have a stable middle class, how to make sure our \ncountry does well in the international economy, how to make sure our \nchildren have opportunities, how to make sure we can reduce the \nviolence--over and over and over again, the focus is on a good \neducation, good health care, and a good job. That is on what people are \nfocused.\n  There are two questions. I don't want to monopolize the floor. But \none of them has to do with priorities. I think what happened during the \nlast couple of weeks is, frankly, that there has been a major \nideological debate, not, in some ways, dissimilar to what happened in \n1981. To the extent that you are now going to have new tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefiting, by the way, people at the very top--I am \nnot totally against some tax cuts. In fact, I think some tax, targeted \ntax cuts make a lot of sense, especially focused on working families \nand the priorities of our families in the country. But if you are going \nto basically erode the revenue base, and you are going to say over the \nnext 10 years here is $800 billion or $900 billion, no longer from this \nfloor any kind of investment in children, education health care, \nprescription drug benefits so people can afford those benefits, but \ninstead it is going to be tax cuts disproportionately helping those \npeople who are already the very top of the economic ladder, then you \nare doing two things.\n  No. 1, there is no standard of fairness in terms of who gets the tax \nrelief and who gets the help. But even more importantly than that, you \nare eroding the revenue base, making it impossible for Government \nthrough public policy to make a positive difference in the lives of \npeople.\n  If you believe when it comes to education--whether it be pre-K, \nwhether it be affordable child care, whether it be what we can do K \nthrough 12, whether it would be higher education and spending for Pell \ngrants, or when it comes to health care, or when it comes to a whole \nrange of issues that affect people's lives in this way--if you believe \nthat there is nothing the Government can or should do, fine. But that \nphilosophy works well when you own your own large corporation and you \nare wealthy; it doesn't work for most people.\n  Talk to veterans about veterans' health care; talk to families about \nchild care; talk to families about health care; talk to families about \nhigher education; talk to families about affordable housing; talk to \nfamilies about how they believe life can be better for themselves and \ntheir children. They don't believe for a moment that there is nothing \nwe can or should do that would make a difference. Their discouragement \nis all too often that we don't seem to be on their side, and we don't \nseem to be speaking to them or including them.\n  We were in morning business at 11 o'clock this morning. The \nRepublicans don't want to go forward with Federal judges. They don't \nwant to have opportunities for amendments. They do not want to have \nopportunities for debate. They do not want to talk about minimum wage. \nThey don't want to talk about affordable prescription drug costs. They \ndon't want to talk about patient protections. They don't want to talk \nabout health security for families or about a commitment to early \nchildhood development. They don't want to talk about a lot of these \nissues. Therefore, I think the Senate is not doing the work for enough \npeople.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator has come to this floor repeatedly and \ndiscussed concerns that I hear in Illinois and that the Senator from \nMinnesota hears in Minnesota from working families and middle-income \nfamilies trying to do their business. They get up and go to work every \nmorning. They think ahead for their children. They want to realize and \nlive the American dream. The Senator in the parlance of politicians \nfeels the pain of families and their anxieties about their future. It \nappears that the Senate in the last 2 weeks feels the pain of the \nwealthy people in America.\n  For those who think I overstate the case, this is an analysis of the \ntax cuts that have been proposed over the last 2 weeks in the Senate \nand the people who benefit from them.\n  The Republicans proposed that we take over $1 trillion--over half of \nthe surplus for the next 10 years--and give it in tax cuts to the \nwealthiest of Americans. We analyzed their tax cut package. Democrats \nsupport tax cuts. The Senator from Minnesota talked about tax cuts so \npeople can deduct the cost of college education; so people can deduct \nand have a credit for quality day care for their kids; for long-term \ncare for their aging parents; for prescription drug benefits. The \nRepublicans focused on the estate tax and a few other taxes.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Minnesota to comment on this \ndistribution chart because we analyzed the Republican tax cut. Who are \nthe winners and who are the losers? The good news is that everybody \ngets a tax cut under the Republican plan.\n  But look at the tax cut. If you happen to make less than $13,000 a \nyear--these are people of minimum wage--the tax cut is worth $24 a \nyear, or two bucks a month.\n  Move up to $12,400 in income. You are going to see $82 a year, or \nabout seven bucks a month. Now you get up to people making $40,000 a \nyear. We are up to about $11 a month, or $131 a year. If you are up to \n$65,000, these folks are going to see a tax cut of about $16 or $17 a \nmonth under the Republican plan.\n  Fast forward and jump with me, if you will, to the top 1 percent of \nwage earners in America. People making over $300,000 a year--people in \nthe gallery don't have to raise their hands--folks who are making over \n$300,000 a year are going to see an annual tax cut from a Republican \nproposal of $23,000 a year. On average, these people make over $900,000 \na year, $75,000 a month. And the Republicans have proposed giving them \nan additional $2,000 a month in disposable income. For what? For what?\n\n  I can tell Members what these working families would do with $2,000 a \nmonth. It is fairly predictable. They would be paying for the kids' \ncollege education. They would be buying health insurance to make sure \nthey are covered. They would be paying for quality day care. They would \nbe taking care of an aging parent. That is what working families would \ndo with a tax break. That is what Democrats support.\n  The Republicans say no; give the biggest tax cut to those who are \nmaking the most money. The response? Well, Senator, you don't \nunderstand. These people are paying too much in taxes. People making \nunder $50,000 a year can use some tax relief, too. They are paying \npayroll taxes and facing a lot of problems every month.\n  The Republicans, frankly, won't listen to this. I want the Senator \nfrom Minnesota to comment on this distribution chart on his proposals \nof what we could be doing to help working families across this country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this brings into sharp focus yet \nanother issue that should be our priority, that the majority party, the \nRepublican Party, refuses to take up. That is campaign finance reform.\n  I am not making a one-to-one correlation between what any Senator \nsays on the floor or how he or she votes or the position he or she \ntakes on an issue. I am talking about the overall\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nbias of big money and the way in which it dominates politics. When \npeople see this chart and hear the distribution of who benefits and who \ndoes not, the benefits are in inverse relationship to need. It violates \nevery standard of fairness people have. People are all for some tax \nrelief, if it is for families, if it speaks to the concerns of working \nfamilies.\n  This chart is, to most people, a little outrageous. This feeds into \nthe skepticism that people have. Most people would say that is exactly \nwhat the majority party is all about. The folks they represent are the \nfolks who can; they are the heavy hitters. They are the contributors, \nthe players, the investors. They are the ones who have the clout. They \nare the ones who hire the lobbyists. They are the ones who know how, \nwho march on Washington every day. The rest are left out.\n  By the way, all too often, people unfortunately have that perception \nof both parties. What we have seen over the last week or 2 weeks only \nreinforces the skepticism and cynicism people have about who gets \nrepresented in the Senate and who doesn't.\n  I say to my colleague from Illinois, there is another issue. The \nissue is, above and beyond not meeting any standard of fairness, and \nabove and beyond huge benefits but in inverse relationship to need, \nthere is another issue. I believe part of what the majority party is \ndoing--and, by the way, every Republican has a first amendment right to \nbelieve this is the right thing to do for the country--is essentially \neroding the revenue base, giving away $1 trillion in money so when it \ncomes to health security for families, when it comes to long-term \ncare for our parents or our grandparents or when it comes to how you \ncan help a child so he or she by kindergarten can come ready to learn \nand does not fall behind and can do well in school, they don't believe \nthere is anything the Government should be doing. I don't agree. I \ndon't think most of the people in the country agree. I think in that \nsense that is clearly where the differences between the two parties \nmake a difference.\n\n  I am a critic of the timidity of our own party quite often. The \ndifferences right now between Democrats and Republicans make a real \ndifference in the lives of people in this country.\n  I conclude by mentioning another issue. I want to make sure I don't \ndo this in a cheap shot, bashing way. I don't want to. There is a \nbitter irony because we will have an appropriations bill on the floor--\nmaybe--this week where we will be raising our salaries and, by the way, \nwhat is tricky for me is our salaries are above the Federal employees, \nincluding support staff who work hard. I am not interested in bashing \naway at people. But we are not interested in raising the minimum wage. \nWe don't want to raise the minimum wage for people. If there is one \nproposition that people in the country agree on, people ought to be \nable to make enough of a wage so they can support their families and \ngive their children the care they know their children need and deserve.\n  We are now at the point where we want to have a minimum wage bill on \nthe floor; we want to raise the minimum wage. I say to Senator Durbin, \n75 to 80 percent of the people in the country believe that is the right \nthing to do.\n  Disproportionately, it is women in the workforce out there every day, \npeople who are working 40 hours a week, almost 52 weeks a year, still \npoor in America, and still can't support their families. We are going \nto have an appropriations bill out here where we are going to be \nraising our wages--and we don't do badly--but this Senate, this \nRepublican majority, is not willing to even entertain a debate and let \nus vote on whether or not we think we should raise the minimum wage.\n\n  These are big issues because they crucially affect the quality or \nlack of quality of the lives of the people we represent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This chart shows what is happening to families of three \ntrying to survive on a minimum wage. There are lots of people trying to \nlive while earning a minimum wage. It usually means multiple jobs. \nThere are 350,000 in Illinois alone who get up and go to work for a \nminimum wage. They usually have a second job. One of my friends who \nworks in the Watertower Place across the street from the hotel I stay \nin Chicago--she is a great friend of mine--is trying to take care of an \naging mother. She has two jobs. She works in a parking garage as an \nattendant and then when she gets off that job she is a hostess in a \nrestaurant. This lady works harder than most of us who think we are \nhard workers, and she is working for a little bit above the minimum \nwage.\n  What we see on this chart, I say to Senator Wellstone, is when we \njudge what the poverty line is in America, look what happened in about \nthe year 1989. All of a sudden the minimum wage fell below the poverty \nline. Those of us who wanted to make sure people who get up and work \nhard every day get a decent paycheck and a chance to have a livable \nwage have asked to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour \nover a 2-year period of time. I guarantee you will not live a life of \nluxury at $6.15 an hour, but you may be able to take care of some basic \nneeds such as school uniforms for the kids, and shoes, maybe a decent \nplace to live, a safer and cleaner place to live. Yet we cannot seem to \nget that issue before the Congress.\n  Republican leadership--in what has been a departure from the past \nwhere they said this is a bipartisan issue--has now said this is a \npartisan issue. Republicans oppose a minimum wage increase. The \nDemocrats support it and the Republicans have stopped us.\n  I will give an example. If I'm not mistaken, Governor Bush from \nTexas, his position is States ought to be able to opt out of the \nminimum wage increase. That is what he would do. So you would have \ncertain pockets in the United States which would not have a minimum \nwage increase. That is cold comfort for people who get up and go to \nwork and try to keep things together for their family. But the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is correct. The minimum wage has been plummeting in its \nbuying power. Congress has the authority to take care of that issue. \nCongress has refused.\n  Instead of dealing with a minimum wage and giving people basically $1 \nan hour increase, which comes out to about $2,000 a year if my math is \ncorrect, here we decide to give $2,000 a month in tax breaks to people \nmaking over $300,000 a year. We cannot give $2,000 a year to people who \nwork hard every single day, but we can give folks making over $300,000 \na year under the Republican tax break plan, a $23,000-a-year tax cut--\nalmost $2,000 a month. Those are the priorities. Those are the \ndifferences.\n  I think we try our best to feel the pain of working families. The \nRepublicans feel the pain of the wealthy, the pain they must go through \nevery day trying to decide what to do with another $2,000 when they \nhave a paycheck coming in of $25,000 a month. What anguish, what pain, \nwhat frustration it must be to try to figure out another mutual fund or \nanother vacation place.\n\n  How about the families worried about having a few bucks in the bank \nand paying for their kids' education?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague--and I am breaking my promise on \nlast words, but on the whole issue of Governor Bush, talking about \ncompassionate conservatism, I have no doubt he says it with sincerity. \nI am fond of this old Yiddish proverb--I think it is a Yiddish \nproverb--about how you cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. \nFrankly, you can talk about compassion. But the other problem is you \ncannot make a difference unless you are willing to, in fact, reach into \nyour pocket and invest some resources.\n  My colleague mentioned minimum wage. It occurred to me that one of \nthe truly awful things is there are two groups of citizens we say we \ncare the most about--let's talk about compassion--the very young \nchildren and the elderly, the people who built the country with the \nstrength of their backs, who now, toward the end of their lives, may be \nstruggling because of illness. Think about it for a moment, I say to my \ncolleague from Illinois. Let's talk wages and then let's talk \ninvestment. The men and women who take care of small children, who work \nin child care, or take care of elderly people--either home-based care \nor nursing homes--are the most miserably paid workers in our\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\ncountry. We devalue the work of adults who take care of small children. \nWe devalue the work of adults who take care of the elderly and those \npeople struggling toward the end of their lives. They have the lowest \nwages and the worst--among the worst--benefits.\n  Raising the minimum wage would help. It would make a difference. So \nwould affordable health care coverage. We could make a difference, I \nsay to my colleague from Illinois, and we should. But we do not.\n  Is there any wonder at the turnover in both of these fields? I know \nin child care there is a 40-percent turnover every year, because if you \ngraduate from school, college, you probably are going to have a debt. \nIf you want to work in the child care field, you are looking at a $9-\nan-hour job maybe with no health care benefits, or a $7-an-hour job. \nThe same goes for home-based care or for nursing homes.\n  My final point. The problem with this chart is that you are talking \nabout the top 1 percent getting the lion's share of all of these tax \nbenefits. You are also talking about eroding the revenue base over the \nnext decade to the point where, in certain decisive areas of life, we \nwill not be able to make the investment. I want to shout this from the \nmountaintop on the floor of the Senate and finish with these words.\n  When it comes to child care, if you want to talk compassion and you \ntalk so much about small children and you care so much that there is \nnurturing care and they are challenged and come to school ready to \nlearn, this is not going to be done on the cheap. This is going to \nrequire real investment if we are serious.\n  When it comes to the elderly--I went through this with my parents. \nNow I will be critical of us for a moment. I am all for tax credits. It \nis fine. But both my mom and dad had Parkinson's. We moved them to \nNorthfield. We actually lived here and we moved them to Northfield, MN, \nto try to keep them at home. We did. We kept them at home for a long \ntime. It got to the point where we would spend the night with them, our \nchildren would, and then we were just exhausted.\n\n  I sent a note out. It was the best day I ever had teaching at \nCarelton. I was desperate. I sent a note out to students and I said: \nHere is the situation with my parents. My dad in particular, he was \nfrom Ukraine, then Russia, and speaks 10 languages fluently and I think \nyou would enjoy him. But we need some help. Would anybody be interested \nin spending the night?\n  The next day I got 170 letters back from students saying they would \nbe more than willing to help. It was wonderful. Then at the very end he \nfell and broke his hip and we no longer could keep them at home.\n  But my point is, home-based care, enabling people to stay at home as \nlong as possible, live with dignity, it is not done on a tax credit of \n$3,000. It is a lot more expensive than that. But if we are serious \nabout this, we are going to have to make some investment. I can think \nof a better use of $1 trillion over the next decade for our country, \nthe United States of America, than tax cuts that disproportionately go \nto the top 1 percent of the wealthy. I think we can do better for \npeople like my mom and dad, who are no longer alive today. And I know \nwe can do better for these small children.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he may recall we asked the Members \nof the Senate to take their choice, make a pick, make a decision. That \nis what we are sent here to do, cast a vote. Senator Dodd stood up on \nday care and said: Shouldn't we help working families who are \nstruggling to find a safe, quality place to leave their kids when they \nare off to work so they can have peace of mind and the children can \ngrow in a positive learning environment, a safe environment?\n  He said: Instead of giving a tax break of $23,000 a year to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans, why don't we talk about targeting \ntax cuts so families can have more of a tax credit to pay for day care? \nHe took another step the Senator from Minnesota, I am sure, remembers. \nSenator Dodd said: What about those families where the mother, for \nexample, decides to stay home and raise the kids? Shouldn't we be \nencouraging that family? They are making an economic sacrifice for the \ngood of their children. Shouldn't they have a tax break?\n  I agree with him. My wife stayed at home. I am glad she did. I guess \nwe did not buy all the things we could have in life, but we sure ended \nup with three good kids, thanks to her hard work. She stayed home and \nhelped raise those kids.\n  A lot of families make that decision, that economic sacrifice. \nShouldn't our Tax Code help those mothers? Frankly, we are going to \nhelp you whatever your choice. Whether you go to work and need help \nwith day care or stay home with your children, we are going to give you \ntax relief targeted to those families. The Republicans said: No, no, \nthat is not a priority. Here is the priority. The priority is giving to \npeople who make an average income of $900,000 a year about $2,000 more \na month to figure out what they are going to do with it.\n  That is the difference. That is what the debate came down to.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, as he talks about long-term care, touches \nmy heart, too. My mother passed away a few years ago. Thank goodness, \nshe was able to stay independent for a long period of time, usually \nwatching her son on C-SPAN and calling him in the evening to correct \nhim on some of the things he said. I understand what families go \nthrough when they start making these decisions--and they are \nheartbreaking decisions--about their parents and grandparents. We \nbelieve tax breaks should be available to those families who want to \ntake care of their parents and grandparents, who are willing to \nsacrifice. But not on the Republican side. They are more concerned \nabout this estate tax which, as my colleague from Minnesota says, \ndisproportionately helps the very wealthiest people in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I remember the \namendment well because I offered it with Senator Dodd. But there was \none other important feature to it. It was a refundable tax credit. It \nwas going to provide some help for those families who did not come \nunder $30,000, which is critically important.\n  I say the same thing about higher education. If we want to do tax \ncredits, make sure they are refundable. Again, think of our community \ncollege students. I have reached the conclusion that the nontraditional \nstudents have become the traditional students. I have reached the \nconclusion that the majority of students today in higher education are \nno longer 18 and 19 living in a dorm. The majority are 30, 35, 40, 45, \n50, going back to school, many of them women, many of them with \nchildren. And, again, I can think of a better use of this money than a \ntax break for the top 1 percent of the population.\n  I far prefer to be out here on the floor passing legislation which \nwill assure affordable higher education, affordable child care, and \nmake a real investment in health care than some of these other areas.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield before he yields the floor, \nmost of us in the Chamber are well aware of Senator Wellstone's \nbackground. Having been involved in teaching in Minnesota and higher \neducation in his professional career before his election, he \nunderstands, if not better than most of us, what higher education is \nabout, what it offers, and also what it costs.\n  The Senator from Minnesota raises another point. We offered an \nalternative to this estate tax break which comes down to $23,000 a year \nfor the wealthiest Americans. We said we are going to help for the very \nfirst time in America working middle-income families. We are going to \nallow them to deduct the cost of college education expenses from their \nincome taxes. It is not a major deduction, but it helps. It said, for \nexample, up to $12,000 a year could be deducted, and it would be \ntreated in the 28-percent rate, which means a little over $3,000 a \nyear.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The time for the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is anyone seeking recognition on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Wyoming. I \nthank him for all his efforts in organizing information to be shared \nwith fellow Senators and with the American public.\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7503-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7503-S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LET'S DO THE SENATE'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Reid\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nfrom Nevada, for his really fine statement. One of the things I most \nappreciate about Senator Reid is, his voice is a quiet voice, but it is \na very firm and strong voice.\n  I come to the floor wondering why it is that on Tuesday morning at 11 \no'clock we are in morning business, which means we can't really do the \nwork of democracy. To me, the work of democracy is to focus on issues \nthat are important to people's lives and to try to make a difference.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, we have a very simple situation \nhere. We in the minority believe we have the right to have a few judges \napproved by the Senate. Our dear friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, \nhas had a judge pending for 1,200 days and he has not even had a \nhearing. We would like that person to have a hearing. Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa has had a judge pending who already had a hearing. We also \nbelieve we have some appropriations bills that need to move forward, \nand there are some strings on that. We want to work, but there are some \nthings that we think, in fairness, we deserve. As a result of that, \nthings have slowed down, which is too bad.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Unfortunately, I am well aware of the situation, and, \nagain, I think we have reached a point where this is raw politics. \nPeople in the country this November can decide about what direction we \nshould take. A calculation can be made that a Presidential race is \ncoming up and we don't want to move any judges anymore, whether it is \nfor the court of appeals or Federal district judges. But when there has \nbeen such a long wait, as a Democrat, I think it is important that \nDemocrats draw the line and insist that some of these highly qualified \nmen and women be able to serve in the judiciary.\n  I want to very briefly emphasize some of what was said this morning. \nI want to be out here on the floor of the Senate right now but not in \nmorning business. I would like to be out here discussing a piece of \nlegislation or with the ability to introduce an amendment to a piece of \nlegislation that would make a positive difference in the lives of \npeople in Minnesota and other people in the United States of America.\n  I was at a public hearing with Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee from \nHouston. It was in Houston in Harris County, which I think is about the \nfifth largest county in America. It was about the mental health of \nchildren. I will never forget the testimony of Matt, who directs the \ncounty correction system. He spoke within a law and order framework. He \nmade it clear that he is a no-nonsense law and order person. But he \nalso said people believe these kids who are locked up are locked up \nbecause they have done something bad. But the truth is--these are his \nstatistics--about 40 percent of these kids are locked up because \nparents couldn't get mental help for them. There was nothing available.\n  I would like to be out on the floor of the Senate introducing \nlegislation and passing legislation that would make it possible for \nthese kids to get the help--so they wouldn't be locked up; so they \ncould go on and live good lives.\n  There is a piece of legislation I have introduced with Senator \nDomenici called the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act. I think it \nis shameful that there is for so many people who struggle with mental \nillness still such discrimination in coverage, and their illness is \ntreated as if it is a moral failing when they don't get the coverage. \nWhen it comes to the stays in the hospital, physician visits, and what \nbills are covered, the coverage isn't there. They go without treatment. \nI would like to be on the floor of the Senate doing the business and \nwork of democracy by trying to pass this legislation.\n  My colleague, Senator Reid, said that a Patients' Bill of Rights is \njust but one step. I agree with him. I think it is important to people \nin the country to make sure that in this health care system they fit \nin; to make sure the providers fit in; and to make sure that the people \nwho are denied access to care which they believe they need for \nthemselves and their families have a right to appeal when there is some \nprotection for them.\n  I would like to pass meaningful patient protection legislation. I \nwould like the floor right now involved in that debate.\n  I introduced a bill for the Service Employees International Union. It \nis a great union. I was at a press conference with Andy Stearn, the \npresident, and other members of the union. This is a union that knows \nhow to organize workers. It is the fastest growing union in America. \nProbably 70 or 75 percent of the membership is women. Probably 70 or 75 \npercent of the membership is people of color. It is a piece of \nlegislation that I think speaks to the No. 1 concern of people around \nthe country; that is, health security for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  What we basically say in this legislation is, as a national \ncommunity, here is what we can agree upon--that there should be health \ncare benefits for the people we represent that is as good as we have in \nCongress. I am determined to introduce a resolution and have a vote on \nthat proposition that the people we represent should have the same \nhealth security that we have.\n  In that legislation, we agree nationally, as a community, that health \ncare coverage should be affordable; that when you have an income below \n$20,000, you pay 0.5 percent and no more of your annual income; between \n$25,000 and $50,000, you pay no more than 5 percent of your income per \nyear; and over $50,000 a year, you would never pay more than 7 percent \nof your annual income.\n\n  Part of the problem with health care is not just the 44 million or 45 \nmillion who are uninsured, but all of the people when it comes to \npaying deductibles and fees just can't afford it any longer. Too many \npeople are not old enough for Medicare. Even if they are, they can't \nafford prescription drug coverage. They are too poor for medical \nassistance. Even if they are, it is by no means comprehensive. They are \nnot lucky enough to work for an employer that can provide them with \naffordable coverage.\n  We also say nationally that we, as a national community, we agree \nthere should be good patient protection legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his leadership. I say to those \nlistening to this debate that Senator Wellstone of Minnesota has been a \nconsistent voice on the floor of the Senate on the issue of health \ncare. Many of us visit that issue and believe it is important. He has \ndedicated his life in Congress and the Senate to champion the cause of \ngood health care for all Americans and is recognized nationally for his \nleadership on issues such as coverage of those who suffer from mental \nillness.\n  To put the agenda of the Senate in perspective for a moment, because \nthe Senator raises an important question about 40 million Americans who \nhave no health insurance, and many who are underinsured today, and the \nfact that this Congress refuses to even debate the issue or discuss the \nissue when we reach out for a good program that Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Wellstone, and I supported to extend health insurance coverage \nto children of working families in many States, and reaching out in \nother areas, but we seem to be reluctant to address what most American \nfamilies have to address every single day--the lack of security, and \nthe lack of peace of mind when it comes to health insurance--I would \nlike the Senator from Minnesota to comment on the fact that we are in \npossibly one of the greatest periods of prosperity in the history of \nthe United States. We are talking about surpluses under the budget that \nmay reach $2 trillion. The only suggestion from the Republican side of \nthe aisle is that we should use $1 trillion of the surplus--almost half \nthe surplus--to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America \nrather than addressing working families who are uninsured and people \nwho are looking for the peace of mind by having some protection when it \ncomes to basic health care.\n  Will the Senator from Minnesota reflect on what we have done on the \nfloor of the Senate over the last 2 weeks in the context of what I \nconsider the high priority he has raised?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Illinois that any time he \nwants to raise such a question, continue to do so. He got a little \nahead of me. This is exactly where I want to go.\n  To finish this proposal on this legislation and what I like about \nit--then I\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nwill talk about this in a broader context--we are saying to States \nwithin this framework, go ahead and decide how you want to do this. \nOnce we agree on universal coverage, once we have agreed it will be \naffordable with good benefits and patient protection for all citizens, \nthen States decide how they want to do it--one insurer, the employer \npays, pay or play, we decentralize. I think it makes all the sense in \nthe world.\n  Then the question is, What is the cost? Over the first 4 years, as \nyou phase it in, it would be $100 billion. If you are looking at the \ntotal cost over 10 years, it would be $700 billion a year. That is not \neven a third of the projected surplus. So the question becomes, What \nare our priorities?\n\n  I argue, based on conversations and meetings I have had with \nMinnesotans--some people do not agree with this point of view, but I \nsay honestly that I do no damage to the truth on the floor of the \nSenate or any other time. I hope when we summarize all of the \ndiscussions from people about how to reduce poverty, how to have good \nwelfare reform, how to have a stable middle class, how to make sure our \ncountry does well in the international economy, how to make sure our \nchildren have opportunities, how to make sure we can reduce the \nviolence--over and over and over again, the focus is on a good \neducation, good health care, and a good job. That is on what people are \nfocused.\n  There are two questions. I don't want to monopolize the floor. But \none of them has to do with priorities. I think what happened during the \nlast couple of weeks is, frankly, that there has been a major \nideological debate, not, in some ways, dissimilar to what happened in \n1981. To the extent that you are now going to have new tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefiting, by the way, people at the very top--I am \nnot totally against some tax cuts. In fact, I think some tax, targeted \ntax cuts make a lot of sense, especially focused on working families \nand the priorities of our families in the country. But if you are going \nto basically erode the revenue base, and you are going to say over the \nnext 10 years here is $800 billion or $900 billion, no longer from this \nfloor any kind of investment in children, education health care, \nprescription drug benefits so people can afford those benefits, but \ninstead it is going to be tax cuts disproportionately helping those \npeople who are already the very top of the economic ladder, then you \nare doing two things.\n  No. 1, there is no standard of fairness in terms of who gets the tax \nrelief and who gets the help. But even more importantly than that, you \nare eroding the revenue base, making it impossible for Government \nthrough public policy to make a positive difference in the lives of \npeople.\n  If you believe when it comes to education--whether it be pre-K, \nwhether it be affordable child care, whether it be what we can do K \nthrough 12, whether it would be higher education and spending for Pell \ngrants, or when it comes to health care, or when it comes to a whole \nrange of issues that affect people's lives in this way--if you believe \nthat there is nothing the Government can or should do, fine. But that \nphilosophy works well when you own your own large corporation and you \nare wealthy; it doesn't work for most people.\n  Talk to veterans about veterans' health care; talk to families about \nchild care; talk to families about health care; talk to families about \nhigher education; talk to families about affordable housing; talk to \nfamilies about how they believe life can be better for themselves and \ntheir children. They don't believe for a moment that there is nothing \nwe can or should do that would make a difference. Their discouragement \nis all too often that we don't seem to be on their side, and we don't \nseem to be speaking to them or including them.\n  We were in morning business at 11 o'clock this morning. The \nRepublicans don't want to go forward with Federal judges. They don't \nwant to have opportunities for amendments. They do not want to have \nopportunities for debate. They do not want to talk about minimum wage. \nThey don't want to talk about affordable prescription drug costs. They \ndon't want to talk about patient protections. They don't want to talk \nabout health security for families or about a commitment to early \nchildhood development. They don't want to talk about a lot of these \nissues. Therefore, I think the Senate is not doing the work for enough \npeople.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator has come to this floor repeatedly and \ndiscussed concerns that I hear in Illinois and that the Senator from \nMinnesota hears in Minnesota from working families and middle-income \nfamilies trying to do their business. They get up and go to work every \nmorning. They think ahead for their children. They want to realize and \nlive the American dream. The Senator in the parlance of politicians \nfeels the pain of families and their anxieties about their future. It \nappears that the Senate in the last 2 weeks feels the pain of the \nwealthy people in America.\n  For those who think I overstate the case, this is an analysis of the \ntax cuts that have been proposed over the last 2 weeks in the Senate \nand the people who benefit from them.\n  The Republicans proposed that we take over $1 trillion--over half of \nthe surplus for the next 10 years--and give it in tax cuts to the \nwealthiest of Americans. We analyzed their tax cut package. Democrats \nsupport tax cuts. The Senator from Minnesota talked about tax cuts so \npeople can deduct the cost of college education; so people can deduct \nand have a credit for quality day care for their kids; for long-term \ncare for their aging parents; for prescription drug benefits. The \nRepublicans focused on the estate tax and a few other taxes.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Minnesota to comment on this \ndistribution chart because we analyzed the Republican tax cut. Who are \nthe winners and who are the losers? The good news is that everybody \ngets a tax cut under the Republican plan.\n  But look at the tax cut. If you happen to make less than $13,000 a \nyear--these are people of minimum wage--the tax cut is worth $24 a \nyear, or two bucks a month.\n  Move up to $12,400 in income. You are going to see $82 a year, or \nabout seven bucks a month. Now you get up to people making $40,000 a \nyear. We are up to about $11 a month, or $131 a year. If you are up to \n$65,000, these folks are going to see a tax cut of about $16 or $17 a \nmonth under the Republican plan.\n  Fast forward and jump with me, if you will, to the top 1 percent of \nwage earners in America. People making over $300,000 a year--people in \nthe gallery don't have to raise their hands--folks who are making over \n$300,000 a year are going to see an annual tax cut from a Republican \nproposal of $23,000 a year. On average, these people make over $900,000 \na year, $75,000 a month. And the Republicans have proposed giving them \nan additional $2,000 a month in disposable income. For what? For what?\n\n  I can tell Members what these working families would do with $2,000 a \nmonth. It is fairly predictable. They would be paying for the kids' \ncollege education. They would be buying health insurance to make sure \nthey are covered. They would be paying for quality day care. They would \nbe taking care of an aging parent. That is what working families would \ndo with a tax break. That is what Democrats support.\n  The Republicans say no; give the biggest tax cut to those who are \nmaking the most money. The response? Well, Senator, you don't \nunderstand. These people are paying too much in taxes. People making \nunder $50,000 a year can use some tax relief, too. They are paying \npayroll taxes and facing a lot of problems every month.\n  The Republicans, frankly, won't listen to this. I want the Senator \nfrom Minnesota to comment on this distribution chart on his proposals \nof what we could be doing to help working families across this country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this brings into sharp focus yet \nanother issue that should be our priority, that the majority party, the \nRepublican Party, refuses to take up. That is campaign finance reform.\n  I am not making a one-to-one correlation between what any Senator \nsays on the floor or how he or she votes or the position he or she \ntakes on an issue. I am talking about the overall\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nbias of big money and the way in which it dominates politics. When \npeople see this chart and hear the distribution of who benefits and who \ndoes not, the benefits are in inverse relationship to need. It violates \nevery standard of fairness people have. People are all for some tax \nrelief, if it is for families, if it speaks to the concerns of working \nfamilies.\n  This chart is, to most people, a little outrageous. This feeds into \nthe skepticism that people have. Most people would say that is exactly \nwhat the majority party is all about. The folks they represent are the \nfolks who can; they are the heavy hitters. They are the contributors, \nthe players, the investors. They are the ones who have the clout. They \nare the ones who hire the lobbyists. They are the ones who know how, \nwho march on Washington every day. The rest are left out.\n  By the way, all too often, people unfortunately have that perception \nof both parties. What we have seen over the last week or 2 weeks only \nreinforces the skepticism and cynicism people have about who gets \nrepresented in the Senate and who doesn't.\n  I say to my colleague from Illinois, there is another issue. The \nissue is, above and beyond not meeting any standard of fairness, and \nabove and beyond huge benefits but in inverse relationship to need, \nthere is another issue. I believe part of what the majority party is \ndoing--and, by the way, every Republican has a first amendment right to \nbelieve this is the right thing to do for the country--is essentially \neroding the revenue base, giving away $1 trillion in money so when it \ncomes to health security for families, when it comes to long-term \ncare for our parents or our grandparents or when it comes to how you \ncan help a child so he or she by kindergarten can come ready to learn \nand does not fall behind and can do well in school, they don't believe \nthere is anything the Government should be doing. I don't agree. I \ndon't think most of the people in the country agree. I think in that \nsense that is clearly where the differences between the two parties \nmake a difference.\n\n  I am a critic of the timidity of our own party quite often. The \ndifferences right now between Democrats and Republicans make a real \ndifference in the lives of people in this country.\n  I conclude by mentioning another issue. I want to make sure I don't \ndo this in a cheap shot, bashing way. I don't want to. There is a \nbitter irony because we will have an appropriations bill on the floor--\nmaybe--this week where we will be raising our salaries and, by the way, \nwhat is tricky for me is our salaries are above the Federal employees, \nincluding support staff who work hard. I am not interested in bashing \naway at people. But we are not interested in raising the minimum wage. \nWe don't want to raise the minimum wage for people. If there is one \nproposition that people in the country agree on, people ought to be \nable to make enough of a wage so they can support their families and \ngive their children the care they know their children need and deserve.\n  We are now at the point where we want to have a minimum wage bill on \nthe floor; we want to raise the minimum wage. I say to Senator Durbin, \n75 to 80 percent of the people in the country believe that is the right \nthing to do.\n  Disproportionately, it is women in the workforce out there every day, \npeople who are working 40 hours a week, almost 52 weeks a year, still \npoor in America, and still can't support their families. We are going \nto have an appropriations bill out here where we are going to be \nraising our wages--and we don't do badly--but this Senate, this \nRepublican majority, is not willing to even entertain a debate and let \nus vote on whether or not we think we should raise the minimum wage.\n\n  These are big issues because they crucially affect the quality or \nlack of quality of the lives of the people we represent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This chart shows what is happening to families of three \ntrying to survive on a minimum wage. There are lots of people trying to \nlive while earning a minimum wage. It usually means multiple jobs. \nThere are 350,000 in Illinois alone who get up and go to work for a \nminimum wage. They usually have a second job. One of my friends who \nworks in the Watertower Place across the street from the hotel I stay \nin Chicago--she is a great friend of mine--is trying to take care of an \naging mother. She has two jobs. She works in a parking garage as an \nattendant and then when she gets off that job she is a hostess in a \nrestaurant. This lady works harder than most of us who think we are \nhard workers, and she is working for a little bit above the minimum \nwage.\n  What we see on this chart, I say to Senator Wellstone, is when we \njudge what the poverty line is in America, look what happened in about \nthe year 1989. All of a sudden the minimum wage fell below the poverty \nline. Those of us who wanted to make sure people who get up and work \nhard every day get a decent paycheck and a chance to have a livable \nwage have asked to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour \nover a 2-year period of time. I guarantee you will not live a life of \nluxury at $6.15 an hour, but you may be able to take care of some basic \nneeds such as school uniforms for the kids, and shoes, maybe a decent \nplace to live, a safer and cleaner place to live. Yet we cannot seem to \nget that issue before the Congress.\n  Republican leadership--in what has been a departure from the past \nwhere they said this is a bipartisan issue--has now said this is a \npartisan issue. Republicans oppose a minimum wage increase. The \nDemocrats support it and the Republicans have stopped us.\n  I will give an example. If I'm not mistaken, Governor Bush from \nTexas, his position is States ought to be able to opt out of the \nminimum wage increase. That is what he would do. So you would have \ncertain pockets in the United States which would not have a minimum \nwage increase. That is cold comfort for people who get up and go to \nwork and try to keep things together for their family. But the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is correct. The minimum wage has been plummeting in its \nbuying power. Congress has the authority to take care of that issue. \nCongress has refused.\n  Instead of dealing with a minimum wage and giving people basically $1 \nan hour increase, which comes out to about $2,000 a year if my math is \ncorrect, here we decide to give $2,000 a month in tax breaks to people \nmaking over $300,000 a year. We cannot give $2,000 a year to people who \nwork hard every single day, but we can give folks making over $300,000 \na year under the Republican tax break plan, a $23,000-a-year tax cut--\nalmost $2,000 a month. Those are the priorities. Those are the \ndifferences.\n  I think we try our best to feel the pain of working families. The \nRepublicans feel the pain of the wealthy, the pain they must go through \nevery day trying to decide what to do with another $2,000 when they \nhave a paycheck coming in of $25,000 a month. What anguish, what pain, \nwhat frustration it must be to try to figure out another mutual fund or \nanother vacation place.\n\n  How about the families worried about having a few bucks in the bank \nand paying for their kids' education?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague--and I am breaking my promise on \nlast words, but on the whole issue of Governor Bush, talking about \ncompassionate conservatism, I have no doubt he says it with sincerity. \nI am fond of this old Yiddish proverb--I think it is a Yiddish \nproverb--about how you cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. \nFrankly, you can talk about compassion. But the other problem is you \ncannot make a difference unless you are willing to, in fact, reach into \nyour pocket and invest some resources.\n  My colleague mentioned minimum wage. It occurred to me that one of \nthe truly awful things is there are two groups of citizens we say we \ncare the most about--let's talk about compassion--the very young \nchildren and the elderly, the people who built the country with the \nstrength of their backs, who now, toward the end of their lives, may be \nstruggling because of illness. Think about it for a moment, I say to my \ncolleague from Illinois. Let's talk wages and then let's talk \ninvestment. The men and women who take care of small children, who work \nin child care, or take care of elderly people--either home-based care \nor nursing homes--are the most miserably paid workers in our\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\ncountry. We devalue the work of adults who take care of small children. \nWe devalue the work of adults who take care of the elderly and those \npeople struggling toward the end of their lives. They have the lowest \nwages and the worst--among the worst--benefits.\n  Raising the minimum wage would help. It would make a difference. So \nwould affordable health care coverage. We could make a difference, I \nsay to my colleague from Illinois, and we should. But we do not.\n  Is there any wonder at the turnover in both of these fields? I know \nin child care there is a 40-percent turnover every year, because if you \ngraduate from school, college, you probably are going to have a debt. \nIf you want to work in the child care field, you are looking at a $9-\nan-hour job maybe with no health care benefits, or a $7-an-hour job. \nThe same goes for home-based care or for nursing homes.\n  My final point. The problem with this chart is that you are talking \nabout the top 1 percent getting the lion's share of all of these tax \nbenefits. You are also talking about eroding the revenue base over the \nnext decade to the point where, in certain decisive areas of life, we \nwill not be able to make the investment. I want to shout this from the \nmountaintop on the floor of the Senate and finish with these words.\n  When it comes to child care, if you want to talk compassion and you \ntalk so much about small children and you care so much that there is \nnurturing care and they are challenged and come to school ready to \nlearn, this is not going to be done on the cheap. This is going to \nrequire real investment if we are serious.\n  When it comes to the elderly--I went through this with my parents. \nNow I will be critical of us for a moment. I am all for tax credits. It \nis fine. But both my mom and dad had Parkinson's. We moved them to \nNorthfield. We actually lived here and we moved them to Northfield, MN, \nto try to keep them at home. We did. We kept them at home for a long \ntime. It got to the point where we would spend the night with them, our \nchildren would, and then we were just exhausted.\n\n  I sent a note out. It was the best day I ever had teaching at \nCarelton. I was desperate. I sent a note out to students and I said: \nHere is the situation with my parents. My dad in particular, he was \nfrom Ukraine, then Russia, and speaks 10 languages fluently and I think \nyou would enjoy him. But we need some help. Would anybody be interested \nin spending the night?\n  The next day I got 170 letters back from students saying they would \nbe more than willing to help. It was wonderful. Then at the very end he \nfell and broke his hip and we no longer could keep them at home.\n  But my point is, home-based care, enabling people to stay at home as \nlong as possible, live with dignity, it is not done on a tax credit of \n$3,000. It is a lot more expensive than that. But if we are serious \nabout this, we are going to have to make some investment. I can think \nof a better use of $1 trillion over the next decade for our country, \nthe United States of America, than tax cuts that disproportionately go \nto the top 1 percent of the wealthy. I think we can do better for \npeople like my mom and dad, who are no longer alive today. And I know \nwe can do better for these small children.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he may recall we asked the Members \nof the Senate to take their choice, make a pick, make a decision. That \nis what we are sent here to do, cast a vote. Senator Dodd stood up on \nday care and said: Shouldn't we help working families who are \nstruggling to find a safe, quality place to leave their kids when they \nare off to work so they can have peace of mind and the children can \ngrow in a positive learning environment, a safe environment?\n  He said: Instead of giving a tax break of $23,000 a year to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans, why don't we talk about targeting \ntax cuts so families can have more of a tax credit to pay for day care? \nHe took another step the Senator from Minnesota, I am sure, remembers. \nSenator Dodd said: What about those families where the mother, for \nexample, decides to stay home and raise the kids? Shouldn't we be \nencouraging that family? They are making an economic sacrifice for the \ngood of their children. Shouldn't they have a tax break?\n  I agree with him. My wife stayed at home. I am glad she did. I guess \nwe did not buy all the things we could have in life, but we sure ended \nup with three good kids, thanks to her hard work. She stayed home and \nhelped raise those kids.\n  A lot of families make that decision, that economic sacrifice. \nShouldn't our Tax Code help those mothers? Frankly, we are going to \nhelp you whatever your choice. Whether you go to work and need help \nwith day care or stay home with your children, we are going to give you \ntax relief targeted to those families. The Republicans said: No, no, \nthat is not a priority. Here is the priority. The priority is giving to \npeople who make an average income of $900,000 a year about $2,000 more \na month to figure out what they are going to do with it.\n  That is the difference. That is what the debate came down to.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, as he talks about long-term care, touches \nmy heart, too. My mother passed away a few years ago. Thank goodness, \nshe was able to stay independent for a long period of time, usually \nwatching her son on C-SPAN and calling him in the evening to correct \nhim on some of the things he said. I understand what families go \nthrough when they start making these decisions--and they are \nheartbreaking decisions--about their parents and grandparents. We \nbelieve tax breaks should be available to those families who want to \ntake care of their parents and grandparents, who are willing to \nsacrifice. But not on the Republican side. They are more concerned \nabout this estate tax which, as my colleague from Minnesota says, \ndisproportionately helps the very wealthiest people in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I remember the \namendment well because I offered it with Senator Dodd. But there was \none other important feature to it. It was a refundable tax credit. It \nwas going to provide some help for those families who did not come \nunder $30,000, which is critically important.\n  I say the same thing about higher education. If we want to do tax \ncredits, make sure they are refundable. Again, think of our community \ncollege students. I have reached the conclusion that the nontraditional \nstudents have become the traditional students. I have reached the \nconclusion that the majority of students today in higher education are \nno longer 18 and 19 living in a dorm. The majority are 30, 35, 40, 45, \n50, going back to school, many of them women, many of them with \nchildren. And, again, I can think of a better use of this money than a \ntax break for the top 1 percent of the population.\n  I far prefer to be out here on the floor passing legislation which \nwill assure affordable higher education, affordable child care, and \nmake a real investment in health care than some of these other areas.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield before he yields the floor, \nmost of us in the Chamber are well aware of Senator Wellstone's \nbackground. Having been involved in teaching in Minnesota and higher \neducation in his professional career before his election, he \nunderstands, if not better than most of us, what higher education is \nabout, what it offers, and also what it costs.\n  The Senator from Minnesota raises another point. We offered an \nalternative to this estate tax break which comes down to $23,000 a year \nfor the wealthiest Americans. We said we are going to help for the very \nfirst time in America working middle-income families. We are going to \nallow them to deduct the cost of college education expenses from their \nincome taxes. It is not a major deduction, but it helps. It said, for \nexample, up to $12,000 a year could be deducted, and it would be \ntreated in the 28-percent rate, which means a little over $3,000 a \nyear.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The time for the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is anyone seeking recognition on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Wyoming. I \nthank him for all his efforts in organizing information to be shared \nwith fellow Senators and with the American public.\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7508-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7508-S7509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         BUSINESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am compelled every once in a while to come \nto the floor to let people know what is happening. I know there are \npeople watching the work of the Senate, and I know those people do not \nhave, for the most part, a program or a scorecard. It is pretty hard to \nfollow the rules of what is going on around here without that.\n  I make an attempt partly to explain to myself what is going on and \ntake the opportunity to share it with other people who might be \ninterested and might be listening.\n  Right now, we are in the closing days of a race for the U.S. \nPresident. It does not really have a lot to do with this body; it has a \nlot to do with our interaction with the administrative branch. \nSometimes it is easier for rhetoric to invade the Chambers and to \nappear to be the most important thing we are doing.\n  What we ought to be doing is the appropriations bills for this \nNation. We handle in excess of $1.8 trillion. That is how much we spend \non behalf of the American public. We ought to be debating that. We are \nnot. We cannot get unanimous consent to proceed to a debate on an \nappropriations bill. We cannot move forward to talk about the $1.8 \ntrillion of appropriations for this country.\n  Instead, we have debate on things that we have debated, things that \nhave been decided, for the most part, and, on some occasions, with some \nfinality. Instead, we have people in this Chamber who would rather \nrehash votes we have already taken and retake them again. I guess the \nplot is to put fellow Members in a bad light in their constituency: \nThey have already voted on these issues once, let's get them to vote \nagain, and that will be progress for this country. You have to be \nkidding me.\n\n  The appropriations for this country are the important things that \nneed to come before this body. They are the things about which we ought \nto be talking right now, and we ought to be talking about them in some \ndetail. Pretty quickly we are going to run out of time. October 1 is \nthe start of the new fiscal year for this country, and that is when we \nneed to have the appropriations finished. That is when they start \nspending next year's money. That is when we hope and pray they will be \nspending it with the conciseness all of us envision.\n  When we are relegated to not being able to proceed on an \nappropriations bill because we cannot reach unanimous consent, we \ncannot debate in detail. Later, we are going to have to make massive \ndecisions on this money, and in fact it is my belief the minority would \nprefer to have the President negotiating these things instead of the \nway our forefathers envisioned it: that Congress would come up with the \nmechanism and the plan and the votes to pass appropriations bills that \nthe executive branch would administer.\n  That is not how it is working. The longer we push this process, the \nmore it will be a nonvoted mediated expenditure without looking at the \ndetails. The amendments are the way the details get into this \nappropriations process, and it is not going to happen because we are \nshoving everything back through this process. We are keeping the \nappropriations of this Nation from being debated. We are not being \nallowed to proceed to the debate on important appropriations bills. \nInstead, we are hearing the rhetoric about how we should have minimum \nwage, Patients' Bill of Rights, education, and the other important \nthings on which we have already worked, on which we have already voted \nthat are in conference committee. Those conference committees should be \nfinishing.\n  I will tell you what happened on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am \non the conference committee for the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is one \nof the toughest jobs I have had in my life. A number of us on the \ncommittee have spent from about 1 to 6 hours a day working on it, and \nit is largely nonscheduled time. When somebody discovers a place where \nthere might be a negotiation breakthrough, we get together and talk \nabout it. We work out words. We meet with the House folks, and we try \nto come to a conclusion.\n\n  We did that for months and months. Yet we hear on the floor of the \ndelay in getting the Patients' Bill of Rights done. We were making \nmajor breakthroughs on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Democrats in \nthis Chamber bailed out of the process and said: Let's go back to the \noriginal House version. Sure, we have spent 3 or 4 months making \nimportant changes in this. I don't think they ever said that on the \nfloor. But we had made 3 or 4 months of important changes in major \nareas. We had virtually wrapped up those areas as being much better \nthan either the House or the Senate bill. That is what a conference \ncommittee is about. That is what a conference committee is supposed to \ndo. We were in the process of doing that.\n  The only thing I can conclude from the Democrats going back to the \noriginal version of the Patients' Bill of Rights on the House side was \nthat they could see we were making progress that the country would \nlike, and they wanted to keep an issue instead. That is not how \nGovernment is supposed to be done. That is not the way we are supposed \nto do it.\n  We have debated these issues. We are working on these issues. But \nthere is a desire to keep things as an issue instead of a solution, and \nI can't tell the Senate how much that dismays me.\n  There are a few other bills that could come up in this process, too. \nWe are working on the elementary and secondary education authorization. \nIt is done once every 5 years. The bill has come out of committee. It \nhas been to the floor. We have debated it a few times. The amendments \nthat are brought for that bill are not education amendments. It is all \nof these other ones that the Democrats would like to vote on and vote \non and vote on again because that keeps them as an issue. What we need \nto do is get some finality to the education issue. We need to have some \nagreement between both sides that we will talk about education, that we \nwill make education decisions, that we will make education in this \ncountry better for every student in elementary and secondary schools. \nWe have to do that. That is our obligation. That is our assignment. \nThat is what America is counting on.\n  We can't get that job done if we keep going back and making political \nstatements about issues on which we have already voted. If there is a \nvote and you want to use it against somebody, you can put the spin on \nit and use it against them. You don't have to have five votes on the \nsame issue to spin it that way. That isn't how elections ought to be \nworking in this country, but it does say something about how elections \ndo work in this country.\n  The voters are more discriminating than that. They are able to tell \nthe rhetoric from their desires. As I travel Wyoming--and I am back \nthere almost every weekend--our whole delegation usually goes out on \nFriday because we don't have votes here, and we travel the State. In \nWyoming that means by car. I have traveled 300, 500 miles on a weekend. \nThe average town in Wyoming is about 250 people. The exciting thing \nabout visiting those towns is you get to talk to about 80 percent of \nthe people. You get a pretty good feel for what your constituents think \nwe ought to be doing. They do think we ought to be doing the \nappropriations process in detail and getting it wrapped up.\n\n  They also think that some of the votes we have taken lately are very \nimportant from a fairness standpoint. One of those issues is the death \ntax. Practically everybody in Wyoming understands that death is a \nterrible thing and when you accompany death with a tax bill, it is even \nworse. That doesn't affect everybody in Wyoming. Those people \nunderstand that the death tax does not affect everybody in Wyoming. But \nthey see a basic fairness issue where it does affect other people, and \nit affects the businesses for which they work. If the small business \nthey work for has to sell off part of it for death taxes and can no \nlonger function and goes out of business, it is their job. They \nunderstand that. It is the same with the farms and ranches in Wyoming \nand the rest of the country. If you have to sell off a significant part \nof your ranch or farm to pay the death tax, you may not have an \neconomic remainder left. When that happens, you don't have the same \nculture in this country, and you do not have the same jobs. People lose \ntheir jobs. So they see the basic fairness issue of making sure that \ndeath is not a taxable event.\n  The bill that is out there for the President to make his decision on\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\ndoesn't say they avoid taxes forever. There is a capital gains tax in \nit. When there is a sale of the business or a sale of the land, when \nthere is a taxable event, it gets taxed. That is how it ought to be. It \nshould not be triggered by death and be a second tax on the same \nproperty.\n  I had a letter from a constituent who said, if we do the death taxes, \nisn't that going to increase the gap between the wealthy and the poor? \nThat is a good question. The answer is, no. What we are working on is \nmiddle America, the workers, particularly the workers who have been \nbuilding IRAs and 401(k)s and who have been participating in the growth \nof the stock market, taking their wage and investing a little bit of \nit. There are a lot of blue-collar workers across this country who are \nnow millionaires. They took some of their wages and saved it. They \naren't in some of the old exclusions we had on death taxes. They are \nsaying: Wait a minute. I worked my lifetime to save this money. I took \nsome risks to make this money. I didn't do it so I could have a great \nretirement with a lot of vacation places. I did it so my kids would \nhave a better chance, so that my kids would have some advantages, so \nthat my kids would start at a little different level in their job than \nI started in mine.\n  I want to make sure death taxes don't take it away. If we let middle \nAmerica, which by the Democratic definition is anybody who pays taxes--\nno, that would be the rich. At any rate, if we let middle America keep \ntheir money instead of paying it in death taxes and move up into a \nlittle higher level, that is the way America has operated. That is why \nvirtually all the people in Wyoming tell me: Eliminate the death taxes.\n  We did that. It is going to be heading down to the President to see \nif he agrees on it.\n  I hear a lot of the marriage penalty in Wyoming. Again, it is a \nfairness issue. They want the marriage penalty eliminated. The bill we \nsent down there was not the Senate bill. The Senate bill would have had \na lot more marriage penalty elimination. We went with the House version \nfor the most part. We increased it in the lower levels so the marriage \npenalty among those paying taxes but making the lower amounts would \nbenefit from it and benefit the most. That is the way the bill is right \nnow that is being sent to the President.\n  Again, we had a debate; we took the vote. That issue was resolved.\n  We hear a lot on taxes about the rich versus the poor and what we \nneed to do with all the surplus. It is not surplus. It is excess taxes. \nIt is tax money that got paid that is in excess of what we had \nanticipated and what we had planned to spend. There are a lot of \nexciting things we can do with excess. Everybody wishes they had some. \nThe greatest thing would be to win a lottery. That is kind of an excess \nsort of thing, unanticipated money that you got, with just a couple of \nbucks for expenditure. If we just give these out on all the new ideas \nfor spending programs, that is what we will be doing--holding a \nnational lottery.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I think your side had time and I patiently listened while I \nwas in the chair. Your questions turn into statements. I would like to \nfinish making my statement, if I might.\n  What we are turning into is a country that recognizes that the \nFederal Government can give us everything and we forget about where the \neverything came from.\n  It is pretty exciting to get a windfall. I figured out--and this is \nmostly from talking to my Wyoming constituents--that when a new program \naround here is proposed, there are people across this country who \nbenefit from it. Maybe they get $1,000. In fact, that turns out to be \nabout the average a person in one of these programs gets--$1,000. Of \ncourse, it employs some different people because they administer the \nprogram, and they get more than $1,000 a year benefit out of it. They \nbecome the main lobbyists for the new program, and they get very \nexcited about getting this new program in place and spending the money. \nYou know, if a person gets $1,000 or more, it is worth a letter or \ntwo--more than that, maybe it is worth a trip to Washington.\n  So we hear a lot about the importance of the new programs and \neverything. What we don't hear about is the taxpayers saying: Whoa, \nthat isn't a program I like or a program I want to fund; that isn't \nwhere I want to put my money.\n  Do you know why we don't hear as much from those people? First of \nall, they are busy earning the tax money that we spend; secondly, it is \nonly costing them about a quarter for a new program. How many letters \ncan you write for 25 cents? You can't. So what we wind up with is a \nhuge lobby for new programs.\n  The President, when he did his State of the Union speech, laid out \nseveral billion dollars a minute in new programs--new programs--that he \nwould like to see done. In fact, there were about $750 billion worth of \nexpenditures listed there. Now, we have programs in this country that \nwe are not funding adequately at the present time, programs that we \nhave said are important, such as IDEA, that we bring up every once in a \nwhile to get additional funding. We don't do it, but we keep looking at \nnew programs.\n  There are some things that need to be done in this country, and the \nbest way is to get on with the appropriations process, to work through \nit in the kind of detail it deserves, and to quit throwing in \nperipheral things just because they can be brought up, which come with \npoints of order and additional votes, each taking about an hour and \nusing up the time of the Senate. It is time we got on with the business \nof appropriations and visited with constituents about the details of \nhow they think this country ought to run.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what is the present order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business until 12:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7509-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7509-S7511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE LOOPHOLE IN COLLEGE GAMBLING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks on an \nissue very important to our young student athletes, as well as our \ncolleges and universities. It is a piece of legislation that, if the \nappropriations continue to be held up on the other side of the aisle, I \nthink we should consider. We should go to this piece of legislation.\n  The legislation is the Amateur Sports Integrity Act, which was passed \nout of the Commerce Committee by a 16-2 vote. There was strong \nbipartisan support for the legislation and introduction of the bill. \nSenator Leahy and I introduced the bill. Basically, the legislation \ncloses the one loophole on college gambling.\n  Presently, you cannot gamble legally in this country on college \nathletics. You can't bet on the Road to the Final Four, the NCAA \nbasketball tournament, football and bowl games--except in one State in \nthe country, and that is Nevada. That is what has led to a number of \nproblems we have had of expanded sports gambling on amateur athletics \nand expanded cases where student athletes have fallen to the whims of \npeople promising them some help if they will shave a point or two off \nthe game. So we are trying to close that one loophole in Nevada so it \nis clear that it is illegal to bet on college sports in the United \nStates.\n  This bipartisan legislation is in direct response to a recommendation \nmade by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which last year \nconcluded a 2-year study on the impact of legalized gambling on our \ncountry. The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling \non amateur sports and is supported by the NCAA, coaches, teachers, \nathletic directors, commissioners, university presidents, school \nprincipals, and family groups from across the country. Those groups are \nall strongly supportive of this legislation.\n  In my home State, Roy Williams, the basketball coach at the \nUniversity of Kansas, considered taking the job at North Carolina but \ndecided against it--happily, in my opinion. He is a strong proponent of \nthis legislation. These are the people supporting this who know about \nthe threat of gambling on amateur athletics. These are the people who \nare fighting the problem on the front lines 24 hours a day. These \ngroups support our legislation which will prohibit all legalized \ngambling on high\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\nschool and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter Olympic \nGames.\n  The Nation's college and university system is one of our greatest \nassets. We offer the world the model for postsecondary education. But \nsports gambling has become a black eye on too many colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Gambling on the outcome of sporting events tarnishes the integrity of \nsports and diminishes the esteem in which we and the rest of the world \nhold U.S. postsecondary institutions. This amendment would deal with \nthat problem. It would remove the ambiguity that surrounds gambling on \ncollege sports and make it clearly illegal in all 50 States in the \nUnited States.\n  We should not gamble with the integrity of our colleges or the future \nof our college athletes. Our young athletes deserve legal protection \nfrom the seedy influences of the gambling, and fans deserve to know \nthat athletic competitions are honest and fair.\n\n  Gambling scandals involving student athletes have become all too \ncommon over the past 10 years. In fact, there have been more gambling \nscandals in our colleges and universities in the 1990s than in every \nother decade before it combined. These scandals are a direct result of \nan increase in gambling on amateur sports.\n  It was just 2 years ago, during the Final Four, that we learned of \nthe point-shaving scandal at Northwestern University involving their \nmen's basketball team. This scandal involved both legal and illegal \ngambling on several Northwestern games. Kevin Pendergast, a former \nNotre Dame place kicker who orchestrated the basketball point-shaving \nscandal at Northwestern University, has stated--and I think this is \nclear, and it points to where we have a problem and why this is a \nproblem and something we should take care of. In other States, it is \nillegal. Here is what the guy who masterminded that point-shaving case \nat Northwestern said:\n\n       My relationship with sports gambling continued off and on \n     and ended with a $20,000 bet placed in a sports book in Las \n     Vegas. This was part of three basketball games that have been \n     mentioned by Senator Brownback in the Northwestern point-\n     shaving incident. The majority of the monies wagered in these \n     games were legally wagered in Nevada. And by legally wagered, \n     I mean you walk up to the sports book and place a bet on one \n     team or the other. Now it was obviously illegal because of \n     what was going on behind the scenes, but like I said, the \n     majority of the monies wagered in this situation were wagered \n     in a legal manner in sports casinos in Nevada.\n\n  That was the big case that broke 2 years ago. He went to a number of \ncollege athletes and said, ``We are not talking about losing the game. \nDon't lose the game. We just want you not to win it by as much as the \nmargin.''\n  That is what we are talking about--the point spread. We will be able \nto wager money on the game, and if you are ahead by five points and the \nmargin says six on it, just don't score. We are learning, as we have \ngone through hearings, that you don't do this on offense; you do it on \ndefense. If you want to shave points, it is not that you miss the free \nthrow or the shot; you actually let your player get by you on an \noffensive move. It is less obvious to the other people watching that \nthat is something that is going on. So actually people have thought \nthis through quite a bit on how you allow shaving to take place.\n  That is what Kevin Pendergast said on this one particular case that \nbroke 2 years ago.\n  In fact, the last two major point shaving scandals involved legalized \ngambling in Las Vegas sports books. The point-shaving scandal involving \nArizona State University is believed to involve more money than any \nother sports gambling case in the history of intercollegiate athletics \nand involved legalized gambling and organized crime.\n  A study recently conducted by the University of Michigan found that \n84 percent of college referees said they had participated in some form \nof gambling since beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40 \npercent also admitted placing bets on sporting events and 20 percent \nsaid they gambled on the NCAA basketball tournament. Two referees said \nthey were aware of the spread on a game and that it affected the way \nthey officiated the contest. Some reported being asked to fix games \nthey were officiating and others were aware of referees who ``did not \ncall a game fairly because of gambling reasons.'' Just a few months \nago, newspaper articles from Las Vegas and Chicago detailed how illegal \nand legal gambling are sometime interconnected.\n  I get irritated sometimes at the referees in games. But if I thought \nthere was anything going on where they were gambling on the games and \nthat it was affecting their calls, imagine how poisonous this would be \nto them and to the integrity of the sport that is taking place.\n  The National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report recognized the \npotential harm of legalized gambling by stating that sports gambling \n``can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can \ndevastate individuals and careers.'' Some of its findings include:\n  More than 5 million Americans suffer from pathological gambling;\n  Another 15 million are ``at risk'' for it; and\n  About 1.1 million adolescents, ages 12 to 17, or 5 percent of \nAmerica's 20 million teenagers engage in severe pathological gambling \neach year.\n  According to the American Psychiatric Association:\n  Pathological gambling is a chronic and progressive psychiatric \ndisorder characterized by emotional dependence, loss of control and \nleads to adverse consequences at school and at home;\n  Teens are more than twice as vulnerable to gambling addictions than \nadults because they are prone to high-risk behaviors during \nadolescence; and\n  Ninety percent of the nation's compulsive gamblers start at an \nadolescent age;\n  According to the Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling, gambling \non sporting events is a favorite preference of teenage gamblers.\n  We are talking about the gateway behavior, the pathological gambling, \nand 90 percent of it starts as teenagers. Where does it generally \nstart? One of the favorite gateways is sports gambling.\n  Opponents of our legislation have tried to discredit our efforts by \ninsisting that we should be focusing our efforts on curbing illegal \ngambling, not legal. I agree that we should be looking at ways to help \nlaw enforcement and institutions for higher education combat illegal \ngambling. The NCAA has undertaken numerous steps to combat gambling \namong student athletes and stated during the Commerce Committee hearing \nits intention to do even more.\n  I want to list some of the steps they proposed and are doing.\n  They are sponsoring educational programs for student athletes, \nincluding development of a sports wagering video; partnershiping with \nseveral professional organizations; assisting in bringing Federal and \nlocal enforcement officers to camps across the country; continuing to \nbroadcast antisports gambling through public service announcements \nduring NCAA championship games aired on CBS and CNN, most recently \naired 18 times during the 2000 basketball championship games, and will \ncontinue to run during championship games this year.\n  They developed a ``don't-bet-on-it booklet,'' created in partnership \nwith the National Endowment for Financial Education to educate students \nabout the dangers of sports gambling and to acquaint them with good \nfinancial management strategies.\n  They distributed these to at least 325,000 NCAA students.\n  The NCAA established policies that prohibit gambling on professional \nor college sports by college athletic personnel, student athletes, \nathletic conferences, and NCAA employees.\n  They prohibit student athletes from competing if they knowingly \nprovide information to individuals concerning games.\n  They prohibit student athletes from competing if they solicit a bet \non any intercollegiate game, or if they accept a bet on any \nintercollegiate team, or if they accept a bet on any team representing \nthe institution, or participate in any gambling activity that involves \nan intercollegiate athlete through a book maker, or any other method \nemployed by organized gambling.\n  They have instituted background checks on men and women basketball\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\nofficials to try to deal with the study that I just mentioned by the \nUniversity of Michigan about the number of referees who have been \ninvolved in gambling.\n  The NCAA has been working in partnership with the National \nAssociation of Student Personnel and Administrators on implementation \nof on-campus surveys aimed at obtaining data related to gambling \nbehavior of college students. The goal is to enlist 50 institutions to \nparticipate in the project. I hope the results will be available later \nthis year.\n  The NCAA is working with several of the largest athletic conferences \nto assist in the development of comprehensive research on student \nathletic gambling behavior. They have other programs they are working \nwith as well.\n  My point in mentioning all of that is there were charges made at the \nhearing in the Commerce Committee that the NCAA isn't doing enough. I \nagree. They are not. They are not stepping up and doing more. That \nshould not be an excuse for us not doing what is right here, which is \nto ban the gambling on student sports. We shouldn't be subjecting our \nstudent athletes to this type of pressure.\n  Opponents have claimed that this is a state issue, not a federal one. \nThis argument doesn't hold water. Congress already determined this is a \nfederal issue with the passage of Professional and Amateur Sports \nProtection Act (PASPA) in 1992. Ironically, while Nevada is the only \nstate where legal gambling on collegiate and Olympic sporting events \noccurs, Nevada's own gaming regulations prohibit gambling on any of \nNevada's teams because of the potential to jeopardize the integrity of \nthose sporting events.\n  If it is good for the goose, it is good for the gander. This should \nbe banned everywhere.\n  During a press conference on my legislation earlier this year I \nencouraged colleges and universities from across the country to ask the \nNevada Gaming Control Board to prohibit any wagers from being \n``accepted or paid by any book'' on their respective athletic teams in \nNevada. Unfortunately, the board refused the NCAA's request, stating \nthat ``the same level of protection is already extended within each of \nthese states.'' What they failed to mention was that no state, except \nfor Nevada, allows betting on college teams from other states. The \nfrequency of gambling scandals over the last decade is a clear \nindication of legal gambling of college sports stretching beyond the \nborders of Nevada, impacting the integrity of States' sporting events \nin other places.\n\n  I said to the Nevada Gaming Control Board: If you take UNLV off the \nbooks, allow a way for the University of Kansas and Kansas State \nUniversity to get off the books. Let our board of regents petition the \nNevada Gaming Board that if they don't want to be on the books, Kansas \nState University can be pulled off, the Governor can send a letter \nofficially requesting, or the legislature can even pass a resolution \nsaying the request be pulled off the books. Give us a way out to \nprotect the integrity of our universities.\n  They denied the request. They said they would not do it because if we \nwanted out, there will be a whole bunch more who want out. Should that \nnot tell us something right there, as well?\n  I am a strong advocate of States rights. However, States rights meet \na State's authority to determine how best to govern within that State's \nown borders; they do not have a right to impact the integrity of Kansas \nsporting events. They do not have the authority to set laws allowing a \nState to impose its policies on every other State while exempting \nitself. Gambling on college sports, both legal and illegal, threatens \nthe integrity of the game. That threat extends beyond any one State's \nborders.\n  I realize a ban on collegiate sports gambling will not eliminate all \ngambling on college sports. However, as Coach Calhoun stated in his \ntestimony during the hearing: It is a starting point.\n  It is an important starting point. This is exactly what this \nlegislation is about, a beginning. It will send a clear signal to our \ncommunities and, more importantly, a clear message to our kids: \nGambling on student athletics is wrong and threatens the integrity of \ncollege athletes.\n  I believe it is important that every Senator voting on this \nlegislation should ask him or herself this question: Is it unseemly and \nwrong to bet on kids? I think so. If enacted, there will be no \nambiguity about whether it is legal or illegal to bet on college \nsports. As part of a broader strategy to resensitize the public to the \nproblems associated with college sports gambling, this will make a \ndifference. We should not wait for another point-shaving scandal in \norder to act. There will be another point-shaving case that will come \ndown. Given the amount of money--over $1 billion bet each year on \ncollege sports--there will be another point-shaving case that will \noccur.\n  Mr. President, if the minority, if the Democrat side, chooses to \ncontinue to hold up legislation on appropriations bills, I think this \nwould be a good time to go take up this bill. I think it would be \nappropriate. I think it would be a good time to take it up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, today I want to talk about one of the \nmost serious issues facing the United States--the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. I also want \nto talk about the legislation that Senator Torricelli and I have \nintroduced--the China Nonproliferation Act--to address this growing \nthreat.\n  The world is a more dangerous place today because key supplier \ncountries like the People's Republic of China [PRC] continue to \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction to rogue states like North \nKorea, Iran, and Libya.\n  China has sold nuclear components and missiles to Pakistan, missile \nparts to Libya, cruise missiles to Iran, and shared a wide variety of \nsensitive technologies with North Korea.\n  Russia has provided nuclear weapons assistance to Iran, and missile \ntechnologies to North Korea.\n  North Korea has provided missile technologies to a variety of \ncountries in the Middle East and Africa, and openly acknowledges these \nsales are one of its main sources of hard currency.\n  Many of these technologies are being used by rogue states to develop \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them--capabilities \nwhich are prompting many policymakers and defense experts in this \ncountry to call for the immediate deployment of a multi-tiered national \nmissile defense system.\n  Two years ago,a bipartisan commission headed by former defense \nsecretary Don Rumsfeld challenged the administration by concluding that \nrogue states like North Korea and Iran could develop an ICBM within 5 \nyears of deciding to do so. In fact, the Commission reported that:\n\n       China also poses a threat to the U.S. as a significant \n     proliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of mass \n     destruction and enabling technologies. It has carried out \n     extensive transfers to Iran's solid-fueled ballistic missile \n     program. It has supplied Pakistan with a design for a nuclear \n     weapon and additional nuclear weapons assistance. . . . The \n     behavior thus far of Russia and China makes it appear \n     unlikely . . . that either government will soon effectively \n     reduce its country's sizable transfers of critical \n     technologies, experts, or expertise to the emerging missile \n     powers.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, North Korea surprised our intelligence agencies \nby successfully launching a three-stage rocket--the Taepo Dong I--over \nJapan, demonstrating the technological know-how to hit the United \nStates with a small warhead, and essentially confirming the Rumsfeld \nCommission's assertions.\n  In July 1999, the Deutch Commission, which was organized to assess \nthe federal government's ability to address WMD proliferation, \nconcluded that:\n\n       The U.S. Government is not effectively organized to combat \n     proliferation, despite the fact that ``Weapons of mass \n     destruction pose a grave threat to U.S. citizens and military \n     forces, to our allies, and to our vital interests in many \n     regions of the world.'' The report also confirmed that China \n     ``is both a source and transfer agent for passing knowledge, \n     technology, sub-systems, and entire\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\n     systems to dangerous state and sub-national actors.\n\n  Last September the intelligence community released a new National \nIntelligence Estimate of the ballistic missile threat. This report \nasserted that ``during the next 15 years the United States most likely \nwill face ICBM threats from Russia, China and North Korea, probably \nfrom Iran, and possibly from Iraq.'' North Korea could convert its \nTaepo Dong-1 space launch vehicle to deliver a light payload--\nsufficient for a biological or chemical--to the United States. And \nIran's missile program is not far behind. In short, some rogue states \nmay have ICBMs much sooner than previously thought, and those missiles \nwill be more sophisticated and dangerous than previously estimated.\n  An unclassified CIA report provided to Congress earlier this year \nsaid that from January to June of last year ``firms in China provided \nmissile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to several \ncountries of proliferation concern,'' including Iran, North Korea, and \nPakistan.\n\n  The report also said that China has provided extensive support to \nPakistan's nuclear and missile programs in the past, and that ``some \nballistic missile assistance continues.''\n  Additionally, ``North Korea obtained raw materials for its ballistic \nmissile programs from various foreign sources, especially from firms in \nChina.''; and\n  ``Russia and China continued to supply a considerable amount and a \nwide variety of ballistic missile-related goods and technology to \nIran.''\n  Iran has ``manufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons, including \nblister, blood, and choking agents and the bombs and artillery shells \nfor delivering them.'' The report adds that, during the first half of \n1999, Iran sought production technology, expertise, and chemicals that \ncould be used for chemical warfare ``from entities in Russia and \nChina.''\n  ``Throughout the first half of 1999, North Korea continued to export \nballistic missile-related equipment and missile components, materials \nand technical expertise to countries in the Middle East and Africa.'' \nIn February of this year, U.S. intelligence officials indirectly \nconfirmed press reports that North Korea has delivered to Iran 12 \nengines that would be critical to Iran's efforts to build extended-\nrange Shahab missiles.\n  The next report is due out any day now, and it isn't much different, \nI am told.\n  In a hearing before the Governmental Affairs subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services last month, \nRobert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear \nPrograms, testified that the threats to our Nation's security are real \nand increasing. He added that the major factors fueling this threat are \ncontinued proliferation and ``increased trade and cooperation among \ncountries that have been recipients of missile technologies.'' Many of \nthe rogue states and other countries seeking these weapons of prestige, \ncoercive diplomacy, and deterrence are working hard to develop an \nindigenous capability--which requires the acquisition of ``dual use'' \nitems from the industrialized countries of the West.\n  The public press accounts are equally troubling:\n  New reports since 1997 have detailed how Russian entities have \nprovided Iran's missile programs with speciality steels and alloys, \ntungsten coated graphite, wind tunnel testing facilities, gyroscopes \nand other guidance technology, rocket engine and fuel technology, laser \nequipment, machine tools, and maintenance manuals.\n  North Korea has provided missile technologies and assistance to Iran \nand Libya, and is supposedly building a missile factory in Sudan for \nIraq.\n  All of these events lead to one bottom line: That dangers to the \nUnited States exist and are increasing; that the unfettered sale of \n``dual-use'' and military-related technologies are abetting those \nthreats; and that the problem is being fueled by a few key suppliers \nlike China.\n  Let me give a brief summary of the revised China Nonproliferation \nAct. The U.S. walks a delicate tightrope as it balances national \nsecurity and trade with China. Free trade and open markets are \nessential, but the federal government's first responsibility is the \nprotection of our national security. That's why Senator Torricelli and \nI have introduced the China Nonproliferation Act, which requires an \nannual review of proliferation, establishes clear standards, reasonable \npenalties, adequate presidential waivers, congressional oversight, and \nmuch-needed transparency.\n  The goal of this bill is to address the proliferation of key \nsuppliers like China, while minimizing any negative impact on United \nStates businesses or workers. We received a number of comments on the \noriginal draft of this bill, and we have made substantial changes in \norder to address concerns raised by the administration and others. I'd \nlike to take a moment now to set the record straight on what our bill \ndoes and does not do.\n\n  The administration raised four concerns regarding the original draft \nof our bill, all of which have been addressed in the revisions.\n  First, in response to the concern that the bill singled out China, we \nhave broadened the bill to apply to all key suppliers of weapons of \nmass destruction as identified by the Director of Central Intelligence. \nRather than singling out certain suppliers, this bill applies equally \nto all countries based on their proliferation activities. Those \ndetermined to be key suppliers by the DCI will be subject to the act. \nThis mechanism allows countries to be added or dropped from the list \nbased on their behavior.\n  Second, in response to the concern that the original bill failed to \nprovide adequate flexibility for the President, we have made the \nsanctions against supplier countries under the act discretionary, as \nopposed to the mandatory sanctions contained in the original bill.\n  Third, in response to a concern that individual companies could face \nmandatory sanctions based on insufficient evidence, we have raised the \nevidentiary standard for imposing mandatory sanctions on companies \nidentified as proliferators to give the President complete discretion \nin making a determination as to whether a company has engaged in \nproliferation activities.\n  Finally, in response to a concern that the original bill captured \nlegal transactions and legitimate efforts by countries to pursue their \nown defense needs, we have changed the language to make clear that only \nactions that contribute to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nwill trigger penalties under the act.\n  Furthermore, the revised bill addresses additional concerns raised by \nthe U.S. business community that U.S. firms and workers could be \nadversely impacted.\n  The bill now contains a blanket provision that protects the \nagricultural community from any adverse impact.\n  In addition, the bill's penalties apply only to companies of key \nsupplier countries, not to U.S. companies and workers.\n  We have also made changes to the congressional review procedure to \nensure that Congress exercises adequate oversight without overburdening \nthe Congress. We have raised the bar with regard to the initiation of \nexpedited congressional review procedures. We did this by requiring at \nleast one-fifth of the Member of either House to sign onto a joint \nresolution. We have also exempted the President's exercise of national \nsecurity waiver authority from this congressional review process.\n  In short, the key features of our bill are now consistent with \ncurrent law and similar to the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, which \npassed the Senate 98-0 in February. These two laws are structured in \nmuch the same way, with the difference being that our bill addresses \nthe supplier of the weapons, and the Iran Act addressed a user. Under \nboth bills, the President is required to supply a report, based on \n``credible information,'' on foreign entities transferring WMD and \nmissile items. The activities covered in these reports are the same, \nexcept that the Iran Act covers transfers of these items into Iran and \nthis bill covers transfers of these items out of key supplier \ncountries--the international equivalent of going after the drug dealers \nto get to the root of a pervasive drug problem. Under both the Iran Act \nand our legislation, the President is authorized, but not required, to \nimpose sanctions against countries violating the act. The principal \ndifference between our bill and the Iran Act is that our bill requires \nsanctions against the individual,\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\ncompany, or government entity, identified as a proliferator, whereas \nthe Iran Act made these sanctions discretionary; however, our bill \nrequires a Presidential determination that the proliferation activities \nhave occurred prior to triggering these sanctions, leaving the \nPresident with substantial discretion.\n\n  In response to the critics, we are confident that these changes will \nstill fulfill our goal of halting proliferation from key suppliers like \nChina and sending the right message abroad, while removing any \nunintended consequences. But despite our efforts, opponents of the bill \ncontinue to contend that current nonproliferation laws are sufficient \nand effective, that Chinese proliferation is under control, and that \nsanctions never work. They add that diplomacy and ``engagement'' will \nbring the world's key suppliers around. I ask these critics, where is \nyour evidence?\n  All we need to do is look at the evidence to realize that existing \nlegislation has clearly not been effective, because we continue to \nreceive alarming reports of China's proliferation activities. In a \nreport issued in July of 1998, the Rumsfeld Commission called China a \n``significant proliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of mass \ndestruction and enabling technologies.'' Recent reports indicate that \nChinese proliferation behavior has worsened over the past year, and \nNorth Korean activities remain intolerable, demonstrating the \ninadequacy of our nonproliferation laws.\n  In the last several weeks, on the eve of the Senate's consideration \nof PNTR for China, and after the House had already voted, it was \nrevealed that China was assisting Libyan experts with that country's \nmissile program, illegally diverting United States supercomputers for \nuse in the PRC's nuclear weapons program, and helping build a second M-\n11 missile plant in Pakistan. And just last week, Iran successfully \ntest-fired its Shahab-3 missile, which is capable of striking Israel, \nAmerican troops in Saudi Arabia, or American bases located within the \nborders of our NATO ally, Turkey. This missile was developed and built \nwith significant assistance by the PRC.\n  The classified reports of Chinese proliferation are even more \ndisturbing.\n  And all we need to do is look at the events of recent weeks to see \nthat diplomacy alone will not resolve the serious threat to our \nnational security posed by proliferation. In the last few weeks, three \nsenior United States delegations traveled to Beijing to discuss these \nissues. Each was sent back to Washington empty-handed, under the \nexplicit threat that if the United States continues to assist Taiwan \nwith its defensive needs or proceed with our own National Missile \nDefense, the PRC will continue to proliferate offensive weapons and \ntechnologies to whomever it pleases.\n  Opponents also argue that we don't need more laws--current laws are \nsufficient and effective. If this is the case, then why is China's \nproliferation problem not improving? Moreover, why was it okay to pass \nthe Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, by a vote of 98-0, less than 6 \nmonths ago, and it's not okay to do so now? That legislation was \ndesigned to address a serious problem: The development of a credible \nnuclear weapons and missile program thanks to the direct assistance of \nthe Russians, Chinese, and North Koreans. Weren't there enough laws on \nthe books then also? Or does the potential to make a buck off the \nChinese make it all different?\n  Our bill recognizes the value of a multilateral approach to the \nproblem and encourages the President to pursue a multilateral solution. \nBut at the same time, we must act. Over the years, when the United \nStates has been serious about implementing measures to signal our \ndispleasure with a foreign government's action, these measures have had \nan effect. For example, United States economic pressure in the late \n1980s and early 1990s led to China's accession to the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty in 1992. In June 1991, the Bush administration \napplied sanctions against the PRC for missile technology transfers to \nPakistan. These measures led to China's commitment five months later to \nabide by the Missile Technology Control Regime [MTCR]. In August 1993, \nthe Clinton administration imposed sanctions on the PRC for the sale of \nM-11 missile equipment to Pakistan in violation of the MTCR. Over a \nyear later, Beijing backed down by agreeing not to export ``ground to \nground'' missiles if sanctions were lifted, which occurred in November \n1994.\n  Critics of our legislation also say that the problem is not with the \nlaws, it is with the President's willingness--or unwillingness--to \nenforce them. On this point I would certainly agree. In the case of \nChinese proliferation, the Clinton administration has too often put \n``good relations'' and commerce before national security. Time and time \nagain this administration has jumped through hoops to whitewash or make \nthe problems with China go away. The President himself acknowledged \nthat he has avoided complying with current laws. In April 1998, while \nspeaking to a group of visitors, he complained about legislation that \nforces his administration to penalize other nations for behavior that \nfalls short of our expectations. He went on to say that this creates \npressure for the administration to ``fudge the facts.'' I have no \ntrouble believing this is true. A prime example is when the \nintelligence community discovered a shipment of Chinese M-11 missile \ncanisters on a dock in Pakistan. The President failed to take action. \nHis justification? He couldn't prove that there are missiles actually \nin the canisters. This of course only emboldened the PRC, as evidenced \nby their recent substantial assistance to the Pakistani missile \nprogram.\n\n  The Clinton administration has never made nonproliferation a policy \npriority. We've never acted aggressively in the face of these \nviolations, and have never treated nonproliferation as a serious agenda \nitem in our official dealings with the PRC.\n  It is not surprising, then, that the White House does not want to see \nany legislation considered by the Congress which might reflect \nnegatively on its stewardship of the proliferation problem. But that is \nprecisely why this legislation is needed. This legislation attempts to \nenhance congressional oversight by requiring reports from the President \non proliferation activities and his response to those activities, and \nby creating expedited procedures for the Congress to consider a joint \nresolution of disapproval of the President's actions where that is \nwarranted.\n  Opponents argue that the congressional review procedures in our bill \nare also unwarranted and infringe on the rights of the President. \nHowever, Congress has a responsibility here. We do not have the luxury \nof sitting back and avoiding a matter that involves our national \nsecurity when we see that things are going in the wrong direction. Our \ngoal is not to tie up the Senate with annual votes on China's \nproliferation activities, but it is to provide a procedure for Congress \nto exercise its oversight role when the President has truly failed to \nrespond to these threats. In response to concerns raised by other \nMembers that the original review procedure would allow individual \nSenators to disrupt the business of the Senate, we have raised the \nstandard to initiate the expedited procedures to one-fifth of the \nMembers of either House, more than that required to initiate a cloture \npetition in the Senate. And regardless of how the Senate votes, the \nPresident can still veto the measure. All this provision does is ensure \nthat Congress' legitimate role in foreign policy is preserved, that we \nare made aware of the proliferation activities of key suppliers \ncountries and what actions the President is taking to deal with this \nthreat, and Members have the means to fulfill our constitutional duties \nto ensure that America's security is safeguarded.\n  Other critics of my bill have argued that we need to hold hearings \nand subject the bill to committee review. Over the past four years, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee alone has held 15 hearings on \nproliferation. Over 30 hearings have been held by my committee, the \nArmed Services Committee, and the Foreign Relations Committee. \nFurthermore, this legislation has the full support of the chairman of \nthe committee of jurisdiction, the Foreign Relations Committee. The \nissue of proliferation has received a full hearing and it is time to \nact. In the past, the Senate has not hesitated to act in an expedited \nfashion where a serious threat to U.S. interests was involved.\n  I find it ironic that some of those members who so eagerly call for \nhearings are the same ones that voted last year for the Food and \nMedicine for the World Act--a sanctions relief bill\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nwhich was offered to the Agriculture Appropriations bill without prior \nhearings, and was voted for by 70 Members of this body. This bill \nsignificantly affected our relations with several states, most notably \nCuba and the other state sponsors of terrorism. This bill would have \nchanged U.S. policy that had been in place for decades, through several \nadministrations, and tightly bound the President's ability to initiate \nsanctions against a country. Moreover, the bill required congressional \napproval to implement sanctions, and did so through the same expedited \nprocedures found in our original bill. Again, I ask what is different \nhere?\n  Some have even raised the argument that the transparency provision in \nour bill is bad and will do great harm to our capital markets. Why is \nthat transparency fine everywhere but in this bill. Whether it be \nwithin the government, campaign finance reform, you name, it, \ntransparency is fine. But not when we want to let U.S. investors know \nwhen a foreign company that they have invested in, or are considering \ninvesting in, has been reported by the intelligence community as a \nproliferator of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. Is it so bad to let American investors know that their hard-\nearned dollars might be providing the capital to support a weapons \nproliferation program for North Korea or Libya that might one day \nthreaten their hometown? We warn Americans that cigarette smoking might \nbe hazardous to their health, that cholesterol might cause heart \nfailure, and that driving without a seat belt on could result in \nserious injuries in an accident, but we're unwilling to tell them that \ntheir pension fund might be helping China ship chemical weapons to \nIran? Do we think Americans aren't smart enough to make responsible \ndecisions, or are we actually afraid that they might do just that?\n\n  This is not some stretch of the imagination. A few months ago, \nPetroChina attempted to raise $10 billion through an IPO to finance its \noperations in Sudan, a country that has been listed as a state-sponsor \nof terrorism. While this case raised the level of public attention on \nthis issue, the problem started before PetroChina. The California \nPublic Employees' Retirement System (or Calpers) has invested millions \nof dollars of employee pension funds in companies with close ties to \nthe Chinese government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. \nCalpers has invested in four companies linked to the Chinese military \nor Chinese espionage: Cosco Pacific, China Resources Enterprise, Citic \nPacific, and Citic Ka Wah Bank. According to the Wall Street Journal, \nAmerican workers own $430 billion worth of foreign equities through \npension funds.\n  Congressionally mandated commissions studying the issue of \nproliferation have concluded both that the Chinese government is using \nthe United States capital markets to fund its proliferation activities \nand that the United States needs to address this issue as part of a \nsolution to proliferation. The Deutch Commission study of the threat \nposed by proliferation stated that ``the Commission is concerned that \nknown proliferators may be raising funds in the U.S. capital markets'' \nand concluded, ``It is clear that the United States is not making \noptimal use of its economic leverage in combating proliferators . . . \nAccess to U.S. capital markets . . . [is] among the wide range of \neconomic levers that could be used as carrots or sticks as part of an \noverall strategy to combat proliferation. Given the increasing tendency \nto turn to economic sanctions rather than military action in response \nto proliferation activity, it is essential that we begin to treat this \neconomic warfare with the same level of sophistication and planning we \ndevote to military options.''\n  The Cox Commission review of United States national security concerns \nwith China also concluded that ``increasingly, the PRC is using United \nStates capital markets as a source of central government funding for \nmilitary and commercial development and as a means of cloaking \ntechnology acquisition by its front companies.'' The committee also \nconcluded that most American investors don't know that they are \ncontributing to the proliferation threat saying, ``Because there is \ncurrently no national security-based review of entities seeking to gain \naccess to our capital markets, investors are unlikely to know that they \nmay be assisting in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by \nproviding funds to known proliferators.''\n  It is clear that China has been using United States capital to fiance \nits military and proliferation activities, and it seems that this \nactivity will only increase in the future. At least 10 Chinese \ncompanies are currently listed on United States stock exchanges, and \nthe PetroChina initial public offering was a test case designed to pave \nthe way for additional offerings. China Unicom, the second largest \ntelecommunications operator in China, was recently listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange, and has already raised approximately $5 billion in \nits initial public offering, and total proceeds of the IPO are expected \nto exceed $6.3 billion.\n  These problems have gone unaddressed for too long. That is why we \nhave included a provision regarding capital market transparency in the \nChina Nonproliferation Act. However, even in light of all of the above, \nthe capital market response is optional. It is merely one of several \nresponses available to the president if a foreign company is determined \nto be a persistent proliferator.\n  In conclusion, let me end by reiterating that our bill is not an \nattempt to derail the vote on permanent normal trade relations [PNTR] \nfor China. I have long been a strong supporter of free trade. That is \nwhy we have asked for a vote separate from, but in the context of, the \nChina-PNTR debate all along. We want Members to vote based on their \nconscience and the right solution to this serious national security \nissue, not based on parliamentary concerns or on how such a vote might \naffect the pending trade bill.\n  But it is essential to address this issue now. At a time of \nmonumental change in our relationship with Beijing--when China is \nasking to become a member in good standing of the global trading \ncommunity--is it asking too much for a fellow permanent member of the \nU.N. Security Council to obey international rules and norms with regard \nto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction?\n  The United States cannot continue this charade of confronting Chinese \nproliferation by establishing more commissions, holding more hearings, \npassing more ineffective legislation, or seeking more empty promises \nfrom Beijing. We are confident that our bipartisan approach to this \nserious threat addresses the problem in a firm, responsible, and \nbalanced manner. The United States must send the right message abroad, \nand as strong proponents of free trade, we believe that requires \nengaging and trading, while establishing a framework for appropriate \nUnited States response to China's actions that threaten this country.\n  We cannot take one approach without the other--not when our national \nsecurity is at stake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7514-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7514-S7515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DICK CHENEY AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute today to react \nto the news that has been all over, of course, in the last few days \nabout the selection of a Wyoming person to be on the ticket with \nGovernor Bush. We are very excited, of course, and very proud of Dick \nCheney. We think he is certainly a great addition to anyone's ticket \nfor national governance. We think he is a great choice.\n  Mr. Cheney, of course, was most recently Secretary of Defense. He \nmoved to Secretary of Defense from serving Wyoming for nearly 10 years \nin the Congress, in the House. I was fortunate enough to be able to \nreplace Dick Cheney in the House, representing Wyoming, so I, of \ncourse, have followed his career closely. No one was more excited than \nI was when he left to go to Defense. In any event, not only that but of \ncourse he had worked in the White House. He had worked there as an \nadministrative person, finally worked his way up to be Chief of Staff \nfor President Ford.\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\n  So really there is no one who has had a broader and better experience \nin National Government than Dick Cheney. Perhaps even more important \nthan that, this is a person who is a real person. I am sure all of us \nget a little exasperated from time to time in politics, where it seems \nalmost everything is spinning the issue, particularly in election \ntimes. You hear things. Someone asks a question and the question is \nnever answered because they spin off into something that is entirely \ndifferent to be advantageous to themselves. Not Dick Cheney. Dick \nCheney is a guy who is real. He is a guy just like the rest of us. He \ngrew up in Caspar, WY; went to school there. So all of us, including \nthe Presiding Officer here, from Wyoming, are very proud of Dick Cheney \nand very pleased that he will be a part of this campaign, hopefully of \ngovernance in this country.\n  Finally, for a couple of seconds I would like to say how disappointed \nI am that we are not moving forward, doing the business of the people \nof this country. We are down to where there are 4 days left this week, \nless than that, actually--a week when we had hoped to do, probably, \nthree appropriations bills. We go out, then, in August for recess, come \nback in September, probably have less than 20 working days to \naccomplish the business of this country.\n  Whether you like it or not, one of the major features of the \nGovernment is the appropriations process. It is determining what money \nis spent for, what programs are given priorities. Of course, that is \nwhat the appropriations process is all about. We are talking about $1.8 \ntrillion, almost $700 billion of that being in appropriated funds. So \nour responsibility is to do that. Now we find ourselves being held up \nfrom going forward. I understand there are differences of opinion. That \nis what this is all about. There are supposed to be differences of \nopinion. But there is also a way to deal with those without holding up \nthe progress of the entire Congress and ignoring the things we are \ndesigned to do, often simply to make an issue.\n  We find ourselves, unfortunately, in Presidential years more \ninterested in creating issues than we are in creating solutions. I \nthink that is too bad. Obviously, issues are important. Obviously, \ndifferences of view are important. Obviously, there is generally a \nconsiderable amount of difference between the views on the other side \nof the aisle, the minority, and the majority. The minority, of course, \nis generally for spending more money, having more Government. They see \nthe role of the Federal Government expanded greatly, where most of us \non this side are more interested in holding down the size of \ngovernment, moving government closer to the people and the States and \nin the counties and that sort of activity.\n\n  It is discouraging when they use that leverage of basically shutting \ndown the things we must do. Unfortunately, there is a history of that. \nIn 1998, in the second session, the minority held up the education \nsavings account, the protection of private property rights, product \nliability reform, NATO expansion, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, \nfunding for the Treasury Department--all in the effort to use that \nleverage.\n  Last year, of course, we had the obstruction of the Social Security \nlockbox--six times. We would go back to the same six times to make an \nissue out of it. Ed-Flex, the idea of giving more flexibility to \neducation and letting people on the ground, in the States and on the \nschool boards, have more determination as to what was done there, and \nbankruptcy reform--still in limbo.\n  We had delay in such critical issues as the elementary-secondary \neducation bill. That is something that ought to be moved. Marriage \npenalty tax relief--it took a very long time. You can make decisions on \nthings, but to try to change it by avoiding moving forward is a very \ndestructive kind of operation. That is where we find ourselves right \nnow, unfortunately.\n  The Ed-Flex bill, as I said, had to have five votes before we could \nbreak that. The lockbox legislation to protect Social Security, we went \nover and over that.\n  Much of it is the idea somehow if we can put everything off until \nafter the first of the year, there will perhaps be another opportunity \nto do something different.\n  I think it is time for us to adjourn. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I was listening to some of the discussion \nthis morning before the Senate broke for the party lunches. I was \nespecially interested in a couple of presentations about the progress \nsome think the Senate has made in this Congress, and about why they \nbelieve the Senate is not making progress today or this week.\n  It reminds me of the story of the fly that landed on the nose of an \nox. The ox, with the fly on its nose, went out for the entire day and \nplowed in the field. They came back to the village at night, and the \nvillagers began applauding. The fly, still on the nose of the ox, took \na deep bow and said to the villagers: We've been plowing.\n  That is sort of what I heard this morning--we've been plowing--when, \nin fact, this Senate, as all of us know, has not done the work we \nshould have been doing for the American people.\n  I thought it would be interesting to describe what the agenda should \nhave been and what we have done.\n  I will talk about some of the issues with which most Americans \nbelieve the Congress should be dealing: Common sense gun safety. For \nthose who might be listening, I'm not talking about gun control; this \nis not in any way going to abridge people's Second Amendment right to \nown guns. This legislation will, however, close a loophole in the law \nthat allows people to purchase guns at gun shows without having to get \nan instant check.\n  If you buy a gun in this country in a gun store, you must have your \nname run through an instant check system\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nto find out whether you are a felon. That makes good sense. We should \nnot sell guns to felons. The instant check system helps identify if \nsomeone trying to buy a gun at a gun store has been previously \nconvicted of a felony and therefore should not be sold a weapon.\n  But guess what? Go to a gun show on a Saturday somewhere and you can \nbuy a gun without an instant check being done. This does not make any \nsense. We want to close that loophole. We do not want to be selling \nguns at a gun show to a convicted felon. Yet we cannot get this common \nsense piece of legislation enacted in this Congress because it is \nconsidered radical or extreme by some. It is a very simple proposition: \nClose the gun show loophole to prevent felons from buying guns. We \nshould get that done.\n  Or what about the Patients' Bill of Rights? Every day 14,000 patients \nare denied needed medicines; 10,000 are denied needed tests and \nprocedures in this country. But we cannot pass a decent Patients' Bill \nof Rights because, in this Congress, we have people who stand with the \nbig insurance companies rather than standing with patients.\n  I know it is inconvenient to some to hear about specific patients who \nhave been denied needed care by their HMOs. I have talked about these \npatients at great length in the past because these folks are what the \nPatients' Bill of Rights is all about. It is about the woman who fell \noff a 40-foot cliff while she was hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains. \nShe fell 40 feet, broke several bones and was hauled unconscious into a \nhospital emergency room on a gurney. After surviving her life-\nthreatening injuries, she was told by her managed care organization \nthat it would not cover her medical care in the emergency room because \nshe didn't have prior approval to go to the emergency room. This is a \nwoman who was hauled into the emergency room unconscious. That is the \nsort of thing people are confronting these days.\n  Senator Reid and I had a hearing in Nevada on this subject. At that \nhearing, a woman stood up and talked about her son. Her son is dead \nnow. He died last October at 16 years of age. He was battling cancer \nand needed a special kind of chemotherapy to give him a chance to save \nhis life. Unfortunately, his insurance company denied him this care. He \nnot only had to battle cancer, but he also had to battle the insurance \ncompany that wouldn't cover the care he needed. His mother held up a \nvery large picture of her son at the hearing and, with tears in her \neyes, she cried as she told us: As my son lay dying, he looked up at me \nand said, Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid.\n  Kids who are battling cancer ought not have to battle the insurance \ncompanies or HMOs. Yet that is what is happening too often in this \ncountry. We propose to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that is very \nsimple. It says every patient in this country has a right to know all \nof his or her options for medical treatment, not just the cheapest \noption. It says that if you have an emergency and go to an emergency \nroom, you have a right to care in that emergency room. It says that if \nyou have cancer and your employer or your spouse's employer changes \nhealth plans, you have a right to continue seeing the oncologist who \nhas been helping you to fight that cancer. But we can't get a Patients' \nBill of Rights enacted because when it comes time to say who you stand \nwith--the patients who ought to have certain rights or the big \ninsurance companies that in too many cases have denied those rights--\ntoo many Senators say: We stand with the insurance companies.\n  The last time we debated this issue on the floor, about a month ago, \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, offered an amendment that \nhe called a Patients' Bill of Rights. He accomplished his purpose, I \nsuspect, because the next day the paper said the Senate passed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. However, what the Senate really passed was a \n``patients' bill of goods,'' not a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I thought it interesting that Dr. Ganske, a Republican Congressman, \nwrote this letter:\n\n       Heaven forbid that any member of Congress would ever vote \n     on a bill they haven't had time to read! Heaven really forbid \n     that a member would vote on a bill that their staff hasn't \n     seen!\n       Yet, that is exactly what happened two weeks ago on the \n     floor of the Senate when the Nickles HMO amendment was \n     brought up for a vote.\n       People are just now beginning to realize what was in that \n     legislation. To help you understand the fundamental flaws of \n     the Nickles bill, I am including a copy of an analysis of the \n     Senate's patient's bill of rights that was added to the FY \n     2001 Labor/HHS legislation.\n       This Senate legislation eliminates virtually any meaningful \n     remedy for most working Americans and their families against \n     death and injury caused by HMOs.\n\n  This is Dr. Ganske, a Republican Congressman, making this reference \nto the Nickles bill. He then includes a rather lengthy analysis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Dr. Ganske's letter \nand the analysis in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Heaven forbid that any member of \n     Congress would ever vote on a bill they haven't had time to \n     read! Heaven really forbid that a member would vote on a bill \n     that their staff hasn't seen!\n       Yet, that is exactly what happened two weeks ago on the \n     floor of the Senate when the Nickles HMO amendment was \n     brought up for a vote. The Norwood-Dingell-Ganske bipartisan \n     Consensus Managed Care Reform Act of 1999 had been public for \n     months before the House voted. Not so with the Nickles HMO \n     bill.\n       People are just now beginning to realize what was in that \n     legislation. To help you understand the fundamental flaws of \n     the Nickles bill, I am enclosing a copy of an analysis of the \n     Senate patient's bill of rights that was added to the FY 2001 \n     Labor/HHS legislation.\n       This Senate legislation eliminates virtually any meaningful \n     remedy for most working Americans and their families against \n     death and injury caused by HMOs. Please read the analysis by \n     Professors Rosenbaum, Frankford, and Rosenblatt as to why the \n     Nickles bill is worse than the status quo!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Greg Ganske,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     July 6, 2000.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: At your request we have reviewed the Senate \n     patients' bill of rights legislation that was inserted into \n     the FY 2001 Labor/HHS legislation last week.\n       Rather than expanding individual protections, the measure \n     would appear to undo state law remedies for medical injuries \n     caused by managed care companies' treatment decisions and \n     delays. In this regard, the bill runs directly contrary to \n     United States Supreme Court's reasoning in its recent \n     decision in Pegram v. Herdrich, which seems to reaffirm the \n     authority of states to determine medical liability policy, \n     and underscores the appropriateness of state courts as the \n     forum for medical liability cases.\n       The displacement of state medical liability law in favor of \n     a new federal medical liability remedy might have some policy \n     validity, were the new law fair and just. But the remedy set \n     forth in the Senate bill is compromised by an unprecedented \n     range of limitations, exceptions, and defenses and appears to \n     leave injured persons with no remedy at all.\n       In sum, in the name of patient protection, the Senate \n     legislation appears to eliminate virtually any meaningful \n     remedy for most working Americans and their families against \n     death and injury caused by managed care companies.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The central purpose underlying the enactment of federal \n     patient protection legislation is to expand protections for \n     the vast majority of insured Americans whose health benefits \n     are derived from private, non-governmental employment, and \n     who thus come within the ambit of ERISA. Not only would the \n     Senate measure not accomplish this goal, but worse, it \n     appears to be little more than a vehicle for protecting \n     managed care companies from various forms of legal liability \n     * * *\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     By classifying medical treatment injuries as claims denials \n     and coverage decisions governed by ERISA, the Senate bill \n     insulates managed care companies from medical liability under \n     state law.\n       Section 231 of the Senate bill amends ERISA Sec. 502 to \n     create a new federal cause of action relating to a ``denial \n     of a claim for benefits'' in the context of prior \n     authorization. The bill defines the term ``claim for \n     benefits'' as a ``request * * * for benefits (including \n     requests for benefits that are subject to authorization of \n     coverage or utilization review) * * * or for payment in whole \n     or in part for an item or service under a group health plan \n     or health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance \n     issuer in connection with a group health plan.'' ERISA \n     Sec. 503B, as added. Thus, the bill would classify prior \n     authorization denials as ``claims for benefits'' that are in \n     turn covered by the new federal remedy. Federal remedies \n     under ERISA Sec. 502 preempt all state law remedies.\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\n       This classification would have profound effects, \n     particularly in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision \n     in Pegram v. Herdrich. As drafted, the Senate bill arguably \n     would preempt state medical liability law as applied to \n     medical injuries caused by the wrongful or negligent \n     withholding or necessary treatment by managed care companies. \n     The bill thus would reverse the trend in state law, which has \n     been to hold managed care companies accountable for the \n     medical injuries they cause, just as would be the case for \n     any other health provider.\n       In recent years courts that have considered the issue of \n     managed care-related injuries have applied medical liability \n     theory and law to managed care companies in a manner similar \n     to the approach taken in the case of hospitals. Thus, like \n     hospitals, managed care companies can be both directly and \n     vicariously liabile for medical injuries attributable to \n     their conduct. In a managed care context, the most common \n     type of situation in which medical liability arises tends to \n     involve injuries caused by the wrongful or negligent \n     withholding of necessary medical treatment (i.e., denials of \n     requests for care).\n       State legislatures also have begun to enact legislation to \n     expressly permit medical liability actions against managed \n     care companies. The best known of these laws is medical \n     liability legislation enacted in 1997 by the state of Texas \n     and recently upheld in relevant part against an ERISA \n     challenge by the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit.\n       In Pegram v. Herdrich, the Supreme Court implicitly \n     addressed this question of whether managed care state \n     liability law should cover companies for the medical injuries \n     they cause. The Court decided that liability issues do not \n     belong in federal courts and strongly indicated its view that \n     in its current form ERISA does not preclude state law \n     actions. It is this decision that the Senate bill would \n     appear to overturn.\n       In Pegram, the Court set up a new classification system for \n     the types of decisions made by managed care organizations \n     contracting with ERISA plans. The first type of decision \n     according to the Court is a ``pure'' eligibility decision \n     that, in an ERISA context, constitutes an act of plan \n     administration and thus represents an exercise of ERISA \n     fiduciary responsibilities. Remedies for injuries caused by \n     this type of determination would be addressed under ERISA \n     Sec. 502 (which of course currently provides for no remedy \n     other than the benefit itself).\n       The second type of decision is a ``mixed'' eligibility \n     decision. While the Court's classification system contains a \n     number of ambiguities, it appears that in the Court's view, \n     this second class of decision effectively occurs any time \n     that a managed care company, acting through its physicians, \n     exercises medical judgment regarding the appropriateness of \n     treatment. Such decisions, as medical decisions rather than \n     pure eligibility decisions, are not part of the \n     administration of an ERISA plan and thus not part of ERISA's \n     remedial scheme because, according to the Court, in enacting \n     ERISA, Congress did not intend to displace state medical \n     liability laws. The Court thus strongly indicated that these \n     claims are not preempted by ERISA and may be brought in state \n     court. In the Court's view, these mixed decisions represent a \n     ``great many, if not most'' of the coverage decisions that \n     managed care companies make.\n       The Senate bill would appear to reverse Pegram by \n     effectively classifying all prior authorization \n     determinations as Sec. 502 decisions, without any regard to \n     whether they are ``pure'' or ``mixed''. As a result, state \n     medical liability laws that arguably now reach mixed \n     decisions apparently would be preempted, leaving individual \n     physicians, hospitals, and other health providers as the sole \n     defendants in state court. Under the complete preemption \n     theory of Sec. 502, remedies against managed care virtually \n     impossible standard to prove and particularly egregious in \n     light of the fact that plaintiffs cannot even bring such an \n     action unless they have gotten a reversal of the denial at \n     the external review stage. Even where they have proven that a \n     company wrongfully withheld treatment, plaintiffs can recover \n     nothing for their injuries without taking the level of proof \n     far beyond what is needed to win at the external review \n     stage. Virtually all injuries would go uncompensated.\n       A plaintiff will be forced to show ``substantial harm'', \n     defined in the law as loss of life, significant loss of limb \n     or bodily function, significant disfigurement or severe and \n     chronic pain. This definition arguably would exclude some of \n     the most insidious injuries, such as degeneration in health \n     and functional status, or loss of the possibility of \n     improvement, that a patient could face as a result of delayed \n     care, particularly a child with special health needs. In \n     Bedrick v. Travelers Insurance Co., the managed care company \n     cut off almost all physical and speech therapy for a toddler \n     with profound cerebral palsy. The Court of Appeals, in one of \n     the most searing decisions ever entered in a managed care \n     reversal case, found that the company had acted on the basis \n     of no evidence and with what could only be described as \n     outright prejudice against children with disabilities (the \n     managed care company's medical director concluded that care \n     for the baby never could be medically necessary because \n     children with cerebral palsy had no chance of being normal).\n       The consequences of facing years without therapy were \n     potentially profound for this child: the failure to develop \n     mobility, the loss of the small amount of motion that the \n     child might have had, and the enormous costs (both actual and \n     emotional) suffered by the parents. Arguably, however, none \n     of these injuries falls into any of the categories identified \n     in the Senate bill as constituting ``substantial harm.''\n       The maximum award permitted is $350,000, and even this \n     amount is subject to various types of reductions and offsets. \n     This limitation on recovery will make securing representation \n     extremely difficult.\n       No express provision is made for attorneys fees. Were the \n     new right of action to be interpreted not to include \n     attorneys fees this would be a radical change in the ERISA \n     statute, and one that would create a massive barrier to use \n     of the new purported ERISA remedy. To mount a case proving \n     bad faith denial of treatment that caused substantial injury \n     is an enormously expensive proposition. The limitations on is \n     enormous. In Humana v. Forsythe the United States Supreme \n     Court held RICO applicable to a managed care company that had \n     systematically defrauded thousands of health plan members out \n     of millions of dollars in benefits by systematically lying to \n     members about the proportional cost of the treatment they \n     were being required to bear (the policy was a typical 80/20 \n     payment policy, but because of secret discounts that were not \n     disclosed to members, group policy holders in many cases were \n     paying for the majority of their care). This is racketeering, \n     pure and simple, and thus represents a classic type of RICO \n     claim. To use a patient protection bill potentially to \n     insulate managed care companies against these types of \n     practices is unwise at best.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The central purpose underlying the enactment of federal \n     patient protection legislation is to expand protections for \n     the vast majority of insured Americans whose health benefits \n     are derived from private, nongovernmental employment, and who \n     thus come within the ambit of ERISA. Not only would the \n     Senate measure not accomplish this goal, but worse, it \n     appears to be little more than a vehicle for protecting \n     managed care companies from various forms of legal liability \n     under current law. Viewed in this light, Congressional \n     passage of the Senate bill would be far worse than were \n     Congress to enact no measure at all.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. We cannot get a real Patients' Bill of Rights passed. How \nabout a Medicare prescription drug benefit? Well, we are not able to \nget that done either. We have been busy providing tax cuts, an estate \ntax repeal and a change in the marriage tax penalty. The head of OMB \nsaid yesterday that, under the recent tax proposals passed by the \nmajority party, the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country \nwill get more tax cuts than the bottom 80 percent combined.\n  This explains why the upper income folks, those with the largest \nestates and the highest incomes, rally around these tax cut proposals. \nThere should really be no difference between the parties on the estate \ntax. Those of us in the minority believe we ought to repeal the estate \ntax for family farms and small businesses and allow a reasonable \naccumulation of wealth for a family. We said if you have up to $4 \nmillion, you should pay no estate tax. For a family farmer or small \nbusiness, you can have assets up to $8 million and pay no estate tax at \nall. But that wasn't good enough for the majority. The majority party \nsaid, we must also fight to eliminate the tax burden on the estates of \nthe Donald Trumps of America who will die with half a billion or a \nbillion or several billion dollars. At what price? What else could we \ndo with the money that the majority wants to use to relieve the tax \nburden on the wealthiest estates in America?\n  Perhaps we could use it to reduce the Federal debt. It seems to me \nthat is probably a better priority than providing a tax cut for the \nestates of billionaires. Or we could use the money for a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare, perhaps for school modernization, or to hire \nmore teachers to lower class sizes. There are a whole series of \nproposals that might represent a better alternative than deciding we \nmust use this revenue to relieve the tax burden on the largest estates \nin this country.\n  Is a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program important? It \nis quite clear that if we were creating the Medicare program today, we \nwould provide coverage for prescription drugs through Medicare. Senior \ncitizens make up twelve percent of our population, but they consume \none-third of all the prescription drugs used in this country. They \nreach a period in their life where they need to maintain their health, \nand miracle drugs that did not exist 30 years ago now exist to extend \ntheir lives. In the 20th century, we increased the life expectancy in \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nby 30 years. A part of the reason for that is better nutrition, better \nliving conditions, better education about healthy living, but part of \nthe reason is also miracle drugs.\n  It is not unusual for a senior citizen to be taking two, four, five, \nand in some cases, ten or twelve different prescription drugs to deal \nwith their health challenges. Those prescription drugs are enormously \ncostly. The price is increasing every year. Last year, spending on \nprescription drugs in America increased 16 percent in 1 year. The year \nbefore the increase was about the same. Many senior citizens just can't \nafford these expenses.\n  I have held hearings through the Democratic Policy Committee in five \nor six States on this subject. I have had senior citizen after senior \ncitizen tell me that, when going shopping, they first must go to the \npharmacy in the back of the grocery store to purchase their \nprescription drugs. Only after they have bought their medications do \nthey know how much money they have left to purchase food. It is a \ncommon story all across the country. So should we add a prescription \ndrug benefit to the Medicare program? Of course, we should. Will we? We \nwon't do it unless we get some cooperation from a majority party that \nbelieves this is not a priority for the country.\n  We believe it is. We have a plan that will provide a prescription \ndrug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries in a way that is cost-effective, \nin a way that will tend to push down the prices of prescription drugs \nand provide an opportunity for coverage for senior citizens who elect \nto have this benefit. That ought to be part of the agenda in this \nCongress, but we can't get it done.\n  Or what about school modernization? This country has had such a \nwonderful 20th century, especially the last half of the century \nfollowing the Second World War. Those who fought for America's freedom \nin World War II came back to this country, and began careers, got \nmarried, had children. They built schools all over America 50 years \nago. Many of those schools are now in disrepair. These schools need \nrenovation or replacement.\n  Not only are many of these schools desperately in need of \nmodernization and renovation, but there is also a need to reduce class \nsizes from 28 or more, in some classes, down to 18 kids or fewer.\n  We know the quality of education is better when there are smaller \nclass sizes. We know it is better for kids' education when they are \ngoing through the door of a modern schoolroom that all of us can be \nproud of. As I have said many times--and if it is tiresome to people, \nit doesn't matter to me--it is hard to go to the Cannon Ball Elementary \nSchool in North Dakota and have a third grader such as Rosie Two Bears \nsay: Mr. Senator, will you build us a new school? That school has 150 \nstudents, one water fountain, and two bathrooms. Some of the classrooms \nhave to be evacuated periodically because of raw sewage seeping up \nthrough the floors. Part of the building is 90 years old and has \nlargely been condemned.\n  Are we proud of sending that young girl through that classroom door? \nI don't think so. We can do better. Perhaps that is more important than \nproviding relief from the estate tax burden of somebody who dies with \n$1 billion. Instead of being able to leave only $600 million to their \nheirs, they get to leave all of the $1 billion because the majority \nparty says that is their priority. Their priority is to give tax cuts \nto the top 1 percent of the American income earners that are more than \nthe tax cuts we are going to give to all of the bottom 80 percent. That \nis their priority. My point is that we ought to be focusing on other \npriorities.\n  So this morning when we had people shuffle over to the floor of the \nSenate and talk about what a wonderful job this Congress has done and \nhow we are stalled now because the Democrats somehow don't want to do \nanything, I just had to come over here and correct the record. One of \nthe things hanging up work today is that there are people who have been \nnominated as Federal judges whose nominations have been before the \nSenate for 3 years without having been brought to the floor for a vote. \nWe would like that to happen. That is considered unreasonable.\n  I say to those who think this Congress has a wonderful record that \nthis is a Congress of underachievers. We have a little time left. We \nhave this week and September and the first week of October. This is \nwhat we have to do. We have a Patients' Bill of Rights that we ought to \npass. We have gun safety legislation that we ought to pass. We ought to \nclose the gun show loophole. We ought to pass an increase in the \nminimum wage. The fact is, those working at the bottom rung of the \neconomic ladder in this country have lost ground. Everybody here is so \nworried about providing tax breaks to the top income earners. What \nabout providing some help to those at the bottom of the economic scale? \nThese people get up and get dressed and have breakfast in the morning \nand go out and work hard, and they are trying to raise a family on a \nminimum wage that has not kept pace with inflation. We ought to do \nsomething about that.\n  We ought to provide a Medicare drug benefit. We can do that to \naddress the needs of our senior citizens who are now struggling with \nhealth problems and just to make ends meet, only to discover that, in \ntheir twilight years, the medicines they need to make life better are \nfinancially out of reach for them.\n  Last week, we passed a piece of legislation that says maybe we ought \nto be able to access the more reasonable prescription drug prices on \nexactly the same prescription drugs that exist in Canada and elsewhere. \nThe same companies produce the same pill, put it in the same bottle, \nand they sell it for a third of the price up in Winnipeg, Canada, or, \nfor that matter, in virtually any other country in which they sell \nthese drugs.\n  Last week, I suggested that I would like to see just one Senator \nstand up--in fact, I renew the challenge to anybody who wants to come \nto the floor--on the floor of the Senate and say that it is fair for \nAmerican consumers to pay significantly more for the same exact drug \nthan consumers in other countries. I will give any Senator who wants to \ndo this the pill bottles; I held up several last week. The bottle of \nthe prescription drug sold in the U.S. costs $3.82 a pill and the same \ndrug in the same bottle, made by the same company, in the same \nmanufacturing plant, sold in Canada costs only $1.82 a pill. The U.S. \nconsumer pays $3.82 and the Canadian consumer pays $1.82. I want to see \na Senator, just one Senator, stand up and hold these bottles and say, \nyes, this is fair to my constituents and, yes, this price inequity is \nsomething we ought to support. Of course, no one will because nobody \nbelieves that is fair. That is another issue that we have to address. \nWe were able to get some legislation through the Senate and, of course, \nthe pharmaceutical industry has indicated that it fully intends to kill \nthat in conference. We will see.\n\n  So there is a lot left for this Senate to do. We have, at the end of \nthis week, a break for the two national conventions, and then in \nSeptember and October we will see the end of the 106th Congress. All \nlegislation introduced between January of last year and now will \neventually die, unless it is passed by this Congress, and we will have \nto start over again next year. So the questions of whether this is an \neffective Congress and whether this Congress creates a record any of us \ncan be proud of are going to be answered in the next few months. Are we \nable to address the issues that the American people care about? Will \nthe majority party stop obstructing on these issues? Will they decide a \nPatients' Bill of Rights should be passed by Congress? If so, let's do \nit soon. Will we be able to address the issue of reasonable gun safety \nmeasures, increasing the minimum wage, adding a drug benefit for \nMedicare, and school modernization? Those and other issues, it seems to \nme, are central to an agenda that will strengthen and improve this \ncountry. We will see in the coming days exactly what the 106th Congress \ndecides it wants to leave as its legacy.\n  One of the great things about this democracy of ours is that the \nmajority rules. That is certainly true in the Senate. They control the \nschedule. That is why we are now in morning business in the afternoon. \nOnly in the Senate can you be in morning business in the afternoon, I \nguess. But we are not debating an appropriations bill, and we should \nbe. There aren't enough people wanting to bring judges to the floor for \nconfirmation and so on.\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n  The point is this: The majority party has a choice to decide which of \nthese issues and how many of them they want this Congress to adopt. I \nhope it will decide very soon that it chooses to join us and say these \nare the issues that matter to the American people, and these are the \nissues the 106th Congress shall embrace in the final weeks of this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last several weeks, I have listened \nas some of my colleagues have, with escalating invective, expressed \nrepeatedly their dismay about the manner in which Senate Republicans \nhave processed President Clinton's judicial nominees. That some would \naccuse the Senate majority of failing to act in good faith strikes me \nas ironic, given the recent reckless statements made by President \nClinton and members of the all-Democratic Congressional Black Caucus. I \nalready have made my views on their reckless statements known and will \nnot repeat them again here.\n  Some of my colleagues like to talk about proceeding in good faith, \nbut they ignore the fact that there is much legislation with broad, bi-\npartisan support that is at a standstill because they refuse to let \nthis institution work its will. From bankruptcy reform to H-1B \nlegislation to juvenile justice reform to religious liberty protection \nlegislation, there are several legislative items where the blessings of \ngood faith cooperation have not been bestowed. Consider, for example, \nthe fact that a handful of members on the other side of the aisle have \nkept us from simply proceeding to a formal conference on the bankruptcy \nbill. Having poisoned the water themselves, they have no ground for \ncomplaining that the water is now poisoned.\n  The more substantive complaints lodged by some of our colleagues have \ntaken various forms. Some complain that there is a vacancy crisis in \nthe federal courts; that the Senate has not confirmed enough of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees; and that the confirmation record \nof the Republican Senate compares unfavorably to the Democrats' record \nwhen they controlled this body.\n  The claim that there is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts is \nsimply wrong. Using the Clinton Administration's own standard, the \nfederal judiciary currently is at virtual full employment. Presently \nthere are 60 vacancies in the 852-member federal judiciary, yielding a \nvacancy rate of just seven percent. Of these 60 vacancies, the \nPresident has failed to make a nomination for 27 of them.\n  Think about that. Some of my colleagues are complaining about a so-\ncalled vacancy crisis when almost half of the current vacancies don't \neven have a nominee. It is too late to really send additional \nnominations up here because we are in the final few months of the \nCongress and there is no way to get through them with the work we have \nto do in processing judges.\n  In 1994, at the end of the Democrat-controlled 103d Congress, there \nwere 63 judicial vacancies. That is when the Democrats controlled the \nSenate and President Clinton was President. There were 63 judicial \nvacancies, yielding a vacancy rate of 7.4 percent. At that time, on \nOctober 12, 1994, the Clinton administration argued in a Department of \nJustice press release that ``[t]his is equivalent to `full employment' \nin the 837-member Federal judiciary.'' If the Federal judiciary was \nfully employed in 1994, when there were 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent \nvacancy rate, then it certainly is fully employed now when there are \nonly 60 vacancies and a 7 percent vacancy rate, even though we have a \nsignificantly larger judiciary.\n  Democrats further complain that the Republican Senate has not \nconfirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial nominees. So far this \nyear, the Judiciary Committee has held seven hearings for 30 judicial \nnominees. In addition, the Committee is holding a hearing today for \nfour additional nominees. This year the Senate has confirmed 35 \nnominees, including eight nominees for the U.S. Courts of Appeals.\n\n  With eight court of appeals nominees already confirmed this year, it \nis clear that the Senate and the Judiciary Committee have acted fairly \nwith regard to appeals court nominees. In presidential election years, \nthe confirmation of appellate court nominees historically has slowed. \nIn 1988, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed only seven of \nPresident Reagan's appellate court nominees; in 1992, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate confirmed eleven of President Bush's appellate court \nnominees. This year, the Senate already has confirmed eight circuit \ncourt nominees--evidence that we are right on track with regard to \ncircuit court nominees.\n  While some may complain that the Republican Senate has not confirmed \nenough of President Clinton's judicial nominees, conservatives \ncriticize us for confirming too many. An editorial in today's \nWashington Times argues that the Republican Senate has confirmed far \ntoo many federal judges since gaining control of the Senate in 1995. \nThis view is typical many reactionary conservatives who, like their \ncounterparts on the extreme left, serve in some respects as a check on \nour political system. I plan to respond to this particular editorial in \na more formal manner, but let me just say this--the notion that our \nLeader is not doing what he believes is best for our country's future \nis absurd.\n  The fact that the criticism comes from both sides leads me to believe \nthat we probably are carrying out our advice and consent duties as most \nAmericans would have us.\n  There are some on the political right who complain that we are not \nconfirming conservative judges. They forget that we are in the midst of \na liberal Presidency and that the President's power of nomination is \nmore powerful than the Senate's power of advice and consent. I urge \nthem to get on the ball and help elect a Republican President who will \nnominate judges that share our conservative judicial philosophy.\n  Finally, Democrats contend that things were much better when they \ncontrolled the Senate. Much better for them perhaps--it certainly was \nnot better for many of the nominees of Presidents Reagan and Bush. At \nthe end of the Bush administration, for example, the vacancy rate stood \nat nearly 12 percent. By contrast, as the Clinton administration draws \nto a close, the vacancy rate stands at just seven percent. The \ndisparity between the vacancy rate at the end of the Bush \nAdministration, as compared to the vacancy rate now, illustrates that \nthe Republican Senate has, in fact, acted in good faith when it comes \nto President Clinton's nominees.\n  The Senate has carried out its advice and consent duties \nappropriately, in a manner that has been fair to all--to the \nPresident's nominees, to the federal judiciary, and to the American \npeople. I stand ready to help Senators Lott and Daschle undertake and \ncomplete work on the appropriations bills that are before us and on \nother legislation, much of which enjoys broad, bi-partisan support and \nshould be acted on this year.\n  I am getting sick and tired of my colleagues on the other side just \nstopping everything--even bills that they agree with--to try and make \nthe Senate look bad for their own political gain, so that they can take \ncontrol of the Senate after the next election. If I were in their \nshoes, I would want to take control of the Senate honorably, rather \nthan dishonorably.\n  I repeat, I stand ready to help Senators Lott and Daschle undertake \nand complete work on the appropriations bills before the Senate and on \nother legislation which enjoys broad bipartisan support and should be \nacted on this year.\n  It is my hope that the important legislative work of the Senate will \nnot be impeded by political gamesmanship over judicial confirmations. I \nparticularly resent people indicating that the Senate is not doing its \nduty on judicial confirmations, or that there is some ulterior purpose \nbehind what goes on, or that this President isn't being treated fairly, \nbecause he has been treated fairly. I am getting sick and tired of it \nand will not put up with it anymore.\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, my good friend from the State of Kansas, \nSenator Brownback, has come to the floor a number of times in recent \nweeks to talk about some legislation that he favors. He favors a ban on \nlegal betting on college games in Nevada.\n  This legislation has received the following comments from respected \npublications from around the country. George F. Will:\n\n       Congress now is contemplating a measure that sets some sort \n     of indoor record for missing the point.\n\n  Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly:\n\n       In fact, passing the bill would be like trying to stop a \n     statewide flood in Oklahoma by fixing a leaking faucet in \n     Enid. Nevada handles only 1 percent of the action on college \n     sports. Not that bookies and the mob wouldn't very much like \n     to get their hands on that 1 percent.\n\n  A Chicago Sun Times editorial:\n\n       A Nevada ban is more likely to push wagers underground or \n     on to the Internet. A ban would do little to stop betting on \n     college games.\n\n  Sporting News, a columnist by the name of Mike DeCourcy:\n\n       The NCAA has put no thought whatsoever into this push. This \n     is strictly a public relations move that offers no tangible \n     benefit.\n\n  Business Week:\n\n       Now the NCAA is looking to fix its image with a bill only a \n     bookie would love.\n\n  USA Today, founder Al Neuharth:\n\n       University and college presidents and coaches properly are \n     concerned about the integrity of campus sports, but \n     the solution to the problem is getting their own houses in \n     order.\n\n  I understand the NCAA is based in Kansas City and they have some jobs \nthere. I am sure this move ingratiates the NCAA to my friend from \nKansas. The fact is, this issue does not come close to doing anything \nto solve the problem. No, Mr. President, I do not gamble. I live in the \nState of Nevada. I have been chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, \nthe top regulator of gaming. I do not gamble. I do not gamble on games \nor anything else, but I know a little bit about gambling, having been \nthe chief regulator in the State of Nevada for 4 years.\n  While my friend says this legislation has widespread support, I have \nonly read a few of the editorial comments. This legislation is held up \nto ridicule. Of course, we get college coaches coming in saying they do \nnot want their kids playing and having people bet on them.\n  The NCAA makes billions--I am not misspeaking--not millions but \nbillions of dollars from NCAA football and basketball. If they are so \nsincere in stopping betting on these games, why don't they not allow \nthese games to be telecast? Just do not have any college games on \ntelevision--no football games, no NCAA Final Four, no Rose Bowl, just \noutlaw them.\n  The NCAA is all powerful. They could do that, they think. They have \nbeen such a dismal, total failure regulating amateur athletics that \nthey think now they have something they can finally win. What they are \ngoing to do is outlaw college betting in Nevada, the only place in the \ncountry where you can do it legally, and as has been said, less than 2 \npercent of the betting on college games takes place in Nevada. Over 98 \npercent of gambling on college games takes place in Washington, DC, in \nthe State of Idaho--all over the country. It is done illegally. If the \nNCAA is so concerned about betting on college games, let's do something \nabout the illegal betting that takes place; let's not go after the \nlegal betting.\n  Lindsey Graham, on Hardball, a few weeks ago said:\n\n       You're not going to stop illegal betting by passing the \n     bill.\n\n  Of course not. Originally, the NCAA, in all its wisdom, said if we \ntake away the 1.5 percent of the legal betting and leave 98.5 percent \nand they do not allow the State of Nevada to post odds, it will stop \nall over the country. Everybody will stop running the lines on these \ngames.\n  Again, of course, the NCAA, for lack of a better description, simply \ndoes not know what they are talking about. John Sturm, the president of \nthe Newspaper Association of America said:\n\n       If Congress prohibits gambling on college sports, the \n     association believes newspapers will continue to have an \n     interest in publishing point spreads on college games, since \n     point spreads appear to be useful, if not valuable, to \n     newspaper readers who have no intention of betting on games.\n\n  I already established I do not bet on games, but I love to know what \nthe point spread is on a game. It makes it more interesting. If UV is \ngoing to play in the Final Four and play Michigan State, Duke, or a \nteam such as that, I want to know the point spread to see who is \nfavored. That does not mean I am going to run down to the corner bookie \nand bet on the game or, if I am in Las Vegas, I will not go to the \nHilton race book, MGM, or one of those places.\n  I would not know how to place a bet if you asked me to, but I do know \nthe way they do it in Nevada is better than the way they do it in the \nservice stations, bowling alleys, and bars because the illegal bookies \nbase their game on credit, usually a week at a time. People place bets \nwith their illegal bookie during the week. On Monday or Tuesday, they \ncome around to collect that money. That is where the real trouble \nstarts.\n\n  In Nevada, you could be Kirk Kirkorian, one of the richest men in the \nworld--he owns the MGM and a number of other things around the world. \nAs rich as he is, if he walked into his own race book, the rules are \nthat he can get no credit. It has to be all cash. If he wants to bet on \na ball game, he has to put up cash. There is no credit.\n  It goes without saying which is the better system. The better system \nis, in Nevada you can only bet what money you have in your pocket. No \ncredit is allowed. For the illegal bookies around the country, credit \nis the name of the game. They do not break as many knuckles as they \nused to, but they sure put their loans out to people who ask to borrow \nthe money. They pay exorbitant interest rates, and that is when people \nlose their homes, cars, and property.\n  When this bill comes up--and it will come up--this is not going to be \na laydown. The merits are on the side of what is going on legally in \nthe State of Nevada.\n  This issue is a sham, it is a farce, it is a diversion designed to \ndeflect attention from an organization that while swimming in money \nitself, earned from the sweat of the college kids, is incapable, it \nseems, of doing anything positive.\n  My favorite--and it happened recently--is St. John's University. \nTheir coach, who was almost hired by the local professional basketball \nteam, is Mike Jarvis. He has a kid who had a used car. The kid trades \nin the used car for another used car. They suspended him from playing \nfor three games.\n  That really helps the game a lot. A kid has a used car and trades it \nin on another used car, and they suspend him from playing. What the \nNCAA does is harass and intimidate people. We have an example in the \nState of Nevada, Jerry Tarkanian, one of the most successful coaches in \nthe history of America. They eventually ran him out in the State of \nNevada. He is now coaching at Fresno State. They harassed, did \neverything they could to embarrass him. He sued them. It took 8 or 9 \nyears, but he won the lawsuit. They had to pay him money for what they \ndid to him. By then he had already been run out of the State.\n  The NCAA recently signed a multibillion dollar broadcasting contract. \nThat is not a bad deal for a nonprofit organization. Players, coaches, \nathletes recognize the unaccountable and often unquestionable power of \nthis organization. They have been sued lately.\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nThey had to pay out millions of dollars to assistant coaches who they \nwould only allow to receive--I forget what the ridiculous sum was--\n$12,000 a year, $8,000 a year. The coaches sued them and, of course, \nthe NCAA lost. They had to pay that judgment. They lose all the time in \ncourt.\n  To avoid scrutiny on them, this is an effort to throw out a red \nherring, something maybe people will take after, rather than who they \nshould take after, and that is them.\n  This legislation, supported by my friend from Kansas who comes here \nall the time and talks about it--I know Senator John McCain, the senior \nSenator from Arizona, also favors this legislation--does nothing to \naddress the problem of illegal gambling on college sports. No one \nsupports illegal gambling on college sports except illegal bookies. \nThey will be the primary beneficiaries of the legislation. That is not \nme speaking. I read to the Senate a few excerpts from editorials around \nthe country.\n  A friend of mine called me. I care a great deal about her. She has \nrecently suffered the loss of her husband. She has some money as a \nresult of that--not a lot but a little bit. Someone called her and \nsaid--I won't mention a name--if this legislation passes, talking about \nthe Brownback legislation, if it passes, you give me $20,000. At the \nend of 1 year I will give you $200,000 because that is how much money I \ncan make by taking illegal bets. I can't do it now because people who \nwant to bet come from all over the country to bet legally in the State \nof Nevada.\n  Illegal bookies love this legislation. One who I heard from in the \nheartland of America told me--not in Kansas but very close to Kansas--\nthis will be the best thing that Congress could ever do for his \nbusiness.\n  I have spoken to law enforcement authorities. There is no question \nthat one of the scandals--referring to Arizona State, where there was \nsome illegal betting taking place on Arizona State--was discovered \nbecause Nevada reported it. They could tell something was wrong because \nof heavy betting on Arizona State. You can bet a little on Arizona \nState football, but their basketball team has never been much to bet \non. They could tell because of the betting that took place at Arizona \nState that something was wrong. They notified authorities, and that is \nwhere the arrest took place. That is where they were able to make a \ncase against the illegal betting taking place at Arizona State.\n  What we should do is look at a way to stop illegal betting on college \ncampuses. College presidents are concerned about it, as well they \nshould be. Remember, what is going on in Nevada is legal and involves \nless than 2 percent of gambling in our country. Eliminating gambling \nlegally in the State of Nevada on college games will do nothing but \nhelp illegal gambling on college campuses. We don't need new laws. We \nneed better enforcement.\n\n  John Sturm, whom I quoted earlier, President of the Newspapers \nAssociation of America, in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, \nmade clear, basically, if Congress prohibits gambling in Nevada on \ncollege sports, it is not going to stop anything that goes on in the \nrest of the country. Certainly it is not going to stop newspapers from \npublishing these lines.\n  President Sturm also dispels another myth perpetrated by the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association that people use the spreads to place \nillegal bets. In fact, a recent Harris poll found that 70 percent of \nthose who look at point spreads do so only to obtain information, such \nas me, about a favorite college team, about information on upcoming \ncollege games.\n  Another myth paraded around by the proponents of banning legal \nwagering on college games is that this is done because of a unanimous \nvote by the members of the National Commission to Study Gambling. Wrong \nagain. That vote was very close. One of the members of the committee \nwas from Nevada. He abstained. He said if he had been called upon to \nvote, it would have been a 5-4 vote. That is far from unanimous. The \nreality is, this proposal was given little consideration by the \ncommission. They had many other things to talk about. The proponents of \nthe ban have the right to their opinion, but they are absolutely wrong. \nTheir opinion in this case lacks substance.\n  We need to step back and take a look at this. We need to understand \nthe legal business of America is not going to lay down and say, OK, run \nover us. There has been some criticism about not letting this bill go \nforward, not having a time agreement on it.\n  This is something we need to talk about. This involves not illegal \ngambling on college games--if they want to enforce the law that now \nprohibits illegal gambling or if they want to pass a new restriction on \nillegal gambling, I will stand beside them and do that--we are talking \nabout less than 2 percent of the gambling that takes place on college \ngames and it is done legally.\n  Danny Sheridan, one of the top oddsmakers in America, USA Today, sets \nthe line. He came to Washington. He has talked to a number of Members \nof Congress. He said: I will talk to whomever you want to talk to. He \nsaid: I don't gamble but I set the line. I will continue to do it no \nmatter what they do in Nevada.\n  We have had people parading on the floor--I shouldn't say \n``parading.'' We have had a couple people talk on several occasions \nabout how bad what goes on in Nevada is. We are not going to go without \noffering a response to that. The time has come to offer that response.\n  The other thing that flabbergasts me about this is, we have people \nwho have come to Congress who say their No. 1 issue is to make sure \nthey protect States rights. States should be able to do what they want \nto be able to do. Well, we find a real problem with that sometimes. \nTake, for example, products liability legislation. I practice law. The \nState of Nevada had a different set of standards than did Utah, \nArizona, California, other States in the country. They are not all the \nsame. But we developed those standards over the years in the State of \nNevada. It is not right that Congress comes in and says: We are going \nto change them. We are going to have one standard system for everybody.\n  Well, that is what States rights is all about. It is not what States \nrights is all about in this instance. The State of Nevada made a \ndecision in 1932 that they were going to allow legal gambling. People \nshould leave the State of Nevada alone. There are no scandals involved \nin college betting in Nevada. We do our best to protect the integrity \nof what goes on there with strict requirements. Obtaining a gambling \nlicense in the State of Nevada is not a right; it is a privilege. They \nare very hard to get. Very strict scrutiny goes to anybody who can run \none of these sports books. I must say there is not much scrutiny given \nto the illegal bookings and charging of exorbitant fees, making all \nthis money, and having all this underreported income. It seems that \npeople should be happy with what Nevada has done on its own. It is a \nmatter of States rights. Why don't they leave us alone?\n  NCAA President Cedric Dempsey was quoted last year as estimating that \nillegal wagers would be closer to $4 billion a year. In Nevada, they \nwager about $60 million a year. That is a small part of $4 billion. So \nI hope people of goodwill--Democrats and Republicans--will look at this \nlegislation and try to understand how unfair it is and how it is going \nto only exacerbate a problem we have with people betting on college \ngames illegally. It won't make it better; it will make it worse.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier in the day, I was pointing out \nthat the pending business is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965. We are in the process of reauthorization and had more than 22 \nhearing days on that legislation. We had an extensive markup on that \nlegislation. We began debate in early May. Over the period of 6 days, \nwe had 2 days when we were not permitted to offer any amendments, and \nwe ended up with rollcalls on 7 amendments; 2 of those were virtually \nunanimous votes. On May 1, we had floor debate only. May 2, we had \nfloor debate only. On May 3, we had a Gorton amendment, changes in \nStraight A's, 98-0. A Democratic alternative, which was a completely \ndifferent approach, was the first major amendment. On May 8, a Collins \namendment was a voice vote, and on May 9, a Gregg amendment on \nteachers, 97-0. There were 8 amendments. We had 6 days of debate. Two \nwere debate only. We had only 7 rollcalls; 2 of those rollcalls were \nunanimously accepted.\n  I believe this is a matter of significant priority for the American \npeople. On the bankruptcy legislation, we had 16 days of debate and \nconsidered 55 amendments. With all respect to the importance of that \nparticular issue, it seems to me the issue of good quality education in \nK through 12, and the role we have on that issue, is of central \nimportance.\n  I am mindful that the majority leader himself said he believed this \nwas an important matter. He gave the assurances to the Senate going \nback to January 6, 1999:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. That is important.\n\n  January 29th, 1999:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to be just words.\n\n  Then on June 22, 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     the Congress this year.\n\n  In Remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:\n\n       We are going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I have been majority leader. . . . \n     And Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  February 3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  April 20, 2000: The majority leader said his top priorities in May \nincluded agriculture sanctions, Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills.\n  May 1, 2000:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  May 2, 2000: Senator Lott was asked on ESEA: Have you scheduled a \ncloture vote on that?\n\n       No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . But education \n     is number one in the minds of American people all across this \n     country and every State, including my own State. For us to \n     have a good, healthy and even a protracted debate and \n     amendments on education, I think, is the way to go.\n\n  That has been the end of it since May 2. Always something else has \ncome up. Always something else came up in May. Always something else \ncame up in June. Always something else came up in July.\n  It does seem, even with this week, we are now at 4 o'clock in the \nafternoon of a Tuesday. We could have had some debate on this on Monday \nor today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7522-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I made the \npoint earlier that we did have before the Senate the pending business, \nwhich is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It did seem, since \nit was the pending business, that under the rules generally, after the \ntime expires under morning business, we would go back to that \nlegislation.\n  I know the majority leader has attempted to work out a process with \nthe minority leader to move forward the business of the Senate. The \neducation bill has been the pending business since May of this year. \nThat has taken us through May, through June, and through July.\n  I still think we can complete the ESEA prior to recessing this week. \nIf we are unable to get agreement on these appropriations bills--I know \nthey are important and generally, as the year goes on, they receive a \nhigher priority, but it does seem to me that education has a high \npriority as well. I had thought we were going to have an opportunity to \ndeal with the education legislation during the evenings of last week. \nWe were unable to do so. We got caught up in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I am wondering whether the majority leader can give us any indication \nwhether he has an intention of getting back to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and, if so, when that might be because with the \nsuccessful motion the Senator has made and with the invoking of \ncloture, as I understand, the elementary and secondary education bill \nis returned to the calendar and will not be before the Senate as the \npending business. With those actions, we are returning the elementary \nand secondary education bill uncompleted to the calendar. It does seem \nto me to be a priority. I am wondering what assurances the leader might \nbe able to give us on the issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond to the Senator's questions \nand comments, he knows a major effort was made last Thursday evening to \ncome up with an agreement on how to proceed further on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  One of the problems we had then, and we continue to have, is Senators \non both sides of the aisle have nongermane, noneducation issues they \nwant to get into or, conversely, amendments they do not want to be \noffered. I know there had been some suggestion that maybe the NCAA \ngaming issue would be offered, and there was a feeling on the \nDemocratic side that should not be included in the package of what we \nproceed to consider.\n\n  There is at least one Senator on this side who is interested in being \nable to offer an IDEA amendment which, in fact, relates to education, \nbut there was resistance to that Senator being able to offer his \namendment.\n  Then it got into immigration, and we were close to working out an \nagreement that connected, in a way, this bill with H-1B. In the end, we \ncould not get the agreement. A lot of time was put in on that by \nSenators on both sides. Senator Daschle and I worked very hard on it. \nWe were up the hill, down the hill.\n  We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this \nyear and get it completed. I have another idea I am considering right \nnow that will get us back on it in a way that will actually get it to \ncompletion. That is my goal. I am not interested in only going back to \nit and playing games with it and having nongermane, noneducation issues \npoured on this bill. I want to stick to education. I think we can have \na good debate and a lot of amendments that are strictly related to \nelementary and secondary education. I realize the ingenuity of Senators \ncan stretch the idea of related amendments to education.\n  That is the way I would like to proceed. Right now we are having \ntrouble getting agreement to do appropriations bills and the \nintelligence authorization bill. I am even worried about being able to \ngo forward with the commitment to begin the proceedings on the China \nPNTR tomorrow, which I still hope to be able to do, but it is going to \ntake some concessions, again, as to how we proceed to get that done.\n  I will be glad to keep working with Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Reid, Senator Gregg, and Senator Ashcroft. I like the bill. I \nwould like to get it done. I would like to vote on it just as it is \nmyself. I do not think we need to fix it up anymore. It does not need \nmore bells and whistles. Let's just vote. I know others have \namendments, and we will try to find agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for one more observation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We do know children start back to school in late August \nand early September. Time is moving along. There were allocations of \nresources in appropriations bills where there has been absolutely no \nauthorization or statement of policy. It does seem to me that parents, \nschool boards, and schoolteachers are entitled to a full debate and \ndiscussion on these issues and for the Senate to work its will.\n  I appreciate what the Senator has said. I hope he understands we are \ngoing to continue to raise this issue as we move along because I do \nthink it is a top priority. The American families who have 58 million \nchildren in schools across this country are entitled to a response. I \nthank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Kennedy, and I thank Senator Domenici for \nallowing us to have an exchange. I know he is anxious to get his bill \ndone. It is an important bill, the energy and water appropriations \nbill. It means a great deal to our country. I know he is trying to find \na way to proceed.\n  At this point, this is the only option I have. I yield the floor so \nhe may comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I might suggest--and I do this in the \npresence of my good friend from Massachusetts; I wish the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Harry Reid, were here. I have an observation. \nMaybe I am 2 weeks ahead of time, but I believe the plan is that the \nDemocrats are not going to let us do anything of significance, \nliterally nothing, unless and until they get everything they want.\n  The truth is, for this little period in history--I have been here 28 \nyears, and\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nit is a small piece of that--the Republicans have controlled the Senate \nand the House. But the Democrats are bound and determined this year, in \nan election year, that we are not going to pass the regular \nappropriations bills, period. They call us ``do nothing,'' but they are \nobstructionists of the highest order.\n  I will just talk about one bill, then I will talk about the \nappropriations bill on education. I am just going to talk on one \nappropriations bill. We have heard from the beginning platitudes about \nworking together to get all the appropriations bills done. The \ndistinguished occupant of the chair has heard they want to get the \nInterior bill finished; they want to get the Treasury bill finished. \nFor the American people, these are the bills you have to pass every \nyear in order to keep certain big parts of our Government open. It \ncomes down to October 1st, and if they aren't passed, you get the \nPresident of the United States talking about who is closing down the \nGovernment.\n  I am going to refer to just the energy and water bill. I am going to \nbeg the Senator, the minority leader from the other side, in the same \nway he pleads with us to get something done that is right. This energy \nand water bill was not drafted by Senator Pete Domenici; it was drafted \nby Senator Pete Domenici and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who spends a \ngreat deal of time on the floor of the Senate and, I might say, for one \nwho worked with him for years before he got to spend all his time on \nthe Senate floor, he has been a very solid performer. I praise him for \nhis leadership on the floor. I believe he has been fair, and I believe \nhe has been nonpartisan. But I believe what he is seeing he can't even \nspeak about because right down deep in that Senator's mind and heart he \nknows it is wrong to hold up appropriations bills for the reasons being \nstated by his colleagues and his leader who compel him to do it.\n  This energy and water bill is being held up. We can't even bring it \nup because the minority leader wants a provision that is within it \ntaken out. He wants assurance we won't vote on it in the Senate. Who \nhas ever heard of that? Take a provision out of a bill that is in a \nbill that has been voted in by a committee. And if you want that bill \nto see the light of day in the Senate, you take out a provision and you \ndon't vote on it in the Senate.\n  I am not familiar with the contents or substance of the amendment, \nexcept it has to do with a dispute between the upper Missouri River and \nthe lower Missouri River. But it is most interesting, that the \nprovision that the minority leader speaks of has been in the \nappropriations bills at least two times. The President has signed it, \nand it has gone out of the Senate. Maybe something dramatically changed \nin the meantime, but it has been in the bill. It has been signed. Some \nwho know more than I say it has been in more than two times. I can tell \nthe Senate, since I have been writing this bill, it has been in 2 years \nin a row.\n  All of a sudden, it isn't enough to have an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate. The only thing that will suffice is that we take it out and \nagree not to vote on it. That means if you don't want to do that, you \ndon't get an energy and water bill for this fiscal year.\n  We are getting close because we still have to do this bill. It is \ndifferent from the House bill. We need to get some new resources \nassigned to the committee on the House side. We might not be able to \nmake it by the October deadline.\n\n  This little innocuous title, ``energy and water,'' is a very \nmisperceived title. Energy doesn't mean energy. Energy means all of the \nnuclear weapons programs in the nuclear laboratories in America. By a \nstrange coincidence, they are in the energy part of this bill. We have \nbeen asked by the Department of Energy to put $100 million in new money \nin that bill to take care of production facilities in three cities, \ncities such as Kansas City, Missouri; Amarillo, Texas; Oak Ridge, \nTennessee; and Aiken, South Carolina; where we have production \nfacilities that are desperately in need of repair. We have cleanup in \nthe State of the occupant of the chair that is ongoing because of our \nprevious nuclear weapons reactor work. We have hundreds of millions of \ndollars in for that kind of cleanup.\n  We have all the water projects and dredging projects and flood \nprotection programs in this country in this bill. We have all of the \nnational laboratories and their special effort and all their employees' \npay in this bill. I could go well beyond that.\n  Now I come to the conclusion: Why can't we take this bill up? \nFrankly, if ever there was an issue where there was something besides \nthis bill that somebody has in mind, I have not heard of it. This has \nto be as bad as it is. What is it?\n  Is there some political issue we don't understand that has nothing to \ndo with the fundamental needs this bill addresses in water, water \nsafety, in dams, in diversions, in the dredging of harbors and, over on \nthe nuclear side, all the safety programs for our nuclear weapons \ndesigns, for stockpile stewardship, which is an entire program aimed at \nmaking sure our nuclear bombs are safe and sound without us doing any \nunderground testing? We can't turn that on and off and say, wait an \nextra month, close down the buildings, close down the people for a \nmonth or so because we have a little problem about the Missouri River \nthat somebody doesn't even want to let you vote on. It is not a \nquestion of whether that provision is right or wrong, it is simply a \nquestion of whether you will vote on it.\n  I wonder, if we would have left it out and we would have brought it \nto the floor and this bill was rocking right along here on the floor \nand somebody offered an amendment to do just what the committee did \nbecause it had done it 2 years before, what would the response have \nbeen? Would it have been, you can't do the amendment and you can't move \non with the bill? I assume that would be the case. I think we would \nhave a chance of convincing Senators that is not right.\n  I understand there are some other appropriations bills that are being \nheld up. I am not aware of the specific reasons why, so I won't make \nthe same kind of argument or evidence the same kind of concern as I \nhave about the energy and water bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about getting our education \nprograms funded. We are talking about two things. We are talking about \nan elementary and secondary education authorization bill which has \ngotten tied up in all kinds of problems from both sides of the aisle on \namendments. When can we pass it? Can we get agreement?\n  But over there in those new offices beneath the Senate, that are \ncalled ``SC''--those offices out there that are really nice to work \nin--there is a whole batch of House Members. I was in there. I made up \na very large group of Senators working on the Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill. I just have a hunch, from the little bit \nI have participated, that the White House does not intend to sign that \nbill no matter what we do. We have already put in that bill resources \namounting to $106 billion, the largest appropriations for those \nfunctions in the history of the Republic.\n  In fact, there is now in that bill, to be spent on education and \nother things, $12 billion more than the Budget Committee contemplated. \nWhile our numbers aren't binding, the Senator who occupies the Chair \nknows we reported out a budget resolution, and we assumed all these \npieces would fit together. We assumed about $96 billion--$94 billion or \n$96 billion--for Labor, Health and Human Services. We have now gotten \nto the point where we have taken from others and we put $106 billion \nin.\n  From what I gather in that committee, there is little we can do to \nconvince the Democrats to be for that bill. My guess is if it rocks \nalong as it is, it is going to be a partisan bill, and then no matter \nwhat we try to do, the President is going to say, ``I want more,'' and \nthe President is going to say, ``It is not a good enough bill''; and he \nwill find some reasons to say it doesn't fund this enough or that \nenough. We are moving toward a real shipwreck. The issue is going to \nbe, at some point, why are we where we are when we come to that \nshipwreck point?\n  I am going to start today, and I will watch everything I can, and I \nwill come to the floor. But I am starting today taking just one bill \nand saying it would appear to me that on the energy and water bill, for \nsome political reason, we can't take it up, and as time passes and \nmoves on, whether or not we can get a bill and do all the things I have \nalluded\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\nto or not will be in the hands of the Democrats and the President, and \nthen we will see who is to blame.\n  I want to suggest that to the extent we are called ``a Senate that \ndoesn't do anything,'' I believe we have to put another mantra on \nsomebody else and we have to talk about the marvelous obstructionism \nthat is going on by the other side of the aisle. It is being done with \nsuch dignity, such ease, with such platitudes about ``we are all \nworking together,'' and ``we are trying to get there,'' and ``we are \nnot trying to delay things.'' It really is that, unless they get their \nway on everything, there will be nothing moving in the Senate.\n  Now I never saw it run quite like that, and I have never seen anyone \never win an argument on a claim that the other group wasn't doing \nanything. We will see how it comes out. In the meantime, we ought to \ntry to work together one more time, and I beg the minority leader on \nthis bill--it is $23 billion, not one of the biggest. I literally beg \nthat he reconsider and let us vote and let us have our 2 days of \ndebate. There are about five very serious problems in this bill that \nwill be debated. But they will be debated and done with, just as the \nMissouri River issue will be debated and finished if they will let us \ndo it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my mind has been reflecting on the fact that \nnow would be the time Senator Coverdell would come in. When we would \nhave a real problem, he would wander in and help bring everything \ntogether. As we know, that will not be the case. We attended Paul's \nfuneral on Saturday, and he is not here to help with the problems we \nare having here.\n  Let me just say to my friend, Senator Domenici, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, he is someone in this body who has great power. He is \nchairman of the Budget Committee, one of the senior members of the \nAppropriations Committee. He is chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, and he is someone with whom I have had the pleasure of \nworking for my entire time here in the Senate--on a very close basis in \nrecent years on Energy and Water. He has been chairman and I am the \nranking member. It has been our bill. He is right. The chairman always \nhas, as we know, a little more latitude, as he should have. But I have \nhad input on the bill, and I feel very comfortable with the bill we \nhave.\n  I say to my friend from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect, we have a problem with this bill that could be resolved just \nlike that. The fact of the matter is that no one is compelling me. We \nare all free agents in the Senate, and we have that right. We are \nelected in our home States, and while Senators are very persuasive in \nhelping us and trying to get us to go along with what they want, no one \ncompels us to do things, and they should not. In spite of the fact that \nthis is a good bill, I think it could be made better. I will not go \ninto detail, but I will explain the problems we have.\n  We have two leaders in the Senate, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. \nThey both do tremendously good work under very difficult circumstances. \nAn overused saying is that they both have a job of herding cats, trying \nto put jello in a bowl that doesn't have sides. They have a lot of \nproblems, and we understand that. Very rarely in legislative matters do \nwe have one of the leaders step forward.\n  The measure we have before us, the energy and water bill, is very \nimportant to this leader. There is a provision in it that is extremely \nbad for the upper Missouri basin States. One of those States, of \ncourse, is South Dakota. My friend from New Mexico stated--and \nrightfully so--that the provision is causing problems in the upper \nbasin States not only to the minority leader, but it has been in the \nbill two times, on two different bills. Of course it has. But the fact \nis that it was meaningless in the bills initially because what this is \nall about is the Fish and Wildlife Service rewriting a manual, \nreissuing and having a new manual. It was first issued before World War \nII ended, in the early 1940s. They did a little revision in the 1970s--\nminor revisions. So for almost 60 years they have had the same manual. \nThey have decided to rewrite it, and they are ready to publish this new \nmanual. What this legislation does is prevent them from doing so.\n  Well, the fact of the matter is that is wrong; it is bad. The \nlegislature should allow the administrative body to go forward and do \ntheir thing to control the Missouri River. The administrative agency is \nprevented from doing that. What Senator Daschle and others have said \nis: Take that provision out of the bill, and when that is taken out of \nthe bill, we will move forward on the legislation. This is a bill \ninvolving $23 billion, a very important bill. But this provision is \nsomething that should not prevent this bill from going forward. It \nshould be removed from the bill, and there are all kinds of different \nsteps. We are going to have conferences on this bill. We are going to \nrevisit it at that time.\n\n  Let me also say that the history of the Senate is such that the \ninterest of the minority is always protected. We talk about this great \ncountry of ours and we brag about our country, and we should do so. It \nis an imperfect country, but the best set of rules ever devised to rule \nthe affairs of men and women comes from the U.S. Constitution.\n  What is the Constitution all about? The Constitution is not about \nprotecting the rights of the majority; it is about protecting the \nrights of the minority. Where are those rights protected in our \nconstitutional framework more than any other place? It is in the \nSenate. That is why the small State of Nevada has as much right to do \nthings in this Senate--Senators Reid and Bryan--as do Senators Moynihan \nand Schumer from New York, or Boxer and Feinstein from California, even \nthough they have millions and millions more people than we have in the \nState of Nevada. That is what the Senate is all about. What Senator \nDaschle and others are trying to do with this bill is nothing that \nhasn't been done in centuries past, decades past.\n  So I say to my friend from New Mexico, take that out and we will move \nforward with this legislation and then deal with a few controversial \nissues. We don't have many controversial issues. This is a very good \nbill, and I think we can finish it in a day.\n  Let me also say this. We believe there should be certain rights \nprotected. Also under this Constitution, we have a situation that was \ndeveloped by our Founding Fathers in which Senators would give the \nexecutive branch--the President--recommendations for people to serve in \nthe judiciary. Once these recommendations were given, the President \nwould send the names back to the Senate and we would confirm or approve \nthose names.\n  One of the problems we are having here is it is very difficult to get \npeople approved, confirmed. We have one Senator from the State of \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, who for 1,300 days has been waiting to have a \nhearing for a very qualified, competent woman who wants to be confirmed \nand whose name has been sent to the White House by Senator Levin.\n  He wants a simple hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Senator \nHarkin from Iowa is also waiting for a nominee to be reported out of \nthe committee. We think that should be done. This has nothing to do \nwith the energy and water bill. It does, however, have something to do \nwith the other bills. We could have moved forward on the energy and \nwater bill on Friday until this glitch came up.\n  There is lots and lots of work to do around here. We believe it would \nbe extremely and vitally important to move the provision that allows \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service to publish its manual, and not have a \nlegislative roadblock for the management of the rivers in an \nappropriate fashion. The Fish and Wildlife Service is not for the upper \nbasin States or against the lower basin States. They try to be an \nimpartial ruler. That is what they are trying to do.\n  I say to my friend: Let the Fish and Wildlife Service go ahead and do \nwhat they need to do and get the energy and water bill brought before \nthis body.\n  Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow the cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed to the Treasury-Postal bill will ripen 1 hour after we convene. \nIs that correct?\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the 1 hour prior to the cloture vote, \na motion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation is in order tomorrow \nmorning. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we look forward to the majority leader \nmaking that motion, and filing cloture, as he indicated he would. We \nwill have to wait and see when that cloture vote occurs--either this \nweek or when we get back after the break.\n  I apologize for taking so much time. The Senator from Nevada wishes \nto speak, but the Senator from New Mexico would like to be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to respond. The Senator from \nNevada does so well that I was almost going to come over and sit beside \nhim and say he is right. The fact is, he is not right.\n  At this late stage--when he knows there is hardly a risk of our being \nable to get appropriations bills finished in a timely manner to keep \nthe Government open--to tie appropriations bills up because a judge has \nnot been appointed is not right. It might be that there is an argument \nabout the judicial appointment, but is it right in the waning days of \nCongress, when we have about 25 working days left, for somebody to come \nalong and say: Now it is my turn. I will not let any appropriations \nbills be approved by the Senate unless certain people are appointed to \nthe judicial and judge positions in this country? I think it is not.\n  Second, this is not a partisan issue. I don't know if it is a \nminority versus majority party issue, because I think in the final \nanalysis there are some people on that side of the aisle who would like \nto vote on their issue and who may not agree with the distinguished \nminority leader as to their interests for their respective States.\n  My last point is that we protect minority rights. But I wonder in \nthis case, when it is obvious that Missouri River upper and lower \ngroups are going to argue about this, if it is a question of protecting \nminority rights. It stands in the way of getting a vote on the issue. \nIf it is important enough to the upper Missouri that they think it is \nvery important but it is also similarly important to those on the lower \nMissouri, it would seem that the way to settle it is to let our \ncolleagues understand the issue--that is what this Senate is all \nabout--and let us vote. I don't quite understand why we can't vote. I \nwonder what is worrying people. The Senate expresses its views on many \nthings. It resolves disputes such as this regularly.\n  But, in this case until some future date, who knows when we will not \nbe permitted to express the collective Senate will by voting on this \nissue--which in 30 minutes could be known by all sides and all parties, \nand a good decision could be made by the Senate.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished occupant of the chair. Mr. \nPresident, I wish to change the focus of the discussion on the floor \nfrom the previous colloquy between the senior Senator from Nevada and \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7526-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7526-S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ILLEGAL WAGERING ON COLLEGE SPORTS\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback, took to the floor and argued on behalf of a piece of \nlegislation that would affect only my State and affect it in a very \nprofound and negative way. The ostensible purpose of the legislation I \nthink all of us can agree upon. I wish to put the discussion in context \nas I see it. We are talking about the illegal wagering on college \nsports, particularly wagering by underage college students, including \nstudent athletes. I think there is no disagreement that there is a \nserious problem and one that we recognize ought to be addressed in a \nvery serious way.\n  The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) testified before \nthe Commerce Committee, as they did before the National Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission (NGISC), that there are illegal student bookies on \nvirtually every college campus in the country, including some \nindividuals with links to organized crime. I do not disagree with that \nassessment. The matter is so serious that some students have actually \nbeen threatened with bodily harm to collect gambling debts owed to \nillegal student bookies. I do not disagree with that assessment.\n  The NCAA has known at least since the three-part investigative series \npublished by Sports Illustrated in 1995 that the illegal gambling \nproblem on America's college campuses was widespread and growing. A \nrecent University of Michigan survey found that nearly half of all male \nstudent-athletes nationwide--45 percent--gambled illegally on college \nand professional sports. A nationwide survey of NCAA Division I male \nbasketball and football student-athletes conducted for the NCAA by a \nUniversity of Cincinnati research team found that over one-fourth \ngambled in college sports. Sadly, a small number in each survey gambled \non games in which they played. They were wrong.\n  Beyond the broader issue of the extent to which student-athletes, and \nstudents generally, gamble on sports illegally, there are the troubling \ncases of improper influence being exerted on student-athletes by those \nwho seek financial gain from placing sports wagers on ``fixed'' games. \nThis reprehensible conduct has reared its ugly head on occasion since \nat least the 1940s, particularly in the context of college basketball.\n  While the NCAA's recent rhetoric leaves the impression that such \n``point-shaving'' or ``fixing'' of games is rampant, we can be thankful \nthat the record belies the rhetoric. The two recent scandals of this \ntype (those at Northwestern University and Arizona State University) \ntook place over five years ago in the mid-1990s. The integrity of \nvirtually all those who compete in college athletics is verified by the \nfact that there were a handful of such scandals in the 1990s out of the \nthousands of games played. While not a single sports bribery scandal \nshould be tolerated, we need to know why they occur and by what means. \nThe record is clear for those student-athletes who have violated the \ntrust of their teammates and school by engaging in illegal sports \nwagering. As a result of their illegal wagering, they put themselves in \ndebt to the point where they committed heinous acts of betrayal to pay \noff those debts to illegal bookies.\n  If merely passing laws prohibiting unregulated sports gambling were \nenough to stop it, the practice would not be so widespread today. \nSports gambling has been illegal for decades in almost every state, and \nCongress acted in 1992 to prevent states from adding sports-based games \nto their state lotteries. The same statute, the Professional and \nAmateur Sports Protection Act, also prohibits persons from engaging in \nsports-based wagering schemes, contests, and sweepstakes.\n  Similarly, wagering on sports of any kind, college or professional, \nis already a violation of NCAA bylaw 10.3. A review of the NCAA's \npublicly available computer database of rules infractions cases \nindicates that, as of 1998 (the last year for which cases are posted), \nenforcement of bylaw 10.3 is infrequent and spotty at best.\n\n  The database reveals that the NCAA brought only 23 enforcement \nactions against student-athletes from 1996 to 1998, even though the \nUniversity of Michigan and University of Cincinnati studies indicate \nthat thousands of violations occurred. In some of the 23 cases, the \nviolations centered on such routine practices as students wagering team \njerseys with each other. In the face of organized student bookmaking \noperations with links to organized crime handling large sums of cash \nwagers, such an enforcement ``strategy'' is at best misplaced.\n  Against this backdrop of a serious national problem with illegal \nsports gambling, the legislation to which I referred, S. 2340, takes \nthe very peculiar approach of targeting the only place in America where \nsports wagering is legal, regulated, policed, taxed, and confined to \nadults over age 21--the State of Nevada. Furthermore, the facts are \nthat legal wagering in Nevada amounts to only about one percent of all \nsports gambling nationwide, 99 percent of which is already illegal. The\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nNGISC estimated that illegal sports wagering in the United States \nranged from $80 billion to $380 billion annually. In contrast, legal \nsports wagering in the State of Nevada last year totaled approximately \n$2.5 billion, with roughly a third of that amount bet on college \nsporting events.\n  The central question then, which supporters of the legislation fail \nto answer adequately, is how does preventing adult tourists and \nconventioneers from placing sports wagers in Nevada affect what happens \non and off college campuses in the other 49 states. Each of the \nattempted answers to this central question is completely unpersuasive.\n  First, the central premise underlying this legislation is that \neliminating the small amount of legal sports wagering in Nevada will \ncause newspapers across the country not to publish betting lines or \npoint spreads, thereby curbing illegal gambling activity. This notion \nis further evidenced by the committee report accompanying S. 2340, the \nAmateur Sports Integrity Act, which states that ``. . . point spreads \nare generated for no other reason than to facilitate betting on college \nsports.'' It is important to note that neither the Commerce Committee \nnor the NGISC took testimony from newspapers to determine if in fact \nthey would cease publishing betting lines if sports gambling were made \nillegal in Nevada. Similarly, no testimony was taken to determine \nwhether illegal sports wagering would be reduced even if newspapers \nceased publishing this information. I made the point at the time of the \nhearing on S. 2340 that it's not too much to ask that such due \ndiligence be conducted before a legal industry and its employees are \nlegislated out of existence\n  Just recently the Newspaper Association of America broke their \nsilence and shared their thoughts on this legislative proposal, and, \nnot surprisingly, they completely refuted the primary argument put \nforth by the sponsors of this amendment. I'd like to share with my \ncolleagues the content of their letter to the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  This is a letter, dated June 7 of this year, addressed to the \nchairman and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Let me \nread the operative provisions:\n  If Congress prohibits gambling on college sports, NAS believes \nnewspapers will continue to have an interest in publishing point \nspreads on college games, since point spreads appear to be useful, if \nnot valuable, to newspaper readers who have no intention of betting on \ngames.\n  That is a pretty clear statement that this association, representing \nAmerica's newspapers, believes, notwithstanding any legislative \nprohibition, that newspapers in America will continue to publish these \npoint spreads on games.\n  The letter goes on to point out:\n  According to a national Harris Poll survey of 1,024 respondents \nconducted during April 7-12, 70 percent of respondents who read or look \nat point spreads on college sports do so to obtain information about a \nfavorite college team and to increase their knowledge about an upcoming \nsporting event. Only 11 percent of the respondents said that they read \nor look at point spreads on college sports to place a bet with a \nbookmaker. NAA believes that publication of point spreads provides \nuseful information to millions of newspaper readers, of whom 96 percent \nare 21 and over (MRI Spring 2000 Study).\n  Second, pointing the spotlight on published point spreads in \nnewspapers fails to acknowledge that an individual can obtain point \nspreads on college games through many different sources. These sources \ninclude sports talk shows on radio and television, magazines, toll-free \ntelephone services and the Internet. Illegal bookies on college \ncampuses and in the general population will continue to set the betting \nlines independent of any published point spread. Anyone who is intent \non placing bets on games can and will obtain point spreads, even if \nthey are not published in the newspaper.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Newspaper Association of America,\n\n                                         Vienna, VA, June 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Henry Hyde,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. John Conyers,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hyde and Congressman Conyers: The purpose of \n     this letter is to respond to your request for comment on H.R. \n     3575, the Student Athlete Protection Act, which prohibits \n     high school and college sports gambling in all States, \n     including Nevada, where gambling on college sports is \n     currently legal.\n       The Newspaper Association of America (NAA) is a nonprofit \n     organization representing more than 2,000 newspapers in the \n     U.S. and Canada. Most NAA members are daily newspapers, \n     accounting for 87 percent of the U.S. daily circulation.\n       NAA understands the concern Congress has with respect to \n     illegal sports gambling on college campuses, including the \n     existence of illegal bookmaking operations that involve \n     student-athletes as well as members of the general student \n     population. Our comments on the proposed legislation are \n     limited to an issue that has been raised concerning \n     publication of point spreads on college sporting events, and \n     whether a prohibition on gambling on college games will \n     persuade newspapers not to publish point spreads on these \n     games.\n       First, like all editorial decisions, the decision on \n     whether to publish point spreads for college sporting events \n     is made by each newspaper and the decision to publish or not \n     publish will vary from newspaper to newspaper. If Congress \n     prohibits gambling on college sports, NAA believes newspapers \n     will continue to have an interest in publishing point spreads \n     on college games, since point spreads appear to be useful, it \n     not valuable, to newspaper readers who have no intention of \n     betting on games.\n       According to a national Harris Poll survey of 1,024 \n     respondents conducted during April 7-12, 70 percent of \n     respondents who read or look at point spreads on college \n     sports do so to obtain information about a favorite college \n     team and to increase their knowledge about an upcoming \n     sporting event. Only 11 percent of the respondents said that \n     they read or look at point spreads on college sports to place \n     a bet with a bookmaker. NAA believes that publication of \n     point spreads provides useful information to millions of \n     newspaper readers, of whom 96 percent are 21 and over (MRI \n     Spring 2000 Study).\n       Second, pointing the spotlight on published point spreads \n     in newspapers fails to acknowledge that an individual can \n     obtain point spreads on college games through many different \n     sources. These sources include sports talk shows on radio and \n     television, magazines, toll-free telephone services and the \n     Internet. Illegal bookies on college campuses and in the \n     general population will continue to set the betting lines \n     independent of any published point spread. Anyone who is \n     intent on placing bets on games can and will obtain point \n     spreads, even if they are not published in the newspaper.\n       Finally, NAA applauds the sponsors of the legislation for \n     resisting the temptation to impinge upon constitutionally \n     protected freedoms of speech by proposing a prohibition on \n     the publication or dissemination of point spreads on college \n     games. Over the years, the Supreme Court consistently has \n     recognized that a consumer's interest in the free flow of \n     information ``may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his \n     interest in the day's most urgent political debate.'' \n     Virginia State Bd Of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer \n     Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 763 (1976). We commend you and your \n     colleagues for being particularly sensitive to maintaining \n     the free flow of information, which citizens of this country \n     have come to expect and enjoy.\n       NAA appreciates the opportunity to comment on this \n     legislation before your committee.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                    John F. Stern,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the NCAA has threatened for years to deny \nNCAA-sponsored tournament press credentials to newspapers that publish \nlines, but they have never done so. These hollow threats are further \nevidence of the futility of this exercise.\n  Secondly, we have been told that this legislation, while admittedly \nno panacea, will ``send a message'' to students and others that sports \ngambling is illegal. Again, there is a complete absence of any \nempirical evidence or fact-based testimony that America's college \nstudents, or adults for that matter, will heed such a so-called \n``message.'' By this logic, we should reinstate Prohibition on serving \nalcohol to adults over the age of 21 to ``send a message'' to minors \nabout drinking and to reduce binge drinking by underage students on \ncollege campuses. The absurdity of such an approach is self-evident, \nand it applies with equal force to this legislation.\n  The real message that this legislation will send is that shirking \nresponsibility and pointing fingers at others is the appropriate manner \nin which to handle a serious national problem. Everyone should agree \nthat a problem so pervasive on college campuses should\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\nbe addressed comprehensively and with a serious commitment from the \nNCAA and its member institutions, including federal requirements \nenshrined in appropriate legislation.\n  While we heard considerable rhetoric at our Commerce Committee \nhearing concerning what the NCAA intends to do about illegal gambling \non college campuses, there was very little testimony concerning what \nconcrete steps at NCAA has taken to date. For example, the chairman of \nthe NCAA's executive committee testified that during the ten years he \nhas served as president of his university, he could not recall a single \ncase of a student being expelled or otherwise disciplined for illegal \ngambling, even though he acknowledged there are illegal student bookies \non his campus.\n  We are repeatedly told by the sponsors of this legislation that the \nNCAA has plans to set up its anti-gambling initiatives. The facts belie \nthe accuracy of those assurances. For example, the NCAA's total \noperating revenue for 1998-99 was $283 million. Within the overall \nbudget, there was a line item for ``sports agents and gambling'' that \nequaled $64,000. Similarly, the line item for 1999-2000 is $139,000 out \nof revenue of $303 million. Only three of nearly 300 NCAA employees are \nassigned to gambling issues, and those persons have other \nresponsibilities in addition to illegal sports gambling.\n  The NCAA's own presentations to the NGISC and in other venues \nindicate that there are many other important steps that should be \ntaken, beyond what this legislation would do, to address the problem of \nillegal gambling on college campuses. The NCAA and its members have \nfailed to follow through on the very steps they recommended to the \ncommission just one year ago. For example, much was made at our hearing \nabout the NCAA's use of a new public service announcement during the \ntelecast of the men's basketball tournament. There was little evidence \nthat this PSA was shown either frequently or during times of maximum \naudience exposure. Furthermore, there is no indication that the NCAA \nfollowed the recommendation of the NGISC and specifics PSA commitments \nbe written into the NCAA's television contracts. A $6 billion, 11-year \ndeal for the television rights to the men's ``March Madness'' \nbasketball tournament was signed by the NCAA with CBS Sports after the \nNGISC made this recommendation in its Final Report.\n  There is a serious need for a combination of enforcement, education, \nand counseling initiatives to address illegal gambling by high school \nand college students. Unfortunately, the Commerce Committee took no \ntestimony from those individuals on campus, in our states, and at the \nFederal level who are charged with enforcing the laws that already make \nthis activity illegal. Similarly, we heard very little from \nprofessionals whose job it is to educate students about the dangers of \ngambling abuse and to counsel those who suffer from such problems.\n  Finally, while this bill directly impacts Nevada, let me suggest to \nmy colleagues we should be alarmed by the precedent that would be \nestablished if this bill becomes law. For over 200 years the Federal \nGovernment has deferred to the State to determine the scope and type of \ngaming that should be permitted within their borders. The Professional \nand Amateur Sports Protection Act preempted that authority as it \nrelates to sports wagering, but only prospectively. If Congress sees \nfit to overturn Nevada's sports wagering statutes that have been on the \nbooks for many decades, it sets a dangerous precedent that should be \ncause for concern for the other 47 States with some form of legal \ngaming operations.\n  We all agree as to the serious nature of the problem. Unfortunately, \nthe legislative proposal will do nothing to address that issue.\n  As I have said during my testimony before the Commerce Committee, \nthis legislation is an illegal bookie's dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before my friend from Nevada leaves the \nfloor, I intend to make a couple of comments on his statement. One of \nthe most valued members of the committee is Senator Bryan from Nevada.\n  Senator Reid and I came to the House of Representatives together many \nyears ago. I consider us to have a very warm and excellent relationship \nover many years.\n  I will miss Senator Bryan very much as he leaves--not only the Senate \nbut as a much valued member of our committee. Coincidentally, on the \nissue of sports, Senator Bryan and I were able to work together on a \ncouple of boxing issues that a lot of our Members did not care much \nabout. But hopefully we were able to assist some people who come from \nthe lowest economic rung of our society and prevent, at least to some \ndegree, the exploitation to which many of them are subjected.\n  I preface my comments with a brief response to both Senators from \nNevada. Again, I say that with respect and affection.\n  I did not invent this legislation, nor did it come from any Member of \nthis body. It came as a result of the National Gaming Impact Study \nCommission, a commission that met for a long time and came up with this \nstrong recommendation. Then the issue was picked up by the NCAA \ncoaches. Some of the most respected men and women in America, \nobviously, are our college coaches, people of the level of Dean Smith, \nJoe Paterno, Jim Calhoun, and so many others who have made this a high \nvisibility and important issue, at least to them, including the \npresidents of the colleges and universities across the country.\n  I will not rebut their comments or try to respond to all the comments \nmade by Senator Bryan, except to say I respect his view. But I do \nbelieve there is a compelling case that has been made, not by this \nMember but by the college coaches and the university presidents who say \nthis is placing these young--as Coach Calhoun called them--kids in the \npath of temptation that is something that could be very unhealthy for \nthem.\n\n  So I respect the views of my friends from Nevada. I hope we will have \na vigorous debate on this issue, and hopefully we will be able to \naddress it one way or another. But I do believe it is an issue of some \nimportance, at least if you believe those who are closest to these \nyoung men and women, our college athletes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will just acknowledge his very generous comments. I \nappreciate that.\n  Let me respond in turn. I have been privileged and honored to serve \nin that committee with him as chairman. We have worked on many, many \nissues, not only the athletic issues which we have addressed, but both \nof our respective jurisdictions are going to enjoy expanded air service \nas a result of his leadership, providing nonstop service to the \nNation's Capital from our respective States. So I assure him my \ncomments are in no way intended to be personal to him. It is a \ndifference of opinion. The Senator from Arizona, who is a tenacious \nadvocate and fearless defender of his own State, can understand the \nSenator from Nevada obviously has serious concerns. They are honest \ndifferences of opinion with the Senator from Arizona. I wanted to state \nthat for the Record.\n  Again, I thank him for his very generous comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Bryan. I will come to the floor sometime \nin September to chronicle his many accomplishments and the admiration \nand heartfelt affection I have for Senator Bryan. But at the moment I \nsay we will respectfully disagree. I think we will have both an \ninteresting and, I hope, illuminating discussion of what has become, in \nthe eyes of many, an important issue. I thank Senator Bryan for his \nkind remarks. I will miss him, although I want to make it clear that he \nis not departing this Earth. In fact, he may be going to a much more \nrewarding and comfortable lifestyle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7528-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7528-S7530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SITUATION IN FIJI\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let us imagine for a moment that a ragtag \ngroup of armed rebels in Australia was able to infiltrate the \nparliament in Canberra and put a gun to the head of the Australian \nPrime Minister. Let us imagine that these rebels, led by a failed \nindigenous businessman who claimed to speak for the native people and \nagainst those of European descent who had ``colonized'' the island, \nheld\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\nthe Prime Minister and members of his government hostage for several \nmonths in the Parliament building. Let us also imagine that, during \nthis period, central government authority across Australia withered as \narmed gangs set up roadblocks, occupied police stations and military \nbarracks, torched homes and businesses owned by those with different \nancestry, seized tourist resorts, and generally terrorized innocents \nacross the country.\n  What would America's response be to such a violent takeover of a \ndemocratic government and the abduction of its prime minister by race-\nbaiters who proclaimed that under their ``new order,'' there would be \nno place in government or, indeed, in society for those with different \nethnic roots, and who reveled in the armed chaos they had inspired? At \na minimum, I would expect the United States to impose tough sanctions \non the illegitimate regime; mobilize our allies in Asia and at the U.N. \nSecurity Council to speak forcefully and with one voice against the \ncoup; and join like-minded nations in resolutely affirming that the \ncountry in question would suffer lasting isolation and international \ncondemnation until constitutional governance and the rule of law were \nrestored.\n  Unfortunately, this scenario is playing out as we speak in \nAustralia's neighbor Fiji, an island nation in the South Pacific that \nis home to some of the warmest, most gentle people I have had the \npleasure of meeting. George Speight, an ethnic Fijian and failed \nbusinessman, led a coup on May 19 that toppled Fiji's democratically \nelected government and its first Indo-Fijian prime minister, Mahendra \nChaudhry. Speight, whom the Economist calls a ``classic demagogue,'' is \nutterly disdainful of democracy, law, and Fijians of Indian descent, \nwho constitute 44 percent of their nation's population.\n  If Speight has his way, democratic rule, racial harmony, and basic \njustice in Fiji have no future, and nearly half of Fiji's people, \ndisenfranchised by the coup, will have been relegated to the status of \nsecond-class citizens and unwitting hostages of a government that \nabhors them for the color of their skin. As Speight bluntly puts it:\n\n       There will never be a government led by an Indian, ever, in \n     Fiji. Constitutional democracy, the common-law version--that \n     will never return.\n\n  The hostages, including the deposed Prime Minister, have been \nreleased, and Speight's forces have apparently cut a deal with Fiji's \nmilitary and traditional leaders for the composition of a new \ngovernment--a government led by an ailing figurehead controlled by the \ncoup leader. The new cabinet will be comprised exclusively of ethnic \nFijians, with the sole official of Indian descent relegated to a non-\ncabinet post as one of two assistant ministers for multi-ethnic \naffairs. The country's multi-racial constitution has been officially \nscrapped in favor of a document being prepared by the new government \nthat ``is almost certain to reduce Indo-Fijians to political \nfootnotes,'' in the words of one observer. The economy, and the tourist \nindustry that sustains it, are in shambles.\n  Democracy is dead in Fiji. Rule by law has succumbed to the law of \nthe jungle and one man, in league with armed criminals, has personally \ndestroyed a successful experiment in representative, multi-ethnic rule. \nThe United States must stand firm in our absolute refusal to ratify the \nresults of a coup that ended democratic governance in Fiji. We cannot \nand shall not condone the violent establishment of a government and a \nconstitution predicated on racial exclusion. We should be prepared to \nsuspend what little amount of assistance we provide to Fiji if the \ngovernment remains intransigent. More importantly, we and our allies in \nAsia and Europe should make clear that Fiji will remain isolated until \nthe interim government in Suva establishes a clear blueprint for a \nreturn to democratic rule by an administration that does not include \nGeorge Speight and his criminal allies. We cannot compromise on the \nprinciple that the Indo-Fijians who constitute nearly half of their \nnation's population must once again have a voice in its affairs.\n  The haunting words of an ethnic Fijian social worker vividly capture \nthe agony of a nation that many people believe to be as close to \nparadise as can be found on this Earth. He laments: ``Fiji was such a \nnice place. We promoted it as `the way the world should be.' Now it is \nthe devil's country.''\n  Let us use the resources at our disposal as a great and moral nation \nto oust this devil and return Fiji's government to all of its people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an editorial from the July \n19th edition of the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Goodbye to Fiji'' be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have two additional comments.\n  There is a lot of unrest in Asia today. Indonesia is ridden with \nethnic strife, a very important country that is the largest Moslem \ncountry in the world and one whose fortunes, economically and \nethnically, have declined severely.\n  The Solomon Islands, an area where American blood was shed many years \nago, has been mistreated by ethnic strife and armed gangs taking over \nand lawlessness and banditry being the order of the day there.\n  In Fiji, we see, again, ethnic unrest that is harmful not only to the \ncountry, but the people who are most affected first will be the poorest \npeople in Fiji, many of them the ethnic Fijians whose livelihood is \ngained from the now disappearing tourist industry.\n  Finally, the United States has a special obligation as the world's \nleader. I think we as Americans are most proud that, following World \nWar II, we began to redress some of the wrongs we had inflicted on some \nof our own fellow citizens. After a titanic civil rights struggle, we \nare at least on the path to assuring equality for all in this great \nNation of ours. For us to sit by and watch an ethnic group be subjected \nto a constitution and rulers that place them in a permanent inferior \nstatus, flies in the face of everything the United States has stood for \nand, clearly, in our assertion that all men and women are created equal \nand endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\n  I hope the administration, the American people, and those of our \nallies, in Asia and all over the world, including at the United \nNations, will do whatever they can to restore equality and equal \nopportunity in this very lovely island.\n  It is important for me to note that I visited this beautiful country \non several occasions, which is one reason why I have a very special \nfeeling for it and a special sense of sadness because it is a beautiful \ncountry filled with very gentle people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            Goodbye to Fiji\n\n       Say goodbye to Fiji, and say it soon. The country is going \n     rapidly down the tubes.\n       Two months ago, Fiji wasn't such a bad place. It ambled \n     along at a South Pacific pace. The locals were laid back and \n     well fed, and prone to a languor induced by regular cups of \n     kava, the narcotic beverage of preference in those parts. \n     Tourists flocked in from Australia and New Zealand, attracted \n     to resorts with names like Buca Bay, Rukuruku and Turtle \n     Island, where ``The Blue Lagoon''--an execrable film that \n     launched the cinema career of Brooke Shields--was shot 20 \n     years ago. In a nutshell, Fiji was so serene that even \n     honeymooners from the American Midwest were not ruffled by \n     the grueling journey it took to get there.\n       All that changed on May 19, when a man called George \n     Speight barged into parliament with a throng of thugs and \n     took Mahendra Chaudhry. the Prime Minister, hostage--along \n     with most of the country's cabinet. They were released only \n     last week, and have all been stripped of office.\n       Mr. Speight is an ethnic Fijian, of Melanesian stock, and \n     Mr. Chaudhry is of Indian descent, as is 44 percent of the \n     country's population. The former maintains that he was acting \n     in the interests of the Melanesian majority, who constitute \n     just over half of all Fijians. The Indians, he declares, are \n     ``the exploiters'' and ``the enemy.'' Unabashedly racial in \n     his vision of Fiji, he insists on the permanent exclusion of \n     Indians from government office. He calls also for curbs on \n     the commercial mobility of Indians, who control a lion's \n     share of the Fijian economy.\n       The Indians, cast as ``outsiders'' by Mr. Speight, are \n     descended from indentured plantation workers who were brought \n     to the archipelago by the colonial British administration a \n     century ago. Most Indians are fourth-generation Fijians. From \n     where we stand, that makes them no less entitled to all the \n     rights of citizenship--whether political or commercial--than \n     an ethnic Fijian might be.\n       Mr. Speight doesn't see things that way. Neither, alas, \n     does Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs, a body of tribal elders \n     that enjoys ill-defined, but very real, powers under the \n     country's racially skewed customary law. To their discredit, \n     the chiefs have given their\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\n     imprimatur to Mr. Speight's objectives, as have sections of \n     the armed forces.\n       The country's interim prime minister, appointed by the army \n     chief while Mr. Chaudhry was hostage, last week unveiled a \n     ``Blueprint'' for the ``protection'' of indigenous Fijians. \n     The document comprises an ill-judged plan for commercial \n     affirmative action, designed to ``advance the interests of'' \n     the country's ethnic majority. Indians are to be excluded in \n     areas where they are ``over-represented,'' and ethnic Fijians \n     are to get preferential royalties, subsidies, tax breaks, \n     rents and licenses.\n       The problem with this ethnic gravy train, of course, is \n     that Fiji will soon run out of gravy. The sugar industry, \n     manned by Indians, is in disarray. Tourism, which contributes \n     $235 million per annum to the economy--and which is second \n     only to sugar in Fiji's economic schema--has ground to a \n     jarring halt. After the recent invasions of luxury resorts by \n     knife wielding ``traditional landowners,'' it's hard to see \n     those Aussies, Kiwis and Midwestern honeymooners coming back. \n     A flight of disenfranchised Indo-Fijians to Australia and New \n     Zealand is under way. This will drain Fiji of its best \n     technical and entrepreneurial stock.\n       Mr. Speight and his cohorts will learn swiftly that running \n     an economy is a lot harder than storming a parliament. Theirs \n     is no more than a blueprint for economic suicide.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nArizona, for his remarks in regard to this challenge, especially as it \nrelates to the South Pacific.\n  Today, we have received very troublesome information about parts of \nIndonesia where there is this kind of tension which is threatening the \npeace, well-being, and the capacity of individuals to exercise their \nown religious beliefs in ways they see fit. This troublesome disorder \nis to be noted and understood, and we should speak out on it. I thank \nthe Senator from Arizona for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7530-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7530-S7531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE MISSOURI RIVER SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something \ncloser to home for me. Perhaps one of the most important things that \nhas ever been known or understood in the economy of Missouri is the \nMissouri River. It is part of the lifeblood of our State. It transports \ncommerce from one part of the State to another and from our State down \nthrough the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and around the world.\n  There are some troublesome issues regarding the flows in the Missouri \nRiver. They relate to the energy and water appropriations bill which \nincludes specific measures relating to language in this year's bill \nthat is identical to language found in previous bills.\n  Under normal Senate procedure once a committee acts and reports out a \nbill, the bill comes to the floor, and if a Senator does not like a \ncertain provision in the bill, then that Senator has the right to move \nto strike that position. That is a guaranteed right.\n  However, it appears that one of the provisions, which is totally \nconsistent with language that has been in previous bills regarding \nflows in the Missouri River system, is not to the liking of some \nindividual Senators. In particular, the minority leader has indicated \nhis opposition to Section 103. Senator Daschle has done what he could \nto prevent debate on this section, and has worked to make sure the bill \ndoes not come to the floor at all.\n  That is a harsh and inappropriate way for us to act. If any Senator \ndoes not like a provision, then that Senator can move to strike the \nprovision, and the Senate can vote on such a motion. Unfortunately, \nthis election to stall; to interrupt the progress and business of the \nSenate; to say we do not want to allow a bill to come to the floor as \nit was reported by the committee and as it has come year after year is \na way to interrupt the business of the Senate, is inappropriate.\n  I was pleased that earlier this afternoon the majority leader filed a \ncloture motion on the energy and water appropriations measure, but it \nis unfortunate that he had to do so. I regret the majority leader had \nto take such action, but because the Democrats insisted on stalling the \nnormal legislative process, such action was necessary.\n  The Missouri River and the Mississippi River are the two most valued \ntreasures of Missouri citizens. They are essential for not only \ntransportation in our State but about 40 percent of all the people in \nour State get their drinking water out of those rivers. They are \nimportant for irrigation and for cost-efficient transportation.\n  I have had the privilege through the decades of fighting to protect \nthat resource, not only for human consumption but for transportation as \nwell. As attorney general, I was involved in litigation that went all \nthe way to the Supreme Court. I was pleased to be part of that, to be a \nmoving factor in that litigation which protected our waterflows at that \ntime in the river.\n  I watched as the Missouri River, when it had inadequate flows, \nparalyzed a community. I remember years ago when I was Governor, an ice \nbridge developed. This was a natural impairment of the flow north of \nMissouri in the river and north of the city of St. Joseph. Instead of \nthe water flowing down, the ice jam backed up the water.\n  The river levels fell and a great city such as St. Joseph, MO, was \nwithout water. When I went to look at the water intake facility for St. \nJoseph, I noticed the water was a foot or two below the intake. We \nworked night and day to get a new pump and a new system of drawing \nwater out of the river. Proper river flows are essential to the well-\nbeing of our State.\n  In the committee report of the energy and water appropriations bill, \nSection 103 prohibits the expenditure of resources to diminish the flow \nor to otherwise tamper with the flow of the river because the river \nflows are so essential to the well-being of our State. The Corps' plan \nfor rewriting the way the river will be managed is known as the \nMissouri River Master Manual. It would send additional surges of water \ndown in the spring, which would cause flooding, and withhold additional \nwater in the fall, which would cause low levels in the river.\n  If you make the level of the river low in the fall, the crop which \nhas been grown can't be shipped as efficiently when there is inadequate \nriver flow for transportation. Of course, you may not have a crop to \nship if in the spring you release so much water that you cause \nwidespread flooding. This flooding potential concerns many of our \ncommunities. I have worked closely with the rest of the Missouri \ndelegation in the Congress, the Missouri Farm Bureau, and the Mid-\nAmerica Regional Council 2000. We uniformly oppose management of the \nriver in a way that would cause flooding in the Spring, and then a \nrestriction of the flow of the river in the fall which would make \nimpossible the kind of transportation upon which our farm, \nagricultural, and other industries must rely.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recently recommended to the \nArmy Corps of Engineers a spring pulse or spring rise on the Missouri \nRiver. This recommendation is irresponsible and dangerous. The U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service wants to do this because it is interested in \nimproving environmental conditions for certain species of fish and \nbirds. We all are concerned about fish and birds, the shorebirds, the \npiping plover, and the shark-like pallid sturgeon fish. But this \nprotection should not come at the expense of the lives of thousands of \npeople living downstream.\n  Section 103 to H.R. 4733, forbids any funding in the bill from being \nused to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual to allow \nfor an increase in the springtime water release program during the \nspring heavy rainfall and snowmelt period in the States. This spring \nrelease, or spring rise, or spring pulse would be dangerous for all \ncitizens living and working downstream from Gavins Point, located on \nthe border of Nebraska and South Dakota.\n  It normally takes about 12 days for water to travel from Gavins Point \nto St. Louis. During the spring, weather in the Midwest is especially \nunpredictable. It is usually said if you don't like the weather, just \nwait a bit. If it is that unpredictable, especially in the spring, it \nis very difficult to correctly predict the weather for a 12-day period. \nAnd if you are going to send a big pulse of water down the river and \nthen, as you are in the process of doing so, there is a substantial \nrainstorm or series of storms that develop, the very purpose of \nrestricting flooding and providing a basis for reasonable flow in the \nriver is defeated. If you are already sending a charge of water down \nthe\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\nriver that is closer to the capacity of the river, any additional rain \nfrom nature would create widespread flooding in the downstream \ncommunities.\n  The combination of a spring rise and a heavy rain during the 12-day \nperiod would increase greatly the chances for downstream flooding. The \nspring rise would come at a time of the year when downstream citizens \nare the most vulnerable to flooding. The Corps' plan provides less \nflood control and less navigability than the current plan, thus it \nshould not be imposed.\n  I oppose the Corps' plan for rewriting the Missouri River Master \nManual, and I call on the Corps to adopt a plan that better suits a \nbalance among water uses. If the President decides, after we have \npassed the bill with this same provision in it that we have had in it \nfor the last several years, to veto it, it is his prerogative. But what \nthat tells the citizens of the lower Missouri basin is that the \nClinton-Gore administration is willing to flood downstream midwestern \ncommunities. It is that simple. Section 103 provides the necessary \nprotection for all citizens downstream from the Gavins Point Dam who \nlive and work along the banks of the Missouri River.\n\n  In closing, each Senator is entitled to his or her opinion on any \npiece of legislation, but the Senator should understand that that \nopinion should be reflected in the legislative process with \nopportunities to strike. That opinion should not be expressed by \nkeeping legislation reported by committees from coming to the floor. We \nsimply want to debate section 103 and any motion with regard to this \ncommonsense provision. We are willing to live by the will of the Senate \nin determining what should be the outcome. We believe the availability \nof this legislation should not be curtailed, especially since it \nincludes identical language found in the last several years of this \nsame energy and water appropriations. As a matter of fact, it is the \nwill of the committee which has sent it to the floor.\n  With that in mind, I look forward to working to protect the interests \nof Missouri citizens, to protect them against flooding in the spring \nand to protect the output and available water resources for a flow \nwhich will support navigation in the fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7531-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7531-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not on the Senate floor to \nhear Chairman Hatch earlier this afternoon. I was attending an \nimportant confirmation hearing and chairing a meeting of the bipartisan \nInternet Caucus. I spoke to the issue of judicial nominations last \nFriday and say, again, with 60 current and longstanding vacancies \nwithin the federal judiciary, and seven more on the horizon, we cannot \nafford to stop or slow down the little progress we are making.\n  Our hearing today included three nominees moved forward to fill \npositions on the District Court of Arizona that have all been declared \njudicial emergencies. Each of the nominees was nominated last Friday. \nThey are now having their hearing, they look forward to being voted out \nof committee on Thursday and approved by the Senate before the week is \nout--within one week of nomination. This demonstrates what we can do \nwhen we want to take action. All the talk about needing six months or \nmore to process and review nominees is just that--talk. If all goes \naccording to schedule, these nominees will be in and out of the Senate \nin less than one week.\n  We could do that with a number of nominees. Instead, this is a Senate \nthat has kept highly-qualified nominees, such as Richard Paez and \nMarsha Berzon, waiting for years before they get a vote. There is just \nno reason to have a qualified nominee like Judge Helene White of \nMichigan held hostage for over 42 months without a hearing.\n  I am disappointed to have seen another hearing come and go without \neven one nominee to fill one of the many vacancies to the Courts of \nAppeals around the country. I was encouraged to hear Senator Lott \nrecently say that he continues to urge the Judiciary Committee to make \nprogress on judicial nominations. The Majority Leader said: ``There are \na number of nominations that have had hearings, nominations that are \nready for a vote and other nominations that have been pending for quite \nsome time and that should be considered.'' He went on to note that the \ngroups of judges he expects us to report to the Senate will include \n``not only district judges but circuit judges.'' Unfortunately, the \nCommittee has not honored the Majority Leader's representations and was \nonly willing to consider a few District Court nominees at today's \nhearing. Pending before the Committee are a dozen nominees to the \nFederal Courts of Appeals who are awaiting a hearing--12 nominees, not \none of which the Republican Majority saw fit to include in this \nhearing. Left off the agenda are Judge Helene White of Michigan, who is \nnow the longest pending judicial nomination at over 42 months without \neven a hearing; Barry Goode, whose nomination to the Ninth Circuit was \nthe subject of Senator Feinstein's statements at our Committee meeting \nlast Thursday and who has been pending for over two years; as well as a \nnumber of qualified minority nominees whom I have been speaking about \nthroughout the year, including Kathleen McCree Lewis of Michigan, \nEnrique Moreno of Texas and Roger Gregory of Virginia.\n  I noted for the Senate last Friday that there continue to be multiple \nvacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of \nColumbia Circuits. With 20 vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly \nhalf of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court \nsystem. I know how fond our Chairman is of percentages, so I note that \nthe vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 11 percent \nnationwide. Of course that vacancy rate does not begin to take into \naccount the additional judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference \nto handle their increased workloads. If we added the 11 additional \nappellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. \nBy comparison, the vacancy rate at the end of the Bush Administration, \neven after a Democratic Majority had acted in 1990 to add 11 new \njudgeships for the Courts of Appeals, was only 11 percent. Even though \nthe Congress has not approved a single new Circuit Court \nposition within the federal judiciary since 1990, the Republican Senate \nhas by design lost ground in filling vacancies on our appellate courts.\n\n  At our first Judiciary Committee meeting of the year, I noted the \nopportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy \ncrisis in our nation's federal courts. I believed that a confirmation \ntotal of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the \neffort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to \nbe done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a \nnumber of outstanding nominations to the Court of Appeals, including \nqualified minority and women candidates.\n  Yet only five nominees to the appellate courts around the country \nhave had nomination hearings this year and only three of those five \nhave been reported by the Committee to the Senate and confirmed--only \nthree all year. The Committee included no Court of Appeals nominees at \nthe hearings on April 27 and July 12, and there are no Court of Appeals \nnominee at the hearing today. The Committee has yet to report the \nnomination of Allen Snyder to the District of Columbia Circuit, \nalthough his hearing was 11 weeks ago, or the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her hearing was eight weeks \nago. The Republican candidate for President talks about final Senate \naction on nominations within 60 days and we cannot get the Committee to \nreport some nominations within 60 days of their hearing.\n  There is no good reason to have a qualified nominee such as Judge \nHelene White of Michigan held hostage for over 42 months without a \nhearing--42 months, and she has not even gotten a hearing. We had two \nmen who were nominated last Friday, and they had a hearing today. They \nwill probably be confirmed this week. Helene White has been held \nhostage for over 42 months without a hearing. She is the record holder \nfor judicial nominees who have had to wait for a hearing--and her wait \ncontinues. It is insulting to the people of Michigan, insulting to the \ncourt, and insulting to her. The people of Michigan deserve a vote up \nor down on this outstanding lawyer and Judge from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\n  Now why do I keep mentioning this? I keep mentioning it because, \nfrankly, we are doing a poor job in confirming judges. I compare this \nto the last year of President Bush's term. We had a Democratic majority \nin the Senate. We confirmed twice as many judges then as this Senate is \nconfirming now with a Republican majority and a Democratic President. \nSomething was said the other day that, well, the Democrats are in the \nminority, and that is probably why they complain so. Well, heavens, I \nwould be happy to have the complaints of the Republicans when they were \nin the minority. The Democrats moved twice as many judges for a \nRepublican President as Republicans are moving for a Democratic \nPresident. It is a simple fact.\n  The soon-to-be presidential nominee of the Republican Party has \nsaid--and I agree with him--that this is wrong, the Senate ought to \nvote these people up or down in 60 days. Of course, we could do that. \nThere is a concern that has been expressed--and rightly so--that so \nmany nominees are held without any vote. Nobody votes against them, but \nnobody gets an opportunity to vote for them; they just sit there. And \neven though the criticism stings, the fact is that, on average, women \nand minorities take longer to go through this Senate than white males \ndo. Some women, some minorities have gone through very quickly, but \nmost have taken longer.\n  I said earlier that I do not see any sense of bias or sexism in our \nchairman. I have known him for over 20 years, and I have never heard \nhim make a biased remark or a sexist remark during that whole time. But \nsomething is happening, somewhere they are being held up. It is wrong. \nOne of the things that most Republicans and Democrats ought to be able \nto agree on is what Governor Bush said: Do it and vote them up or down \nin 60 days. Let's make a decision.\n  Some of these people got held up for 2 or 3 or 4 years. When they \nfinally got a vote, they passed overwhelmingly. But for 2 or 3 or 4 \nyears they were humiliated, caused to dangle, have their law practices \nfall apart, have people question what was going on. Why? Because one or \ntwo Senators thought they should be held up. Well, let those one or two \nSenators vote against them. We are paid to vote yes or no, not maybe. I \ndo not know whether it is because they are women, because they are \nHispanic, because they are too liberal, or too conservative, too \nactive, not active enough, that people don't want them to be confirmed. \nLet them vote against them.\n\n  I argued, when we had a very distinguished African American justice \nof a State supreme court, that we ought to let him at least have a \nvote. We had a vote after 2 years and, on a party line vote, he was \nvoted down. Every single Republican voted against him, and every single \nDemocrat voted for him, even though he had the highest rating of the \nAmerican Bar Association, even though he was a justice of his state's \nhighest court, and even though he was one of the most outstanding \nnominees either of a Democratic or Republican President to come before \nthe Senate. At least he had a vote. I think the vote was wrong; he \nshould have been confirmed. But at least he had a vote.\n  I also worry about are all these people who are not even given a \nvote.\n  Senator Hatch compared this year's confirmation total against totals \nfrom other Presidential election years. The only year to which this can \nbe favorably compared is 1996 when the Republican majority in the \nSenate refused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the \nFederal bench. The total that year was zero. That is hardly a \ncomparison in which to take pride. I say let us compare 1992, in which \nthere was a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Republican \nPresident. We confirmed 11 court of appeals nominees during that \nRepublican President's last year in office--11 court of appeals \nnominees, and 66 judges in all. In fact, we went out in October of that \nyear. We were having hearings in September. We were having people \nconfirmed in October.\n  So do not come here and say the Democrats are not well grounded in \ncomplaining about what is happening. We established the way \nnonpartisanship can work in confirming judges. We did it for Republican \nPresidents. Obviously, it is not being done for a Democratic President. \nWhat we did in 1992, between July 24 and October 8, was the Senate \nconfirmed 32 judicial nominees. We ought to try to do the same here, \nbasically, from now until about the time we go out. Again, the last \ntime that happened at the end of a President's term, the Democrats \nhelped get 32 judges through during that period of 10 weeks at the end \nof the Congress. Well, we ought to do the same here. The Republicans \nought to be willing to do the same thing.\n  In fact, in 1992 the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as \nthis Committee has found time to hold this year. Late that year, we met \non July 29, August 4, August 11, and September 24, and all of the \nnominees who had hearings then were eventually confirmed before \nadjournment. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting \non any laurels.\n  Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much \nmore to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial \nnominees this year. We cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' \nand stop acting on these nominees now in anticipation of the \npresidential election in November. We must use all the time until \nadjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on the \ncourts to the detriment of the American people and the administration \nof justice. That should be a top priority for the Senate for the rest \nof this year. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, between July 24 \nand October 8, 1992, the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I \nwill work with the Republican Majority to try to match that record.\n  One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United \nStates Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial \nnominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts \naround the country. I continue to urge the Senate to meet its \nresponsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That \nthese highly qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most \nregrettable. The President spoke to this situation earlier this month \nin his appearance before the NAACP. The Senate should join with the \nPresident to confirm these well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded \nnominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country.\n  The Arizona vacancies are each judicial emergency vacancies. Two were \nauthorized in appropriations legislation last year when the Republicans \nMajority continued its refusal to consider a bill to meet the judicial \nConference's recommendation for 72 additional judges around the \ncountry. All we were able to authorize were a few judgeships in \nArizona, Florida and Nevada. That points out one of the reasons that \nthe comparisons that Chairman Hatch is seeking to draw to the vacancy \nrates at the end of the Bush Administration are incorrect. During \nPresident Reagan's Administration and again during the Bush \nAdministration, Congress added a significant number of new judgeships. \nThe so-called vacancy rate that Senator Hatch is so fond of citing at \nthe end of the Bush Administration is highly inflated by the addition \nof 85 new judgeships in 1990 and by the addition of 87 new judgeships \nin 1984, of which many where yet to be filled. By contrast the \nvacancies currently plaguing the federal courts are longstanding and in \nspite of Republican intransigence against authorizing additional \njudgeships requested by the Judicial Conference since 1996. If those \nadditional judgeships were taken into account, the vacancy rate today \nwould be over 13 percent with over 120 vacancies--hardly a comparison \nthat the Republican majority would want to make, but that would be \ncomparing comparable figures.\n  In addition, even running the gauntlet and getting a confirmation \nhearing does not automatically guarantee someone a vote before the \ncurrent Judiciary Committee. Bonnie Campbell, nominated by the \nPresident on March 2, 2000, has completed the nomination and hearing \nprocess and is strongly supported by Senator Grassley and Senator \nHarkin from her home state. But her name continues to be left off the \nagenda at our executive meetings for the last several weeks. She is a \nformer Iowa Attorney General and former high ranking Justice Department \nofficial who has worked extensively on domestic violence and crime\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nvictims matters. Allen Snyder is another well-respected and highly-\nqualified nominee who got a hearing but no Committee vote. He was \nnominated on September 22, 1999, received the highest rating from the \nABA, enjoys the full support of his home state Senators, and had his \nhearing on May 10, 2000. There are and have been many others.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified \nnominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate \nshould join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and \nfair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around \nthe country.\n  More than two years ago Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned that \n``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated \nwith the federal judiciary.'' The New York Times reported last year how \nthe crushing workload in the federal appellate courts has led to what \nit calls a ``two-tier system'' for appeals, skipping oral arguments in \nmore and more cases. Law clerks and attorney staff are being used more \nand more extensively in the determination of cases as backlogs grow. \nBureaucratic imperatives seem to be replacing the judicial deliberation \nneeded for the fair administration of justice. These are not the ways \nto continue the high quality of decisionmaking for which our federal \ncourts are admired or to engender confidence in our justice system.\n\n  When the President and the Chief Justice spoke out, the Senate \nbriefly got about its business of considering judicial nominations last \nyear. Unfortunately, last year the Republican majority returned to the \nstalling tactics of 1996 and 1997 and judicial vacancies are again \ngrowing in both number and duration. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote at \nthe end of 1997: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm \nany particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it \nshould vote him up or vote him down.'' The Senate is not defeating \njudicial nominations in up or down votes on their qualifications but \nrefusing to consider them and killing them through inaction.\n  During Republican control it has taken two-year periods for the \nSenate to match the one-year total of 101 judges confirmed in 1994, \nwhen we were on course to end the vacancies gap. Nominees like Judge \nHelene White, Barry Goode, Judge Legrome Davis, and J. Rich Leonard, \ndeserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two \nand three years. We are still seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and \ndelayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred from \nseeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see their \nwork put on hold while they await the outcome of their nominations. \nTheir families cannot plan. They are left to twist in the wind. All of \nthis despite the fact that, by all objective accounts and studies, the \njudges that President Clinton has appointed have been a moderate group, \nrendering moderate decisions, and certainly including far fewer \nideologues than were nominated during the Reagan Administration.\n  Federal law enforcement relies on judges to hear criminal cases, and \nindividuals and businesses pay taxes to exercise their right to resolve \ncivil disputes in the federal courts. As workloads continue to grow and \nvacancies are perpetuated, the remaining judges are being overwhelmed \nand the work of the federal judiciary is suffering.\n  Our independent federal judiciary sets us apart from virtually all \nothers in the world. Every nation that in this century has moved toward \ndemocracy has sent observers to the United States in their efforts to \nemulate our judiciary. Those fostering this slowdown of the \nconfirmation process and other attacks on the judiciary are risking \nharm to institutions that protect our personal freedoms and \nindependence.\n  What progress we started making two years ago has been lost and the \nSenate is again failing even to keep up with normal attrition. Far from \nclosing the vacancies gap, the number of current vacancies has grown \nfrom 57, when Congress recessed last year, to 60. Since some like to \nspeak in terms of percentage, I should note that the judicial vacancy \nrate now stands at over seven percent of the federal judiciary (60/\n852). If one considers the 63 additional judges recommended by the \njudicial conference, the vacancies rate would be over 13 percent (123/\n915).\n  What is most significant about the recent trend of judicial vacancies \nand vacancy rates is that the vacancies that existed in 1993 (after the \ncreation of 85 new judgeships in 1990) had been cut almost in half in \n1994, when the rate was reduced to 7.4% with 63 vacancies at the end of \nthe 103rd Congress. We continued to make progress even into 1995. In \nfact, the vacancy rate was lowered to 5.8% after the 1995 session, and \nbefore the partisan attack on federal judges began in earnest in 1996 \nand 1997.\n  Progress in the reduction of judicial vacancies was reversed in 1996, \nwhen Congress adjourned leaving 64 vacancies, and in 1997, when \nCongress adjourned leaving 80 vacancies and a 9.5% rate. No one was \nhappier than I that the Senate was able to make progress in 1998 toward \nreducing the vacancy rate. I praised Senator Hatch for his effort. \nUnfortunately, the vacancies are now growing again.\n  Let me also set the record straight, yet again, on the erroneous but \noft-repeated argument that ``the Clinton Administration is on record as \nhaving stated that a vacancy rate just over 7% is virtual full-\nemployment of the judiciary.'' That is not true.\n\n  The statement can only be alluded to an October 1994 press release. \nThat press release cannot be construed or even fairly misconstrued in \nthis manner. That press release was pointing out at the end of the \n103rd Congress that if the Senate proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees \nthen on the Senate calendar, it would have reduced the judicial vacancy \nrate to 4.7%, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a \nfavorable unemployment rate of under 5%.\n  This was not a statement of administration position or even a policy \nstatement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-\nconceived comment. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not \ncomparable. Unemployment rates are measures of people who do not have \njobs not of federal offices vacant without an appointed office holder.\n  When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized \nupon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the \npress release actually said and were manipulating it into a \nmisstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney \nGeneral, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial \nvacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to \n``full employment.''\n  The Department responded:\n\n       There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies \n     a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for \n     judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the \n     fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the \n     federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of \n     Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was \n     intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity \n     of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the \n     extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III \n     judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain \n     small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the \n     time required by the appointment process, that will always \n     exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach \n     12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate \n     should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as \n     they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent \n     capacity for the federal bench.\n\n  At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes \nthat 7 percent vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a \nvirtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that \nopinion. As the Justice Department noted two years ago in response to \nan inquiry on this very questions, the Senate should be ``working \ndiligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to \nreach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.''\n  Indeed, I informed the Senate of these facts in a statement in the \nCongressional Record on July 7, 1998, so that there would be no future \nmisunderstanding or misstatement of the record. Nonetheless, in spite \nof the facts and in spite of my July 1998 statement, these misleading \nstatements continue to be repeated.\n  The Senate should get about the business of voting on the \nconfirmation\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nof the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed with \njustification for too long. We must redouble our efforts to work with \nthe President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the federal \ncourts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional \nresponsibility. It should not be shirked.\n  I am sorry that Senator Hatch feels that he is being attacked from \nall sides. I regret that some on his side of the aisle and other \ncritics have sought to prevent him from doing his duty. I have gone out \nof my way to compliment the Chairman when praise was warranted and to \nkeep my criticism from becoming personal.\n\n  With respect to the Senate's treatment of nominees who are women or \nminorities, I remain vigilant. I have said that I do not regard Senator \nHatch as a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern \nabout the manner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority \nand women nominees over the last four years. From Margaret Morrow and \nMargaret McKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, and including Judge James Beatty, Judge James Wynn, Roger \nGregory, Enrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority \nnominees who have been delayed and opposed over the last four years, I \nhave spoken out. The Senate may never remove the blot that occurred \nlast October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican \nCaucus to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal \nDistrict Court Judge in Missouri.\n  The United States Senate is the scene where some 50 years ago, in \nOctober 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of \nWilliam Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the \nfirst Senate confirmation of an African American to our federal \ndistrict courts and courts of appeal. This Senate is also where some 30 \nyears ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of \nThurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court.\n  And this is where last October, the Senate wrongfully rejected \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made \nme doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half \ncentury of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or \nJustice Marshall.\n  On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to \nreject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court in \nMissouri--a nomination that had been waiting 27 months for a vote. For \nthe first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a federal district court \nwas defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate \nthat day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that \nwhich took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch \nthat led to the party-line vote.\n  It is unfortunate that the Republican Senate has on a number of \noccasions delayed consideration of too many women and minority \nnominees. The treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are \nexamples from earlier this year. Both of these nominees were eventually \nconfirmed this past March by wide margins.\n  I have been calling for the Senate to work to ensure that all \nnominees are given fair treatment, including a fair vote for the many \nminority and women candidates who remain pending. According to the \nreport released last September by the Task Force on Judicial Selection \nof Citizens for Independent Courts, the time it has been taking for the \nSenate to consider nominees has grown significantly and during the \n105th Congress, minorities and women nominees took significantly longer \nto gain Senate consideration than white male nominees: 60 days longer \nfor non-whites, and 65 days longer for women than men. The study \nverified that the time to confirm female nominees was now significantly \nlonger than that to confirm male nominees--a difference that has defied \nlogical explanation. They recommend that ``the responsible officials \naddress this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not \ntreated differently based on their gender.''\n  On July 13, 2000, President Clinton spoke before the NAACP Convention \nin Baltimore and lamented the fact that the Senate has been slow to act \non his judicial nominees who are women and minorities. He said: ``The \nquality of justice suffers when highly-qualified women and minority \ncandidates, fully vested, fully supported by the American Bar \nAssociation, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political \nreasons.'' He went on to say: ``The face of injustice is not \ncompassion; it is indifference, or worse. For the integrity of the \ncourts and the strength of our Constitution, I ask the Republicans to \ngive these people a vote. Vote them down if you don't want them on.'' I \nagree with the President.\n\n  The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of \nJudge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. When \nconfirmed, Judge Wynn and Mr. Gregory will be the first African-\nAmericans to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will each fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of \nJudge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an \nAfrican-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James \nA. Beatty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. \nThat nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nor the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at \nthe end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified \nAfrican-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President Clinton spoke \npowerfully about these matters last week. We should respond not by \nmisunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said, but by taking \naction on this well-qualified nominees.\n  In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of \nJudge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit, \nBonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth \nCircuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on \nwhich the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified \nnominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those \ncourts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a \njudicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of \njudicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, \nand the overwhelming workload.\n  I am disappointed that the Committee has not reported the nomination \nof Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. She completed the nomination \nand hearing process two months ago and is strongly supported by Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin from her home state. She will make an \noutstanding judge.\n  Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all \nAmericans. The Senate should treat minority and women and all nominees \nfairly and proceed to consider them without delay.\n  I think it was unfortunate that the chairman tried to assign blame \nfor the Senate's lack of progress on a number of legislative items. I \ndisagree with that assessment. He knows, as I do, that the Democratic \nleader made a proposal that would have moved the H-1B legislation and \nallowed votes on the humanitarian immigration issues. The Republicans \nrefused Senator Daschle's offer. We all know the Democrats have not \nopposed the religious liberty bill Senator Kennedy helped develop. We \nall know we have been pressing for reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women's Act for many months. It is not fair to suggest \nDemocrats are holding that up.\n  I will give you one other example. I am getting calls from police \norganizations, and I see the distinguished assistant minority leader, \nthe Senator from Nevada, who served as a police officer. He will \nunderstand this. I am getting calls from police organizations all over \nthe country.\n  They ask me: Why hasn't the Campbell-Leahy bill to provide more \nbulletproof vests passed? Why hasn't it gone through the Senate? I tell \nmy friend from Nevada what I told them. I said: My friend from Nevada, \nwho is the Democratic whip, has checked, as I have, with every single \nDemocrat, and every single Democrat is willing to pass it this minute \nby unanimous consent. We said that to the Republican leader.\n  We were told there was an objection on the Republican side. My \ngoodness. Have we gotten so partisan that a bill\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nsponsored by the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, by \nmyself and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Hatch, a bill to provide bulletproof vests--cosponsored \nby the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, as well--that a \nbill to provide bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers is being \nstalled by Republican objections? That is wrong.\n  If that bill were allowed to come to the floor for a vote, I am \nwilling to bet--in fact, I know because we have already checked--that \nevery Democratic Senator would vote for it. But I am also willing to \nbet that virtually every Republican Senator would vote for it. This is \nnot a Democrat or Republican bill. In fact, Senator Campbell and I have \nspecifically worked to make sure it is not a partisan bill.\n  So I tell my friends from law enforcement: Please call the other side \nof the aisle. I am convinced that a majority of Republicans support it, \nbut somebody on the Republican side is holding it up. The Democrats are \nwilling to pass it immediately.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee knows we were working toward \na bankruptcy bill until the Republicans decided to end bipartisan \ndiscussion and negotiate among themselves and not negotiate with the \nDemocrats.\n  He knows we should have passed the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act \nweeks, if not months, ago. I tell the business community that \ncontinuously asks me that every single Democrat is willing to move \nforward with it. It has been stalled on the Republican side.\n  In fact, let me take a bill involving the two of us. The Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile crime bill passed the Senate in May of 1999. Again, I ask my \nfriend from Nevada: As I recall, that passed with 73 votes, Democrats \nand Republicans, the majority of both parties. It passed the Senate \nwith 73 votes.\n  My friend from Utah is the chair of the House-Senate conference. But \nwe haven't convened in almost a year. It is a bill that should have \nbeen enacted last year. But we will not even have a conference. \nSeventy-three Senators voted for that bill--73. We can't get the \nconference to meet on it and the Senate controls the conference.\n  These are a lot of items, such as the H-1B legislation, the religious \nliberty bill, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, the \nbulletproof vest bill, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, the \nHatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill, the bankruptcy bill. These are things \nthat can move forward. But there seems to be no movement from the other \nside.\n  I will continue to try to find ways to work with the distinguished \nchairman, my friend from the Judiciary Committee, to make progress. I \npoint out that we worked together on civil asset forfeiture reform, and \nit passed. We worked together on intellectual property and antitrust \nmatters. Those measures pass with a majority of Republicans and \nDemocrats joining us. But now we find legislation on the bulletproof \nvest bill, which most of us agree on, that we cannot get passed. We \nfind nominations on which we cannot get a vote--even when the soon to \nbe Republican nominee for the Presidency, Governor Bush, said we ought \nto vote them up or down within 60 days. We can't get votes on them. \nSome stay stalled for months and years by humiliating delay.\n  I have spoken about how humiliating it must be to somebody who is \nnominated for a judgeship--the pinnacle of their legal career. They get \nnominated. The American Bar and others looked at them, and said: This \nis an outstanding person, an outstanding lawyer, and they would be a \nterrific jurist. Usually we get inundated with letters from lawyers--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--who say they know this man or woman \nand he or she would make a superb judge. The FBI and others do the \nbackground check --as thorough as you can imagine, such that most \npeople in private life would never be able to put up with it. Their \nprivacy is just shredded. They come back and say: This is an \noutstanding person.\n  If they are in private practice, they are congratulated by their \npartners in their firm. They say how wonderful it is. They realize, of \ncourse, that the nominee can't take on any more new cases because no \none wants conflicts of interest. They kind of suggest as soon as they \nhave this party that the nominee can sort of move out so the rest of \nthe law firm can go forward.\n  The nominees wait and wait and wait and wait. Nobody is against them, \nbut they can't get a hearing. They can't get a vote. Then, if the \npublic pressure grows enough, if they are in a high profile, they may \nget a hearing. Then if the pressure continues, they may get a Committee \nvote. And then, if the pressure really builds and the Democratic leader \nand the Democratic caucus insist, they may get a Senate vote on \nconfirmation. When they get voted, they get confirmed--with the \nexception of Justice White--by 90 to 10, or 95 to 5, and many times \nunanimously. But their lives has been put on hold for 2 or 3 years. \nTheir authority as a judge has been diminished because of that. It is \nhumiliating to them.\n  Frankly, it is humiliating to the Senate. It is beneath this great \nbody. I have served here for over 25 years. I can't think of any \ngreater honor that could come to me than to have the people of Vermont \nallow me to serve here. I should put on my tombstone, other than \nhusband and father, that I was a United States Senator.\n  I have always thought of this Senate as the conscience of the Nation. \nWe are not handling the conscience of this Nation very well.\n  We have a responsibility to uphold the judiciary. If we allow it to \nbe tattered, if we allow it to be shredded, if we allow it to be \nhumiliated, how can a democracy of a quarter of a billion people uphold \nour laws? How can the country have respect both for the laws and the \ncourts that administer them, if we in the Senate, the most powerful \nlegislative body in this country, don't show that same respect? If we \ndiminish that, it will be an example to be followed by the rest of the \npeople in this country.\n  There are only 100 of us who have the privilege of serving here at \nany given time to represent a quarter of a billion Americans. Sometimes \nwe should think more of that responsibility than partisan politics.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Vermont leaves, let me \nsay a few things. In this body, we tend not to give the accolades to \nour fellow Senators that we should. I want the Senator from Vermont to \nknow how the entire Democratic caucus supports and follows the lead of \nthis man on matters related to the judiciary. He has done an \noutstanding job leading the Democratic conference through this wide-\nranging jurisdictional authority of the Judiciary Committee.\n  We are very proud of the work that Pat Leahy does. The people of \nVermont should know that, first of all, he is always looking after the \npeople of Vermont. I am from a State 3,000 miles away from Vermont, the \nState of Nevada. People in Nevada should, every day, be thankful for \nthe work the Senator does, not only for the State of Vermont but for \nthe country.\n  I want the Record to be spread with the fact that we in the minority \nare so grateful for the work the Senator from Vermont does for our \ncountry. The statement made today certainly outlines many of the \nproblems we are having in the Senate, none of which are caused by the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I must \nadmit, in my 25 years, nobody has handled the job as whip the way the \nSenator has. In having the Senator as an ally on the floor, I come well \narmed, indeed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7531-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7531-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not on the Senate floor to \nhear Chairman Hatch earlier this afternoon. I was attending an \nimportant confirmation hearing and chairing a meeting of the bipartisan \nInternet Caucus. I spoke to the issue of judicial nominations last \nFriday and say, again, with 60 current and longstanding vacancies \nwithin the federal judiciary, and seven more on the horizon, we cannot \nafford to stop or slow down the little progress we are making.\n  Our hearing today included three nominees moved forward to fill \npositions on the District Court of Arizona that have all been declared \njudicial emergencies. Each of the nominees was nominated last Friday. \nThey are now having their hearing, they look forward to being voted out \nof committee on Thursday and approved by the Senate before the week is \nout--within one week of nomination. This demonstrates what we can do \nwhen we want to take action. All the talk about needing six months or \nmore to process and review nominees is just that--talk. If all goes \naccording to schedule, these nominees will be in and out of the Senate \nin less than one week.\n  We could do that with a number of nominees. Instead, this is a Senate \nthat has kept highly-qualified nominees, such as Richard Paez and \nMarsha Berzon, waiting for years before they get a vote. There is just \nno reason to have a qualified nominee like Judge Helene White of \nMichigan held hostage for over 42 months without a hearing.\n  I am disappointed to have seen another hearing come and go without \neven one nominee to fill one of the many vacancies to the Courts of \nAppeals around the country. I was encouraged to hear Senator Lott \nrecently say that he continues to urge the Judiciary Committee to make \nprogress on judicial nominations. The Majority Leader said: ``There are \na number of nominations that have had hearings, nominations that are \nready for a vote and other nominations that have been pending for quite \nsome time and that should be considered.'' He went on to note that the \ngroups of judges he expects us to report to the Senate will include \n``not only district judges but circuit judges.'' Unfortunately, the \nCommittee has not honored the Majority Leader's representations and was \nonly willing to consider a few District Court nominees at today's \nhearing. Pending before the Committee are a dozen nominees to the \nFederal Courts of Appeals who are awaiting a hearing--12 nominees, not \none of which the Republican Majority saw fit to include in this \nhearing. Left off the agenda are Judge Helene White of Michigan, who is \nnow the longest pending judicial nomination at over 42 months without \neven a hearing; Barry Goode, whose nomination to the Ninth Circuit was \nthe subject of Senator Feinstein's statements at our Committee meeting \nlast Thursday and who has been pending for over two years; as well as a \nnumber of qualified minority nominees whom I have been speaking about \nthroughout the year, including Kathleen McCree Lewis of Michigan, \nEnrique Moreno of Texas and Roger Gregory of Virginia.\n  I noted for the Senate last Friday that there continue to be multiple \nvacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of \nColumbia Circuits. With 20 vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly \nhalf of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court \nsystem. I know how fond our Chairman is of percentages, so I note that \nthe vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 11 percent \nnationwide. Of course that vacancy rate does not begin to take into \naccount the additional judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference \nto handle their increased workloads. If we added the 11 additional \nappellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. \nBy comparison, the vacancy rate at the end of the Bush Administration, \neven after a Democratic Majority had acted in 1990 to add 11 new \njudgeships for the Courts of Appeals, was only 11 percent. Even though \nthe Congress has not approved a single new Circuit Court \nposition within the federal judiciary since 1990, the Republican Senate \nhas by design lost ground in filling vacancies on our appellate courts.\n\n  At our first Judiciary Committee meeting of the year, I noted the \nopportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy \ncrisis in our nation's federal courts. I believed that a confirmation \ntotal of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the \neffort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to \nbe done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a \nnumber of outstanding nominations to the Court of Appeals, including \nqualified minority and women candidates.\n  Yet only five nominees to the appellate courts around the country \nhave had nomination hearings this year and only three of those five \nhave been reported by the Committee to the Senate and confirmed--only \nthree all year. The Committee included no Court of Appeals nominees at \nthe hearings on April 27 and July 12, and there are no Court of Appeals \nnominee at the hearing today. The Committee has yet to report the \nnomination of Allen Snyder to the District of Columbia Circuit, \nalthough his hearing was 11 weeks ago, or the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her hearing was eight weeks \nago. The Republican candidate for President talks about final Senate \naction on nominations within 60 days and we cannot get the Committee to \nreport some nominations within 60 days of their hearing.\n  There is no good reason to have a qualified nominee such as Judge \nHelene White of Michigan held hostage for over 42 months without a \nhearing--42 months, and she has not even gotten a hearing. We had two \nmen who were nominated last Friday, and they had a hearing today. They \nwill probably be confirmed this week. Helene White has been held \nhostage for over 42 months without a hearing. She is the record holder \nfor judicial nominees who have had to wait for a hearing--and her wait \ncontinues. It is insulting to the people of Michigan, insulting to the \ncourt, and insulting to her. The people of Michigan deserve a vote up \nor down on this outstanding lawyer and Judge from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\n  Now why do I keep mentioning this? I keep mentioning it because, \nfrankly, we are doing a poor job in confirming judges. I compare this \nto the last year of President Bush's term. We had a Democratic majority \nin the Senate. We confirmed twice as many judges then as this Senate is \nconfirming now with a Republican majority and a Democratic President. \nSomething was said the other day that, well, the Democrats are in the \nminority, and that is probably why they complain so. Well, heavens, I \nwould be happy to have the complaints of the Republicans when they were \nin the minority. The Democrats moved twice as many judges for a \nRepublican President as Republicans are moving for a Democratic \nPresident. It is a simple fact.\n  The soon-to-be presidential nominee of the Republican Party has \nsaid--and I agree with him--that this is wrong, the Senate ought to \nvote these people up or down in 60 days. Of course, we could do that. \nThere is a concern that has been expressed--and rightly so--that so \nmany nominees are held without any vote. Nobody votes against them, but \nnobody gets an opportunity to vote for them; they just sit there. And \neven though the criticism stings, the fact is that, on average, women \nand minorities take longer to go through this Senate than white males \ndo. Some women, some minorities have gone through very quickly, but \nmost have taken longer.\n  I said earlier that I do not see any sense of bias or sexism in our \nchairman. I have known him for over 20 years, and I have never heard \nhim make a biased remark or a sexist remark during that whole time. But \nsomething is happening, somewhere they are being held up. It is wrong. \nOne of the things that most Republicans and Democrats ought to be able \nto agree on is what Governor Bush said: Do it and vote them up or down \nin 60 days. Let's make a decision.\n  Some of these people got held up for 2 or 3 or 4 years. When they \nfinally got a vote, they passed overwhelmingly. But for 2 or 3 or 4 \nyears they were humiliated, caused to dangle, have their law practices \nfall apart, have people question what was going on. Why? Because one or \ntwo Senators thought they should be held up. Well, let those one or two \nSenators vote against them. We are paid to vote yes or no, not maybe. I \ndo not know whether it is because they are women, because they are \nHispanic, because they are too liberal, or too conservative, too \nactive, not active enough, that people don't want them to be confirmed. \nLet them vote against them.\n\n  I argued, when we had a very distinguished African American justice \nof a State supreme court, that we ought to let him at least have a \nvote. We had a vote after 2 years and, on a party line vote, he was \nvoted down. Every single Republican voted against him, and every single \nDemocrat voted for him, even though he had the highest rating of the \nAmerican Bar Association, even though he was a justice of his state's \nhighest court, and even though he was one of the most outstanding \nnominees either of a Democratic or Republican President to come before \nthe Senate. At least he had a vote. I think the vote was wrong; he \nshould have been confirmed. But at least he had a vote.\n  I also worry about are all these people who are not even given a \nvote.\n  Senator Hatch compared this year's confirmation total against totals \nfrom other Presidential election years. The only year to which this can \nbe favorably compared is 1996 when the Republican majority in the \nSenate refused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the \nFederal bench. The total that year was zero. That is hardly a \ncomparison in which to take pride. I say let us compare 1992, in which \nthere was a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Republican \nPresident. We confirmed 11 court of appeals nominees during that \nRepublican President's last year in office--11 court of appeals \nnominees, and 66 judges in all. In fact, we went out in October of that \nyear. We were having hearings in September. We were having people \nconfirmed in October.\n  So do not come here and say the Democrats are not well grounded in \ncomplaining about what is happening. We established the way \nnonpartisanship can work in confirming judges. We did it for Republican \nPresidents. Obviously, it is not being done for a Democratic President. \nWhat we did in 1992, between July 24 and October 8, was the Senate \nconfirmed 32 judicial nominees. We ought to try to do the same here, \nbasically, from now until about the time we go out. Again, the last \ntime that happened at the end of a President's term, the Democrats \nhelped get 32 judges through during that period of 10 weeks at the end \nof the Congress. Well, we ought to do the same here. The Republicans \nought to be willing to do the same thing.\n  In fact, in 1992 the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as \nthis Committee has found time to hold this year. Late that year, we met \non July 29, August 4, August 11, and September 24, and all of the \nnominees who had hearings then were eventually confirmed before \nadjournment. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting \non any laurels.\n  Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much \nmore to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial \nnominees this year. We cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' \nand stop acting on these nominees now in anticipation of the \npresidential election in November. We must use all the time until \nadjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on the \ncourts to the detriment of the American people and the administration \nof justice. That should be a top priority for the Senate for the rest \nof this year. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, between July 24 \nand October 8, 1992, the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I \nwill work with the Republican Majority to try to match that record.\n  One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United \nStates Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial \nnominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts \naround the country. I continue to urge the Senate to meet its \nresponsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That \nthese highly qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most \nregrettable. The President spoke to this situation earlier this month \nin his appearance before the NAACP. The Senate should join with the \nPresident to confirm these well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded \nnominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country.\n  The Arizona vacancies are each judicial emergency vacancies. Two were \nauthorized in appropriations legislation last year when the Republicans \nMajority continued its refusal to consider a bill to meet the judicial \nConference's recommendation for 72 additional judges around the \ncountry. All we were able to authorize were a few judgeships in \nArizona, Florida and Nevada. That points out one of the reasons that \nthe comparisons that Chairman Hatch is seeking to draw to the vacancy \nrates at the end of the Bush Administration are incorrect. During \nPresident Reagan's Administration and again during the Bush \nAdministration, Congress added a significant number of new judgeships. \nThe so-called vacancy rate that Senator Hatch is so fond of citing at \nthe end of the Bush Administration is highly inflated by the addition \nof 85 new judgeships in 1990 and by the addition of 87 new judgeships \nin 1984, of which many where yet to be filled. By contrast the \nvacancies currently plaguing the federal courts are longstanding and in \nspite of Republican intransigence against authorizing additional \njudgeships requested by the Judicial Conference since 1996. If those \nadditional judgeships were taken into account, the vacancy rate today \nwould be over 13 percent with over 120 vacancies--hardly a comparison \nthat the Republican majority would want to make, but that would be \ncomparing comparable figures.\n  In addition, even running the gauntlet and getting a confirmation \nhearing does not automatically guarantee someone a vote before the \ncurrent Judiciary Committee. Bonnie Campbell, nominated by the \nPresident on March 2, 2000, has completed the nomination and hearing \nprocess and is strongly supported by Senator Grassley and Senator \nHarkin from her home state. But her name continues to be left off the \nagenda at our executive meetings for the last several weeks. She is a \nformer Iowa Attorney General and former high ranking Justice Department \nofficial who has worked extensively on domestic violence and crime\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nvictims matters. Allen Snyder is another well-respected and highly-\nqualified nominee who got a hearing but no Committee vote. He was \nnominated on September 22, 1999, received the highest rating from the \nABA, enjoys the full support of his home state Senators, and had his \nhearing on May 10, 2000. There are and have been many others.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified \nnominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate \nshould join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and \nfair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around \nthe country.\n  More than two years ago Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned that \n``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated \nwith the federal judiciary.'' The New York Times reported last year how \nthe crushing workload in the federal appellate courts has led to what \nit calls a ``two-tier system'' for appeals, skipping oral arguments in \nmore and more cases. Law clerks and attorney staff are being used more \nand more extensively in the determination of cases as backlogs grow. \nBureaucratic imperatives seem to be replacing the judicial deliberation \nneeded for the fair administration of justice. These are not the ways \nto continue the high quality of decisionmaking for which our federal \ncourts are admired or to engender confidence in our justice system.\n\n  When the President and the Chief Justice spoke out, the Senate \nbriefly got about its business of considering judicial nominations last \nyear. Unfortunately, last year the Republican majority returned to the \nstalling tactics of 1996 and 1997 and judicial vacancies are again \ngrowing in both number and duration. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote at \nthe end of 1997: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm \nany particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it \nshould vote him up or vote him down.'' The Senate is not defeating \njudicial nominations in up or down votes on their qualifications but \nrefusing to consider them and killing them through inaction.\n  During Republican control it has taken two-year periods for the \nSenate to match the one-year total of 101 judges confirmed in 1994, \nwhen we were on course to end the vacancies gap. Nominees like Judge \nHelene White, Barry Goode, Judge Legrome Davis, and J. Rich Leonard, \ndeserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two \nand three years. We are still seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and \ndelayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred from \nseeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see their \nwork put on hold while they await the outcome of their nominations. \nTheir families cannot plan. They are left to twist in the wind. All of \nthis despite the fact that, by all objective accounts and studies, the \njudges that President Clinton has appointed have been a moderate group, \nrendering moderate decisions, and certainly including far fewer \nideologues than were nominated during the Reagan Administration.\n  Federal law enforcement relies on judges to hear criminal cases, and \nindividuals and businesses pay taxes to exercise their right to resolve \ncivil disputes in the federal courts. As workloads continue to grow and \nvacancies are perpetuated, the remaining judges are being overwhelmed \nand the work of the federal judiciary is suffering.\n  Our independent federal judiciary sets us apart from virtually all \nothers in the world. Every nation that in this century has moved toward \ndemocracy has sent observers to the United States in their efforts to \nemulate our judiciary. Those fostering this slowdown of the \nconfirmation process and other attacks on the judiciary are risking \nharm to institutions that protect our personal freedoms and \nindependence.\n  What progress we started making two years ago has been lost and the \nSenate is again failing even to keep up with normal attrition. Far from \nclosing the vacancies gap, the number of current vacancies has grown \nfrom 57, when Congress recessed last year, to 60. Since some like to \nspeak in terms of percentage, I should note that the judicial vacancy \nrate now stands at over seven percent of the federal judiciary (60/\n852). If one considers the 63 additional judges recommended by the \njudicial conference, the vacancies rate would be over 13 percent (123/\n915).\n  What is most significant about the recent trend of judicial vacancies \nand vacancy rates is that the vacancies that existed in 1993 (after the \ncreation of 85 new judgeships in 1990) had been cut almost in half in \n1994, when the rate was reduced to 7.4% with 63 vacancies at the end of \nthe 103rd Congress. We continued to make progress even into 1995. In \nfact, the vacancy rate was lowered to 5.8% after the 1995 session, and \nbefore the partisan attack on federal judges began in earnest in 1996 \nand 1997.\n  Progress in the reduction of judicial vacancies was reversed in 1996, \nwhen Congress adjourned leaving 64 vacancies, and in 1997, when \nCongress adjourned leaving 80 vacancies and a 9.5% rate. No one was \nhappier than I that the Senate was able to make progress in 1998 toward \nreducing the vacancy rate. I praised Senator Hatch for his effort. \nUnfortunately, the vacancies are now growing again.\n  Let me also set the record straight, yet again, on the erroneous but \noft-repeated argument that ``the Clinton Administration is on record as \nhaving stated that a vacancy rate just over 7% is virtual full-\nemployment of the judiciary.'' That is not true.\n\n  The statement can only be alluded to an October 1994 press release. \nThat press release cannot be construed or even fairly misconstrued in \nthis manner. That press release was pointing out at the end of the \n103rd Congress that if the Senate proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees \nthen on the Senate calendar, it would have reduced the judicial vacancy \nrate to 4.7%, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a \nfavorable unemployment rate of under 5%.\n  This was not a statement of administration position or even a policy \nstatement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-\nconceived comment. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not \ncomparable. Unemployment rates are measures of people who do not have \njobs not of federal offices vacant without an appointed office holder.\n  When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized \nupon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the \npress release actually said and were manipulating it into a \nmisstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney \nGeneral, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial \nvacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to \n``full employment.''\n  The Department responded:\n\n       There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies \n     a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for \n     judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the \n     fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the \n     federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of \n     Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was \n     intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity \n     of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the \n     extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III \n     judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain \n     small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the \n     time required by the appointment process, that will always \n     exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach \n     12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate \n     should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as \n     they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent \n     capacity for the federal bench.\n\n  At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes \nthat 7 percent vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a \nvirtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that \nopinion. As the Justice Department noted two years ago in response to \nan inquiry on this very questions, the Senate should be ``working \ndiligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to \nreach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.''\n  Indeed, I informed the Senate of these facts in a statement in the \nCongressional Record on July 7, 1998, so that there would be no future \nmisunderstanding or misstatement of the record. Nonetheless, in spite \nof the facts and in spite of my July 1998 statement, these misleading \nstatements continue to be repeated.\n  The Senate should get about the business of voting on the \nconfirmation\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nof the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed with \njustification for too long. We must redouble our efforts to work with \nthe President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the federal \ncourts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional \nresponsibility. It should not be shirked.\n  I am sorry that Senator Hatch feels that he is being attacked from \nall sides. I regret that some on his side of the aisle and other \ncritics have sought to prevent him from doing his duty. I have gone out \nof my way to compliment the Chairman when praise was warranted and to \nkeep my criticism from becoming personal.\n\n  With respect to the Senate's treatment of nominees who are women or \nminorities, I remain vigilant. I have said that I do not regard Senator \nHatch as a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern \nabout the manner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority \nand women nominees over the last four years. From Margaret Morrow and \nMargaret McKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, and including Judge James Beatty, Judge James Wynn, Roger \nGregory, Enrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority \nnominees who have been delayed and opposed over the last four years, I \nhave spoken out. The Senate may never remove the blot that occurred \nlast October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican \nCaucus to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal \nDistrict Court Judge in Missouri.\n  The United States Senate is the scene where some 50 years ago, in \nOctober 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of \nWilliam Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the \nfirst Senate confirmation of an African American to our federal \ndistrict courts and courts of appeal. This Senate is also where some 30 \nyears ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of \nThurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court.\n  And this is where last October, the Senate wrongfully rejected \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made \nme doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half \ncentury of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or \nJustice Marshall.\n  On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to \nreject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court in \nMissouri--a nomination that had been waiting 27 months for a vote. For \nthe first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a federal district court \nwas defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate \nthat day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that \nwhich took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch \nthat led to the party-line vote.\n  It is unfortunate that the Republican Senate has on a number of \noccasions delayed consideration of too many women and minority \nnominees. The treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are \nexamples from earlier this year. Both of these nominees were eventually \nconfirmed this past March by wide margins.\n  I have been calling for the Senate to work to ensure that all \nnominees are given fair treatment, including a fair vote for the many \nminority and women candidates who remain pending. According to the \nreport released last September by the Task Force on Judicial Selection \nof Citizens for Independent Courts, the time it has been taking for the \nSenate to consider nominees has grown significantly and during the \n105th Congress, minorities and women nominees took significantly longer \nto gain Senate consideration than white male nominees: 60 days longer \nfor non-whites, and 65 days longer for women than men. The study \nverified that the time to confirm female nominees was now significantly \nlonger than that to confirm male nominees--a difference that has defied \nlogical explanation. They recommend that ``the responsible officials \naddress this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not \ntreated differently based on their gender.''\n  On July 13, 2000, President Clinton spoke before the NAACP Convention \nin Baltimore and lamented the fact that the Senate has been slow to act \non his judicial nominees who are women and minorities. He said: ``The \nquality of justice suffers when highly-qualified women and minority \ncandidates, fully vested, fully supported by the American Bar \nAssociation, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political \nreasons.'' He went on to say: ``The face of injustice is not \ncompassion; it is indifference, or worse. For the integrity of the \ncourts and the strength of our Constitution, I ask the Republicans to \ngive these people a vote. Vote them down if you don't want them on.'' I \nagree with the President.\n\n  The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of \nJudge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. When \nconfirmed, Judge Wynn and Mr. Gregory will be the first African-\nAmericans to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will each fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of \nJudge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an \nAfrican-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James \nA. Beatty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. \nThat nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nor the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at \nthe end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified \nAfrican-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President Clinton spoke \npowerfully about these matters last week. We should respond not by \nmisunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said, but by taking \naction on this well-qualified nominees.\n  In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of \nJudge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit, \nBonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth \nCircuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on \nwhich the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified \nnominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those \ncourts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a \njudicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of \njudicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, \nand the overwhelming workload.\n  I am disappointed that the Committee has not reported the nomination \nof Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. She completed the nomination \nand hearing process two months ago and is strongly supported by Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin from her home state. She will make an \noutstanding judge.\n  Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all \nAmericans. The Senate should treat minority and women and all nominees \nfairly and proceed to consider them without delay.\n  I think it was unfortunate that the chairman tried to assign blame \nfor the Senate's lack of progress on a number of legislative items. I \ndisagree with that assessment. He knows, as I do, that the Democratic \nleader made a proposal that would have moved the H-1B legislation and \nallowed votes on the humanitarian immigration issues. The Republicans \nrefused Senator Daschle's offer. We all know the Democrats have not \nopposed the religious liberty bill Senator Kennedy helped develop. We \nall know we have been pressing for reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women's Act for many months. It is not fair to suggest \nDemocrats are holding that up.\n  I will give you one other example. I am getting calls from police \norganizations, and I see the distinguished assistant minority leader, \nthe Senator from Nevada, who served as a police officer. He will \nunderstand this. I am getting calls from police organizations all over \nthe country.\n  They ask me: Why hasn't the Campbell-Leahy bill to provide more \nbulletproof vests passed? Why hasn't it gone through the Senate? I tell \nmy friend from Nevada what I told them. I said: My friend from Nevada, \nwho is the Democratic whip, has checked, as I have, with every single \nDemocrat, and every single Democrat is willing to pass it this minute \nby unanimous consent. We said that to the Republican leader.\n  We were told there was an objection on the Republican side. My \ngoodness. Have we gotten so partisan that a bill\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nsponsored by the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, by \nmyself and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Hatch, a bill to provide bulletproof vests--cosponsored \nby the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, as well--that a \nbill to provide bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers is being \nstalled by Republican objections? That is wrong.\n  If that bill were allowed to come to the floor for a vote, I am \nwilling to bet--in fact, I know because we have already checked--that \nevery Democratic Senator would vote for it. But I am also willing to \nbet that virtually every Republican Senator would vote for it. This is \nnot a Democrat or Republican bill. In fact, Senator Campbell and I have \nspecifically worked to make sure it is not a partisan bill.\n  So I tell my friends from law enforcement: Please call the other side \nof the aisle. I am convinced that a majority of Republicans support it, \nbut somebody on the Republican side is holding it up. The Democrats are \nwilling to pass it immediately.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee knows we were working toward \na bankruptcy bill until the Republicans decided to end bipartisan \ndiscussion and negotiate among themselves and not negotiate with the \nDemocrats.\n  He knows we should have passed the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act \nweeks, if not months, ago. I tell the business community that \ncontinuously asks me that every single Democrat is willing to move \nforward with it. It has been stalled on the Republican side.\n  In fact, let me take a bill involving the two of us. The Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile crime bill passed the Senate in May of 1999. Again, I ask my \nfriend from Nevada: As I recall, that passed with 73 votes, Democrats \nand Republicans, the majority of both parties. It passed the Senate \nwith 73 votes.\n  My friend from Utah is the chair of the House-Senate conference. But \nwe haven't convened in almost a year. It is a bill that should have \nbeen enacted last year. But we will not even have a conference. \nSeventy-three Senators voted for that bill--73. We can't get the \nconference to meet on it and the Senate controls the conference.\n  These are a lot of items, such as the H-1B legislation, the religious \nliberty bill, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, the \nbulletproof vest bill, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, the \nHatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill, the bankruptcy bill. These are things \nthat can move forward. But there seems to be no movement from the other \nside.\n  I will continue to try to find ways to work with the distinguished \nchairman, my friend from the Judiciary Committee, to make progress. I \npoint out that we worked together on civil asset forfeiture reform, and \nit passed. We worked together on intellectual property and antitrust \nmatters. Those measures pass with a majority of Republicans and \nDemocrats joining us. But now we find legislation on the bulletproof \nvest bill, which most of us agree on, that we cannot get passed. We \nfind nominations on which we cannot get a vote--even when the soon to \nbe Republican nominee for the Presidency, Governor Bush, said we ought \nto vote them up or down within 60 days. We can't get votes on them. \nSome stay stalled for months and years by humiliating delay.\n  I have spoken about how humiliating it must be to somebody who is \nnominated for a judgeship--the pinnacle of their legal career. They get \nnominated. The American Bar and others looked at them, and said: This \nis an outstanding person, an outstanding lawyer, and they would be a \nterrific jurist. Usually we get inundated with letters from lawyers--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--who say they know this man or woman \nand he or she would make a superb judge. The FBI and others do the \nbackground check --as thorough as you can imagine, such that most \npeople in private life would never be able to put up with it. Their \nprivacy is just shredded. They come back and say: This is an \noutstanding person.\n  If they are in private practice, they are congratulated by their \npartners in their firm. They say how wonderful it is. They realize, of \ncourse, that the nominee can't take on any more new cases because no \none wants conflicts of interest. They kind of suggest as soon as they \nhave this party that the nominee can sort of move out so the rest of \nthe law firm can go forward.\n  The nominees wait and wait and wait and wait. Nobody is against them, \nbut they can't get a hearing. They can't get a vote. Then, if the \npublic pressure grows enough, if they are in a high profile, they may \nget a hearing. Then if the pressure continues, they may get a Committee \nvote. And then, if the pressure really builds and the Democratic leader \nand the Democratic caucus insist, they may get a Senate vote on \nconfirmation. When they get voted, they get confirmed--with the \nexception of Justice White--by 90 to 10, or 95 to 5, and many times \nunanimously. But their lives has been put on hold for 2 or 3 years. \nTheir authority as a judge has been diminished because of that. It is \nhumiliating to them.\n  Frankly, it is humiliating to the Senate. It is beneath this great \nbody. I have served here for over 25 years. I can't think of any \ngreater honor that could come to me than to have the people of Vermont \nallow me to serve here. I should put on my tombstone, other than \nhusband and father, that I was a United States Senator.\n  I have always thought of this Senate as the conscience of the Nation. \nWe are not handling the conscience of this Nation very well.\n  We have a responsibility to uphold the judiciary. If we allow it to \nbe tattered, if we allow it to be shredded, if we allow it to be \nhumiliated, how can a democracy of a quarter of a billion people uphold \nour laws? How can the country have respect both for the laws and the \ncourts that administer them, if we in the Senate, the most powerful \nlegislative body in this country, don't show that same respect? If we \ndiminish that, it will be an example to be followed by the rest of the \npeople in this country.\n  There are only 100 of us who have the privilege of serving here at \nany given time to represent a quarter of a billion Americans. Sometimes \nwe should think more of that responsibility than partisan politics.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Vermont leaves, let me \nsay a few things. In this body, we tend not to give the accolades to \nour fellow Senators that we should. I want the Senator from Vermont to \nknow how the entire Democratic caucus supports and follows the lead of \nthis man on matters related to the judiciary. He has done an \noutstanding job leading the Democratic conference through this wide-\nranging jurisdictional authority of the Judiciary Committee.\n  We are very proud of the work that Pat Leahy does. The people of \nVermont should know that, first of all, he is always looking after the \npeople of Vermont. I am from a State 3,000 miles away from Vermont, the \nState of Nevada. People in Nevada should, every day, be thankful for \nthe work the Senator does, not only for the State of Vermont but for \nthe country.\n  I want the Record to be spread with the fact that we in the minority \nare so grateful for the work the Senator from Vermont does for our \ncountry. The statement made today certainly outlines many of the \nproblems we are having in the Senate, none of which are caused by the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I must \nadmit, in my 25 years, nobody has handled the job as whip the way the \nSenator has. In having the Senator as an ally on the floor, I come well \narmed, indeed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7536-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in all likelihood tomorrow we will be \nsending the President a bill to eliminate the marriage penalty for most \nAmericans. I urge the President to sign this bill.\n  This bill will provide tax relief for millions of married couples. \nFor individuals or for couples who have incomes of $52,000, they will \nsee their take-home pay increase by a total of about $1,400. Some of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side have said that is a tax cut for the \nwealthy. It is not. I don't consider a married couple who have an \nincome of $52,000 particularly wealthy. We want to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty and allow them to keep more of their own money. They \nshould not be taxed at a 28-percent rate.\n  That is what our bill does. Our bill says we should double the 15-\npercent rate on individuals for couples. Right now, people who have \ntaxable incomes of $26,000 as individuals pay taxes at 15 percent. We \nare saying married couples should pay taxes at 15 percent at twice that \namount, up to $52,000. That only makes sense. If you tax individuals at \n15 percent up to $26,000, for couples it should be double that amount, \n$52,000, except that present law taxes couples at 28 percent beginning \nat $43,000.\n  So if couples have taxable income above $43,000, they start paying \n28-percent income tax. If they happen to be self-employed on top of \nthat, it is 28 percent plus 15.3 percent Social Security and Medicare \ntax. That is 43.3 percent. In most States, they have income tax rates \nof another 6 or 7 percent, State income tax. That is over 50 percent \nfor a couple with taxable income of $44-$45-$50,000. That is too high.\n  Congress has passed a bill--both the House and the Senate, identical \nbills--that says let's double that 15-percent rate for couples, the \nindividual rate for couples, so the taxable income will be 15 percent \nup to $52,000, 28 percent above that.\n  Again, I urge the President to sign it. It is not tax cuts for the \nwealthy; it is tax cuts for all married couples who have incomes of \n$43,000, $52,000, or $60,000. The amount of benefit, maximum benefit, \nis about $1,400.\n  I urge the President to sign that bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7536-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

He conducted himself in the quiet, deliberative manner \nthat reflected his commitment to a thorough performance of his duties. \nHe was a true leader, willing to do his best for all Americans.\n  Most recently, he and I worked together to keep our nation's promise \nto provide health care coverage to military retirees, when we \nintroduced legislation together earlier this year. As my colleagues \nknow, Senator Coverdell had extreme pride in this country. It was an \nhonor to work with him on making good to those people who have served \ntheir nation and are now in the years of declining health. It was also \nan honor to work with Senator Coverdell every day, for he was truly \ninterested in ensuring our democracy remained strong and pushed forward \nconfidently into the Twenty-first Century.\n  Mr. President, I wish to extend my condolences to the Coverdell \nfamily, including his many friends and his staff. The entire Senate \nfamily has lost a friend and the nation has lost a leader. However, we \nare all enriched by having known such an honorable man. His service and \ncommitment will have a definite and lasting legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7536-6", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7536-S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n               indian tribal self-governance regulations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to engage several of my colleagues \nin a colloquy about some regulations which the Department of the \nInterior is preparing to issue in final form. These regulations would \ngovern the federal and tribal administration of the Tribal Self-\nGovernance program. I understand there is strong opposition from \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native groups to a handful of the proposed \nprovisions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. The \nCommittee on Indian Affairs has received a series of communications \nfrom Native American tribes and tribal organizations indicating their \nopposition to eight of the hundreds of proposed provisions. These eight \n``impasse'' issues appear to involve particularly sensitive matters \nwhich the Indian tribes believe would seriously set back the advances \nthese tribes have made in the field of tribal self-governance during \nthe past decade.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I share the concerns raised by the Indian tribes, and \nwould note that in 1994 when we enacted the Tribal Self-Governance Act, \nthe Congress expressly authorized the tribal self-governance effort to \ngo forward without regulations. At the same time, we required the \nDepartment to engage in a negotiated rulemaking with tribal government \nrepresentatives to develop mutually acceptable rules. Now it appears \nthat this effort has been largely successful. There are hundreds of \nprovisions that have been developed and mutually accepted by the tribal \nand federal representatives. These should be permitted to go forward. \nBut as to the eight or so provisions upon which there is a negotiation \nimpasse, I believe it would be contrary to the intent of the 1994 Act \nand to the negotiated rulemaking process to impose objectionable \nprovisions upon the Indian tribes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur in the views of my colleagues, and add that the \n1994 Act has been implemented without the benefit of any regulations \nfor the past six years. Accordingly, I can imagine no undue hardship \nwould come to the Department if the final regulations are silent as to \neight of the hundreds of issues addressed in the draft regulations. As \nto these eight so-called ``impasse'' issues, I would encourage the\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nDepartment to simply not issue any regulatory provisions that touch \nupon these objectionable issues. As I understand it, the ninety-five \npercent of the remaining regulations that deal with other issues are \nacceptable to the Indian tribes. The Department should publish those as \nfinal and withhold from publication of the eight provisions that are \nobjectionable. I would inquire of the Chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs as to the nature of the eight objectionable provisions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The tribal representatives have provided the Committee \nwith a list of eight issues. They have asked the Department to agree to \nnot publish any regulatory provision which: limits the reallocation \nauthority of a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium by requiring that \nreallocation of funds may only be between programs in annual funding \nagreements; limits the local decision-making of a Self-Governance \nTribe/consortium by requiring that funds in an annual funding agreement \nshall only be spent on specific programs listed in such funding \nagreement; prohibits Tribal Base funding from including other recurring \nfunding within Tribal Priority Allocations; requires renegotiation or \nrejection of a previously executed Self-Governance Compact or Funding \nAgreement or a provision therein; prohibits a Self-Governance Tribe/\nconsortium from investing funds received under Self-Governance Compacts \nin a manner consistent with the ``prudent investor'' standard; requires \nany Self-Governance Tribe/consortium to adopt ``conflict of interest'' \nstandards which differ from those previously adopted by its governing \nbody; applies project-specific construction requirements to a tribal \nassumption of project design and other construction management services \nor of road construction activities involving more than one project; or \nfails to provide that ``Inherent Federal functions'' for purposes of \nthe published regulations shall mean those Federal functions that \ncannot be legally transferred to a Self-Governance Tribe/consortium.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to inquire of the chairman on one of these eight \nimpasse issues. Is it your understanding that the Department would have \nthe regulatory authority, in one of the objectionable regulatory \nprovisions, to delete unilaterally certain provisions in the various \nCompacts of Self-Governance that the Department has signed with various \ntribal governments and that have existed as long as nine years? I \nthought we expressly indicated in 1994 when we gave permanent authority \nto the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration program that these Compacts \nand Annual Funding Agreements are to be bilateral agreements reached on \na government-to-government basis that cannot be unilaterally amended by \nthe Department?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator is correct. In 1994, the Congress received \na series of complaints from Indian tribes that the Department was \nattempting to unilaterally amend agreements it had previously reached \nwith Indian tribes who were assuming functions previously carried out \nby Federal officials. The Congress had to remind the Department in 1994 \nthat it must treat the agreements it reached with Indian tribes as \nbilateral accords that cannot be amended except by mutual consent. Now, \nthe Department is insisting on a regulation that would permit it to \nunilaterally revise agreements it had previously reached on a bilateral \nbasis with individual Indian tribes. The American Indian and Alaska \nNative organizations find these and the remaining seven regulatory \nprovisions objectionable, and I agree with them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I hope the Department will withdraw its proposals to \nregulate in each of these eight areas. The negotiated rulemaking \nprocess works best when it is based upon consensus, and in these eight \ninstances the Department has failed to make its case for regulations.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleagues. I share their concerns. I am \nhopeful that in bringing affected parties together we can resolve these \ndifferences.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator and will work with him on this \nissue in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7537-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FLEXIBLE TRADE POLICY TOWARD CUBA\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss American relations with \nCuba. Recently, I had the opportunity to travel to Havana with Senators \nBaucus and Roberts. We spent ten hours with Fidel Castro, in what has \nbeen characterized by the press as a marathon meeting. But more \nimportantly, we had meetings with dissidents and Catholic Church \nrepresentatives.\n  It was my first time in Cuba, and I went there with no pre-conceived \nnotions although I did have the opportunity to be thoroughly briefed \nprior to our departure.\n  I returned from Cuba convinced that lifting the trade embargo and \nrestrictions on travel, especially for educational exchanges, are \nextremely important steps in an effort to foster economic and political \nliberalization in Cuba. They are important steps but not for the \nreasons which are generally assumed.\n  As one Cuban told us, ending the American economic embargo on Cuba \nwill not produce economic change. The Castro government has no interest \nin economic reform--even along the lines of that now seen in China or \nVietnam. As the Minister of Economics and Planning explained, there is \nno program for privatization in the economy, insisting that capitalism \ndoes not work but ``pure socialism'' does. The government allows some \nprivate investments, mainly in farming, but the intent of the State is \nstill to control the economy. Indeed, President Castro told us that he \nbelieved Cuba could not survive if it was a member of the International \nMonetary Fund and called the IMF the ``world's most subversive \norganization.''\n  While this was denied by the Foreign Minister, I came away convinced \nthat the government does not want the American embargo on Cuba lifted \nbecause the lack of economic ties allows the government to blame the \nUnited States for its own economic failures. If the embargo was lifted, \nCuba's leaders might find another excuse for their failed policies but \nit might make it harder for them to find widely acceptable excuses.\n  The Cuban people have voted already for change. Many have fled to the \nUnited States. One Cuban told us that social and economic differences \nare increasing. The population has declined over the last decade in \npart because people sadly see no future for their children. The average \nCuban salary is said to be $11 per month. The Castro regime was \ndescribed to us by those we spoke to in Havana as a dying dictatorship: \naging, inefficient and corrupt.\n  In this environment we should not exaggerate America's influence. \nCastro will do everything to limit it. But we can start to build a \nbasis for a future relationship with the Cuban people after Castro. The \nCongress can demonstrate our good will by a partial lifting of the \ntrade embargo. We can demonstrate our good faith by allowing freer \nmovement of Americans to Cuba and to do what we can to encourage \nCubans, especially school children, to visit the United States on \nexchanges. The Congress should promote cultural ties and try to direct \nassistance to the Cuban people.\n  None of this will be easy. Nothing Castro said indicated to me that \nhe was willing to permit, for example, Cuban school children to attend \nAmerican elementary and secondary schools or colleges in significant \nnumbers. Nothing Castro said indicated to me that he was willing to \nallow American aid, including medical supplies, to be given directly to \nthe Cuban people.\n  But even if the hand of friendship is rejected, I believe we should \nstill offer it. The future of Cuba is not Castro. President Castro said \none clear truth: Cuba still suffers from an inherited history of four \ncenturies of colonialism. Unfortunately, he does not understand that \nhis form of paternal dictatorship perpetuates the same horrors he \nclaims to abhor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7537-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

DANIEL C. WALL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nDaniel C. Wall, who will leave his elected position as Commander of The \nSons of The American Legion, Detachment of Michigan, in August. For the \nlast year, Mr. Wall has led the Michigan Detachment of the S.A.L. with \nwisdom and with grace, and has used his time in this position to aid \nthe Veterans of the United States Armed Forces in an exemplary fashion.\n  Mr. Wall has served in the Sons of The American Legion for many \nyears, and holds a Life Membership card from Robert A. Demars Sons of \nThe American Legion Squadron 67 of Lincoln Park, Michigan. During his \ntime as a member, he has held many offices within the S.A.L., including \nall offices at the Squadron level; District Commander, Adjutant, and \nothers; State Commander, Adjutant, and Zone 1 Commander.\n  Mr. Wall was elected to serve as the State of Michigan Commander in \n1999. During his time in the position, Mr. Wall focused much of his \nattention upon the education of his fellow members, so that they might \nknow more about the purpose, programs, awards, officer duties and the \nbenefits of their organization. He believed that this would not only \nhelp to recruit new members, but would also give current members a \nbetter appreciation for the many beneficial things that the S.A.L. does \non a daily basis.\n  As Commander, Mr. Wall has also presided over the many efforts of the \nS.A.L. in the State of Michigan, including assisting local posts in \ntheir activities, initiating programs for Veterans, volunteering at \nV.A. homes and hospitals, and fundraising. In 1999, the S.A.L. raised \nover $514,000 for V.A. homes and hospitals, and over $181,000 for the \nAmerican Legion Child Welfare Foundation. In addition, Mr. Wall has \nserved as a member of national S.A.L. committees.\n  I applaud Mr. Daniel C. Wall on the job he has done as State of \nMichigan Commander of the Sons of the American Legion. He has dedicated \nmuch of his life to improving the lives of the Veterans of our great \nNation, and for this he is to be commended. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I thank Mr. Wall for his dedication, and wish him \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7538-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7538-S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            A TRIBUTE TO ``TALK OF VERMONT'S'' JEFF KAUFMAN\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to mark the end \nof an era in Vermont. Jeff Kaufman, host of Vermont's award-winning \nprogram, ``The Talk of Vermont,'' will hang up his headphones at the \nend of this week. After 5 years on the air in Middlebury, Jeff and his \nfamily are leaving the Green Mountain State for the arguably less green \npastures of Southern California.\n  A fixture on Vermont morning radio and a catalyst for thoughtful and \nprovocative discussion of the key issues facing our state and nation, \nJeff has not only brought wit and wisdom to the airwaves, but he has \nconsistently managed to recruit big-name guests--Lily Tomlin, Ted \nWilliams, Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist--to our small-\nmarket corner of the world, while never neglecting lesser-known local \nvoices. Above all else, Jeff does his homework--he is equally adept at \nunderstanding the intricacies of missile defense as he is the physics \nof baseball.\n  While living in Middlebury, Jeff did not just entertain his listeners \non the radio, but he became a valued member of the community, whether \nit was raising money for flood victims or serving as a member of the \nCitizens of Middlebury.\n  I am certain that I speak for my colleagues in the Vermont \nCongressional delegation--each of us has had the pleasure of Jeff's \nunique brand of inquisition--when I say that he will be a tough act to \nfollow. He has provided an extraordinary service to Vermonters who have \nbenefitted from his professionalism, his insights and his curiosity. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff for a job well \ndone and to wish him and his family well in every future endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a profile of Jeff \nfrom The Burlington Free Press, dated July 23, 2000.\n  The material follows:\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 23, 2000]\n\n     Radio's Inventive ``Talk of Vermont'' Is About To Grow Silent\n\n                          (By Chris Bohjalian)\n\n       It is an overcast weekday morning smack in the center of \n     summer. It is hot and sticky, and there's absolutely nothing \n     in the air that might be mistaken for a breeze.\n       I am leaning against the side of a gazebo in Middlebury \n     during the town's annual celebration on the green, waiting \n     for Jeff Kaufman, host of the WFAD radio show ``The Talk of \n     Vermont,'' to arrive. The show is about to broadcast live \n     from the commons.\n       Abruptly, a slim guy with hair the color of sand just after \n     the surf has receded coasts across the grass on a bicycle \n     with a copy of one of my books under his arm. He says \n     something I can't hear to the engineer, who is battling with \n     miles of wires and the sort of microphone that I thought \n     existed only in radio and television museums, and the \n     engineer laughs. Then he turns to me and introduces himself.\n       This is Kaufman, and no more than 90 seconds later--still \n     without breaking a sweat, despite the heat and his last-\n     minute arrival--he has me seated in a folding metal chair, \n     and we are on the air. It is clear within minutes that he not \n     only has read my most recent novel, be has read the ones that \n     preceded it. All of them. He has read the column I write for \n     this newspaper. He has read a surprising number of the \n     articles I have written for different magazines.\n       You have no idea how rare this is.\n       I have done easily a hundred-plus radio and television \n     interviews in my life, and the vast majority of the time the \n     very first question I am asked is this: ``So, tell us about \n     your new book.'' The reason? There is a not a soul in the \n     studio other than me, including the person with whom I am \n     speaking, who has the slightest idea what the book is \n     about.\n       In truth, why should they? How could they? Think of the \n     number of guests who pass through a radio or television talk \n     show every week. It's huge, and it takes time to read a \n     novel.\n       Almost every weekday morning for the better part of a \n     decade, Kaufman has done his homework on his guests and then \n     offered the state some of the very best radio in Vermont. \n     Sometimes his show has been broadcast on five stations, and \n     sometimes it has been on only one, but it has never affected \n     the first-rate quality of the program.\n       It was three years ago that I met Kaufman on the commons in \n     Middlebury, and I have come to discover that day in, day out \n     he corralled terrific guests. Lily Tomlin one day, Ted \n     Williams the next. One morning he might be moderating a live \n     debate between U.S. Senate hopefuls Jan Backus and Ed \n     Flanagan, and the next he might be chatting with Middlebury \n     biographer, poet and novelist Jay Parini about--basketball.\n       On any given day, he was as likely to have an acrobat from \n     the Big Apple Circus performing--literally--on the stool in \n     his studio as he was to have an expert from Washington, D.C., \n     on the proposed ``Star Wars'' missile defense system.\n       Now, alas, we are about to begin Kaufman's last week. He \n     and his family are leaving for California in early August, \n     and Kaufman will no longer be a fixture on Vermont radio. \n     There is no question in my mind that this is a real loss--and \n     not simply because Kaufman is a first-rate interviewer and \n     radio personality. He was also a part of the community. He \n     used his show to find food and clothes for those families \n     that had to leave their homes after the summer flood of 1998, \n     and to raise money to help build a new Lincoln Library.\n       Sometimes I wonder if Kaufman had the ratings he deserved, \n     but regardless of whether he had 12 or 1,200 people tuned in, \n     he never gave his audience a small-market effort.\n       Happy trails, my friend. We'll miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7539-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MS.

Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of \nMichigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary \nof its landmark welfare reform initiative, ``To Strengthen Michigan \nFamilies,'' by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month \nsince, the award has been given to an individual who participates in \nthe initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-\nsufficiency. I rise today to recognize Ms. Lorie Fooce, the recipient \nof the award for the month of July, 2000.\n  Ms. Fooce, a single mother, applied for assistance in August, 1994, \nin order to provide for her family. She was approved for ACD/FIP, food \nstamps, and Medicaid. At the time, Ms. Fooce lacked the necessary job \nskills and experience to maintain a steady, sufficient income. However, \nwithin that same month, she took the initiative to enroll in Certified \nNurses Aid (C.N.A.) training through Work First.\n  Ms. Fooce was able to complete the training and was subsequently \nhired by Gogebic Medical Care. With the help of Work First, which paid \nfor the C.N.A. training, testing fees, transportation, and uniforms, \nshe has become a valued employee at Gogebic.\n  Ms. Fooce's FIP case closed in May, 1999. In order to best care for \nher family, she currently receives food stamps, Medicaid, and day care \nassistance to supplement her earnings.\n  I applaud Ms. Lorie Fooce for being named Achiever of the Month for \nJuly of 2000. She has shown a sincere dedication to her job and to the \ngoals of self-improvement and self-sufficiency, and the progress she \nhas made shows both great effort and great determination.

On July 30, Senator Vaughn, the Associate President Pro Tempore \nfor the Michigan State Senate, will be honored for his tireless public \nservice to Detroit and the entire state of Michigan.\n  Senator Vaughn's history of public service is truly deserving of \nrecognition. For the past twenty-two years this ``Man of Peace'' has \nrepresented the Fourth Senatorial District of Michigan with a sense of \njustice and concern for all members of society. He has drafted wide-\nranging legislation that has, among other things, sought to expand \nvoting rights, promote peace and provide educational opportunities for \nall citizens.\n  Such a diverse array of interests and concerns should come as no \nsurprise to those who know Jackie. Senator Vaughn is a renaissance man \nwho has been educated at many of the world's finest institutions of \nhigher learning. The recipient of a Fullbright Scholarship, Senator \nVaughn has received the Oxon B. Litt from England's Oxford University, \na Master's Degree from Oberlin College and a B.A. from Hillsdale \nCollege. In addition, has been awarded honorary doctorates from \nHighland Park College, Marygrove College, Shaw College and the Urban \nBible Institute.\n  Senator Vaughn has sought to pass his love of learning on to \nsubsequent generations through his teaching at the University of \nDetroit, Wayne State University and Hartford Memorial Church where he \nhas led the Contemporary Issues Sunday School Class for twenty years.\n  Senator Vaughn can take pride in his long and honorable service in \nthe Michigan State Senate.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rabbi \nSteven Weil, who on August 20, 2000, will be honored for over six years \nof faithful service at Young Israel of Oak Park, the largest Orthodox \nsynagogue in Michigan. Rabbi Weil will soon move to the Los Angeles \narea to pursue a large pulpit position in another Orthodox synagogue, \nand this occasion provides the Orthodox Jewish Community of Detroit \nwith an opportunity not only to say good-bye to Rabbi Weil, but also to \nthank him for the wonderful work he has done during the past six years.\n  Under the guidance of Rabbi Weil, the congregation of Young Israel \ndoubled in size, an accomplishment which can be directly attributed to \nhis devotion to spreading the tenets of his faith. In addition to \ndeveloping a lecture and discussion series within his own congregation, \nhe and his wife, Yael, were frequent lecturers at the Agency for Jewish \nEducation and at the Jewish Community Center. He also had an on-going \ncable television series on the topic of Jewish history.\n  Rabbi Weil had a vision of creating cohesiveness within the Jewish \ncommunity and developing future Jewish leadership. He was able to \nachieve this goal by enacting several different programs, including a \ntrip to Israel and Prague for young Jewish Orthodox, Conservative and \nReform couples, as well as a March of the Living Youth Unity Mission. \nHe also headed the Metropolitan Detroit Federation Young\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\nLeadership Cabinet, an organization which tutors the future leaders of \nthe Detroit Jewish community.\n  Rabbi Weil served on the boards of Yad Ezra, the Detroit kosher food \nbank, the Jewish Apartments and Services and the Neighborhood project. \nHe was one of eight rabbis in North America selected to be a L.E.A.D \nfellow, with the responsibility of leading Orthodox rabbis into the \n21st century. He was also on the executive committee of the Council of \nOrthodox rabbis in Detroit and of the National Rabbinical Council of \nAmerica.\n  I applaud Rabbi Steven Weil for his many contributions to the Jewish \ncommunity of the State of Michigan. He is a man dedicated to his faith, \nhis family and his community, and he will be dearly missed.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     Commonwealth of Guam relative to the Visa Waiver Pilot \n     Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                           Resolution No. 357\n\n       Whereas, the Visa Waiver Pilot Program was initially \n     enacted into law by the United States Congress in 1986; and\n       Whereas, as the Visa Waiver Pilot Program is considered \n     only a ``Pilot Program,'' Congress regularly extends the \n     expiration date and has done so throughout the Pilot Programs \n     existence; and\n       Whereas, the current Visa Waiver Pilot Program expired on \n     the 30th day of April, 2000; and\n       Whereas, the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the \n     United States Department of Justice on the 25th day of May, \n     2000, issued a circular notifying all carriers, who are \n     participating in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, of an interim \n     plan to provide entry privileges to travelers who would have \n     applied for admission under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program; \n     and\n       Whereas, under the interim plan, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service will parole for a period of ninety \n     (90) days all eligible Visa Waiver Pilot Program country \n     nationals who arrive for legitimate business or travel \n     purposes, and who would have been admitted under the Visa \n     Waiver Pilot Program prior to its expiration; and\n       Whereas, the circular further provides, that Nationals of \n     the Visa Waiver Pilot Program countries will still be \n     required to complete ``Form I-94W''; however, neither an \n     additional application nor an additional fee will be required \n     when arriving at an airport; and\n       Whereas, the Immigration and Naturalization Service also \n     noted that this interim plan would change if Congress either \n     extends the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, or makes it permanent \n     before the 30th day of June, 2000; and\n       Whereas, on the 1st day of March, 2000, Representative \n     Lamar Smith introduced H.R. 3767 in the United States House \n     of Representatives, that would amend the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act to make improvements to and permanently \n     authorize, the Visa Waiver Pilot Program under Sec. 217 of \n     the Act; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3767 was referred to the House Committee on \n     the Judiciary wherein, H.R. 3767 was placed before the \n     Committee for consideration and Mark-Up and was subsequently \n     reported out by the Committee and placed on the Union \n     Calendar, as Calendar Number 308; and\n       Whereas, on the 11th day of April, 2000, H.R. 3767 was \n     presented to the House for adoption, wherein H.R. 3767 passed \n     as amended and agreed by a voice vote of the House; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3767 was transmitted by the House and \n     received by the Senate on the 12th day of April, 2000; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3767 was read twice in the Senate and placed \n     on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders, \n     designated, Calendar Number 524; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the expiration of the Visa Waiver \n     Pilot Program, tourists arriving on Guam now endure long \n     lines and added transit time in order for the INS Office to \n     process their travel documents; and\n       Whereas, this delay has caused an economic impact on tour \n     companies that have had to absorb additional costs because of \n     the delay in Immigration processing; and\n       Whereas, tourism is our number one industry and has only \n     recently reflected positive signs of growth; however, with \n     the inordinate amount of time it now takes to go through the \n     immigration procedures, this could discourage potential \n     visitors to our Island; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3767 has received bipartisan support in the \n     House; unanimously passed by the Subcommittee on Immigration \n     and Claims and the Committee on the Judiciary; and has \n     received strong support from the tourism and travel industry; \n     and\n       Whereas, the implementation of the Visa Waiver Pilot \n     Program has enabled Guam to promote its number one industry--\n     Tourism; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request that the United States Senate expeditiously act upon \n     H.R. 3767; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests to, the adoption hereof and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable Albert \n     Gore, Jr., President of the United States Senate; to the \n     Honorable Trent Lott, Majority Leader of the United States \n     Senate; to the Honorable Thomas Daschle, Minority Leader of \n     the United States Senate; to the Honorable Lamar Smith, \n     Member of Congress, U.S. House of Representatives;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to a single statewide \n     reimbursement rate; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 60\n\n       Whereas, the Health Care Financing Administration provides \n     health insurance for over 74 million senior Americans through \n     Medicare; and\n       Whereas, providers of the Medicare managed care plans are \n     decreasing in Louisiana and other states; and\n       Whereas, some providers of managed care plans have \n     withdrawn from certain parishes and withdrawn from the state \n     of Louisiana because of low reimbursement rates; and\n       Whereas, Medicare reimbursement rates drastically vary \n     between urban and rural parishes; and\n       Whereas, the reimbursement rates for rural parishes are \n     drastically lower than those rates for urban parishes; and\n       Whereas, the cost to treat these enrollees does not \n     significantly differ from parish to parish. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to mandate \n     that the Health Care Financing Administration revise the \n     Medicare managed care plan rates so that the reimbursement \n     rates do not vary significantly. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Health Care Financing Administration \n     institute a single statewide rate throughout the state to \n     promote equal access for all citizens of the state of \n     Louisiana. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-609. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to providing funds under \n     the River and Harbor Act; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 40\n\n       Whereas, for well over twenty years the Congress of the \n     United States has funded monies for the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers' Aquatic Plant Control Program; and\n       Whereas, the monies for this program have been used to \n     assist the various states in the control and eradication of \n     such evasive plant species as water hyacinth, hydrilla and \n     salvinia; and\n       Whereas, beginning in 1997 the Clinton administration \n     terminated funding for the spraying aspect of the Aquatic \n     Plant Control Program, providing money only for research \n     purposes; and\n       Whereas, the cessation of this funding has resulted in the \n     elimination of the spraying program so necessary to control \n     the spread of evasive plants such as water hyacinth, hydrilla \n     and salvinia, and\n       Whereas, it has been estimated that salvinia alone will \n     infest over forty-five thousand acres in Louisiana in the \n     year 2000; and\n       Whereas, it has been further estimated that two and one-\n     half million dollars will be necessary to control the further \n     spread of salvinia alone; and\n       Whereas, control and the eventual removal of these evasive \n     plants is absolutely necessary if Louisiana is to control and \n     maintain its waterways; and\n       Whereas, without the assistance of federal funding it will \n     become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to continue \n     the spraying program so necessary for the control of these \n     plants. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide the \n     necessary funding under the River and Harbor Act for the\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Aquatic Plant Control Program. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress,\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-610.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nour farmers fight back against the unfair trade practices of state \ntrading enterprises. As many of my colleagues know, state trading \nenterprises are government sanctioned monopolies that control commodity \nexports. Their unfair practices allow them to undercut prices of U.S. \ncommodities, both in our market and in overseas markets where we \ncompete for exports. My legislation, the Export Enhancement Program \nTrigger Act of 2000, would direct our government to fight back against \nthese unfair practices.\n  I am introducing this legislation in response to the experience of \nfarmers in North Dakota, who have been forced to compete not just with \nforeign farmers, but with foreign state trading enterprises. Ever since \nthe U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) took effect, North Dakota \nfarmers have been flooded with a rising tide of imports of Canadian \ngrains.\n  These imports are coming into our country not because Canadian \nfarmers are more competitive, but because of flaws in the CFTA and the \nunfair actions of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB). As negotiated by \nthen-USTR Clayton Yeutter, the CFTA allows the Canadian Wheat Board to \nsell into our market at less than the total cost of acquiring and \nselling its grain.\n  The fact is that the Canadian Wheat Board is a government created and \ngovernment supported monopoly. Because Canadian farmers are required to \nsell their grain to the Wheat Board, the Wheat Board gets its wheat at \nbelow market prices and can then tell its customers in this country or \noverseas that it will undercut U.S. prices. These practices amount to \nde facto subsidies, but because the Wheat Board operates in secret, \nthese unfair practices are not subjected to the normal rules of \ninternational trade.\n  This unfair competition caused imports of wheat from Canada to \nincrease steadily until, in 1993-94, they reached a record 2.4 million \ntons of total wheat and 575,000 tons of durum. These levels of imports \ncaused unacceptable damage to North Dakota farmers, so I convinced the \nClinton Administration to impose limits on Canadian imports. Under the \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) negotiated with Canada, durum imports \nwere limited to 300,000 tons and total wheat imports were limited to \n1.5 million tons in 1994-95.\n  These limits worked. Imports of Canadian grain fell dramatically for \nseveral years. Unfortunately, however, the authority to impose these \nlimits disappeared as a result of the Uruguay Round Agreements. As a \nresult, our friends to the north are once again on the move, attacking \nour markets, using the monopoly power of the Canadian Wheat Board to \nundercut prices for our farmers.\n  Last year, imports from Canada again approached their 1993-94 peaks \n(2.2 million tons of total wheat and 560,000 tons of durum), and this \nyear they are on track to stay far above the MOU level (2 million tons \nof total wheat and 480,000 tons of durum). This is unacceptable. It is \nfar past time to send a clear and unmistakable message to our friends \nin Canada that the U.S. will not tolerate these practices any longer--\nthat we will fight back.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will do exactly that. My \nlegislation would require USDA to use the Export Enhancement Program--\nEEP--in either of two circumstances.\n\n  First, if imports of durum or wheat into the U.S. from Canada exceed \nthe\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\nlimits set in the MOU--300,000 tons for durum and 1,500,000 tons for \ntotal wheat imports--USDA would be required to use EEP to export wheat \nor durum into markets where we compete with Canada in a quantity equal \nto at least twice the total amount of Canadian imports into the U.S. \nfor that year.\n  This will clearly tell Canada that it will lose far more in its \noverseas markets than it gains in our markets if it persists in \nexporting more than the MOU levels. As a result, I expect that Canada \nwill again voluntarily comply with the MOU limits as it did in 1995-96 \nand 1996-97. Even if Canada does not comply, though, this legislation \nwill ensure that U.S. farmers do not bear the costs of Canadian \nimports. By requiring the U.S. to export twice as much wheat as we are \nimporting from Canada, this legislation will ensure that total supply \nwill be reduced and prices will strengthen.\n  Second, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a state \ntrading enterprise (STE) like the Canadian Wheat Board is using unfair \ntrade practices to reduce our exports of any agricultural commodity to \noverseas markets, the Secretary is required to respond by using EEP in \nan amount sufficient to ensure that prices received by U.S. farmers are \nnot reduced as a result of the STE's actions. Too often, we have heard \nfrom our industry and our USDA officials that Canada is arbitrarily \nundercutting U.S. prices in overseas markets. My proposal would require \nUSDA to respond, to ensure that we do not give up our export markets \nwithout a fight.\n  Taken together, these two provisions will support the efforts of our \ntrade negotiators to discipline STES as part of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) negotiations on agriculture. Disciplining STEs is a \ntop priority for our negotiators, and this legislation, by defining the \nmarketing practices of STEs as unfair trade practices, will increase \nour negotiators' leverage to develop meaningful rules on STEs.\n  Moreover, I believe these provisions will support the efforts of \nNorth Dakota farmers, acting through the Wheat Commission, in bringing \na trade case against Canada. I have always believed that, ultimately, \nCanadian agricultural trade issues will have to be resolved through \nnegotiation. It is my hope that, in combination, this legislation and \nthe trade case will provide short term relief for our farmers and help \nbuild sufficient pressure on Canada to negotiate a permanent resolution \nof Canadian grain issues.\n  I have no doubt that our friends to the north will not like this \nlegislation. They do not like having a spotlight focused on their \nsystem, so they will complain about our use of EEP. I have a simple \nanswer for them: If they do not want us to use EEP against them, they \nshould stop dumping their grain into our market and stop using unfair \ntrade practices in overseas markets.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has the support of every major \nfarm group in North Dakota with an interest in these issues, including \nNorth Dakota Farmers Union, North Dakota Farm Bureau, North Dakota \nWheat Commission, North Dakota Grain Growers, and the North Dakota \nBarley Council.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 2914. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to require partial \nrebates of FHA mortgage insurance premiums to certain mortgagors upon \npayment of their FHA-insured mortgages; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                     homeowners rebate act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreduce the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) homeownership tax. I am \njoined in this effort by Senator Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee. This legislation was introduced earlier in the month \nby Congressman Rick Lazio of New York. Congressman Lazio chairs the \nHouse Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity.\n  This homeownership tax comes in the form of excess premiums paid by \nthose who have FHA insured mortgages on their properties. The FHA \nMutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI fund) collects mortgage insurance \npremiums in order to cover any losses to the government that result \nfrom FHA-insured mortgage defaults and to fund the administrative costs \nof the FHA program.\n  FHA is an important program for first-time, low and moderate income, \nand minority homeowners. These families should not be overcharged in \nFHA premiums. Premiums in excess of an amount necessary to maintain an \nactuarially sound reserve ratio in the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance \nFund can only be characterized as a tax on homeownership. The Congress \nhas determined that a capital reserve ratio of 2 percent of the MMI \nfund's amortized insurance-in-force is necessary to ensure the safety \nand soundness of the MMI fund. According to the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development the FY 1999 capital reserve ratio is 3.66 percent \nand is estimated to rise to over 3.8 percent in FY 2000, nearly twice \nthe reserve ratio mandated by Congress.\n  The FHA single family mortgage program was designed to operate as a \nmutual insurance program where homeowners were granted rebates of \nexcess premiums. This rebate program was suspended at the direction of \nCongress in 1990 when the MMI fund was in the red--with the intent that \nthe payment of distributive shares or rebates would resume when the \nFund was again financially sound. Since 1990 a number of steps have \nbeen taken to strengthen the FHA program. The premiums were increased \n(Congress mandated the addition of a risk-based annual premium to the \none-time, up front premium), downpayment requirements were improved, \noversight by HUD and the Congress was strengthened, and Congress \nmandated the minimum 2 percent capital reserve ratio. With a capital \nreserve ratio nearly twice that mandated by the Congress it is time to \nresume rebates and return the MMI program to its prior status as a \nmutual insurance fund. This legislation restores the rebates for \nmortgages insured for 7 years or more and paid off subsequent to the \n1990 rebate suspension.\n  The legislatively mandated improvements in the FHA program have \ncertainly been partially responsible for the strength of the MMI fund. \nBut another major reason for this strength is the fact that we have \nexperienced a near perfect economy in recent years. I recognize that \nthis will not always be the case. We should therefore proceed carefully \nwhen we propose to lower or rebate premiums. This legislation takes the \ncautious approach of providing for rebates only when the reserve ratio \nis in excess of 3 percent, or 150 percent of the reserve level mandated \nby Congress. If the capital reserve ratio drops below 3 percent, the \nrebates will be suspended. The legislation also requires that the \nGeneral Accounting Office evaluate the adequacy of the 2 percent \ncapital reserve ratio for ensuring the safety and soundness of the MMI \nfund and make a recommendation to Congress regarding the most \nappropriate reserve ratio at which to trigger future premium rebates.\n  I invite my colleagues to review this important legislation and join \nwith me in reducing this tax on homeownership. By enacting this \nhomeownership rebate we will continue to help make homeownership \naffordable for more and more Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record following this statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2914\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make improvements in the operation and \nadministration of the Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE FEDERAL COURTS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today entitled \nthe ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000.'' Every few years, the \nJudicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, contacts \nCongress regarding changes to the law the Judicial Conference believes \nare necessary to improve the functions of the courts. As chairman of \nthe Judiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I have \nthe responsibility to review the operation of the federal court process \nand procedures. In the past, I have also been in the forefront of \nadvocating that the federal judicial system be administered in the most \nefficient and cost-effective manner possible while maintaining a high \nlevel of quality in the administration of justice. The bill I am \nintroducing, along with Senator Torricelli, the Ranking Member of my \nsubcommittee, is a consensus bill that includes many of the \nrecommendations made by the Judicial Conference.\n  The Judicial Conference has noted a problem that continues to plague \nthe Federal judicial system is the lack of up-to-date technologies that \nwould reduce costs while at the same time improve the efficiency of its \nadministration along with a wide range of judicial branch programs. The \n``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' attempts to addresses this \nproblem. In accordance with federal policy to defray the cost of \nproviding services by assessing a fee for their use, sections of this \nbill provide the judiciary with the authority to set, collect, and \nretain fees to be used to acquire information technologies, such as \nelectronic filing, video conferencing, and electronic evidence \npresentation devices. This section requires that the fees collected are \nto be deposited into the Judiciary Information Technology Fund and used \nfor reinvestment in information technology. I feel that granting the \njudiciary the authority to collect and retain these fees will go a long \nway toward improving the efficiency of the judicial system while \nproviding substantial savings for litigants and attorneys.\n  This bill addresses two areas in which I have taken a personal \ninterest, over the years: reducing unnecessary expenses and improving \nthe efficiency of the judicial system. This bill would help achieve \nboth. Traditionally, the safeguards applicable to criminal defendants \ncharged with more serious crimes have not been applicable to petty \noffense cases because the burdens were deemed undesirable and \nimpractical in dealing with such minor offenses. Currently, U.S. \nMagistrate Judges may preside over petty offense cases charging a motor \nvehicle offense and infractions, without the consent of the defendant. \nThis bill removes the consent requirement in all other petty cases--a \nposition repeatedly supported by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates. Additionally, this bill authorizes magistrate judges to try \nmisdemeanor cases involving juveniles currently tried in district \ncourt. Removing the consent requirement from these petty offense cases \nand authorizing magistrate judges to preside over all juvenile \nmisdemeanors would free-up valuable district court resources that could \nbe used to deal with more serious crimes and offenders while reducing \nthe time and expense necessary in dealing with these offenses.\n  Another section of the bill also contains provisions that would free \nup district court resources and allow federal judges more time to deal \nwith their civil and criminal dockets. These provisions raise the \nmaximum compensation level paid to federal or community defenders \nrepresenting defendants appearing before United States magistrates or \nthe district courts before they must seek a waiver for payment in \nexcess of the prescribed maximum. Payment in excess of the maximum \ncurrently requires the approval of both the judge who presided over the \ncase and the chief judge of the circuit. This procedure in turn \nincreases the amount of time judges must devote to non-judicial \nmatters. The last increase was instituted fourteen years ago. During \nthis time, the effects of inflation have significantly eroded the \ncompensation paid to federal and community defenders.\n\n  The Judicial Conference has expressed to me their concern over a \ngrowing trend of ``Criminal Justice Act'' (CJA) panel attorneys being \nsubject to unfounded suits by the defendants they previously \nrepresented and the financial damage these attorneys have to deal with \nwhen they must pay to defend themselves in these actions. These unfair \ncosts have the potential of having a chilling effect on the willingness \nof attorneys to participate as panel attorneys and will only make it \nmore difficult to obtain adequate representation for defendants. \nCurrently, the CJA authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office \nof the United States Courts to provide representation and indemnify \nfederal and community defender organizations for malpractice claims \nthat arise as a result of furnishing representational services. Panel \nattorneys are the only component of the appointed counsel program who \nare not permitted to receive CJA-funded coverage for any costs \nassociated with defending against a malpractice claim by a CJA client. \nOur bill rectifies this oversight in the CJA, and provides CJA panel \nattorneys the same protection as other federal defenders.\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nProvisions in our bill authorize the judge who presides over a case, at \nhis discretion, to reimburse panel attorneys for out-of-pocket expenses \nfor civil claims arising for their CJA services. The judge would \nexercise his discretion limiting the amount of reimbursement available \nfor a panel attorney as he views appropriate under the circumstances, \nas has been the practice with respect to malpractice claims against \nother federal defenders.\n  In addition, the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' also \ncontains provisions designed to assist handicapped employees working \nfor the federal judiciary. These provisions bring the federal judicial \nsystem in-line with the Executive Branch and other governmental bodies.\n  The bill also contains a number of other provisions that we believe \nare necessary to improve the Federal Courts' administration, judicial \nprocess and matters relating to public defenders, as well as other \nitems that enhance the operation of the Federal judiciary. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us and support these improvements to our Federal \nCourt system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2916. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to provide separate subheadings for hair clippers used for \nanimals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           tariff classification correction for hair clippers\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would \namend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to allow for a separate subheading \nfor hair clippers used for animals.\n  As a result of the ongoing beef hormone dispute with the European \nUnion (EU), the United States Trade Representative has released a list \nof products upon which retaliatory duties of 100 percent will be \nplaced. The proposed list was issued pursuant to Section 407 of the \nTrade and Development Act of 2000. Furthermore, Section 407 explicitly \nstates that the products on this list must be goods of industries that \nare affected by the EU's non-compliance in the beef hormone dispute.\n  Since beard trimmers used by humans and hair clippers for animals for \nuse on the farm are both currently included under the same subheading \nwithin the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, human beard trimmers could \npotentially be subject to the retaliatory duties. However, the personal \ncare industry, and specifically human beard trimmers, has no \nrelationship with the beef hormone industry as is required by Section \n407.\n  To address this problem, and to ensure that products are not \ninadvertently subjected to these retaliatory tariffs, I am introducing \nlegislation that would provide a separate subheading to clippers used \nfor animals. This legislation would prevent imposing duties on products \nthat have no significant bearing or connection to the EU beef hormone \ncase and would assist in the fair and equitable application of our \ntrade laws. I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this simple \nclarification of our tariff schedule.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2917. A bill to settle the land claims of the Pueblo of Santo \nDomingo; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n           SANTO DOMINGO PUEBLO CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Santo Domingo Pueblo is one of the \nlargest Indian pueblos in New Mexico. It is located north of \nAlbuquerque and South of Santa Fe, about midway between the two. For \nabout 150 years, some 80,000 acres have been in dispute with \nneighboring Indian pueblos, Spanish land grants, and private land \nholders. Many of these disputes have been in court, but remain \nunsettled.\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues that three years of negotiations \nhave produced a settlement agreement. Our legislation would ratify that \nagreement, thus resolving a complex land ownership situation in New \nMexico.\n  The initial Spanish land grant establishing the Santo Domingo Pueblo \nGrant was issued in 1689. When this Spanish grant was surveyed in the \nmid-19th century, approximately 24,000 acres of land to the east of the \ncurrent reservation boundary were erroneously excluded. The excluded \nlands are now held in private deeds and public lands, but not by Santo \nDomingo Pueblo.\n  The Pueblo of Santo Domingo purchased the Diego Gallegos Spanish Land \nGrant to expand its reservation on the west end. That purchase excluded \nsome privately held lands and overlapped with both the San Felipe and \nCochiti Pueblos.\n  Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands have also \nbeen claimed by Santo Domingo Pueblo.\n  The global settlement we are endorsing, resolves the complex set of \ntitle disputes between Santo Domingo, the Pueblos of San Felipe and \nCochiti, the federal government, and private land holders.\n  In return for both money and land, the Santo Domingo Pueblo will \nwaive their land claims and remove the clouded title for private land \nholders. This settlement envisions a monetary settlement of $23 \nmillion. Of that amount, $8 million would be payable from the Judgment \nFund. The remaining $15 million would be from appropriated accounts \nover a three year period at $5 million per year, beginning in FY 2002.\n  Approximately 4500 acres of BLM land would be conveyed to Santo \nDomingo Pueblo, and the Pueblo would have an option to purchase 7000 \nacres of Forest Service land for the agreed upon price of $3.7 million.\n  Three lawsuits will be settled by this legislation. The first is \nPueblo of Santo Domingo v. United States. This case is over 50 years \nold and was filed under the Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA). In \nthis action, the Pueblo asserts monetary claims against the United \nStates for trespass, lost use, and breach of the ICCA's ``fair and \nhonorable dealings'' provision by the United States. The Pueblo's \nclaims, based on its Spanish land grants, involve more than 80,000 \nacres of land. Our legislation affirms the compromise award of $8 \nmillion for these claims and also includes the Pueblo's stipulated \nsettlement of the ICCA case.\n  The second lawsuit is Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. Rael. This issue \nstems from the Pueblo's purchase of the Diego Gallegos Grant. The \nPueblo sought possession of land from a private landowner in the same \ngrant. The Federal District court for the District of New Mexico \nentered judgment for the Pueblo. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered \nthe Rael action held in abeyance until the Government intervened in \nRael or judgment was entered in the overlapping ICCA case. To date, \nneither has occurred. The settlement legislation will resolve the \nissues in the Rael case.\n  The third lawsuit to be settled by this legislation is United States \nv. Thompson. In this case, the United States sought to enforce the \nPueblo's title against third-party owners who trace their titles to \noverlapping land grants. In 1991, the Tenth Circuit held that the \nUnited States' claim for the Pueblo was time-barred. The Court of \nAppeals, however, found that the Pueblo Lands Board had ignored an \nexpress Congressional directive in its determination that the overlap \nlands were not the Pueblo's lands.\n  The Court of Appeals did not resolve the ownership question, again \ndue to the time bar. These overlap lands are currently in the \npossession of non-Indians and in the Army Corps of Engineers. This \nglobal settlement will resolve the ownership questions in favor of the \nprivate landowners and the Army Corps of Engineers in the overlap area.\n  The global nature of this settlement will put all these issues to \nrest. Assuming the Congress agrees with our legislation, the next step \nwould be entry of the stipulated settlement of the ICCA case and \ndismissal with prejudice of the Pueblo's existing quiet title action in \nRael. The Pueblo of Santo Domingo would then receive both the money and \nthe lands agreed to in this settlement agreement. In addition to \nwaiving its ICCA claims and the Rael case, the Pueblo agrees to waive \nother existing land claims.\n  In this settlement agreement, the Congress would ratify and resolve \nthe Pueblo's land claims with finality and do so in a principled way \nwhich serves the interests of all parties. The Pueblo of Santo Domingo \nboundaries have been in dispute since the mid-19th century. This \nsettlement resolves the Pueblo of Santo Domingo claims once\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\nand for all, and clearly delineates the Pueblo's boundaries.

Mr. President, too many Americans nearing age 65 face a \ncrisis in health care. They are too young for Medicare, and unable to \nobtain private coverage they can afford. Often, they are victims of \ncorporate down-sizing, or of a company's decision to cancel its health \ninsurance. These Americans have been left out and left behind through \nno fault of their own--often after decades of loyal work--and it is \ntime for Congress to provide a helping hand.\n  Almost three and a half million Americans ages 55 to 64 have no \nhealth insurance today, including more than 60,000 in Massachusetts. \nMany of these Americans have serious health problems that threaten to \ndestroy the savings of a lifetime and that prevent them from finding or \nkeeping a job. Even those without significant health problems know that \na serious illness could wipe out their savings.\n  Even those with good coverage today can't be certain it will be there \ntomorrow. No one nearing retirement can be confident that the health \ninsurance they have now will protect them until they qualify for \nMedicare at 65.\n  The health and financial well-being of these near-elderly are often \nat risk because of the serious gaps in our health care system. Those \nwithout coverage are twice as likely to be in fair or poor health than \npersons with coverage. They are four times as likely not to receive a \nrecommended medical test or treatment, and five times as likely to \nforego needed medical care when they are sick.\n  The bill that Senators Rockefeller, Daschle, and I are introducing \ntoday is a lifeline for these Americans. It is a constructive step \ntoward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental \nright to health care. It will enable uninsured Americans ages 62 to 65 \nto buy into Medicare by paying monthly premiums. It will also enable \nthose ages 55 to 61 who lose their jobs to buy in. In addition, it will \nhelp retirees ages 55 and older whose health insurance is terminated by \ntheir employers by extending COBRA.\n  Finally, tax credits equal to 25% of the premium will be available \nfor enrollees in all three programs to help them afford to buy into the \nprograms. The estimated cost of the tax credits is $8.4 billion over \nthe next ten years.\n  In the past, opponents have used scare tactics to claim that these \nproposals pose a threat to Medicare. They are nothing of the kind. \nThere is no additional burden of Medicare as a result of this \nlegislation. The tax credits are paid for by general treasury funds. \nThe Medicare costs are paid for through enrollee premiums. The existing \nMedicare Trust Fund is protected by placing the programs in their own \ntrust fund. The Medicare Trustees will monitor the program to ensure \nthat it is self-financing.\n  The number of near-elderly who are uninsured is growing every year. \nRelief of this kind was originally proposed by President Clinton, and \nit deserves broad bipartisan support. The health and financial \nconsequences of the lack of insurance are significant--especially for \nthe near-elderly. These Americans need and deserve the help that this \nbill provides. We intend to do all we can to see that this proposal is \nenacted as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2919.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n            indian gaming regulatory improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President today I am pleased to introduce the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 2000 to make specific and \nwhat I feel are needed changes to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of \n1988, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2701, et seq. (``IGRA'').\n  The IGRA was signed into law in 1988 with two broad goals in mind: \nFirst, to provide for the continued economic opportunities tribal \ngaming presents to Indian tribes, and second, to provide a regulatory \nframework for tribal gaming to ensure the integrity of such gaming for \nthe benefit of tribes as well as customers of tribal gaming operations.\n  In 1988, tribal gaming was a relative new activity and in 12 years \ntribal gaming gross revenues have grown from $500 million to $8.26 \nbillion. By statute these revenues are spent by tribal governments on \nphysical infrastructure, general welfare and the betterment of Indian \nand surrounding non-Indian communities.\n  For the 198 tribes that now conduct some form of gaming the economic \nbenefits for the tribes as well as surrounding communities cannot be \nignored. For these communities collectively, unemployment has dropped \nand tribes who operate gaming have been able to provide for housing, \nhealth care and education for their members and to generate hundreds of \nthousands of jobs for Indians and non-Indians alike.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is not intended and should not \nbe viewed as a comprehensive attempt to remedy all matters that have \narisen in the past 12 years. Rather, this bill takes aim at very \nspecific items.\n  1. With regard to gaming fees assessed against tribal operations, \nthis bill will require the Federal National Indian Gaming Commission to \nlevy fees that are reasonably related to the duties of and services \nprovided by the Commission to tribes, and in certain instances to \nreduce the level of fees payable by those operations;\n  2. It establishes a Trust Fund for such fees that can only be tapped \nfor the specific activities of the Commission mandated by the IGRA;\n  3. It provides statutory authority for the Commission to establish \nthrough a negotiated rule-making process, Minimum Standards for the \nconduct of tribal gaming, acknowledging that for class III gaming the \nstandards are to be determined by the tribe and the state through \nnegotiated gaming compacts;\n  4. It authorizes technical assistance to tribes for a number of \npurposes including strengthening tribal regulatory regimes; assessing \nthe feasibility of non-gaming economic development activities on Indian \nlands; providing treatment services for problem gamblers; and for other \npurposes not inconsistent with the IGRA;\n  5. It launches a negotiated rulemaking to eventually clarify the \ncurrent conflict between the IGRA and other Federal law with regard to \nthe classification of certain games conducted by tribes; and\n  6. Last, to bring the Commission in line with all other Federal \nagencies it specifically subjects the Commission to the reporting and \nother requirements of the Federal Government Performance and Results \nAct.\n  Mr. President, while there are other matters that Indian tribes and \nothers wish to address that are not included in this bill, I am hopeful \nthat people of good will find this legislation to be appropriate, \nreasonable and targeted to specific issues that he arisen in the part \n12 years.\n  It is my hope that we can debate and discuss the bill in Committee to \nget the views of affected parties and iron out whatever differences \nthere may be.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Gaming Regulatory \n     Improvement Act of 2000''.\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \namend the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National \nEnvironmental and Native America Public Policy Act of 1992 to expand \nopportunities for the Morris K. Udall Foundation to assist tribal \ngovernments with leadership and management training. I am pleased that \nSenator Inouye is an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  This legislation is mostly technical in nature. It extends the \nauthority of the Udall Foundation, located at the University of Arizona \nin Tucson, to implement a leadership and management training program, \nto be called the ``Native Nations Institute for Leadership, Management \nand Policy.''\n  The 1992 Act which created the Udall Foundation is already authorized \nto implement programs to assist tribal governments with training for \nNative American and Alaska Native professionals in public policy. This \nlegislation simply authorizes the Udall Foundation to carry out another \nstep in its mission.\n  The Native Nations Institute will provide practical leadership and \nmanagement training as well as policy analysis, in a variety of fields, \nfor native people and communities to further the goals of tribal self-\ngovernance. The Native Nations Institute will facilitate this training \nthrough a unique partnership between the University of Arizona, the \nUdall Foundation and the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic \nDevelopment.\n  Mr. President, the Native Nations Institute will enable tribal \nleaders and decision-makers to access professional leadership and \nmanagement training to prepare current and future tribal leaders to \ntackle the socioeconomic, educational and other fundamental challenges \nfacing tribal communities.\n  Companion legislation has been introduced in the House with \nbipartisan support. In the short time remaining in this Congressional \nsession, I hope that we can proceed with prompt passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the legislation in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of final \npassage of H.R. 4040, The Long-Term Care Security Act. As the lead \nDemocratic sponsor of the Senate companion to this bill, S. 2420, I \nbelieve this is an important part of our down-payment on finding \nsolutions to the exploding problem of long-term care.\n  Without long-term care coverage, no family has real security against \nthe costs of chronic illness or disability. The Long-Term Care Security \nAct H.R. 4040 (S. 2420), does 4 things:\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\n  1. Enables federal and military workers, retirees and their families \nto purchase long-term care insurance at group rates--projected to be 15 \npercent to 20 percent below the private market.\n  2. Creates a model that private employers can use to establish their \nown long-term care insurance program.\n  3. Provides help to those who practice self-help by offering \nemployees the option to better prepare for their retirement.\n  4. Reduces the reliance on federal programs, like Medicaid, so the \nAmerican taxpayer benefits. Federal workers also benefit because they \nare paying lower premiums than they would get in the private market.\n  I am a strong supporter of The Long-Term Care Security Act because it \ngives people choices, flexibility and security. Faced with a sick \nparent or spouse, most Americans currently do not have a lot of \nchoices. They may choose, or be forced, to spend down their assets in \norder to qualify for Medicaid. They, or a spouse, may quit their job to \ndo some of the caregiving themselves. Or, families may be forced to \nmake the difficult choice of putting a child through college, or paying \nfor long-term care for a parent. This legislation gives people better, \nmore informed choices.\n  It also provides people with flexibility because beneficiaries will \nhave different types of settings where they can receive care. They may \nchoose to be cared for in the home by a family caregiver--or they may \nneed a higher level of care that nursing homes and home health care \nservices provide. Different plan reimbursement options will ensure \nmaximum flexibility that meet the unique health care needs of the \nbeneficiary.\n  Long-term care insurance also provides families with some security. \nFamily members will not be burdened by trying to figure out how to \nfinance health care needs--and beneficiaries will be able to make \ninformed decisions about their future.\n  Some of us have faced the challenge of having a family member who \nneeded long-term care. It is emotionally and financially difficult. \nBut, imagine if you are a secretary working at the Social Security \nAdministration, or a custodial worker here in the Senate. And a family \nmember gets Alzheimers, or Parkinsons, or has some other illness that \nrequires long-term health care. Your paycheck probably isn't big enough \nto cover the cost of home health visits, or a nursing home stay. So \nwhere do you go? Medicare doesn't cover long-term care so that is not \nan option. Should you quit your job so you can take care of your \nparent? But then what if you have a family of your own that you need to \nsupport? Or, what if you are trying to put a child through college?\n  Consider if you are a 61 year old employee at NASA and you are \ndiagnosed with cancer. You might be able to retire, but the federal \nemployees health benefits program does not cover long-term care--even \nfor retirees. You may not have family to provide care and your pension \nprobably isn't large enough to finance the high costs of long-term \ncare. Where do you go?\n  Many Americans are currently facing these difficult decisions. \nConsider that:\n  At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older currently need long-\nterm care.\n  As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-term care \nneed.\n  41 percent of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or take family \nmedical leave to care for a frail older parent or parent-in-law.\n  80 percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and \nfriends.\n  These statistics represent the enormous financial and emotional costs \nassociated with long-term care. This legislation is an essential step \nin providing opportunities for federal workers to plan ahead for \nretirement so they can take responsibility for their future long-term \ncare needs.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people \nafford the burdens of long-term care. Eleven years ago, I introduced \nlegislation now known as Spousal Anti-Impoverishment. My bill changed \nthe cruel rules of government that forced elderly couples to go \nbankrupt before they could get any help in paying for nursing home \ncare.\n  Through the Older Americans Act, seniors have easier access to \ninformation and referrals they need to make good choices about long-\nterm care. I am also working hard to create a National Family \nCaregivers Program so that families can access comprehensive \ninformation when faced with the dizzying array of choices in addressing \nthe long-term care needs of a family member.\n  It is clear that we have a long-term care problem. The Office of \nPersonnel Management estimates that 96,000 federal employees will be \nretiring in the year 2001. Providing federal employees with a long-term \ncare insurance benefit is a down payment on a solution.\n  I am starting with federal employees for two reasons. As our nation's \nlargest employer, the federal government can be a model for employers \naround the country whose workforce will be facing the same long-term \ncare needs. Starting with the nation's largest employer also raises \nawareness and education about long-term care options.\n  I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so \nmany of them live, work, and retire in Maryland. They work hard in the \nservice of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting \nfor fair COLAs, lower health care premiums, or to prevent unwise \nschemes to privatize important services our federal workforce provide, \nthey can count on me.\n  One of my principles is ``promises made should be promises kept.'' \nFederal employees and retirees have made a commitment to devote their \ncareers to public service. In return, our government made certain \npromises to them. One important promise made was the promise of health \ninsurance. The lack of long-term care for federal workers has been a \nbig gap in this important promise to our federal workers. This \nlegislation will close that gap and provide our federal workers and \nretirees with comprehensive health insurance.\n  I reiterate my commitment to finding long-term solutions to the long-\nterm care problem. I am proud that this bipartisan bill takes an \nimportant step forward in helping all Americans to prepare for the \nchallenges facing our aging population.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cleland, Senator Grassley, Senator \nAkaka, Senator Cochran, Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson for all \nof their hard work in coming to a bipartisan consensus on how best to \nprovide federal and military employees, retirees, and their families \nwith the opportunity to purchase long-term care insurance. \nAdditionally, many Senate staff worked very hard in developing this \ncompromise: Nanci Langley, Hope Hegstrom, Michael Loesch, Tamara Jones, \nJudy White, Larry Novey, and Dan Blair. And I would like to thank \nCynthia Brock-Smith and Frank Titus at the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, and the bill be considered read the \nthird time.\n  I further ask that H.R. 4040 be discharged from the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Senate proceed to its consideration. I \nfurther ask consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and \nthe text of S. 2420, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof. I further \nask consent that the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, the amendment to the title be \nagreed to, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I finally ask consent that S. 2420 be placed back on the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4040), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \n     the establishment of a program under which long-term care \n     insurance is made available to Federal employees, members of \n     the uniformed services, and civilian and military retirees, \n     provide for the correction of retirement coverage errors \n     under chapters 83 and 84 of such title, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/25/senate-section/article/S7582-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7582-S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 2000\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I say to the Chair today, with the 45 minutes just outlined, would \nthat answer still be, yes, it could be filed under that 45-minute \nperiod in the morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES.
