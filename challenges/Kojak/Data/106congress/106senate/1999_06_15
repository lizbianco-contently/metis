Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided for closing arguments on S. 96, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between and among the \n     several States by providing for its orderly resolution of \n     disputes arising out of computer-based problems related to \n     processing data that includes a two-digit expression of the \n     year's date.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain Amendment No. 608, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Sessions Amendment No. 623 (to Amendment No. 608), to \n     permit evidence of communications with State and Federal \n     regulators to be admissible in class action lawsuits.\n       Gregg/Bond Amendment No. 624 (to Amendment No. 608), to \n     provide for the suspension of penalties for certain year 2000 \n     failures by small business concerns.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after discussion with the distinguished \nDemocrat manager, Senator Hollings, I would like to modify the \nunanimous consent agreement to allow Senator Hollings and I 3 minutes \neach before the vote on final passage is taken. I will withhold that \nrequest to clear it on both sides. But I think it is appropriate after \nwe have votes on amendments that Senator Hollings and I be allowed to \nmake brief statements before the final vote on this very important \nissue. So I will withhold that unanimous consent request, but I intend \nto make it at the appropriate time.\n  Also for the information of my colleagues, I believe we may not \nrequire a vote on the Sessions amendment--I believe we are working that \nout on both sides--and we may not require a vote on the Gregg amendment \nas well, although neither have been worked out on both sides. We are \nattempting to do that. So it is entirely possible that at 2:15 we would \nbe moving to final passage.\n  I note that it is acceptable to the other side, so I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify the unanimous consent request, that Senator Hollings \nbe allowed 4 minutes and I be allowed 4 minutes prior to the vote on \nfinal passage of the pending Y2K legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe it is in the unanimous consent \nagreement that there be 2 hours equally divided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, we are about to culminate the work of many months: \ninvestigation, drafting, negotiation, and compromise. The vote we take \ntoday\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nwill set the tone for the Senate in the new millennium. The Senate will \neither rise to the challenge that the Y2K problem poses and provide a \nproactive solution, or it will allow traditional political loyalties to \nleave us in reactive mode after a problem exists. I am optimistic that \nmost of my colleagues recognize the importance of providing a balanced \napproach to avoiding a Y2K litigation quagmire, to preserving the \nnation's economy and providing support to the creativity and ingenuity \nthat makes this country the world's leader in technology.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that many compromises have been made \nin this bill since it passed out of the Commerce Committee. It is \ncertainly not as strong a bill as that passed by the House. These \ncompromises have been made in order to get a bill that can have \nbipartisan approval and can be signed into law. We cannot play politics \nwith this important issue--we must ensure that this legislation becomes \nlaw. On the other hand, I have stated clearly that I will not be party \nto passing a mere facade. Unless we really accomplish something, we \ncannot take credit for doing so. Even with all of the compromises we \nhave made to get the legislation to this point, I firmly believe that \nthe legislation will be effective.\n  Before we vote, I want to walk through the provisions of the \nlegislation and correct some misconceptions as to how this bill would \noperate. With all of the rhetoric of the past several days, I think \nthere has been some concern about the operation of the legislation, \nwhich I want to allay.\n  First, it is critical to remember that this legislation addresses Y2K \nfailures which may be encountered by every industry, business, and \nconsumer in the country. This legislation is not designed to protect \nthe high tech industry or provide it immunity. The intent of the \nlegislation is to provide a balance and orderly system for the \nresolution of Y2K failures in a manner that is fair, ensures that real \nproblems experienced by consumers and businesses alike are addressed \nquickly, without litigation whenever possible, and that the judicial \nsystem is not overrun with opportunistic and creative lawsuits. It is \nnot the redress of real problems that this legislation seeks to limit.\n\n  It is important to keep in mind that this legislation is supported by \nthe broadest array of interests I have ever seen in support of \nlegislation. They represent companies which will be plaintiffs, those \nwho will be defendants, and those who will likely be both. These varied \ninterests have debated among themselves many of the points raised on \nthe floor of the Senate regarding the balance between plaintiffs and \ndefendants. The compromises made since the bill was passed from the \nCommerce Committee also have refined the balance. What remains today to \nbe voted upon is a good piece of legislation for every segment of the \nnation's economy.\n  Let me also reiterate that the Y2K date code problem is not simple to \ncorrect. Millions of lines of code are involved, many in outdated \nlanguages or in applications that have been revised and upgraded more \nthan once or twice. Multiple means of correcting the date codes adds to \nthe challenge, as does the rare occurrence of leap year in the first \nyear of a new century. Uncertainty as to all the affected embedded \nchips, the interface of the various corrections, and the complexities \nof solving the date code without affecting other aspects of a date \nprogram, all make this a complex problem requiring massive dedication \nof technical ingenuity to correct. Although the opponents of this \nlegislation would like the country to think the solution is simple and \ncould have and should have been fixed a long time before now, it is not \nso simple.\n  Businesses in every industry will spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars to correct the problem. Estimates are that the costs in the \nUnited States alone will be between $100 and $200 BILLION--without \nlitigation costs. There will undoubtedly be shifts of costs from one \nbusiness to another, from one industry to another, from consumer to \nmanufacturer, as the ramifications of the problem are better known. The \npurpose of this legislation is to provide rules and mechanisms for this \nprocess of cost shifting; rather than focusing on blame, to focus on \nsolutions, prevention and remediation of real problems, rather than \nanticipated or perceived problems.\n  Let me review some of the most important aspects of S. 96:\n  First, I want to emphasize that this legislation does not affect \npersonal injury cases. We have done nothing to alter the current law \nregarding how personal injury or wrongful death claims would be \nhandled.\n\n  Second, let me state clearly that this legislation sunsets. It \napplies only to problems that occur within 3 years. This legislation \nwill not change American law for all time.\n  The notice provisions provide time for the potential plaintiffs and \ndefendants to resolve Y2K problems without litigation. The notice \nperiod is 30 days. Only if the defendant responds by fixing the problem \nis another 60 days provided to allow remediation to be completed. If \nthere is no response, or if the defendant declines to fix the problem, \nthe plaintiff can sue on the 31st day. The emphasis here is on \nproviding notice that there is a problem so that it can be fixed. Most \npeople want their equipment to work--they don't want a lawsuit. This \nprovision ensures that the first order of business is to offer an \nopportunity to fix the problem. In no way does this provision deny \nsomeone's right to sue. Instead, it should speed up resolution of \nproblems.\n  A requirement for pleading material injury ensures that the cases \nwhich are litigated are those in which there is real injury. This \nsection will not cause problems for consumers or businesses with actual \nY2K-related failures. It will cause a problem for plaintiffs solicited \nfor class actions where no injury has occurred, as in the increasingly \nfamous California case brought by Tom Johnson.\n  To remind my colleagues, that is the case brought against six \nretailers in California, not to remedy any failure or injury, but to \ndisgorge profits made over the past 5 years from selling unspecified \nproducts which may or may not be Y2K compliant. The clear intent of \nthis litigation is a large settlement. That kind of profiteering \nlitigation is the kind of litigation which S. 96 seeks to curb. Our \njudicial system should not be clogged with possible Y2K failures, nor \nnovel complaints to ensure the payment of lottery-type settlements and \nattorneys' fees.\n  The economic loss rule further ensures that contract actions will not \nbe ``tortified.'' Why is this important? Historically contract actions \nhave provided as remedy the ``benefit of the bargain,'' but not \npunitive damages. The ``benefit of the bargain'' may include lost \nprofits or similar compensatory damages to ensure that the plaintiff is \nmade whole. By turning contract actions into tort actions, aggressive \nattorneys can claim the more lucrative punitive damages which are not \ncompensatory in nature and allow a windfall from which to pay \nattorneys' fees.\n  However, banning the ``tortification'' of contracts does not leave a \nconsumer without remedies for real problems. Principles of contract law \ngovern many situations where only a verbal contract, not a written \ncontract, exists. Additionally, the legislation does not affect rights \nunder State Uniform Commercial Code and consumer protection laws.\n  Punitive damage awards have been limited for small businesses, but \nnot for large businesses, in recognition that small companies are \nespecially vulnerable to an onslaught of litigation. No caps are \napplicable, however, if the defendant has intentionally caused injury, \nsince such conduct is egregious and should not be protected. These \nmodest limitations also prevent frivolous lawsuits. This is especially \nreasonable here where we have eliminated personal injury claims, thus \nthe damages suffered are all economic in nature.\n  We have preserved contracts as written to ensure that preexisting \ncontractual relationships are maintained. The parties will receive the \nfull benefit of their bargain. When the terms of a contract are in \nconflict with this legislation, the contract prevails. There is no \nreason for attorneys to say, as some trial lawyers have, that the \nlegislation would alter a businessman's right to sue a vendor who does \nnot perform a contract because of a Y2K failure. He can. But the \nlegislation provides a notice period in which the vendor can, and \nshould, remedy the problem without the time and expense of litigation.\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n  A critical provision of the legislation provides that where \nlitigation is necessary, the defendants will pay for their \nproportionate share of the damage. This is fair. A defendant pays for \nthe damage he caused. It also eliminates the incentive to sue the \n``deep pockets'' who may not be primarily responsible for the problem. \nExceptions are provided for small plaintiffs who should not be at risk \nfor collecting a damage award, and for situations where a defendant, \nbecause of particularly egregious behavior, should bear the burden of \ncollecting from other defendants.\n  Those who oppose the bill have alleged that these provisions will \nactually deter responsible companies from taking necessary action to \nprevent Y2K failures. The facts do not support this claim. All one has \nto do is take a quick look at the year 2000 related Internet links to \nsee that massive efforts are already being made to make information \nabout Y2K problems and solutions available.\n  A recent EDS, Electronic Data Systems, ad highlights its free of \ncharge, on-line data base that lists over 230,000 products from more \nthan 5,000 vendors, with links to the vendors, instructions for making \nproducts Y2K compliant, and links to other related sites. The ad claims \nthat the site receives 56,000 hits a day.\n\n  Both the EDS site and other sites provide step-by-step checklists and \nresource information for solutions. Why is this information being made \navailable? Because the United States is the world's leader in \ntechnology. One of the reasons for the high-tech industry's success is \nthat it has responded well to the marketplace. Preventing Y2K problems, \nletting other businesses and industries know about the problem and how \nto solve it, make good business sense.\n  If so much work is going into solving the Y2K problem then why do we \nneed this legislation?\n  As I have stated before, the cost of solving the Y2K problem is \nstaggering. Experts have estimated that the businesses in the United \nStates alone will spend $50 billion in fixing affected computers, \nproducts and systems. But what experts have also concluded is that the \nreal problems and costs associated with Y2K may not be the January 1 \nfailures, but the lawsuits filed to create problems where none exist. \nAn article in USA Today on April 28 by Kevin Maney sums it up:\n\n       . . . Experts have increasingly been saying the Y2K problem \n     won't be so bad, at least relative to the catastrophe once \n     predicted. Companies and governments have worked hard to fix \n     the bug. Y2K-related breakdowns expected by now have been \n     mild to nonexistent. For the lawyers, this could be like \n     training for the Olympics, then having the games called off.\n       . . . The concern, though, is that this species of Y2K \n     lawyer has proliferated, and now it's got to eat something. \n     If there aren't enough legitimate cases to go around, they \n     may dig their teeth into anything. . . . In other words, \n     lawyers might make sure Y2K is really bad, even if it's not.\n\n  The sad truth is that litigation has become an industry. While many \nfine attorneys represent their clients ethically and in a scrupulous \nmanner, litigation has become big business for a segment of the trial \nbar.\n  A panel of experts predicted at an American Bar Association \nconvention last August that the legal costs associated with Y2K will \nexceed that of asbestos, breast implants and tobacco and Superfund \ncombined. A reported 500 law firms across the country have put together \nY2K litigation teams.\n  As we have already seen in the Tom Johnson case in California, where \nno real injury or damage exists, novel theories are pursued to divert \nattention from prevention and remediation to defending litigation. Time \nand resources that could be spent on improving technology are diverted \nto litigation and settlement costs and attorneys' fees.\n  During a hearing on this legislation in the Commerce Committee \ntestimony was presented from two small businessmen who were concerned, \nlegitimately, about problems they had faced with Y2K failures, or \nanticipated failures. The esteemed Ranking Member of the Committee has \noften mentioned their testimony on the floor. Both expressed concern \nthat they would be prevented by this legislation from bringing suit, or \nfrom being compensated for their damages. In both instances, not only \nwould this legislation not elimate their right to sue, it might help \nprevent the need to sue. The notice provisions and remediation period \nwould assure prompt attention and resolution to their complaints.\n  We cannot lose sight of the bigger picture in terms of cost of \nlitigation. The costs of both bringing and defending lawsuits are \npassed on by the businesses and industries into higher prices and \ncutbacks in jobs or new orders. The impact on our economy of an \navalanche of frivolous lawsuits will be felt by all of us. If we do not \ncurtail litigation costs, we will all pay a price in higher prices for \ncomputer and software goods, higher prices for every other retail good \nwith embedded chips, higher prices for insurance, and slower, more \nexpensive increases in technological advances. Money that is spent on \nlitigation is money that is not spent on creating new jobs, providing \nbetter incomes, retaining our nation's competitive edge.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. It is bipartisan, and again I want to thank Senators Wyden \nand Dodd for all they have done to make it so. It is reasonable and \npractical. It presents a good balance between the interests of \nplaintiffs and defendants and will prevent needless and costly \nlitigation. It will assist in preserving the best economy our country \nhas ever enjoyed. I will encourage the continued prosperity and \nleadership of our nations' technology industries as we enter the new \nmillennium. It will prevent our nation's courts from being clogged for \nyears with litigation that offers no one prosperity except for the \nlawyers. The emphasis in approaching the Y2K problem must be on \nprevention, remediation and prompt resolution of Y2K problems. This \nlegislation meets those goals.\n  The coalition of support for this bill is compelling. This \nlegislation is important not only to big business and high tech, but to \nsmall businesses, retailers, wholesalers, insurance, consultants--\nvirtually every segment of the business community.\n  Time is of the essence. For this legislation to provide the direction \nand impetus desired to assure prevention and remediation of Y2K \nproblems, it must be passed now. We have spent several months getting \nto this point. Let me be clear. This legislation will make a \ndifference. If we don't pass it, we will be failing to provide \nleadership for our country. I fear that a year from now we will again \nturn to this issue, but only after an avalanche of lawsuits has stymied \nthe economy. Support this legislation and be part of the Y2K solution.\n  I again thank Senators Dodd and Wyden and many others for all of \ntheir efforts. I also want to congratulate Senator Hollings, my friend \nfrom South Carolina, for an impassioned and very compelling argument in \nopposition to this legislation. I have always enjoyed debating him on a \nvariety of issues, and I know no one who is better informed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  He and I work very closely together. The chairman of our committee \nhas gained a reputation against charades and frauds and make-believes \nand pork and all these things. That is why it doesn't please this \nparticular Senator that he would take this one on.\n  The truth of the matter is that, generally speaking, it is a \nnonproblem. If there is a problem, the best of the best, Intel, has a \nweb page we lifted just yesterday afternoon entitled ``Updating Your \nComponents, Updating Your PC Hardware.''\n  ``If you have determined that your PC hardware is not capable of \nhandling the century rollover''--so forth and so on, about how to \nmanually reset and install a BIOS upgrade or patch, if available.\n\n       1. Manually reset the date after December 31, 1999, the \n     first time you turn on your PC or laptop after December 31, \n     1999, and before you use any software applications, simply \n     reset the operating system date on the computer. For nearly \n     all PCs and laptops, this is the easiest and safest way to \n     ensure the computer will handle dates properly in the year \n     2000. Once reset, the PC hardware clock will maintain the \n     correct date when powered off and on or rebooted.\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\n       2. Install a BIOS upgrade or ``patch,'' if available if you \n     wish to ensure that your PC hardware is capable before the \n     new millennium begins. You may want to install a BIOS upgrade \n     or software ``patch'' before the end of 1999. Some PC \n     hardware manufacturers and BIOS and software vendors are \n     offering free BIOS upgrades.\n\n  I was wondering, Mr. President, about the time, the minimum amount of \ntime, as I understand, and the cost.\n  I lifted, again, in searching back in 1998, an article entitled, \n``Tool fixes PC Y2K glitch,'' priced at $94.95.\n  We are hearing millions and billions and everything else, Chick \nLittle, the sky is falling.\n\n       A lot of people still don't seem to realize that even \n     though they purchase their PC in 1998, it doesn't mean that \n     the system is compliant. There are still PCs out there that \n     are not fully compliant. Tools like the [PCfix2000] provide \n     users with a solution for addressing this.\n\n  Then they go on to describe this $94.95 fix.\n  I noticed in the month of March, on March 10 of this year:\n\n       The easiest way to prepare your PCs for the new millennium \n     is with Y2K diagnostic software. We chose five sub-$50 \n     programs that both check your computer for year 2000 \n     compliance and solve any problems they find: Check 2000 PC \n     Deluxe, IntelliFix 2000, Know2000, Norton 2000, and 2000 \n     Toolbox. We scrutinized each program and, finally, chose a \n     winner. (Mac owners: Your machines are, and always have been, \n     free of the Y2K bug.)\n\n  That interested me, because we only just last week had Michael Dell \nof Dell Computers, the largest producers of computers in the United \nStates, and he had advertised with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that all Dell computers were Y2K compliant.\n  I ask unanimous consent, once again, to print this March issue of \nBusiness Week in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Mar. 1, 1999]\n\n                      Be Bug-Free or Get Squashed\n\n      (By Marcia Stepanek, Ann Therese Palmer, and Michael Shari)\n\n       Lloyd Davis is feeling squeezed. In 1998, his $2 million, \n     25-employee fertilizer-equipment business was buffeted by the \n     harsh winds that swept the farm economy. This year, his \n     Golden Plains Agricultural Technologies Inc. in Colby, Kan., \n     is getting slammed by Y2K. Davis needs $71,000 to make his \n     computer systems bug-free by Jan. 1. But he has been able to \n     rustle up only $39,000. His bank has denied him a loan \n     because--ironically--he's not Y2K-ready. But Davis knows he \n     must make the fixes or lose business. ``Our big customers \n     aren't going to wait much longer,'' he frets.\n       Golden Plains and thousands of other small businesses are \n     getting a dire ultimatum from the big corporations they sell \n     to: Get ready for Y2K, or get lost. Multinationals such as \n     General Motors, McDonald's, Nike, and Deere are making the \n     first quarter--or the second at the latest--the deadline for \n     partners and vendors to prove they're bug-free. A recent \n     survey by consultants Cap Gemini America says 69% of the \n     2,000 largest companies will stop doing business with \n     companies that can't pass muster. The National Federation of \n     Independent Business figures more than 1 million companies \n     with 100 workers or less won't make the cut and as many as \n     half could lose big chunks of business or even fail.\n\n\n                               weak links\n\n       Cutting thousands of companies out of the supply chain \n     might strain supply lines and could even crimp output. But \n     most CEOs figure it'll be cheaper in the long run to avoid \n     bugs in the first place.\n       Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the \n     past year, Prudential Insurance Co. has cut nine suppliers \n     from its ``critical'' list of more than 3,000 core vendors, \n     and it continues to look for weak links, says Irene Dec, \n     vice-president for information systems at the company. At \n     Citibank, says Vice-President Ravi Apte, ``cuts have already \n     been made.''\n       Suppliers around the world are feeling the pinch. Nike Inc. \n     has warned its Hong Kong vendors that they must prove the're \n     Y2K ready by Apr. 1. In India, Kishore Padmanabhan, vice-\n     president of Bombay's Tata Consultancy Services, says repairs \n     are running 6 to 12 months behind. In Japan, ``small firms \n     are having a tough time making fixes and are likely to be the \n     main source of any Y2K problems,'' says Akira Ogata, general \n     research manager for Japan Information Service Users Assn. \n     Foreign companies operating in emerging economies such as \n     China, Malaysia, and Russia are particularly hard-pressed to \n     make Y2K fixes. In Indonesia, where the currency has \n     plummeted to 27% of its 1977 value, many companies still \n     don't consider Y2K a priority.\n       A December, 1998 World Bank survey shows that only 54 of \n     139 developing countries have begun planning for Y2K. Of \n     those, 21 are taking steps to fix problems, but 33 have yet \n     to take action. Indeed, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, \n     an international group of more than 230 institutions in 46 \n     countries, has reconsidered its December, 1998 promise to the \n     U.N. to publish its country-by-country Y2K-readiness ratings. \n     The problem: A peek at the preliminary list has convinced \n     some group members that its release could cause massive \n     capital flight from some developing countries.\n       Big U.S. companies are not sugarcoating the problem. \n     According to Sun Microsystems CEO Scott G. McNealy, Asia is \n     ``anywhere from 6 to 24 months behind'' in fixing the Y2K \n     problem--one he says could lead to shortages of core \n     computers and disk drives early next year. Unresolved, says \n     Guy Rabbat, corporate vice-president for Y2K at Solectron \n     Corp. in San Jose, Calif., the problem could lead to price \n     hikes and costly delivery delays.\n       Thanks to federal legislation passed last fall allowing \n     companies to share Y2K data to speed fixes, Sun and other \n     tech companies, including Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, \n     Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Motorola, are teaming up to \n     put pressure on the suppliers they judge to be least Y2K-\n     ready. Their new High-Technology Consortium on Year 2000 and \n     Beyond is building a private database of suppliers of \n     everything from disk drives to computer-mouse housings. He \n     says the group will offer technical help to laggard firms--\n     partly to show good faith if the industry is challenged later \n     in court. But ``if a vendor's not up to speed by April or \n     May,'' Rabbat says, ``it's serious crunch time.''\n\n\n                                warnings\n\n       Other industries are following suit. Through the Automotive \n     Industry Action Group, GM and other carmakers have set Mar. \n     31 deadlines for vendors to become Y2K-compliant. In March, \n     members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will meet \n     with their counterparts from the Food Marketing Institute to \n     launch similar efforts. Other companies are sending a warning \n     to laggards--and shifting business to the tech-savvy. ``Y2K \n     can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize the \n     supply chain,'' says Roland S. Boreham, Jr., chairman of the \n     board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, Ark.\n       In Washington, Senators Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.) and \n     Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) have introduced separate bills to \n     make it easier for small companies like Davis' to get loans \n     and stay in business. And the World Bank has shelled out $72 \n     million in loans and grants to Y2K-stressed nations, \n     including Argentina and Sri Lanka. But it may be too little \n     too late: AT alone has spent $900 million fixing its \n     systems.\n       Davis, for one, is not ready to quit. ``I've survived \n     tornadoes, windstorms, and drought,'' he says. ``We'll be \n     damaged, yes, but we'll survive.'' Sadly, not everyone will \n     be able to make that claim.\n\n         WHY BIG BUSINESS MAY HAVE A SMALL-BUSINESS Y2K PROBLEM\n               [A January survey of small-business owners]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAware of the Y2K problem......................................        55\nAre taking action to fix it...................................        38\nPlan to take action but haven't yet...........................        19\nNo action taken and none planned..............................        18\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nData: National Federation of Independent Business.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is very short.\n\n       Multinationals such as General Motors, MacDonald's, Nike, \n     and Deere, are making the first quarter--or the second at the \n     latest--the deadline for partners and vendors to prove \n     they're bug free. A recent survey by consultants Cap Gemini \n     America says that 69% of the 2,000 largest companies will \n     stop doing business with companies that can't pass muster. \n     The National Federation of Independent Business figures more \n     than 1 million companies with 100 workers or less won't make \n     the cut and as many as half could lose big chunks of business \n     or even fail.\n       Some small outfits are already losing key customers. In the \n     past year, Prudential Insurance has cut 9 suppliers from its \n     critical list of 3,000 core vendors.\n\n  Citibank has already cut. Cuts have already been made.\n  I read further down:\n\n       If a vendor is not up to speed by April or May, it is a \n     serious crunch problem. Through the Automotive Industry \n     Action Group, General Motors and other car makers have set a \n     March 31 deadline for vendors to become Y2K compliant. In \n     March, members of the Grocery Manufacturers of America will \n     meet with their counterparts from food marketing to launch \n     similar efforts. Other companies are sending a warning to \n     laggards and shifting business to the tech-savvy.\n\n  Now I quote:\n\n       ``Y2K can be a great opportunity to clean up and modernize \n     the supply chain,'' says Ronald S. Boreham, Jr., chairman of \n     the board of Baldor Electric Co. in Fort Smith, Ark.\n       The World Bank shelled out millions in loans and grants to \n     Y2K-stressed nations.\n\n  On and on, Mr. President. Here is another article that the banks now, \nby June 30, will have all of their Y2K customers and everything else \ncompliant, or they will have cancellations.\n  Otherwise, Paul Gillin said in Computer World earlier this year:\n\n       Vendors have had plenty of time to prepare for 2000. The \n     fact that some were more preoccupied with quarterly earnings \n     and stock\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n     options than in protecting their customers is no excuse for \n     giving them a get-out-of-jail-free card now.\n\n  That is what Computer World has called the Y2K bill, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona--a get-out-of-jail-free card--which \nis why I am surprised by my colleague, because he is usually on the \nother side. I quote again from Computer World:\n\n       The problem belongs--hook, line, and sinker--to the vendors \n     that capriciously ignored warnings from as long ago as the \n     late `70s. . . . It has been five years since year 2000 \n     awareness washed over the computer industry [and everyone \n     should now be compliant].\n\n  I was interested that Boeing, for example--and the Senator from \nWashington was here debating it--started back in 1993. Everyone has \ndone that. This is a political fix--and I will get to that in just a \nlittle while. I want to just bring you really up to date with respect \nto the number of cases.\n  We had a witness, Ronald Weikers, who has written Litigating Year \n2000 Cases, published by the West Group. I can tell you, the West Group \nis not going to publish anything partisan. They have a wonderful \nreputation for objectivity and reliability of their reports. He says:\n\n       I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do not \n     represent any clients that have any interest in the passage \n     or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation.\n\n  Then he goes on to state:\n\n       Thirteen of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to \n     date have been dismissed almost entirely.\n\n  I brought that 44 figure up to date because that was the end of \nApril, just a little over a month and a half ago. It is now 50 cases. \nTwelve cases have been settled for moderate sums of money, or no money. \nThe legal system is weeding out frivolous claims. They act as if the \ncourts just love to see a frivolous claim come into the court that \ndoesn't have any substance. All you have to do is get 12 people and, \nwhoopee, you've got money. You race to the courthouse, see the 12 \npeople, and you get your money. It is a total fanciful picture that is \nbeing painted with respect to this legislation.\n\n       The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims and Y2K \n     legislation is therefore unnecessary.\n\n  So says, of course, the Washington Post; they editorialized. We \nincluded that particular item in the Record, with others.\n  The most recent one is by Institutional Investor, a magazine from \nWall Street. They had a survey taken, and this was just this month:\n\n       Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are \n     prepared to make the year 2000 transition without problems?\n\n  Mr. President, 88.1 percent said yes; 6 percent said no. Here we are, \n5 and a half months, and now the bill. This is a wonderful problem \nhere, and we have to give it time. In January, under the McCain bill, \nyou get 3 months. I am giving them 5 and a half months, the operation, \nright now, to that 6 percent. Get with it.\n\n       Have you done a dry run of your computer problems for the \n     year 2000 transition?\n\n  Twelve percent said no problems. Few problems: 86.4 percent.\n  Then they asked:\n\n       Do you expect Y2K transition problems to have a material \n     impact on your company's business or financial performance \n     next year?\n\n  Three point six percent, and we have this wonderful Federal \nlegislation. Of course, States haven't asked for that. No  attorney \ngeneral has ever come up here. In fact, the Conference of State \nLegislatures has resolved against this political fix. That is all it \nis, political. We will get to that in just a few minutes.\n\n  Only 3.6 percent said yes; 89.2 percent said no. And then 95.2 \npercent say they have worked with their suppliers and cleaned up the \nproblem.\n  So here we are in June, 5 and a half months ahead of time, and we \nstill are insisting, if you please, on the Y2K fix.\n  Let me divert for a second and get right into the matter of safety. I \nknow it is difficult with the matter of gun violence in the schools, \nand everything else, for us politicians to think in terms of a safe \nAmerica. But that is the fact. We have the safest society with respect \nto product liability. That is what this is about, the Y2K problem with \nyour computer, a product liability.\n  Since 1963 in the McPherson case, under the common law, when the \ncourts came in and enunciated the doctrine of strict liability, the \nState legislatures thereupon have followed suit, enunciating strict \nliability, joint and several liability, all over the land. When you buy \na product, it is not caveat emptor, the buyer beware, but caveat \nvenditor, the seller beware. They have to be responsible right down the \nline, because the proponents of this bill said they are going to go way \ndown and find somebody with fat pockets, or high pockets.\n  That is total nonsense. I have a glitch on my computer now, and I \nknow they are like fleas on a dog, and they are all rich; it is the \nrichest crowd the world has ever produced, way better than any oil \nmillionaires. I know they have deep pockets, but I am not racing to the \ncourthouse. I told my secretary to get this blooming thing fixed. I \nhave no time to run around to the courthouse. If I went to the \ncourthouse at 12 noon, it would take until the year 2000 to get into \nthe courthouse. File your pleadings and see how it happens.\n  The total unreality of the picture described here for the need of \nthis particular legislation--it has worked and, yes, and the Europeans \nare following us, incidentally. I have the record here where they are \ncoming along with strict liability and joint and several liability. I \nonly mention that because they come in and say we are losing business \nto the Europeans. The Europeans are following America. We are setting \nthe example for safe products in America.\n  The conference board has found that. The Rand study has found that. I \ncould go to various others--232 risk managers; the conference board \nreports that the companies responded to product liability by ``making \ntheir products safer.'' So we know the effect it has had.\n  But to emphasize it, yes. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers has done a \nwonderful job with respect to consumers demanding a safe product, \nchecking it out and understanding it--and various other things. The \nNational Safety Transportation Board has come forth with various \nregulations, but it is really all prompted, if you please, I say to the \nSenator from Utah, by the trial lawyers. This town loves lawyers. That \nis all about lawyers. There are 60,000 of them. This town just loves \nlawyers. There are 60,000 to fix you and to fix me--not to get to the \ncourt. The lawyers are racing to the court around this place. I can \ntell you. I have been here 32 years now, and I know them. They are \ndelightful folks. They are highly intelligent. I enjoy them. But one \nthing is that they have started advertising against working lawyers and \nthe trial lawyers.\n  The lawyer that has to come in, if you please, and when he has a \nclient that comes to him, he says first I have got to investigate and \nmake sure the facts are as you say they are and you have been wronged. \nHe has to pay for all the expenses of that investigation--the \ninterrogatories, the discoveries, having to file the different \npleadings, the trial of the case itself, and on appeal taking care of \nthe briefs on appeal, the costs thereof, making of appeal and waiting \nfor the court. And all along that so-called talented trial lawyer is \nrushing to the courtroom. He has to get all 12 jurors--not 11 but all \n12 jurors. He has to get a majority opinion from the court. Then he \ngets his 20 percent or 30 percent, and these Senators run all around \nand saying they have a lottery, and ``strike it rich,'' and some kind \nof atmosphere.\n  The consumer has never been mentioned here. That is what trial \nlawyers represent. They do not represent themselves. They represent a \nwronged consumer. Ask the Consumer Federation of America. Ask Public \nCitizen. Ask anybody who represents consumers if they thought that this \nbill was appropriate. They are absolutely opposed to it, but we have \nthem. They have been very clever in the way that they have postured \nthis particular measure. It isn't about consumers. It isn't about \nwrongdoing. It isn't about need.\n  This is a measure--sooey, pig. All you computer folks come into \ntown--you millionaires--falling over each other. Billionaires, excuse \nme. I don't mean to hurt their feelings. Billionaires are falling over \neach other because we are going to fix it for you, which reminds me; \nthat is some crowd, isn't it? That is some crowd. They are highly \nintelligent. Bless their success, but that is the crowd now that wants\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nestate tax cuts. That is the crowd that wants capital gains tax cuts. \nThat is the crowd that wants no tax on the Internet. What Wal-Mart has \nstarted cleaning up is Main Street. Now we are going to clean up the \nrest of it, because Main Street in the States and the municipalities is \nnot going to be able to tax businesses as normal businesses on Main \nStreet. In fact, the merchant on Main Street will say: Tell me. Yes. \nYou want siding 42 feet long. That is fine. Let me order it. I will \nhave it delivered tomorrow. I will order it on the Internet, and you \nwon't have to pay the 8 percent sales tax.\n  There is the agent sitting up there in a little cubicle on Main \nStreet, and all we have is the wig shops run up and down Main Street of \nAmerica.\n  But that is the crowd that says get rid of the immigration laws. They \nhave been spoiled. They have been told that money can buy anything. Get \nrid of the estate taxes, capital gains taxes, the immigration laws, and \nnow get rid of the liability laws--200 years of State liability laws \nfor wrongdoers--and instead they are saying the wronged injured party \nnow has to pay for the misdeeds of the wrongdoer.\n\n  I go back to placing emphasis on the point: I want to join on the \nissue about these lawyers. It was Mark Robinson back in the 1970s who \nbrought the Pinto case wherein the gasoline tank exploded. It was \nnegligently and willfully proved that they knew it was unsafe, but they \nfigured that the extra little cost from a market cost-benefit analysis \nthat they weren't going to put in the safe gas tank.\n  He got a verdict in that death case of $3\\1/2\\ million and $125 \nmillion punitive damages 20 years ago. He collected zero of his \npunitive damages. He never got a red cent. But pick up the morning \npaper or yesterday's paper, pick up any news edition and you will find \nrecalls.\n  I went to the National Transportation Safety Board. As of 1994--in \nthe last 4 years--there have been 73 million recalls on account of the \nPinto case, on account of trial lawyers. You break that down to $1.8 \nmillion, or $18 million each year, $50,000 a day, and 5 percent of the \n$50,000 would be death, the other 95 percent in injury, and Mark \nRobinson saved 2,500 people from being killed as of today. He ought to \nbe proud of it. Every trial lawyer who works that hard knows he is \ntaking a risk, and he has to convince by the greater weight of the \npreponderance of evidence all 12 jurors. He has to be studied and \ncareful and legally sound and prevail on appeal. He is taking care of \nall the costs, and out of it the average American gets a good lawyer. \nThey do not like good lawyers. They like office lawyers that fix you \nand me. They don't like working lawyers.\n  So all of us, this thing about running to the courthouse, race to the \ncourthouse, and everything else, we put it to bed.\n  Under our system, torts have been relegated to the States. I would \nthink the contract crowd would understand that. If I remember it, they \ncame to town in 1995 and said the best government is the least \ngovernment; the best government is closest to the people--the 10th \namendment, the rights of the States. Even then the first thing they \npassed was to make sure the States were made whole. What did they call \nthat thing? Unfunded mandates. That was it. Yes. Unfunded mandates. \nThey wanted to make sure they would take care of the State communities. \nThe States have been administering. They have been doing it on Y2K. \nEveryone is taking up the Y2K. They don't live in an isolation booth. \nThe people are close to their government at the local level, and all of \nthem have been hearing about this particular problem. It has been \nadvertised.\n  Incidentally, my distinguished friends, the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nBennett, and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, have performed \nyeomen service in bringing attention to this particular problem. But \nthe States have been administering this, whereby you have to be a \naccountable for your wrongful acts. Having done so, we have a safe \nAmerica with the States having administered properly their product \nliability law. They have refused every time--and this has been going on \nfor 20 years--to get the Federals to come in.\n  Here were the States asking not to do it. No State attorney general \nhas come up and asked for it. No State Governor has said it is \ninadequate, and we need a Federal statute. Here they want to do away \nwith 200 years of liability law at the State level. Why? Why? Why? Why? \nWhy? Look here. All we have to do is get yesterday's New York Times, \nJune 14. On the front, left-hand column, ``Congress Chasing Campaign \nDonors Early and Often.'' The money chase. If you have any doubt about \nthat, just the day before, on Sunday in the Washington Post, a two-\ncolumn story appears on two pages, ``GOP Vies for Backing of High-Tech \nLeaders.'' ``Party aims to exploit Y2K vote at CEO summit.''\n  That is why they have all of them in town. This is a disgrace. This \ncrowd has gone so political about message, message, message, they got \nthe message together, but they say: Now, wait a minute. Senator McCain \nand Senator Hollings were ready for a final vote at 12:30 last \nThursday, but we have to wait 5 days because you have to have a message \nbut you have to have it timely.\n\n  Guess who is in town this afternoon when we vote. Bill Gates of \nMicrosoft. You want me to call the roll? Want to hear a bird call? Here \nwe go.\n  John Warnock of Adobe system, Carol Bartz of Autodesk, Greg Bentley \nof Bentley Systems, Michael Cowpland of Corel Corporation, Dominique \nGoupil of FileMaker, Bill Harris of Intuit, Jeff Papows of Lotus \nDevelopment, Bill Gates of Microsoft, William Larson of Network \nAssociates, Eric Schmidt of Novell, John Chen of Sybase, John Thompson \nof Symantec Corporation, and Jeremy Jaech of Visio Corporation.\n  Of course, we have some that we could not get to meet with us, I \nguess--like Netscape.\n  I saw Barksdale on TV, and I saw the head of IBM, Gerstner. They were \non my morning TV. They are all in town.\n  I thought this was the most amusing thing I had ever seen. I lifted \nthis--I had to scroll it down word for word. Turn on channel 2, the TV \nhere, which is the Republican screen of what is going on. I read it \nword for word: Senate again attempts to end minority stranglehold--the \ngreat Y2K money chase.\n  That is the first time an outreach, bag in hand, has ever been called \na ``stranglehold.'' We have been begging, trying to get a little bit of \nthe crumbs from Silicon Valley. We have to run, too. We have never been \nagainst technology. I am the author of the Advanced Technology Program. \nI am the author of the Manufacturers Extension Partnership Program. It \nall works. It was supported by the electronics industry, the technology \nindustry. It is working extremely well. We are trying to expand it.\n  I would love to get Mr. Gates and Microsoft to South Carolina. I \ndon't speak in a disparaging way. I speak in an adoring way. But don't \ncome here with the screen about stranglehold.\n  We have the Federal Election Campaign Commission. Last year, \naccording to their records:\n  Intel, Andy Grove, hard money, the Democrats got $16,000; the \nRepublicans got $64,000.\n  Microsoft, the Democrats got $71,000, and the Republicans got \n$143,000.\n  Soft money, Microsoft, the Democrats got $135,000; the Republicans \ngot $629,000.\n  This is usually a performance of my distinguished chairman from \nArizona, because I have heard him and he is very effective. I am just \nshocked he is not doing this and I am forced to do it.\n\n  I could go down the list here. Computer Services Corporation, the \nDemocrats, $25,000; the Republicans, $53,000.\n  Microtech, Democrats, soft money, zero; Republicans, $16,000.\n  Advanced Micro Devices, soft money, the Democrats got $1,000; the \nRepublicans, $95,000.\n  I have the list. You can go over there.\n  Stranglehold? Come on, give me a break.\n  Here is what they are doing. They come here. We all have to run. So \nwe create a problem. We raise a straw man of trial lawyers. We don't \ntalk about consumers. We don't talk about the wrongdoing. We don't talk \nabout trial lawyers representing wrongdoers. They are not just running \naround with frivolous cases. That is an imaginary thing that could be \nbrought at the political level but not at our level, I can tell you \nthat. Trial lawyers worth their salt are\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nnot fooling around. They have to make a living. They don't run up and \ndown and ruin their reputation. You know they are not getting anywhere. \nThe courts take care of the frivolous charges. They raise that thing \nand they are saying: Here is what we are going to do; we are going to \nget rid of the lawyer.\n  It was very obvious in the debate how they are going to get rid of \nthe lawyer. They said get rid of economic damages. If you come in with \na $10,000 or $20,000 computer and that is all you are limited to, that \nis all you can recover.\n  What I have just described--for the investigation, the pleadings, the \ninterrogatories, the depositions, the trial, the appeal, the cost, the \ntime--as a lawyer, I would tell my secretary up front, if they come in, \ntell them those are very complicated cases and there are a lot of legal \nloopholes to go through and delays, and we are just not in a position \nto handle those cases.\n  That is the way to get rid of the lawyer. They know exactly what they \nare doing.\n  When Senator Edwards of North Carolina came up and said, wait a \nminute, you can't do that, the Senator from Oregon said, we will give \nyou exactly whatever the contract. You don't contract for torts. You \ndon't say, we are going to contract for the wrongdoing; the contract is \ncomplied with.\n  If they defraud you, if they engage in wrongdoing, while the computer \nis down you are losing your customers to your competition, you are \nlosing your business, you may have to let go of some of your good \nemployees to tide yourself over.\n  All the time that business has to wait--and a small business at \nthat--I can tell you right now, there will be serious economic damages.\n  If there is any doubt about it--because that is what small business \nwants. They don't want a law case; they want it fixed--up comes the \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer. She said: Don't give us trials, \ndon't give us lawyers; just get a fix.\n  They denied that in an up-and-down vote. They said instead of fixing \nthe computer, we are going to fix the lawyers; we are going to fix the \nsystem.\n  Just like any car dealer who comes around, what we are going to do is \ntake your junk off the shelves and sell it; don't worry about it, \nbecause the law will protect you for 3 years. You can get rid of all \nyour old models. Don't worry about it. Get rid of the junk. We will \nrepeal the  liability bill. We will say that fraud pays for the first \ntime in America.\n\n  No one is going to get these cases. That is what they will do. I can \nsee exactly what was happening with that particular witness from New \nJersey who came before the committee. He bought an update that was \nrepresented to last for 10 years. Within a year he found out it wasn't \nY2K compliant. He paid $13,000. He called them twice and nothing ever \nhappened. He wrote a letter. They finally came back and said they would \nmake it Y2K compliant, for $25,000. That was after he got a lawyer and \nit went on the Internet and some 17,000 similarly situated people \nfiled, and that particular manufacturer, supplier, came back and said \nthey would fix it for nothing and pay legal fees.\n  You can see the game that business will play on a cost-benefit basis. \nWe live in a rough world, but we have a responsibility in American \nsociety. It is done well at the State level and has worked well at the \nState level. No State has asked for this particular measure. Instead, \nthe Association of State Legislatures has resolved against the Federal \nY2K bill.\n  But they have the audacity to come up here and raise a straw man of \nlawyers running to the courthouse, in a litigious society and all of \nthat nonsense, 5\\1/2\\ months ahead of time, and insisting on passing \nthis particular measure, and insisting on the time of its passage is \nwhen the computer folks are in town so they will know who delivered the \ngoods.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah, followed by 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, if that \nis agreeable to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the remarks of my colleague, \nmy dear friend. In this body, he is certainly a champion for the trial \nlawyers, and certainly I have been as well. I intend to continue to \nstand up for trial lawyers, who do a great job for consumers in this \ncountry, but we are talking about a little bit of a different problem.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the final passage of \nS. 96, the Y2K Act, as modified by S. 1138, the bipartisan Dodd-McCain-\nHatch-Feinstein-Wyden-Gorton-Lieberman-Bennett amendment. This bill \neffectively addresses the very serious problems associated with the Y2K \ncomputer problem.\n  As you know, Mr. President, what is now known as the Y2K problem \narises from the inability of computers to correctly process the date \nafter December 31, 1999. When January 1, 2000 arrives, the computers \nthat cannot process that date will have a variety of problems, ranging \nfrom very mild glitches to severe breakdowns. In the technologically \ndependent world we live in, this creates obvious problems for both \nindividuals and for any business that relies on computer technology at \nany point in its business.\n  As a result of this problem, we face the threat of an avalanche of \nY2K-related lawsuits that will be filed on or about January 3, 2000. \nSuch an unprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer \nindustry's ability to correct the problem. As I have said before, this \nsuper-litigation threat is real, and the consequences for America could \nbe disastrous. Already, there have been more than 66 lawsuits, \nincluding 31 class actions, filed based on the Y2K problem. These suits \nare the beginning of a tsunami of litigation that could drown America.\n  As a Senator from the State of Utah, I am extremely aware of the \nimpact this problem will have on the economy of the United States, as \nwell as that of the entire world. Utah stands with a number of other \nstates as a leader in the technological boom that has fueled America's \neconomic progress in recent decades. The future of Utah, and of all \nAmerica, relies on our ability to continue in our role as the global \ntechnological leader. As I have said before, if we fail to counteract \nthe negative effects of the Y2K problem, we will be killing the goose \nthat lays the golden egg.\n  Every dollar that industry has to spend defending itself from \nfrivolous litigation is a dollar that cannot be spent on fixing the \nproblem. The way to minimize the hardships caused by the problem on \nJanuary 1st is to encourage remediation by the technology industry and \nto encourage mitigation by would-be plaintiffs, both before and after \nJanuary 1st. This bill does precisely that.\n  The Y2K bill provides powerful incentives for industry to fix the Y2K \nproblem before it happens and to remedy problems once they occur. \nContrary to what some opponents of the bill have alleged, there is \nabsolutely nothing in the bill that would deny any aggrieved party the \nright to sue. Let me repeat this. There is nothing in the bill that \nwould prohibit anyone from bringing a lawsuit. What the bill does is to \ncreate powerful incentives to fix problems before resort to the courts \nis necessary. It encourages remediation through the requirement of pre-\nlitigation notice and by providing opportunities for alternative \ndispute resolution. The pre-litigation notice and pleading requirements \nalso assist industry in fixing Y2K problems by requiring that \nprospective plaintiffs provide the information necessary for the \ndefendant to understand and remedy the problem during the cure period.\n  In addition to encouraging the computer industry to remediate the \nproblem, this bill fosters action by both industry and consumers to \navoid the problems caused by Y2K failures. This bill preserves \ncontracts and State contract law, encouraging contracting parties to \nanticipate the possibilities of Y2K failure and to do all they can to \navoid them. The bill also imposes a duty to mitigate, requiring \nprospective plaintiffs to do what they reasonably can to avoid damages \noccurring because of a Y2K failure.\n  Some Senators have raised concerns about some of the provisions of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\n Y2K Act. Let me address some of these concerns.\n  Specifically, some Senators have opposed to the punitive damages \nprovision, the proportional liability provision, and the section \ndealing with the economic loss rule. In the past several days, however, \nwe have also heard many of my colleagues set forth the reasons why \nthese provisions are central to the effective operation of the bill in \npreventing the disaster that is imminent in the wake of extensive \nfrivolous Y2K litigation.\n  The punitive damages provision of the Y2K Act is essential in order \nto prevent the destruction of America' small businesses by excessive \npunitive damage awards. This section of the bill is extremely limited, \nas it applies only to small businesses. The bill simply does not impose \na cap on punitive damages for any defendants other than small \nbusinesses. Opponents of this provision argue that punitive damages \nserve as a deterrent to misconduct, and that placing a cap on them will \nremove that deterrent. The punitive damage cap created by this bill \ndoes not remove any deterrent to misconduct.\n  Punitive damage awards against small businesses will be limited to \nthree times the amount awarded for compensatory damages or $250,000, \nwhichever is less. FOr small businesses consisting of an individual \nwhose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or a company with less than 50 \nemployees, this is a significant deterrent of misconduct. In addition, \nthere is no cap at all if the plaintiff establishes by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific intent to \ninjure the plaintiff. I cannot take seriously the argument that this \nformulation of punitive damages is too small to act as a deterrent. \nTreble damages or $250,000 is a significant piece of change to pay for \na small business.\n  In fact, I supported a similar cap for all businesses. But, in the \nspirit of bipartisan compromise, we agreed to limit the caps to small \nbusinesses. I understand that even the White House supported a similar \nsmall business cap provision in the products liability bill of two \nyears ago. So what's the big deal?\n  What the small business punitive damages cap does do is to protect \nour small businesses from utter destruction by excessive punitive \ndamage awards. As last year's Rand Corporation study of punitive \ndamages concluded, the United States has witnessed a substantial \nincrease in the amount of punitive damage awards. Witness the recent \nMay 10 punitive damage award by an Alabama jury of $581 million to a \nfamily that complained they were overcharged $1,200 for two satellite \ndishes. According to Rand, although punitive damages amounts to a \nminority of all damages awarded, the very size of these awards skewers \nthe civil justice system. Even frivolous lawsuits are settled for fear \nof large judgments. This has led to what is termed ``jackpot justice.'' \nLawsuits have been grossly transformed from a search of justice to a \nsearch of deep pockets. We have tried to counter this trend--at least \nfor small businesses--in the Y2K Act.\n  Speaking about ``jackpot justice''--the proportionate liability \nprovision is intended to mitigate the quest for deep pockets by \nassuring fairness in the award of damages. Punishment must fit the \ncrime and it is only fair that defendants should be liable only for the \npart of the damage that they cause. In an attempt to forge a bipartisan \ncompromise, Senators McCain, Dodd, Wyden, Lieberman, Feinstein, Gorton, \nBennett, and myself, agreed to the formulation of proportionate \nliability found in the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \nof 1995. This act was signed into law by the President several years \nago--so it should be acceptable to the administration.\n  Yet some opponents to this bill have spoken out against this \nprovision. Opponents of this section of the bill apparently want some \ndefendants to be liable for all damages, even if they were responsible \nonly for a tiny fraction of the damage. That is the very definition of \n``deep pockets.'' The Y2K Act would prevent this and that is why it is \nopposed by the trial attorneys. The act ensures that a defendant's \nliability in a Y2K action will be for the damage that they caused, and \nnot for the damages caused by other defendants.\n  Another section of the bill that is under attack is the class action \nsection. Opponents of the bill say that this provision would federalize \nall State actions. This is a gross exaggeration. Let me explain.\n  The class action provision is vital to the effective operation of the \nbill. Class actions are a significant source of abuse. I have seen this \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Far too often, Federal \njurisdiction is defeated by joining just one nondiverse class \nplaintiff--even if the overwhelming number of parties are from \ndiffering States. This wrecks the clear purpose of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23--to provide for a Federal forum ameliorates myriad \nstate judicial decisions that are conflicting in scope and onerous to \nenforce.\n  Now, as I stated before in this debate, I am a great proponent of \nfederalism and the right of our States to act as what Justice Brandeis \ntermed national laboratories of change. But it is axiomatic that a \nnational problem needs an uniform solution. That is the justification \nfor Congress' commerce clause power and its consequent promulgation of \nrule 23. That is the justification for the Y2K Act itself, in which the \nY2K defect is clearly a national problem in need of a Federal answer.\n  The economic loss section of the Y2K Act has also been the subject of \nsome contention. Let me reiterate some of the arguments I made last \nThursday on the Senate floor in opposition to the Edwards amendment \nwhich if passed would have weakened this section. The economic loss \nrule is already widely accepted and has been adopted by both the U.S. \nSupreme Court and by a majority of States. The rule basically mandates \nthat when parties have entered into contracts and the contract is \nsilent as to consequential damages--which is the contract term for \neconomic losses--the aggrieved party may not turn around and sue in \ntort for economic losses. Under the rule, the party may only sue under \ntort for economic losses. Under the rule, the party may only sue under \ntort law when they have suffered personal injury or damage to property \nother than the property in dispute.\n  In short, the Y2K Act's economic loss section ensures fairness in \ncontract law by applying the rule already in use in most states to Y2K \nlawsuits. It prevents ``tortification'' of contract law by flagging an \nend run against terms of a contract agreed to by the parties.\n  Let me also remind the critics of this bill that it is of limited \nduration. This bill is designed to specifically address the problems \nrelated to Y2K computer failures that will occur around the turn of the \nmillennium. In keeping with this purpose, the bill has a sunset period, \nwhich means that the entire bill will only be in effect until January \n1, 2003.\n  Let me also make a variant of Pascal's wager. If these disputed \nprovisions are harmful, as some critics contend, enacting them will do \nlittle harm because the bill will expire in 3 years. But if, as the \nsupporters of this bill believe, these provisions are critical, not \nincluding them in the final bill could greatly harm the economy and our \nhigh tech industries. The choice is obvious. Both reason and equity \nrequire that these provisions remain in the bill.\n  Some have expressed concern that President Clinton will veto this \nbill. I don't think he will. This bill can only solve the problems \ncreated by the Y2K problem. Its provisions encourage remediation and \nmitigation, and encourage solutions to problems. The President knows \nthis. He knows that to sign the bill can only help our nation and the \nworld. He knows that by vetoing the bill he will, at best, be doing \nnothing to solve the Y2K problem, and that at worst he will be \ncontributing to it. If we are to be successful in solving this great \nproblem before us, we must overcome our fear and pass the Y2K bill as a \nstrong and effective piece of legislation.\n  Again, I emphasize the importance of this bill to our nation's \nfuture. Without meaningful legislation addressing the Y2K problem and \nthe deluge of litigation that will surely follow, our nation may suffer \ndevastating consequences. The Y2K Act before the Senate today is that \nmeaningful legislation. This is a bipartisan bill, created and shaped \nthrough cooperation on both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for its final passage.\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to once again commend \nmy colleague from Utah. He has given a very insightful legal analysis \nof what the implications of this proposal are, what the authors of this \nbill are attempting to do. I will restate, not as eloquently as he has, \nthe fact that the trial bar performs a very valuable service in this \ncountry.\n  There is no way in the world the Justice Department, and others, \ncould do all the work the private litigators achieve on behalf of all \ncitizens. But to listen to some talk about this bill, you would think \nwe had just voided all litigation when it came to the Y2K issue. \nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact, quite to the \ncontrary, it provides for a systematic way for laws to be filed should \nthere be no other means of resolving the difficulties.\n  I commend my colleague from Utah. I also commend Senator McCain, the \nchairman of the committee and the principal author of this legislation, \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and the many others who have \nbeen involved in putting this piece of legislation together. I also \nwish to commend the hard work of Senator McCain's staff, Senator \nWyden's staff and I wish to particularly recognize my own staff and all \nthe work that they have done.\n  We have now resolved most of the outstanding issues, or we have had \nvotes on a number of them. I understand we will have a final passage \nvote sometime early this afternoon.\n  We, as a nation, and the world at large are going to meet the new \nmillennium 199 days from today. That is when the clock turns. As many \nof my colleagues know, Senator Bennett of Utah and I were asked by the \nleadership of this body--the majority and the minority--to head up a \nspecial committee, if you will, to take a good, hard look at the Y2K \nissue and the full ramifications of it on our National Government, \nState and local governments, private industry, nonprofits, and the \nworld.\n  We have held, over the last year and several months, some 22 \nhearings; we have had site visits to nuclear power plants, hospitals, \nand financial services sectors; we have had staff who have gone \noverseas to meet with leaders of other countries--all of this, as \nquickly as we could, to give our colleagues and the country the benefit \nof an analysis of where we stand with this issue of the year 2000 \nmillennium bug.\n  I am not going to go into all the details of the work. We have had a \ngood committee. I commend my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, who \nhas done a very fine job chairing this committee. We think--we hope--we \nhave provided a valuable service in highlighting and pushing and using \nthe forum of that special committee to urge a greater sense of urgency \non the part of the various sectors of our society to get ready for this \nproblem.\n  I think it is fair to say we believe we are in fairly good shape on \nthis issue. Again, I will not go through all the details, but, by and \nlarge, most sectors in our society--government at all levels--are doing \na good job of remediating the problem, taking the steps that are \nnecessary to fix these computers and to eliminate the potential hazards \nand harm. There are larger problems offshore. I am not going to go into \nthat at this point. But there has been a lot of work up to this point.\n  One of the things we concluded, in part, is that we ought to come up \nwith some sort of a means by which, if problems do emerge after January \n1, we ought to try to fix the problem before we litigate the problem.\n  This is an outrageous thought, but maybe Congress might actually do \nsomething in anticipation of a potential problem. We do not normally do \nthat around here. We wait for the problem to hit us. We wait for \ncatastrophes to occur, many of which we cannot predict, obviously, \nbecause in many cases we talk about natural  disasters or unanticipated \nevents.\n\n  However, in 199 days, we have a very anticipated event. We have been \ntold by experts, knowledgeable people, during the last 2 years in our \nhearing cycle--one expert after another--that we have a very serious \nproblem hanging over us potentially, come the change in the millennium \ndate.\n  You could go the traditional route and rush to the courthouse every \ntime a problem emerges--with a handful of law firms, by the way. To \nspeak about the trial bar on this issue, you can count the law firms on \none hand, almost, that are involved in this kind of litigation. Let \nthere be no illusion, this isn't your fender-bender, your product \nliability case, your personal injury case. This is a very specialized \narea. They would prefer to run to the courthouse for the problem.\n  Those of us who have offered this bill do not rule out the courthouse \nat all, but we say: Why not a 90-day cooling off period? How about \nsaying you have to take some time to try to fix the problem? As much as \nwe try to anticipate the problem, we cannot guarantee that we have done \nso. If a problem emerges, why not try to fix the problem? If you cannot \nfix it, then go to the courthouse. It is not much more complicated than \nthat.\n  This bill lasts 36 months. You would think, to listen to some of my \ncolleagues, we were amending the Constitution of the United States, the \nBill of Rights, that we were changing the Ten Commandments. This is a \n36-month bill for one short window in time, for us to say we want to \ntry to solve the problem and not run to the courthouse for 36 months.\n  Can the trial bar bear that for 36 months? To see if we can't come to \nsome conclusion and avoid the tremendous cost, the business to \nconsumers, and others, as they spend weeks and months, if not years, \nlitigating these problems instead of trying to fix them? That is really \nwhat this is all about.\n  We came to some significant compromises here. In fact, this bill \nought to have been done on a consent calendar, in my view. It should \nnot have taken a week's time in the Senate to deal with this issue. It \nis not that complicated.\n  What we have done here is, we have put caps on punitive damages for \nsmall business. We do not think you ought to wipe out a small business \nbecause you file a lawsuit against them, because they have a computer \nglitch problem. These punitive damage caps apply only to businesses \nthat employ 50 people or less. We have directors' and officers' \nliabilities--again, no ceilings here on punitive damages at all. The \ntrial bar begged for those things. That is included. That is in our \nbill.\n  We have proportionate liability here. This is the great stumbling \nblock, I guess, for some in this 36-month bill. For 36 months we are \ngoing to have proportional liability--this cataclysmic event that is \noccurring here for 36 months--where we say that if, in a normal case, \nyou are guilty of involvement in some problem, you are responsible for \nthat percentage of the problem you caused--that is a radical idea--\nexcept, however, that is not the case if in fact you had an \nintentional, willful action on the part of the defendant. Under those \ncircumstances, there is no proportional liability; it is joint and \nseveral. So we protect the plaintiff that may have been severely hurt \nas a result of this problem.\n  That is basically the sum and substance of this legislation--for 36 \nmonths.\n  This is an important industry, the high-technology community. It is \nchanging the economy of our Nation and the world in which we live. The \nUnited States is on the cutting edge. We are leading the world. Ten or \nfifteen years ago, all we talked about was the Japanese and the Pacific \nrim. The United States could not compete in high technology. We had \nlost it forever. Well, there were bright people in this country who had \nother thoughts. As a result of their ingenuity and hard work, they \nchanged the nature of how the world looks to leadership in high \ntechnology. Today the United States is the leader. These leaders \nchampion ideas that are incubated in basements and garages, these \ntechnology leaders are often young people who are coming out with \nlittle or no money in their own pockets but a good idea. They are \nchanging how you and I live.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. These industries are critical to the 21st century economy \nof this country. I do not think we ought to allow some big appetites \nand a handful of law firms to go out there and try\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\nand do damage unnecessarily to these people. If you have to get to a \ncourthouse, you get to the courthouse. But, for 36 months in this \ncountry, let us take time out and try and solve the problem.\n  This bill that Senator McCain, Senator Wyden, myself and others have \nauthored, we think buys us this short window of time to resolve these \ndifficulties. I hope this afternoon, when final passage occurs, my \ncolleagues will vote for the 21st century future and not for a handful \nof law firms that want to litigate forever.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senators McCain, \nDodd, Bennett, and Hatch for all the work they have done on S. 96, the \nY2K Act. The bill will help protect against frivolous Y2K lawsuits. \nWith just 199 days until 2000, the focus must remain on fixing the \ncomputer problem, not on litigating it.\n  The Y2K computer problem has been with us for some while, and it \nwould be derelict of me not to mention that it was brought to my \nattention by a dear friend from New York, a financial analyst, John \nWestergaard, who began talking to me about the matter in 1995. On \nFebruary 13, 1996, I wrote to the Congressional Research Service to \nsay: Well, now, what about this? Richard Nunno authored a report which \nthe CRS sent to me on June 7, 1996, saying that, ``the Y2K problem is \nindeed serious and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. \nThe problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the \nFederal Government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert \nmajor disruptions on January 1, 2000.''\n  I wrote the President, on July 31 of that year, to relay the findings \nof the CRS report and raise the issue generally. In time, a \nPresidential appointment was made to deal with this in the executive \nbranch. And last spring--less than 1 year ago--the majority and \nminority leaders had the perception to appoint the Senate Special \nCommittee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.\n  We have done a fine job preparing for the Year 2000. It took some \ncajoling, but people finally began to listen. The Federal Government \nshould make it. The securities industry has been out on front on this. \nTheir tests went very well this past March and April. When Senator \nBennett and I held a field hearing last summer--July 6--in the \nceremonial chamber of the U.S. Federal Court House for the Southern \nDistrict of New York, we found the big, large international banks in \nthe City advanced in their preparations regarding this matter.\n  But much work still remains to be done. Testing and contingency plans \nare still being addressed. Last year, Senators Bennett, Dodd, and I \nintroduced the Y2K Disclosure Act. This act, which the President signed \non October 19, 1999, has been very successful in getting businesses to \nwork together and share information on Y2K. S. 96 builds on the \nDisclosure Act and encourages remediation and information sharing. It \nis a good short-term fix for a once-in-a-modern-civilization problem, \nand I encourage the Senate to pass it forthwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from North Carolina want to use his \ntime?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator. Mr. President, I \nyield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have a bill before us today that has had a great \ndeal of discussion. I just listened to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, discuss it. He and I agree about a great many \nthings. We agree about a great many things with respect to this bill.\n  I think it makes great sense to pass a moderate, thoughtful bill that \nprovides protection for the computer industry. I think it makes sense \nto create incentives for consumers, buyers of computer products and \nthose people who sell those products to, No. 1, try to remedy any Y2K \nproblems that might exist with the computers they purchase and, No. 2, \nto work together to solve any problem that either of them may have, \neither the seller or the purchaser.\n  I think it makes a great deal of sense, as a result of that, to have \na cooling off period. I think the 90-day cooling off period is \nsomething I strongly support. I add to that, I strongly support the \nidea of alternative dispute resolution which has been discussed at \ngreat length on the floor of the Senate. I think all those things \naccomplish positive things. They accomplish the goal of providing some \nlegitimate protection for the computer industry. They accomplish the \ngoal of having folks work together to try to avoid lawsuits. I think \nthose are things that we ought to support.\n  There is a fundamental problem with this particular bill. The problem \nis this: There are going to be cases where purchasers of computers, \nwhether they be consumers or small businesspeople, are going to suffer \nlegitimate losses. They are going to have a Y2K problem. Their business \nis going to get shut down. They are going to have to continue to make \npayroll. All of us who grew up with small businesses understand that \nproposition. They are going to have to keep paying their employees, \nkeep having overhead. But as a result of a Y2K problem, they do not \nkeep generating revenue.\n  They are going to have a real and substantial loss. The computer \ncompany or salespeople who sold them the computer may well be \nresponsible for that loss. In those cases where the computer company or \nthe manufacturer acted in a reckless or irresponsible way on one hand, \nand in addition to that, we have a purchaser who suffered a real \nsubstantial and legitimate loss--I am not talking about something \nfrivolous, not talking about their VCR won't work; I am talking about \ntheir family-run and family-owned business has been put out of \nbusiness--that loss exists as a result of a Y2K problem clearly caused \nby somebody's irresponsibility, what we have to recognize is that loss \nwill not go away. It exists. It exists in reality. It exists in the \npocketbook of this small businessman.\n  The question is really very simple. Who will bear that real and \nlegitimate loss when it occurs?\n  There are two problems in this bill. One has to do with the issue of \njoint and several liability. The other has to do with economic loss. \nThey are both devastating in how they deal with that issue.\n  If you start with the basic premise that that loss which has been \nsuffered by the consumer or a small businessperson is a real loss that \nis not going to go away, then the question becomes, who is going to pay \nfor it? By eliminating joint and several liability, what we have said \nby law is if there are multiple parties who may be responsible, but for \nsome reason one of those parties can't be reached, that we are going to \nshift that part of the responsibility, whatever, because it is an \noffshore company, if it is a company going bankrupt, out of business, \nwhatever, and that company was 20 percent responsible, that loss gets \nshifted to the innocent consumer, the businessman, under this law. That \nis exactly what this law does.\n\n  Joint and several liability has existed in this country for 200 \nyears. It exists for a simple reason--because it is fair and it is \nequitable.\n  What we say in the law of the United States is that we always want \nthe guilty to pay and not the innocent. What this law does is, it \nchanges that fundamental premise. If a Y2K problem exists and an \ninnocent consumer or businessman suffers as a result, that share of the \nloss that can't be recovered will be borne not by those who \nparticipated in the loss, the guilty, but will be borne by the \ninnocent. That is one problem.\n  There is a second problem that is even more devastating. This bill \nessentially eliminates the right to recover economic losses, which \nmeans, in my example, a small businessman whose family-run-and-owned \nbusiness has been put out of business, as between him or her and a \ncomputer company or computer sales business that has sold the computer \nto him knowing it was non-Y2K compliant, as between those two, what we \nsay in this law is, the innocent purchaser will bear the loss.\n  It is so important for all of my colleagues and the American people \nto recognize that there has been a lot of rhetoric on the floor about \nlawsuits and lawyers and the trial bar I heard Senator Dodd talking \nabout a few minutes ago. This has nothing to do with lawyers. What we \nare taking about and\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nwhat we ought to be talking about is who is going to be protected by \nthis bill and who is going to be hurt by it.\n  We know who is going to be protected. The big computer companies will \nbe protected. Now the question is, Who will be hurt? It is not lawyers \nthat will be hurt. The people who will be hurt are consumers and small \nbusinessmen. It really becomes a very simple proposition. We are \nprotecting the big guy, and we are shifting that injury and damage to \nthe little guy. It is the little guy that gets hurt by this bill.\n  In my example where a computer has been sold that is non-Y2K \ncompliant, the people who sold it did it absolutely intentionally. They \nknew exactly what they were doing and some innocent businessman in a \nsmall town in North Carolina gets put out of business. If this law \npasses, this is what he can recover; he can recover the cost of his \ncomputer.\n  Well, he is going to have a great time explaining to his family, to \nhis mother and father, who spent their life building up his business, \nthat they have been put out of business and they can identify who \ncaused it and they did it intentionally and willfully and they were \nirresponsible, but all they can ever get back is the cost of their \ncomputer.\n  It is fundamentally wrong. It is inequitable and it is unfair. That \nis what is wrong with this bill.\n  I want to mention three specific examples that I think show the \nAmerican people what a problem we have. Example No. 1, let's suppose we \nhave a businessman who runs his assembly line with a computer system. \nOn November 15, 1999, this year, the computer salesman comes to him and \nsells him a new system. Let's assume that computer salesman knows the \nsystem is not Y2K compliant. On January 2, 2000, his assembly line \ncomes to a grinding halt. It does so because of this Y2K problem. The \npeople who sold it to him were reckless and irresponsible in doing so. \nHe has lost all of his sales. He can't produce a product.\n  Let's assume that some of his customers will void their contracts, \nwhich they would. He doesn't have what they need and they have to get \ntheir product somewhere. They void their contract because he doesn't \nhave anything to sell them. He can't meet payroll. For about 3 weeks, \nhe is able to pay his people, but he can't meet payroll now because he \nhas nothing to sell anymore. He goes out of business. Under section 12 \nof this bill, under that example, this is what this manufacturer can \nrecover: The cost of the computer. He may have lost thousands and \nthousands of dollars. He has been put out of business, and what he can \nget back is the $5,000 cost of the computer. That is one example.\n  Let me give a second example. Suppose a businessman buys a computer \nprogram that manages his billings, his promotional mailing, and his \ndata bases. On January 1, 2000, the program fails and renders the \ncomputer unworkable. The business can't send out its bills and loses \nthe use of its mailing list and data base for more than 2 months; as a \nresult, it goes under. Under this bill, he has been run out of \nbusiness--clearly a Y2K problem, clearly the responsibility of the \npeople who sold him the computer system. But all he can recover is the \ncost of his computer.\n  Finally, assume that we have a doctor who buys an infusion pump which \nis run by a computer, which is done all over the country in doctors' \noffices, and he uses it for a surgical procedure in his office. Because \nof a Y2K problem, it fails during surgery and a patient he cares about \nis severely injured as a result. They sue him for malpractice. He has \nto pay some huge judgment. He doesn't have enough insurance to cover \nit, so he loses thousands and thousands of dollars and his business is \nruined. What that doctor who is operating in small town North Carolina \nis allowed to recover is the cost of his computer.\n  The problem is--and all three of these examples show it--it is very \nfundamental to the problem existing in this bill. We are going to have \nreal and legitimate losses that are caused by irresponsible conduct. \nThe vast majority of computer companies in this country will act \nresponsibly, but the reality is, as we all know, there will be a \nminority of those companies that do not act responsibly. We are going \nto have small businesspeople and consumers all across the United States \nwho have real losses. I think my colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator \nWyden, and Senator Dodd, would all recognize that is true. That is \nreality.\n  What we do when we pass this bill is we take that real, legitimate \nloss that has to be borne by somebody--it doesn't disappear into thin \nair because the Congress of the United States passes a law. These folks \nwho run small businesses and these consumers are going to have some \nreal losses. It is a simple question: Who pays for those losses?\n  What I propose is that we have a bill that creates every conceivable \nincentive to cure Y2K problems, to cause these people who have \nlegitimate complaints to work to solve those problems; that makes the \npurchaser do everything in his power to reduce his losses, to act in a \nvery responsible way; that we streamline the process; that we find a \nway to have alternative dispute resolution; that we make the court \nprocedure as simple as it can possibly be. All of those things would go \nto help with any litigation that might occur, or any day in court that \nmay occur.\n  The problem is that this bill takes that loss that is real and \nlegitimate and says we are going to go a step further; we are going to \nsay when somebody suffers a real and meaningful loss, we are going to \nmake the innocent consumer and the small businessman bear that loss. It \nis fundamentally wrong. It is inequitable. It violates every principle \nof law that exists in this country.\n  The American people absolutely do not believe in this and would not \nsupport it. They don't want frivolous lawsuits. None of us do. We ought \nto cut those off. They want people to use alternative dispute \nresolution. They don't want people going to the courthouse the first \ntime they have a problem. We ought to do something about that. But what \nwe should not do is throw the baby out with the bath water. There are \ngoing to be real people out there who have real losses, and it is \nsimply not right--and the American people in their gut know it is not \nright--to take that loss and shift it from the people who are \nresponsible to the innocent people who have suffered.\n  I will make one last comment and I will be finished. I have heard \nSenator Dodd and Senator Wyden talk at great length about the sunset \nnature of this bill, that this is a 3-year bill. With all due respect \nto those arguments, I think they are a smokescreen. This bill will \ncover virtually every Y2K problem that exists, because by the very \nnature of the problem, it is going to come into existence in the year \n2000. So it doesn't make any difference. They could cut it off in 2 \nyears, or in a year and a half. It would not make any difference \nwhatsoever. It could be 20 years. It is going to cover exactly the same \nlosses--those losses that rear their ugly heads in the year 2000 \nbecause of a Y2K problem.\n  So what I say to my colleagues and to the American people is that, \nbeing from a State where we are very proud of our technology industry \nand believing that the great majority of technology companies act in a \nvery responsible way, I think it makes a lot of sense to provide some \nthoughtful protection for those folks and to provide the kind of \nincentives we have talked about today. But I don't think we should go \nso far and be so drastic and so dramatic as to take away a real and \nlegitimate loss and to take that loss, which is not going to disappear, \nand shift it from the people who are responsible for it to the innocent \nconsumers and to innocent small businesspeople. I think that is wrong. \nI think it is protecting the big guy against the little guy. For that \nreason, I oppose this bill and will vote against it.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the points \nmade by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. But before I do \nthat, I want to talk about what a vote against this legislation means \ntoday.\n  A vote against this legislation today means that the high-technology \nsector, which is driving this Nation's economic prosperity, doesn't \ndeserve the same kind of treatment afforded the airline manufacturers; \nthe high-technology sector doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment \nafforded the securities industry; the high-technology sector doesn't \ndeserve the same kind of treatment afforded the financial services\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nsector. I just don't think that makes sense, when it is so clear that \nwe are going to have problems in the next century with respect to Y2K, \nthat we would compound those problems by not giving high technology the \nsame sort of protection that we have given to a variety of other \nindustries.\n  Second, it seems to me that a vote against this legislation is a vote \nagainst the Nation's risk-takers, and it is a vote against the Nation's \nentrepreneurs who are working their heads off today to make their \nsystems Y2K-compliant but are legitimately concerned about frivolous \nlawsuits. I don't think the Senate ought to be voting today against \nthose risk-takers and entrepreneurs.\n  Third, it seems to me that a vote against this bill fails to \nrecognize how dramatic the bipartisan changes have been to this \nlegislation since it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee. The \nSenate Commerce Committee bill, as far as I am concerned, was a \nnonstarter. The House bill is a nonstarter. But this bill puts tough \npressure on business and directs systems to cure problems, as well as \nthose who might want to bring suits to mitigate damages.\n  Now, my friend from North Carolina has said repeatedly for days that \nif you have a problem and you are a small businessperson, you are not \ngoing to get to recover anything except the cost of the computer.\n  My question, colleagues, is, Why in the world would the overwhelming \nmajority of the Nation's small businesses be calling for passage of \nthis bill if all they got when there was a problem was the cost of a \ncomputer?\n  I agree with the Senator from North Carolina. These are dedicated, \nthoughtful people. Why in the world would they be in support of a bill \nif all they got was the cost of the computer?\n  The reason they are for the bill is they get all the rights that are \nprescribed in the contract that a majority of them signed when they \npurchased a computer. They get the damages that are the foreseeable \nconsequence of a Y2K problem. They get economic losses as prescribed by \nState contract law. That is the reason why the overwhelming number of \nsmall businesses in this country are for this legislation.\n  The fact of the matter is, colleagues, that the so-called culprits \nwho are behind the Y2K problem are folks who didn't really realize \ndecades ago what we would be faced with at the end of the century.\n  Let me tell you what Alan Greenspan had to say recently on this \nissue. Alan Greenspan said, ``I am one of the culprits who created the \nproblem. I used to write those programs back in the 1960s and 1970s, \nand was so proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements \nof space by not having to put 19 before the year.''\n  That is what Alan Greenspan said. He said he was one of the culprits \nbehind the problem. In the infancy of the information age when every \nbyte of memory cost about $1 million, he saved his company a lot of \nmoney. Today a million bytes of memory can be bought for less than a \npenny.\n  This problem was a result of an engineering tradeoff, not some kind \nof conspiracy of computer geeks. I doubt that any computer programmer \never dreamed that programs written in the 1960s and 1970s would still \nbe running today.\n  But the point of this legislation is to keep the heat on all of our \nNation's companies to do everything they can to make the chips and the \ncomputers and all of our systems Y2K compliant. Let's get the problem \nfixed. But let's also have a safety net in order to ensure justice for \nthose who have problems.\n  I want to say to my friend from North Carolina, the distinguished \nSenator, that he talked about how companies that are big and bad are \ngoing to get off the hook; they are going to get a free ride, and, \nagain, you are not going to get anything except the cost of the \ncomputer.\n  Let me tell you what the hooks are for those that are big and bad. If \nyou are ripping people off, you are going to get stuck with joint and \nseveral liability. You are going to get stuck with punitive damages. \nThat is what happens under this legislation when you are big and bad.\n  But what we say in the many cases where we don't have that kind of \nconduct--the Senator from North Carolina and I certainly agree on this \npoint--is you will be liable for the proportion of the problem that you \ncaused. We say that the small businesses deserve a break on punitive \ndamages.\n  But let's make no mistake about it, colleagues. If you are big and \nbad, the hooks in this bill are clear. Nobody is getting off the hook. \nYou get stuck with joint and several liability. You can be held for \npunitive damages. That is in the text of this legislation.\n  There is a reason, colleagues, why the little guy is for this bill. \nThere is a reason why the overwhelming number of small businesses in \nthis Nation are for the bill. It is that those risk takers, those \nentrepreneurs, those innovators are saying, as we take the steps to \nmake our systems Y2K compliant, let's also have a safety net so if \nthere are frivolous lawsuits that we aren't going to lose everything as \na result.\n  This bill has seen 11 major changes to favor the consumer, the \nplaintiff, and small businessperson since the legislation left the \nSenate Commerce Committee. I particularly want to credit the chairman \nof the committee, Senator McCain, and the Democratic leader on the \ntechnology issue, Senator Dodd, who have worked so hard to help fashion \nthis proposal.\n  I hope today when we vote that we will not send a message that high \ntechnology doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment that airlines \nget, that the securities industry gets, that the financial services \nsector gets. Let's pass this bill. Let's send it to the conference with \na resounding vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S6986-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1664\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I would like to respond very briefly to \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n  First, I point out that based on my study of the issue it appears to \nme that virtually every consumer group which is composed of, among \nothers, small businesspeople around this country is opposed to this \nbill.\n  Second, and more importantly, Senator Wyden said--I am quoting him--\nthat the ``bill permits recovery of damages for foreseeable \nconsequences.''\n  I say with all due respect to my colleagues that is exactly what the \nbill does not permit. That language appears nowhere in this bill. I \nchallenge him, since he has made that statement, to find the language \nin the bill that says ``damages for foreseeable consequences.''\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that. Of course, that is what many contracts \nsay. That is the economic loss rule. We say that the rights that apply \nare the rights of contracts, which most small businesses enter into \nwhen they buy the system. It is the State economic loss rule. State \ncontract law with respect to economic loss covers those issues.\n  I appreciate him yielding.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My response to that is, first of all, the vast majority \nof the computers are not bought pursuant to a written law in contract, \nbecause most folks are not able to hire a team of lawyers to draft a \ncontract on their behalf. So the contracting is a meaningless concept, \nexcept as between one\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nbig company buying the computer system from another big company. \nOtherwise, contracts don't exist. In the absence of a contract, this \nbill eliminates recovery of economic losses.\n  It is that simple. They do not allow for the recovery of damages that \nare the result of foreseeable consequences.\n  It is a huge, fundamental problem with this bill. It will not allow \npeople to recover anything but the cost of their computer. That is what \nthe bill says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say thanks to my friends, Senator \nHollings and Senator McCain. They worked very hard on moving this piece \nof legislation through.\n  I really like the premise of this bill. As a matter of fact, when I \nsaw there was a bill introduced, and there were several that gave a 90-\nday cooling off period where we can fix the Y2K problem, I thought, \nthere is a great idea. But the more I got into it, the more I saw the \nconsumers being trampled on.\n  That is not the way my friend from Oregon sees it. I have the utmost \nrespect for him. We just simply disagree. I say: How do you know who is \nright? I harken to what Senator Edwards said. Every consumer group is \nagainst it. They don't like taking on lost causes that they are going \nto lose.\n  This bill is going to pass overwhelmingly. Why would consumer groups \nstep up to the plate and say it is wrong? Because in their heart they \nknow the bill goes too far.\n  I am just going to give you three examples of what happened to this \nbill when it came to the floor. I am going to pick out three amendments \nas examples as to why this bill moved over so far to the anticonsumer.\n  Take one of the amendments of Senator Edwards. My friend offered an \namendment that simply said that if you sell a computer in the year of \n1999, or you sell software, and it is supposed to be Y2K compliant and \nsomething happens, you should get the protection of the underlying \nbill.\n  Why should we protect people who sell a computer to an ordinary \nperson, or a small business, or sell software in the year of 1999, I \nsay to my friend, as late as November of 1999, and then, whoops, it \ngoes wrong, and in the year 2000 you still get the protection of this \nbill? I don't get it. It goes too far.\n  Then we have the Boxer amendment supported by a number of my friends.\n  What did that say? In the remediation period of that 60 days after \nyou have notified the computer company or the software company that you \nhave a failed product, they have to fix it, if they have a fix.\n  We had 31 votes or something like that. Where are the voices of the \nconsumer in this Senate? It is perplexing to me. We showed at that time \nthe law of the State of Arizona, a law on Y2K protecting their computer \npeople, as well. Guess what. It said in the remediation period, you \nmust offer a fix to the people.\n  If this is supposed to cure the problem, how are we curing it when we \nvote down the Boxer amendment, which said if there is a fix, fix the \ncomputer, fix the problem?\n  Today, we have the Gregg amendment. If I am correct, it is my \nunderstanding that the Gregg amendment will be accepted; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I don't know. I had not discussed it with the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If it is accepted or we know they will pass because they \nall are passing, what does the Gregg amendment do? Under the Gregg \namendment, if your small business makes a certain chemical and has to \nlive by the rules of the Environmental Protection Agency regarding \ndumping of that chemical, but your computer goes on the fritz--I don't \nmean that in a derogatory way--your computer breaks down, guess what. \nUnder the Gregg amendment you don't have to live by the environmental \nlaws. Dump that stuff anywhere, because you will get a waiver which \nsays the problem was my computer went down and, therefore, I can't live \nwithin the environmental laws.\n  This is amazing.\n  I have given the Senator three examples of how every proconsumer \namendment has been voted down and every amendment that flies in the \nface of good government has moved forward. I am totally shocked and \nchagrined that we could not even pass the simplest amendments.\n  I see my friend from Vermont is here. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier I came to the floor to show what \nhappens in an actual case today under the law.\n  In a case in Warren, MI, a man bought a $100,000 computer system and \nit was not Y2K compliant. He almost lost his business. However, he was \nable to follow the State laws we have today. He was able to use State \nlaw, enforce it, and save going into bankruptcy, save being out of \nbusiness.\n  Under the law before the Senate today, instead, here is what would \nhappen. Rather than a straight line of protection for that small \nbusinessperson, here is the way it goes: dead end, dead end, roadblock, \nroadblock, dead end, dead end, roadblock.\n  Now they say they have cured it. What did they do? They took off one \nof the roadblocks.\n  Look at this chart. The roads in Kosovo are easier to drive through \nthan the roads on this so-called Y2K ``correction'' bill.\n  I wish we did what we did last year. We had a good Y2K bill. The \ninformation-sharing law, S. 96, was done in a truly bipartisan way. It \npassed virtually unanimously. It was signed into law.\n  Now we have a bill, instead of making efforts to bring all parties \ntogether to have a bill the President could sign, we have something we \nknow the President will veto, and he will veto it because of these dead \nends, because of these detours, because of these roadblocks, because \nthe court door is slammed, and because it wipes out every single State \nlaw in this country--all 50.\n  Mr. President, a few months ago, I came to the Senate floor to take a \nlook at what this Y2K liability bill will actually do in a real life \nsituation. I had a similar chart with me at that time.\n  Since then, we have heard some of my colleagues praise the so-called \ncompromise on the Y2K liability protection bill. I have adjusted my \nchart to take into account the changes made to S. 96. You can see that \nthis new so-called compromise eliminated only one road block on the \nroad to justice. The ``compromise'' dropped liability protection for \nofficers and directors of corporations that have Y2K computer problems. \nAll these other special legal protections are still in S. 96.\n  Let's take a closer look at my chart under the modified S. 96. The \nchart still illustrates the many detours, roadblocks and dead ends that \nthis bill would impose on a innocent plaintiff in our state-based legal \nsystem. Let's take a real life example of a Y2K problem and see what \nwould happen under the sweeping terms of this new bill.\n  A small business owner from Warren, Michigan, Mark Yarsike, testified \nthis year before the Commerce and Judiciary Committees about his Y2K \nproblems. In 1997, he brought a new computer cash register system for \nhis small business, Produce Palace, that was not Y2K compliant. \nNaturally, he assumed his new cash register system would be Y2K \ncompliant. But it was not.\n  His brand new high-tech cash register system, which cost almost \n$100,000, kept crashing. After more than 200 service calls, it was \nfinally discovered that his computer cash register system kept breaking \ndown because it could not read credit cards with an expiration date in \nthe year 2000. A Y2K computer defect that would be covered under this \nso-called ``compromise'' bill.\n  At the top of this chart is how the state-based court system works \ntoday for Mark Yarsike. His business buys a new computerized cash \nregister system and a Y2K defect crashes the system. He then asks the \ncash register company to fix the system. If Congress rejects current \nY2K liability legislation, a small business owner has two options under \ntraditional state law.\n  The cash register company agrees to solve the Y2K problem and the \nsmall\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nbusiness owner has a quick and fair settlement.\n  If the company fails to fix the cash register system with the Y2K \ndefect, then a small business owner has the option to have his day in \ncourt and proceed with a fair trial. That is what Mark Yarsike did. He \nwas forced to buy a new computer cash register system from another \ncompany and sued the first company that sold him the non-Y2K compliant \nsystem. He was able to recoup his losses through a fair settlement.\n  Today's court system worked for him.\n  Now what happens to that same small business owner who brought a Y2K \ndefective computer cash register system under the bill before us. Well, \nthe current ``compromise'' bill overrides the 50 state laws and places \nnew Federal detours, roadblocks, and dead ends from justice for that \nsmall business owner. Let's take another look at the chart.\n  If Congress enacts this Y2K liability protection legislation that \noverrides state law, the small business owner faces all these special \nlegal protections on his road to justice.\n  The bill's sweeping legal restrictions include--90 day waiting \nperiod, preservation of unconscionable contracts' terms, heightened \npleading requirements, new class action requirements, duty to \nanticipate and avoid Y2K damages, override of implied warranties under \nstate law, caps on punitive damages, limits on joint and several \nliability, and bystander liability protection. All these special legal \nprotections still apply to small business owners and consumers under \nthis so-called ``compromise.''\n  All these dead ends on the road to justice may force a small business \nowner, like Mark Yarsike, to file for bankruptcy or lay off employees.\n  The bill contains severe limits on recovery by capping punitive \ndamages to 3 times the amount of compensatory damages or $250,000, \nwhichever is less, for medium-sized and small businesses. The sponsors \nof this ``compromise'' have touted the fact that they struck the looser \npunitive damages cap for larger businesses that was in the bill. I \nagree that this is an improvement, but it comes with another troubling \ncompromise.\n  The bill now defines small businesses as firms with fewer than 50 \nemployees, instead of firms with fewer than 25 employees, which was the \ndefinition in the original bill. As a result, the absolute cap of \n$250,000 on punitive damages now applies to many more businesses \nwithout any justification. Never before in any product liability tort \n``reform'' bill has a small business been defined so broadly.\n  An exception to this punitive damages cap has been added if a \nplaintiff can prove that the defendant intentionally defrauded the \nplaintiff. Of course, the plaintiff must prove this by a higher \nstandard of proof than normal--by clear and convincing evidence. Even \nthe legal standard to prove an exception is stacked against the \nplaintiff under this bill.\n  This exception will prove meaningless in the real world because no \none will be able to meet this exception for proving the injury was \nspecifically intended. How in the world is our small business owner \ngoing to prove that the cash register company intentionally tried to \ninjury him by selling a Y2K defective cash register system? How in the \nworld is our small business owner going to prove this specific intent \nby clear and convincing evidence? Get real.\n  As a result, the small business owner who is harmed by the Y2K \ndefective cash register system may be forced into bankruptcy or lay off \nemployees.\n  To the credit of the sponsors of this ``compromise,'' they have \nstruck the last road block in the original bill--special liability \nprotection to directors and officers of companies involved in Y2K \ndisputes. I commend them for striking this section. Providing special \nY2K liability protection to the key company decision makers would \nhinder Y2K remediation efforts. Instead, we want to encourage these key \ndecision makers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance \nmeasures.\n  I hope special legal protections for corporate officers and directors \ndoes not resurface in the final bill after conference with the House.\n  A few of these detours, roadblocks and dead ends in this so-called \n``compromise'' may be justified to prevent frivolous Y2K litigation. \nBut certainly not all of them.\n  This bill makes seeking justice for the harm caused by a Y2K computer \nproblem into a game of chutes and ladders--but there are only chutes \nfor plaintiffs and no ladders. The defendant wins every time under the \nrigged rules of this game.\n  Unfortunately, this so-called compromise bill still overreaches again \nand again. It is not close to being balanced.\n  During Senate consideration of S. 96 last week, some of my colleagues \nand I offered amendments to add some balance to this bill. But the \nmajority defeated every one.\n  Senator John Kerry offered an alternative, which was endorsed by the \nWhite House. The President would sign Senator Kerry's bill tomorrow, \nbut the majority voted it down.\n  I offered a consumer protection amendment to exclude ordinary \nconsumers from the bill's legal detours, road blocks and dead ends. My \namendment would have granted relief from the bill's broad Federal \npreemption for ordinary consumers to access their home state consumer \nprotection laws. But the majority voted it down.\n  Senator Edwards offered two amendments to add balance to the bill. \nThe first clarified the bill's economic loss section to ensure that \nrecovery would be permitted only for claims allowed under applicable \nstate or Federal law effective on January 1, 1999. The second excluded \nbad actors from the bill's special legal protections if they sold non-\nY2K compliant products in 1999. But again the majority voted down these \namendments.\n  Senator Boxer offered an amendment for computer manufacturers to \noffer free or at-cost fixes to small businesses and consumers who had \npurchased Y2K defective products as a requirement for these same \ncomputer manufacturers to be protected under S. 96. This amendment \nwould have added real balance to the bill. But the majority voted it \ndown.\n  The prospect of Y2K computer problems requires remedial efforts and \nincreased compliance. But as last week's delay in voting on final \npassage of S. 96 made clear, this bill is not about promoting Y2K \ncompliance; it is about sweeping liability protection and partisan \npolitics.\n  I fear that all the special legal protections for Y2K problems in S. \n96 will hinder serious Y2K remediation efforts in 1999. Instead of \npassing protections against future lawsuits, Congress should be \nencouraging Y2K remediation efforts during the last six months of 1999. \nWe have to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. \nUltimately, the best business policy and the best defense against Y2K-\nbased lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant.\n  That is why I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small \nbusinesses prepare for 2000. That is why I taped a Y2K public service \nannouncement in my home state. That is why I cosponsored Senator Bond \nand Senator Kerry's new law, the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness \nAct,'' to create SBA loans for small businesses to eliminate their Y2K \ncomputer problems now. That is why I introduced, with Senator Dodd as \nthe lead cosponsor, the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act,'' S. 962, \nto offer new tax incentives for purchasing Y2K compliant hardware and \nsoftware.\n  These real measures will avoid future Y2K lawsuits by encouraging Y2K \ncompliance now.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to pass into law a consensus \nbill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure \nAct.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator \nDodd, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach \nagreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K \ncompliance.\n  The new law, enacted less than nine months ago, is working to \nencourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test \nresults. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not \nlimiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact \nbalanced and narrow legislation to deter frivolous Y2K litigation while \nencouraging responsible Y2K compliance.\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\n  Unlike last year's Y2K information sharing law, S. 96 is not narrow \nor balanced. Instead it is a wish list for special interests that are \nor might become involved in Y2K litigation.\n  This bill sends the wrong signal to the business community about its \nY2K remediaton efforts. It is telling them; ``Don't worry, be happy.'' \nThat will only make Y2K computer problems worse next year, instead of \nfixing them this year.\n  The coming of the millennium should not be an excuse for cutting off \nthe rights of those who will be harmed, turning our States' civil \njustice system upside down, or immunizing those who recklessly \ndisregard the coming problem to the detriment of American consumers.\n  I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the \nSenate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would protect \nconsumers, deter frivolous Y2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K \ncompliance. S. 96 is not that bill.\n  The President will veto S. 96 in its present form, as he should. Then \nperhaps we can sit down with all interested parties and craft a truly \nbalanced bill.\n  Those of us in Congress who have been active on technology-related \nissues have struggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a \nbipartisan way. It would be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the \ntechnology industry, technology users and to all consumers, if that \npattern is broken over this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Alabama, Senator \nSessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \ncomment on this extremely important bill. I congratulate Senator McCain \nfor his leadership. I am confident it will pass with a strong vote.\n  This morning we completed our second day of a joint economic \ncommittee on the high-tech national summit. We have heard some of the \nleading practitioners of computer business in America, including Alan \nGreenspan and the president of MIT, and we have discussed the \ntremendous role computers and high-tech equipment have played in the \neconomic growth of this country.\n  Most people may not know that for a number of years the average wage \nof Americans has been increasing twice as fast as the cost of living. \nThat is exactly what we want in America. We want productivity. That \noccurs because of an increase in the productivity of our workforce.\n  Mr. Greenspan, who everybody recognizes is such a knowledgeable \nperson about our economy, attributes that primarily to the increased \nproductivity that has come from being on line with our computer \nsystems.\n  Experts, including Bill Gates of Microsoft, talked about the leading \nexports from the United States being computer related.\n  This is good for America. We are buying more than we take in. We are \nselling less than we buy. We need to change that. We need to increase \nour exports. The one industry that is strong in that record is the \ncomputer industry.\n  Craig Barrett of Intel testified yesterday. I asked him about the Y2K \nbill. He said it was critical for their industry to maintain economic \ngrowth.\n  Some say they can pay, and we can sue and sue. I know one Senator \nmentioned a case, and I believe it was the same case, in which a man \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He had filed a lawsuit \nover the computers in his company. He eventually won. I asked him how \nlong it took. The litigation took 2 years.\n  With regard to asbestos, we have 200,000 lawsuits completed, 200,000 \npending, with another 200,000 expected. They are filed all over this \ncountry. Do we want hundreds of thousands, perhaps even a million or \nmore, lawsuits filed in every court in America, with every single case \nclogging those courts, distracting the computer companies from fixing \nthe problem, trying to defend against the litigation with punitive \ndamages and other unexpected costs that somebody might claim in a \nlawsuit?\n  We need to act. It is the responsibility of Congress to set the \nstandards for lawsuits. We have every right to do that. That is what \nthe legislative branch does.\n  We have an industry that deals throughout the United States. It deals \nthroughout the world. We need to make sure it fixes the problem--and \nfocuses on fixing the problem, not on draining its resources.\n  With regard to asbestos, 70 percent of the asbestos companies are now \nin bankruptcy, and of the money they paid out through this litigation \nonslaught, only 40 percent actually got to the victims.\n  What I think this bill is intended to do, with strong bipartisan \nsupport, is to make sure the moneys these companies spend are spent on \nfixing the problem. The idea that somehow joint and several liability \nis horrible is not so. Many States already have joint and several \nliability in every aspect of their legal system. We are simply saying \nfor this one problem we will have joint and several liability. Frankly, \nI think that is the better way to go. Why should a company that is not \nresponsible but for 10 percent of the problem pay the whole cost of the \nproblem? What is just about that? I don't think that is a good \nargument.\n  We have a potential crisis in our country. We have the potential, \nmake no mistake about it, to significantly damage our highest and most \nproductive industry, the industry that has led to our economic growth \nand increased wages for American workers. We are endangering that \ncommunity. If anyone thinks hundreds of thousands of lawsuits filed \nagainst all our computer companies in every county in America will not \ndrain them of creativity, will not drain them of research and \ndevelopment, will not reduce their ability to be competitive in the \nworld, I suggest that person is clearly wrong.\n\n  I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Dodd, on that side, and Senators \nMcCain and Hatch, who have worked on this bill. They have done a good \njob, and I am pleased to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support S. 96, the Y2K Act of 1999. The \nsubject of Y2K liability is an important and timely issue for the \nSenate to address. As you know, I serve on the Senate Special Committee \non the Year 2000 Technology Problem. Earlier this year, the Committee \nheld a hearing examining Y2K litigation and its potential effect on the \ncourts. A study by the Gartner Group estimated that the cost of Y2K-\nrelated litigation could reach $1 trillion.\n  The issue of liability is especially important to me. Last Congress, \nI sponsored the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, \nwhich became law. That legislation encouraged companies to disclose and \nexchange information about computer processing problems, solutions, \ntest practices, and test results that have to do with preparing for the \nyear 2000. The goal of the bill was to encourage information sharing, \nwhich would in turn lead to remediation, which would in turn lead to \ngreater Y2K compliance. Unfortunately, many companies still fear \nliability, and it is that fear of lawsuits that is inhibiting them from \ngetting done what is needed--which is remediation. The goal of S. 96, \nlike that of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness and Disclosure \nAct, is to ease the fear of lawsuits so businesses can focus on \nremediation rather than litigation.\n  S. 96 is the second major Y2K bill passed by the Congress. Earlier \nthis year, the Senate passed (by a vote of 99 to 0) the Small Business \nY2K Readiness Act, which became law on April 2. The bill directed the \nSmall Business Administration to establish a loan guarantee program to \nguarantee loans of up to $1 million for small businesses to fix their \ncomputers or tackle other Y2K-related problems.\n  S. 96 enjoys bipartisan support and the backing of a broad coalition \nof business groups--large and small--including the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the Information Technology Association of America, the \nNational Retail Federation, the National Association of Independent \nBusiness, the Semiconductor Industry Association, to name a few. The \nbill provides incentives for fixing Y2K problems before failures occur \nand it encourages the prompt resolution of Y2K problems if they do \noccur.\n  Finally, I commend my colleague from Arizona, John McCain, for his \ntireless efforts in navigating this bill through the Commerce Committee \nand for his repeated attempts to secure its\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\npassage on the Senate floor. S. 96 will provide much needed protection \nagainst a potential flood of lawsuits against the nation's business \ncommunity and I look forward to its prompt signature by the President.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 96, the Year \n2000 liability legislation. The problems caused by faulty computer \nsoftware on January 1, 2000 may be severe, and some legislation \naddressing that problem may be warranted. Although I had concerns about \nS. 96 as it was originally offered, I supported invoking cloture on the \nbill because I wanted to see the compromise process continue so as to \npossibly improve the legislation. But even the modified bill would \ncause the litigation nightmare that it ostensibly seeks to avoid.\n  Were this bill to become law, both State and Federal courts would be \nrequired to resolve disputes resulting from Year 2000 failures not \nunder familiar legal standards developed over 200 years, but by \napplying new legal terms and definitions, or terms never before applied \nto this context. As a result, vast amounts of litigation will be \nrequired to establish the meaning of those terms, and various State and \nFederal courts are certain to adopt different views of the same \nlanguage.\n  For instance, the bill applies to injuries that result ``directly or \nindirectly from an actual or potential Y2K failure.'' Because it would \nbe in the interest of defendants to apply the liability shields \ncontained in this bill as widely as possible, many types of cases \ncertainly will be characterized as ``result[ing] directly or indirectly \nfrom an actual or potential Y2K failure.'' Pre-trial motions, trial \ncourt rulings, appellate court decisions, and ultimately, appellate \ncourt rulings to resolve conflicting appellate court rulings will be \nnecessary before the scope of cases actually covered by the bill is \nfinally determined. Courts will consume years determining the meaning \nof other operative terms, such as ``material defect,'' or deciding \nprecisely what factors are relevant in assessing ``the nature of the \nconduct.''\n  Although punitive damages have been a staple of the common law, this \nbill would impose a punitive damages regime never before adopted in any \njurisdiction. While some States have adopted caps on punitive damages \nfor noneconomic damages in personal injury cases, this bill represents \nthe first time that a law would cap punitive damages with respect to \nproperty damage. No one has offered a compelling reason for this \ncourse. And no one can predict what the consequence will be of a \nblanket Federal rule on this subject in the absence of any State \nexperiences with this approach.\n  The bill's effects on the procedures for resolving cases are equally \nserious. It would permit a defendant to respond to a complaint by \nindicating a willingness to engage in alternative dispute resolution. \nBut the bill makes no provision for the actual availability of \nalternative dispute resolution in federal courts that lack them, nor \ndoes it ensure the use of State ADR procedures. And federal law would \ncontrol the pleading requirements even of State law causes of action \nbrought in state courts.\n  Additionally, I am concerned about the effect this bill would have on \nsmall businesses. Unless a small business is in the computer business, \nits exclusive role in Year 2000 litigation will be as a plaintiff, not \na defendant. But this bill provides benefits only to defendants, \nbenefits that would be of no use to most small businesses. At the same \ntime, it denies otherwise available legal rights to small business \nplaintiffs. Apart from restricting their right to recover punitive \ndamages, small businesses who currently could bring an action against a \nlandlord who fails to provide working elevators so that customers and \nemployees can reach their offices would not be able under this bill to \nsue the landlord if he for failed to take action now to make sure that \nthose elevators will work on January 1, 2000. The landlord's relief \nfrom liability will both increase the chances that a small business' \nelevator will not work and decrease the recovery that the small \nbusiness can obtain if in fact the elevator does not work.\n  Similarly, a small business that bought a computer that did not work \nnow has the right to obtain consequential damages from that failure. If \nthe business had to shut down because of the failure, the business \nowner could recover the lost profits for the period that the defective \ncomputer caused the shutdown. But under this legislation, all that the \nbusiness owner who files a tort and contract lawsuit could obtain is \nrecovery for damage to the computer itself. No compensation would be \npermitted for real injuries that the owner faces. There is no reason to \nimpose this hardship on a small business that bought a product that it \nhad every reason to believe would work. There is no reason to increase \nthe protection of the company that did not take the appropriate steps \nto ensure Y2K compliance as against the workers who will be laid off \nbecause the small business cannot continue to operate.\n  Even though the bill does preempt state law in a number of areas, \nfederal action might be appropriate to address a unique event such as \nthe Year 2000 problem. There could in fact be a large volume of \nlitigation that could overwhelm courts. But this bill is not an \neffective means of addressing that possible calamity. Reducing in \nadvance the exposure of people who made non-Y2K compliant products will \nreduce neither the scope of the computer malfunctions nor the number of \nlawsuits. Restrictions only on the ability of plaintiffs, such as \nindividuals and small businesses, to recover damages, no matter how \nmeritorious their cases, is not warranted. S. 96 will create many new \nissues to litigate, increase the likelihood that the Year 2000 problem \nwill be great rather than small, and harm the ability of innocent \npersons to recover that which their states legally entitle them to \nretain. These are not desirable objectives, and for these reasons I \noppose this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the debate surrounding Y2K Liability is a \nvery important one. The estimated cost associated with Y2K issues vary \ngreatly, ranging from $600 billion to $1.6 trillion worldwide. The \namount of litigation that will result from Y2K-related failures is \nuncertain, but at least one study has guestimated the costs for Y2K \nrelated litigation and damages to be at $300 billion.\n  With that in mind, several bills have been drafted which encourage \ncompanies to prevent Y2K failures and to remedy problems quickly if \nthey occur, and to deter frivolous lawsuits. It has essentially boiled \ndown to 2 bills: the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill, and the Kerry bill. Many \nof the provisions within the bills are the same; however, there are a \ncouple of issues that warrant discussion.\n  I have studied these bills closely. And for me, what it all comes \ndown to is two simple questions: Which bill provides more of an \nincentive for computer companies to identify and remedy potential Y2K \nproblems? And, second, what effect will this legislation have on \nconsumers?\n  First. Which bill provides more of an incentive for computer \ncompanies to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems? To answer that \nquestion, one needs to understand what the backers of this bill are so \nconcerned about. The people that are pushing for this bill, namely, \nsome of the computer companies and big business, are not afraid of me. \nThey are not afraid of what Congress might do to them. What they are \nconcerned about, and what they are afraid of, is 12 men and women on a \njury. They are afraid of what a jury might do to them if they are sued \nand their case ends up in court before a jury.\n  Let me be clear: I do think this Y2K liability is a special situation \nand believe that we should provide computer companies with some type of \ncertainty and protection from these lawsuits. That is why I want to \npass one of these bills. However, I think we need to be careful that \nthe protections we provide aren't so great that companies no longer \nhave an incentive to fix their Y2K problems.\n  So, when I hear people asking to ``cap'' the amount of punitive \ndamages that can be imposed against them, I can't help but to wonder, \n``Why do you need to worry about that? The only time punitive damages \nare awarded is if the person has done something flagrantly wrong.''\n  Similarly, proportionate liability, which provides assurances to the \ndefendant on how much money he would have to pay the plaintiff, is fair \nand reasonable for most defendants, but\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nnot all defendants. Under the Kerry bill, only good corporate citizens \nwill have the benefit of proportionate liability. Under the McCain \nbill, all corporate citizens, no matter whether they act in good faith \nor bad faith, will be rewarded with proportionate liability.\n  Computer companies must have an incentive to identify and remedy \npotential Y2K problems. If we pass the McCain bill, which both caps \npunitive damages, and rewards all corporate citizens, both good and \nbad, with proportionate liability, I believe that would provide a \ndisincentive to remedy potential Y2K problems.\n  Therefore, the answer to the first question is clear: the Kerry bill \nprovides more incentive for computer companies to identify and remedy \npotential Y2K problems.\n  Second. The second question I had to answer is what effect will this \nlegislation have on consumers? To answer that question, we need to look \nat one provision in particular: the economic loss provision. The \neconomic loss provision has to do with whether a small business owner \nor the consumer is allowed to recover for lost profits, lost overhead, \nand out-of-pocket costs.\n  The McCain bill bars the recovery of economic losses for businesses \nin all Y2K contexts. The economic loss rule that I support, and the \nrule followed in most jurisdictions, says that if the parties have \nagreed by contract about the allocation of loss, then that agreement \nshould govern. If there is no contract, then state law would apply.\n  What does this mean? It means that under the McCain bill, consumers \nand small businesses are going to be at a disadvantage. To illustrate, \nlet's look at a very practical example that would apply to many small \nbusinesses in Nebraska. A businessman wants to open a flower shop. He \ngoes into a computer store and talks to a computer salesman. That \nsalesman tells the businessman that the computer is Y2K compliant and \nthat come January 1, 2000, the computer will be fine. The businessman \nbuys the computer for $5,000. The flower shop opens and is doing great. \nOn January 1, 2000, the computer crashes and can not be fixed for four \nweeks. The businessman relies on his computer for almost everything, \nincluding as a cash register, a client database, and record keeping. As \na result of the computer crash, his business is severely affected--he \npays bills late, he can't meet payroll, and he loses customers, costing \nhim a total of $75,000. Under the McCain bill, the only damages the \nbusinessman can recover are the cost of the computer, $5,000. The \neconomic loss rule I support, the Edwards amendment, would allow the \nbusinessman to make a case as to why he should be able to recover at \nleast some of his lost profit. Thus, to answer to the second question, \nthe McCain bill would unfairly place small businesses and consumers at \na disadvantage to computer companies.\n  Because of these reasons, I will cast a vote against the McCain Y2K \nLiability bill. I want to reiterate that I support the goals of this \nlegislation--I want computer companies to have an incentive to identify \nand remedy potential Y2K problems, and I don't want there to be an \nonslaught of frivolous lawsuits beginning on January 2, 2000. \nUnfortunately, I do not believe the McCain bill in its current form is \nthe proper way to address these issues.\n  If these issues are properly addressed in conference, I will support \nthe conference report. Until that happens, although the McCain bill may \nachieve its goal of eliminating frivolous lawsuits, I believe this \ncomes at too high a price to our small businesses and consumers.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the overriding point to be made today \nis that the vast majority of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, and \nthe White House, agree on the need for legislation to encourage Y2K \nreadiness and to prevent frivolous litigation.\n  We all agree that there is likely to be a surge in Y2K related \ncomplaints and lawsuits and that everyone will benefit if many of those \ncases can be dealt with outside the courtroom. We agree on the need to \nencourage consumers and businesses to use remediation to fix Y2K \nproblems and to use negotiation to settle disputes.\n  Where we differ is on the details of how to get there. And let me \nassure you from my 11 years of experience as a proponent of product \nliability reform--the details matter.\n  And the details should matter. In liability reforms, and especially \ntort reforms, what's at stake is the basic balance between plaintiffs \nand defendants, consumers and business, injured and responsible \nparties. Our state courts and legislatures have struggled for several \nhundred years to get that balance right. If we're going to change their \nwork then we have a responsibility to work hard at getting the details \nright, too.\n  Senators Kerry and Daschle deserve a great deal of credit for wading \ninto the middle of the Y2K liability reform issue. I've been in their \nshoes before, and I know how hard it is to try to find the middle \nground. It is no easy feat to craft a bill that protects consumers, \ngives business the predictability and relief from frivolous suits they \ndeserve, wins the support of the majority in Congress, and would secure \na presidential signature.\n  Senators Kerry and Daschle came up with a bill that gives the high-\ntech community about 80 percent of what they want, that meets every one \nof the objections outlined by the White House, and that won 41 votes in \nthe Senate last week. I voted for that bill.\n  Forty-one votes, including the votes of many Senators who hold strong \nreservations about federalizing any part of our tort liability system \nat all. Forty-one votes shows us in plain terms that there is obvious \noverlap on the core issues and principals of this bill, and on a good \nmany of the details.\n  What is so regrettable is that even after our negotiating a bill that \ngives most stakeholders most of what they say they need, my Republican \ncolleagues and much of the business community would rather have an \nissue than a bill. A negotiated compromise that gives them 80 percent \nof what they want but also keep the courts open to legitimate claims \napparently isn't enough.\n  So rather than achieve a major portion of their goals for the year \n2000, they've decided to put all of us through an exercise that will \nresult in nothing. Believe me, I've been down this road before. I know \nthese issues, I know these stakeholders, I know the vote counts, and I \nknow this White House on liability reforms. And I know what the outcome \nwill be if we continue down this dead-end path.\n  What baffles me is to see the business community, once again, choose \nnothing. Haven't we learned from years of legislating on liability \nreforms that purists come away emptyhanded?\n  The bottom line is that the bill before us today is simply too far \nafield of what's doable. And the best way to get back on course for \nenacting a Y2K law is to vote against this bill and sit down at the \nnegotiating table.\n  Unlike the never-ending products liability debate the opportunity to \ndeal with Y2K suits won't last long. We can't afford to get it wrong. \nAnd we don't have time to pass a bill that we know will be vetoed and \nthen come back to the drawing board.\n  I urge my colleagues not to squander this opportunity.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleague, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, a few questions regarding his \namendment Thursday to the Y2K Bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and I am \npleased to answer any questions he might have.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator's amendment refers to temporary non-compliance \nwith ``federally enforceable requirements'' because of factors related \nto a Y2K failure beyond the control of the party charged with \ncompliance. Could the Senator provide an example of such a federally \nenforceable requirement so that this Body can understand the practical \nscope of the Senator's amendment, especially what would and would not \nbe an imminent threat to health, safety or the environment that would \nbar the use of the defense?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would be pleased to. An example of a use of the defense \nthat this amendment would provide would be a federally enforceable \nreporting requirement on an energy facility. Suppose a plant operator \nis vigilant at the controls of a conventional power plant. At the \nstroke of midnight New Year's the plant is operating smoothly, and \npower is being transmitted to homes, hospitals, and nursing homes right \non schedule. Further, the operator can see clearly that the \nenvironmental machinery that cleans emissions such as\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nsulfur dioxide (an acid rain precursor) or nitrogen oxides (a \ncontributor to smog) is operating normally in every respect save one. \nThe computer read-out from the continuous emissions monitor at the top \nof the smoke stack does not seem to be transmitting or storing the \nemission data verifying that equipment is otherwise in normal function. \nRepairing the bug in the monitor transmitter may take a few days over \nthe holiday weekend.\n  Without my amendment the plant operator faces a terrible choice. Does \nhe shut down the whole plant and let the people in the nursing homes \nfreeze in the dark, or does he run the risk of severe sanctions for \ndisregarding a requirement that he provide government agencies an \nunbroken chain of emission monitor print-outs? Mind you, he knows the \npollution is being controlled as usual because he or she has hands on \nthe equipment. With my amendment, the plant could keep operating, \nnobody's lights would have to go out unless--and this is key--doing so \ndoes not threaten public health, safety, or the environment. This is \nnot a holiday from environmental quality laws.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Could the Senator also provide an example of when the \ndefense would not apply?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Certainly, suppose the power plant were nuclear and--this \ntime--a temperature gauge is broken and the operator does not really \nknow whether the plant is operating in safe mode or not. In such a \ncase, the operator could not, under my amendment, ``drive in the dark \nwith no lights on.'' Clearly operating in such a fashion that could \npose a risk to health, safety, or the environment would receive no \nprotection under my amendment, and no sympathy from me.\n  Mr. WYDEN. What does the phrase ``federally enforceable \nrequirements'' mean? Is it broader than federal requirements?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is broader only in the following respect. Many federal \nstandards are actually implemented in collaboration with states. For \nexample, it could technically be a state-issued monitoring and data \nrecordation and reporting program that is enforceable federally.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for clarifying his \namendment and I thank him for his work on this issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon's interest in my \namendment and I thank him for his support and assistance in getting my \namendment accepted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in little more that six months time, each \nand every American is going to be impacted by one of the simplest, yet \nmost complex technological problems we have ever faced. The so-called \nY2K computer problem--simple to understand, but enormously complex in \nterms of its solution--has the potential to adversely affect every \nfacet of our lives. Yet, while no one can say with absolute certainty \nwhat consequences will flow from the new year, there is one thing our \nlitigious nation can be sure of: Come January 1st, many Americans will \nseek redress in our nation's courtrooms.\n  At the very time when businesses will need to focus their attention \non mending computer problems and helping others deal with service \ndisruptions, too many companies will, unfortunately, find themselves \ndistracted from that important task by the threat of legal action. \nEqually troubling is the possibility of hundreds of thousands of law \nsuits being brought in a matter of weeks or months; a situation which \ncould simply overwhelm our judicial system.\n  Consequently, I am concerned that, unless we act now, our legal \nsystem may not be able to adequately address the ramifications of the \nnew year in an efficient, fair, and effective manner. But beyond the \ncourthouse doors, I am also deeply concerned about the potential long-\nterm effect on our nation's computer industry.\n  Mr. President, a generation ago, the United States was the world's \npreeminent producer of manufactured goods. At one time, we were \nunrivaled in our construction of automobiles, aircraft, consumer \nelectronics, communications equipment including satellite technology, \nand steel, to name but a few. For various reasons, though, we have lost \nour dominant position in each of these important areas. No longer do \nforeign companies immediately look to the U.S. when seeking to purchase \nan airplane or a role of steel. And no longer do consumers around the \nworld automatically purchase an American-made television, an American-\nmade radio or an American-made camera. Those days are gone.\n  Yet, despite that circumstance, unsettling as it may be, the fact \nremains that the United States is predominate in the world of computers \nand computer technology. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and \nCompaq, are household names around the world, and for good reason. \nThey, among many others, are American success stories that have \nproduced enormous benefits to our nation's economy and provided our \nworkers with good, high-paying jobs.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am troubled by the fact that some small \nbusinesses may suffer as a result of a Y2K failure. But it also \ntroubles me to think that we may be on the verge of litigating our \ncomputer industry into submission. Where are we if, in our zeal to \nplace blame, we cripple these corporate entities, some of which may be \nbig and rich, but most of which are small? And how do we preserve what \nmay be our last industrial stronghold if we are willing to treat the \noverwhelming majority of these companies, which have worked diligently \nand in good faith, the same way we treat those few unscrupulous firms \nthat do not wish to accept their responsibilities? I believe that the \nprotections afforded small business in the bill, while not as I would \nhave written them, are adequate.\n  We must acknowledge that what is at stake here is of enormous long-\nterm importance to the economic well-being of every American. Each of \nus has a duty to ensure that our technological and industrial base \nflourishes, not just in the coming months, but for decades. In weighing \nthose factors, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will come to the \nsame conclusion as I and support this legislation for the good of our \neconomy, our workers, and our nation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we should act both to deter frivolous \nlitigation over Y2K defects and to encourage Y2K fixes, but this bill \nwill create as many problems as it solves. Instead of merely \nestablishing incentives to address Y2K defects, several provisions in \nthis bill could, perversely, discourage companies from acting \nresponsibly and reward those who silently --and inexcusably--wait for \ndefects to happen rather than cure them before disaster strikes. In \nshort, I will oppose this measure because it fails to strike the right \nbalance.\n  To be sure, the bill has improved from earlier versions, and some \nsections--like class action reform to curtail frivolous lawsuits and a \n90-day waiting period to promote remediation instead of litigation--are \nsteps in the right direction. Still, provisions like limits on punitive \ndamages and a one-sided duty on consumers to anticipate all Y2K defects \ngive businesses an excuse to continue doing nothing because even the \nbad actors end up with a lower risk for liability. And provisions like \nthe elimination of ``joint and several'' liability, which I have \nsupported in other contexts, seem out of place here where remediation \nis the heart of the matter. In other words, if a company isn't fixing a \ndefect when it could be 100 percent liable, why should limiting its \nliability to a fraction of that be anything but a disincentive to take \ncorrective steps?\n  While this issue has become a political football here in Washington, \nit doesn't play the same way in Wisconsin, where we know how to play \nfootball. Our home State businesses are concerned about the potential \nfor wasteful litigation, and they want to see fixes rather than \nbreakdowns. Like me, they do want Y2K liability reform. That is why I \nsupported the Kerry/Robb substitute. But the Wisconsin businesses \nwho've contacted me don't have very strong feelings about any of the \nprovisions unique to the McCain/Wyden bill. And it is not surprising \nbecause, unlike as with product liability reform, here they are more \nlikely to be plaintiffs than defendants, making them weary of measures \nthat discourage remedial action.\n  I continue to believe that we should generally reform litigation. But \nif we are going to start doing it piecemeal, the place to start is \nprobably in the\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\nproduct liability context, where 90-year-old products, still in use, \nare being judged by today's standards. The place not to start with \nsweeping reform is here--especially when it would benefit a software \nmanufacturer who produces a product in 1998 that becomes dysfunctional \njust two years later and did nothing at all to try to prevent the \ndefect from happening.\n  That said, there are moderate steps we have taken, and can take, to \nhelp address the Y2K issue. For example, last year I cosponsored and \nCongress passed the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act. This law \nencourages the disclosure and exchange of information about computer \nprocessing problems by raising the standard regarding when companies \ncan be liable for releasing false information. I also cosponsored the \nSmall Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, which was signed into law \nearlier this year. It expands the Small Business Administration's \nlending program to provide companies with assistance as they work to \nbecome Y2K compliant. The Kerry/Robb substitute is a reasonable measure \nthat can make a difference and, indeed, that the President can sign.\n  When all is said and done, I suspect we will enact a law this year \nand before the Year 2000, and that it will look a lot more like the \nKerry/Robb substitute than the unbalanced bill before the Senate today. \nThat would be fair to the high tech world and it would be in the best \ninterests of consumers and small businesses in Wisconsin.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to highlight the hypocrisy \nthat I have heard during this debate on S. 96, the Y2K legislation \nadmirably led by my friend, Senator John McCain. I have heard a number \nof Senators up here saying they would not do anything to hurt the high-\ntech industry. Those same Senators then turn around and offer an \namendment or voice their support for an amendment that no one in the \nhigh-tech industry supports, but there is one group who supports their \namendments, the American Trial Lawyers.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, I work with \nleaders from the high-tech industry on a daily basis. I sit back in \namazement when I watch the economic success of our nation, which is \nlargely driven by the high-tech industry. In fact, yesterday, June 14, \nAlan Greenspan testified in front of Chairman Mack's Joint Economic \nCommittee and placed strong emphasis on the fact that the high-tech \nindustry is driving our current economic boom. It is creating an \neconomy like we have never seen before. I am working toward the goal of \nbringing high-tech jobs to Montana, my home state. I believe in my \nheart that the day will come when the high-tech economy delivers more \ngood paying jobs to my fellow Montanans. I do not want anything to get \nin the way of this possibility. Let me give you a few amazing \nstatistics that outline the success and tremendous growth opportunities \nin this industry. In 1998, there was anywhere from $32 billion to $50 \nbillion in electronic commerce done worldwide depending on which \nresearch firm you listen to. The Gartner Group projects that in 2003 \nthere will be $3.2 trillion in electronic commerce done worldwide. \nThink about that, $32 billion in 1998 and over $3.2 trillion in 2003 or \n100 times as much electronic commerce in five years. Friends, we have \nnever seen growth like this in an economic sector in American history. \nFurther, in 2010, 20 percent of worldwide commerce will be done online. \nI ask myself, ``What can the Government do to make sure these numbers \nbecome a reality?''\n  We need to stay out of the way. What can the Government do that could \nstop this unprecedented growth? I can tell you what we could do to stop \nthe growth of the industry, we could listen to our colleagues who are \nup here carrying the water of the trial lawyers.\n  Let me show you exactly why the American trial lawyers do not want to \nsee this legislation pass. The Gartner Group estimates that the cost of \ndealing with the Y2K bug worldwide will run in excess of $600 billion. \nYet, we continuously hear that class action lawsuits and other suits \nare being filed or are being written for later filing that may reach \npast the $1 trillion mark. Do you know any industry in the world that \nis so resilient that it can easily take a $1 trillion hit without being \nslowed down in its growth? I don't. As a matter of fact, as big as the \nY2K problem is, the biggest problem our high-tech industry faces is \nfrom the trial lawyers. We cannot stand by and let this happen.\n  I want the American people to see why many Senators are carrying \nAmendments that are supported by the American trial lawyers. In the \n1998 election cycle, nearly 90 percent of the roughly $2.4 million \ngiven to federal candidates by the American Trial Lawyers Association \nwas given to Democrats. Every single one of the Amendments offered here \non the Senate floor that the American Trial Lawyers Association backed \nhas been offered by Democrats. It is not hard to see the correlation \nand draw conclusions. President Clinton has threatened to veto S. 96 if \npassed in its current form. Sure enough, if you look back to his \nelection in 1996, you find that over 90 percent of the money given by \nthe American Trial Lawyers Association was given to President Clinton \nover former Majority Leader Bob Dole.\n  The Democrats stand on the Senate floor and say that their proposed \namendments to S. 96 are proconsumer. I am here to highlight the \nhypocrisy in that statement. Is it proconsumer to slow the growth of \nour Nation's economy because of frivolous legislation? What the \namendments do and President Clinton's threatened veto stand to do are \nto slow one of the most outstanding eras of economic growth this \ncountry has ever seen. And they say this is proconsumer? As voices for \nthe people, we are elected to do what is best for the citizens of \nAmerica. The high tech industry, which is carrying us into an \nunprecedented era of economic strength, wants to see this bill passed \nso that the $1 trillion plus in threatened lawsuits by the American \ntrial lawyers never become a reality.\n  The Democrats are again threatening to play politics with a matter of \ngrave danger and utmost importance to the American economy. I want to \nsay to my colleagues, stand firm. Push this bill through unchanged, and \nsend it to President Clinton.\n  The growth of the high-tech industry is absolutely critical to the \ncontinued growth of our Nation's economy. Make President Clinton tell \nthe American people that he would rather see the trial lawyers have \ntheir day and pay rather than see one of the most exciting industries \nin American history continue its rise to the top of our Nation's \neconomy. Do not let the American trial lawyers dictate our economy, \nstand in support of Senator McCain's bill, S. 96.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise Y2K \nliability bill before the Senate today.\n  I want to commend my colleagues who have worked hard to put the \nSenate in position to pass this important legislation.\n  After working for years to enact securities litigation reform, I know \nhow tough it is to battle the trial lawyers. In fact, many of the same \nentrepreneurial lawyers who specialize in securities class actions have \nalready begun to file Y2K class actions.\n  Let there be no doubt that being a trial lawyer is big business. In \nanticipation of the problems associated with Y2K, lawyers have been \nputting on seminars on how to plead, try and negotiate Y2K lawsuits. \nNearly 80 companies have already been hit by Y2K lawsuits.\n  Y2K offers these enterprising lawyers a new litigation gold mine. If \nwe do not pass this bill, estimates are that the litigation costs from \nthe Y2K problem will be as much as $1.5 trillion. That exceeds the cost \nof the asbestos, breast implant, tobacco and Superfund lawsuits \ncombined.\n  Our economy is the envy of the world. High technology companies have \ndone much to fuel the growth of the stock market in recent years, and \nthey have provided millions of Americans high paying and rewarding \njobs. The average high-tech wage is nearly 75% higher than the average \nprivate sector wage in the United States. These companies spend nearly \n$40 billion per year in research and development. I would rather see \nhigh-tech firms continue to spend their resources on their employees \nand on improving their products, rather than spend money on lawyers.\n  And there is no doubt that deep-pocketed technology companies will be \nthe most attractive potential defendants in abusive Y2K litigation. \nThese companies proved to be the most attractive for entrepreneurial \nsecurities\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nclass action lawyers, and I have every reason to believe that they will \nfind themselves in the lawyers' cross hairs once again if we don't \nenact this bill.\n  Rather than turn our booming high tech economy over to the trial \nlawyers, this bill seeks to place some reasonable restraints on Y2K \nlitigation. The focus of this bill is to encourage potential litigants \nto fix their Y2K problems without having to resort to the courts, and \nthe lawyers.\n  The bill would require a 90-day cooling off period to allow potential \nplaintiffs to offer a way to cure any Y2K defects which arise in their \nproducts. This is a reasonable alternative to the ``rush to the \ncourthouse'' atmosphere which might prevail without this legislation.\n  I am also pleased to see that the drafters of this bill have chosen \nto include the proportionate liability provisions from the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in this bill. These \nprovisions, taken from the bill Senators Dodd, D'Amato and I passed \ninto law, are the essence of fairness in tort reform. Who can argue \nwith the concept that defendants should only be responsible for the \nportion of damages corresponding to their actual fault in any given \ncase? I guess the trial lawyers might argue with that idea, but few \nothers would.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about punitive damages. I think the \ndrafters of this bill have done all they can, and compromised as much \nas possible on the issue of punitive damages. At this point, unless you \nare a small business, there is no limit in this bill on punitive \ndamages, if the plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the applicable standard for punitives has been met.\n  In my view, I would have liked to see this bill further cap punitive \ndamages. Punitive damages are designed to deter future wrongful \nconduct, but it has been shown that they serve relatively little \ndeterrent purpose. This is particularly true in Y2K cases, where the \nproblem is one that is fixable the first time it is discovered. Since \nwe cannot have another ``millennium problem'' for another thousand \nyears, I fail to see how punitive damages should apply in any Y2K case.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, in describing punitive \ndamages generally many years ago, noted that they invited ``punishment \nso arbitrary as to be virtually random.'' Justice Powell wisely has \ncommented that because juries can impose virtually limitless punitive \ndamages, they act as ``legislator and judge, without the training, \nexperience, or guidance of either.'' Justice Powell didn't know about \nthe Y2K problem when he wrote these words, but they still ring true in \nthis debate here today.\n  While many of us would have liked to see this bill go farther in a \nfew areas, I believe that some lawsuit reform is better than no reform \nat all. Rather than let the trial lawyers run out the clock, the \ndrafters have done a fine job reaching a compromise. This bill is a \nreasoned approach to the problem- one that emphasizes cooperation, not \nlitigation and puts our economic growth and our high-tech businesses \nahead of greedy trial lawyers. I am happy to support it.\n  I thank my colleagues for yielding me time, I again commend the \ndrafters of this bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while most people think of divisions in this \nbody as divisions of party, there are other divisions as well. \nIncreasingly, I'm becoming concerned about the division between those \nwho want to create political issues and those who want to solve \nproblems.\n  From the start of this debate, I realized that the crushing wave of \nlitigation which could accompany the new year threatens to hinder our \nefforts to achieve Y2K readiness and exacerbate the damage done by the \nY2K bug. The prospect of litigation enormously complicates an already \ncomplex problem. I have worked with others to try to move all \ninterested parties toward enough of a consensus that we could get a \nbill that would be signed into law.\n  This effort to develop a consensus bill led to the development of the \nalternative offered by Senator Kerry. That substitute had the benefit \nof both addressing the legitimate needs of the high tech community and \nsatisfying the concerns expressed by the Administration. Instead we \nhave voted out legislation which, if unchanged in conference, is \nheading toward a veto.\n  I have said from the outset that I believe we ought to pass a bill to \naddress this real--and unique--problem. So today I voted for S. 96, to \nmove it to the next stage in the legislative process. But I caution my \ncolleagues that if this bill is not modified--if the conferees are not \nwilling to address the remaining concerns in the upcoming conference--\nthen we're still faced with a veto, we'll end up where we began, and \nwe'll have wasted valuable time in reaching our goal.\n  With regard to the conference, I have heard that the House may simply \nadopt the Senate language, sending this bill directly to the White \nHouse knowing it would be vetoed. That's pure politics and it's \ncounter-productive. From my negotiations with the White House, I know \nthat they too want to find consensus, but at this point, the only way \nto find this consensus is to sit down with them in a conference \nsetting.\n  If a conference does not take place, if this bill is sent to the \nPresident with the explicit knowledge that it will draw a veto, then \nthe reports on Capitol Hill that some would rather have a Y2K issue \nthan a Y2K solution will be obvious for one and all to see, because \nthere is consensus to be found on this issue, if all parties are \nwilling to negotiate in good faith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think we have had a very excellent \ndebate. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say just \na couple of words about the pending bill. I will use my leader time, \nbecause I know we are out of time under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Let me begin by saying I do not think there is disagreement at all \namong most of our colleagues about the importance of stopping frivolous \nY2K lawsuits. We recognize that high technology is now the driving \nengine of our economy and will become an even more important part of \nour economy in the years ahead. We recognize that businesses need to \nfocus on fixing the problem, not defending against lawsuits.\n  So we want a bill. We hope to have a bill the President will sign. I \nam disappointed we are not there yet. The White House has made it very \nclear the pending bill will be vetoed even with the changes that have \nbeen made so far. So we have gridlock. We have gridlock in large \nmeasure because we have not been able to resolve the remaining \ndifferences on this important legislation.\n  I think it is very important we balance the legitimate needs of \nindustry to be protected from frivolous attacks and the rights of \nconsumers. We differ on very critical legislative details that were the \nfocus of a substitute Senator Kerry offered some time ago. We recognize \nthat consumers and small businesses will face real problems. We need to \nprotect their rights in court. That is one of our fundamental concerns \nabout the passage of the current legislation.\n  We want a bill. We do not want frivolous lawsuits. But we also want \nto ensure that people have some protection.\n  Let me just give one example of what will happen if this bill is \npassed and signed into law. This is just one example.\n  The pending bill only allows small businesses to recover economic \nlosses for tangible property damage. That is a phrase we are going to \nhear a lot more in the future, ``tangible'' property damage. This does \nnot include the loss of business information, such as that contained in \ncomputer databases. So such losses, including billing records or \ncustomer lists, property that is critical to a business owner but which \nis not tangible, is not covered under the bill we are passing. \nAmazingly, the pending bill would even protect defendants from \nliability for fraud or misrepresentation.\n  If you are a small businessman watching C-SPAN right now, you are on \nMain Street and you are wondering what this bill is all about, under \nthis bill, in those cases where you do not have a tangible property \nmatter at stake, you have absolutely no protection. If you lose your \ndatabase, if you\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nlose that so-called nontangible property, you have no recourse. That is \nunacceptable.\n\n  I know we are going to get all kinds of debate, and I will probably \nget calls this afternoon: Yes, we do. The fact is, we have had analysis \nafter analysis. The bottom line is that there is no protection for \nintangible property. That is not protected.\n  Defendants are even protected from liability for economic losses if \nthey engaged in fraud or misrepresentation under the current \nlegislation.\n  Our alternative, by contrast, only protects responsible companies. \nThe biggest difference between our approach and theirs is that we \nprotect only companies that have acted responsibly. We require \ncompanies to demonstrate that they have taken steps to clear up the Y2K \nproblems.\n  For example, the pending bill provides blanket proportional \nliability. The Kerry amendment merely requires companies to have \nidentified and warned potential victims of problems to get proportional \nliability.\n  The pending bill caps punitive damages for small companies. Punitive \ndamages punish egregious conduct. We provide no such protection for \nirresponsible behavior in the alternative we offer.\n  The pending bill sets up roadblocks for consumers suffering from real \nY2K-related problems. Our amendment lets them in the courthouse door to \nat least have the opportunity for redress their damages in a court of \nlaw.\n  This area of law traditionally falls under State jurisdiction. But \nthis legislation, the pending bill, preempts State law. We acknowledge \nthe need to do so because of unique circumstances, but we also \nrecognize the need to be careful.\n  The pending bill virtually shifts all Y2K suits into Federal court. \nIt makes it harder for consumers to bring a suit. It increases the \nstrain on an already backlogged Federal court system. Chief Justice \nRehnquist and the Judicial Conference oppose such federalization. Our \nbill places limits on class actions but does not federalize them.\n  In some ways our bill is very similar. Our version addresses all the \nbasic concerns raised by the high-tech industry. Our plan is identical \nto the pending bill in many ways. Both give defendants 60 days to fix a \nY2K problem. Both allow either party to request alternative dispute \nresolution. Both require anyone seeking damages to have the opportunity \nto offer reasonable proof--including the nature and amount of the \ndamages--before a class action suit could proceed.\n  But while we recognize the need for a bill, we must carefully write \nit. Evidence is yet unclear as to the extent of this problem. Evidence \nis yet unclear about how much frivolous litigation will result from the \nY2K bug.\n  We should not grant sweeping legal immunity to those who have caused \nbut not corrected problems. Those who have not tried to address \nproblems deserve no special protection. Yet, this bill provides them \nthat protection.\n  Our approaches are identical in every important, necessary way. But \nthey differ in critical ways for consumers and for our court system.\n  Our approach is the only one the President will sign, so it is the \nonly one that has hope of becoming law.\n  The year 2000 is fast approaching. We cannot waste time debating a \nbill we know will be vetoed only to have to start all over again. It is \nsenseless to do that.\n  If enough of our colleagues vote against this legislation, it sends a \nmessage to fix it in conference. If conferees fail to fix it, I will \nmake every effort to pass another bill that addresses the problem, that \nthe President can sign.\n  In fact, I will present again, as clearly as I can, an articulated, \nvery understandable version of what the President will sign. I want to \nmake it very clear what it is the President will sign and what he will \nnot. We owe it to all of our colleagues to reiterate one more time just \nwhat it is that he finds so offensive about this.\n\n  Let's go back one more time, because I think it is so incredible an \nissue. If you are affected tangibly, if your property is somehow \ntangibly affected, you have redress, you can be compensated for \neconomic losses; but if your database, if your mailing list, or if \nanything else in the computer is adversely affected, is lost, is \ndestroyed as a result of an advertent or inadvertent error on the part \nof technology--you lose everything--you have no recourse. You cannot \nrecover economic losses that result.\n  Is that really what we want to do? Do we want to destroy your \nopportunity for recourse when you have lost your database? When you \nhave lost your mailing list? Do we really want that to be the law of \nthe land overriding State law? That is exactly what we are voting on.\n  The answer is, I will bet you this afternoon a majority of our \ncolleagues are going to say: Yes, that is what I am voting on. I will \nsupport taking away the right of a small businessman to go to court if \nhe has lost his database. I will support the right of an errant \ncomputer salesman or somebody else to take away a small business's \nopportunity to go to court.\n  I do not believe we want to do that. That is why the President said \nhe will veto this bill. We can do better than that. Nobody can plead \nignorance. I am saying it this afternoon. I want everybody to \nunderstand it. Nobody can say, ``I didn't know that's what the bill \ndid,'' because I am telling you right now, that is what it does.\n  So before you vote, my colleagues, understand, ignorance is not bliss \nhere. Ignorance is no excuse. When they come back and say, ``I didn't \nknow,'' we can say, ``I told you before the vote.''\n  If you want to take away a small businessman's right to go to court \nbecause he has lost everything, you go ahead and vote for this bill. If \nyou want a bill that works, work with us, work with the President; \nlet's get one approved by the Senate he can sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S6995-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SUSPENSION OF PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN YEAR 2000 \n                   FAILURES BY SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' means any executive agency, as \n     defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, that \n     has the authority to impose civil penalties on small business \n     concerns;\n       (2) the term ``first-time violation'' means a violation by \n     a small business concern of a Federal rule or regulation \n     (other than a Federal rule or regulation that relates to the \n     safety and soundness of the banking or monetary system, \n     including protection of depositors) resulting from a Y2K \n     failure if that Federal rule or regulation had not been \n     violated by that small business concern within the preceding \n     3 years; and\n       (3) the term ``small business concern'' has the same \n     meaning as a defendant described in section 5(b)(2)(B).\n       (b) Establishment of Liaisons.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this section each agency \n     shall--\n       (1) establish a point of contact within the agency to act \n     as a liaison between the agency and small business concerns \n     with respect to problems arising out of Y2K failures and \n     compliance with Federal rules or regulations; and\n       (2) publish the name and phone number of the point of \n     contact for the agency in the Federal Register.\n       (c) General Rule.--Subject to subsections (d) and (e), no \n     agency shall impose any civil money penalty on a small \n     business concern for a first-time violation.\n       (d) Standards for Waiver.--In order to receive a waiver of \n     civil money penalties from an agency for a first-time \n     violation, a small business concern shall demonstrate that--\n       (1) the small business concern previously made a good faith \n     effort to effectively remediate Y2K problems;\n       (2) a first-time violation occurred as a result of the Y2K \n     system failure of the small business concern or other entity, \n     which affected the small business concern's ability to comply \n     with a federal rule or regulation;\n       (3) the first-time violation was unavoidable in the face of \n     a Y2K system failure or occurred as a result of efforts to \n     prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that \n     could result in harm to life or property;\n       (4) upon identification of a first-time violation, the \n     small business concern initiated reasonable and timely \n     measures to remediate the violation; and\n       (5) the small business concern submitted notice to the \n     appropriate agency of the first-time violation within a \n     reasonable time not to exceed 7 business days from the time \n     that the small business concern became aware that a first-\n     time violation had occurred.\n       (e) Exceptions.--An agency may impose civil money penalties \n     authorized under Federal law on a small business concern for \n     a first-time violation if--\n       (1) the small business concern's failure to comply with \n     Federal rules or regulations constitutes or creates an \n     imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment; \n     or\n       (2) the small business concern fails to correct the \n     violation not later than 1 month after initial notification \n     to the agency.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the precedent that the presenter of the \namendment has the last minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment is really fairly simple. Essentially, it is \nan attempt to give the middle person, the small businessperson in this \ncountry who may, through no fault of their own, be subject to a Federal \nfine because they didn't comply with some Federal law as a result of \nthe failure of their computer system, some protection from that fine. \nIt says that this can only occur in instances where it is the first \ntime it has happened. In other words, you can't have a bad actor trying \nto use this to try and get out from underneath the fines.\n  It says that the small business may have a legitimate, provable \neffort that they tried to protect the computer problem and that they \nnotified the Federal agency they had the computer problem. So there is \nample protection to be sure that the system can't be gamed. The purpose \nof this amendment is simply to protect the small businessperson. This \nwill be rated by the NFIB, I understand.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the Gregg-Bond amendment that was adopted as part of this Y2K bill. \nI know that the small business community in Mississippi and nationwide \nmust appreciate our removing the potential for yet another millennium \nheadache.\n  Almost every federal agency requires small businesses to comply with \na number of paperwork requirements. That is a fact that is unlikely to \nchange with the new century. It is likely, however, that an \nunanticipated Y2K failure could prevent a small business from meeting \nthese federal paperwork deadlines on time.\n  The Gregg-Bond amendment will provide relief to small businesses by \nwaiving civil penalties in this type of case. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that this is not an amendment that will reward those who \nmisbehave or who fail to prepare themselves for Y2K. As the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire stated earlier, in order to take advantage of this \none-time penalty waiver, a small business owner must first prove that \nhe or she took prudent steps to prevent the Y2K failure in the first \nplace. Let me give you an example of how the amendment will work.\n  Let's say a shoe repair shop owner in Inverness, Mississippi, does \nher best to make her computer system Y2K compliant, only to find that \nthe New Year brings total system failure. Because of this computer \ncrash, the store owner is unable to access her payroll records and \ncannot submit her payroll taxes on time. The Gregg-Bond amendment gives \nthe business owner a reasonable amount of time to get her system \nrunning and pay her taxes--without the IRS slapping huge fines on her.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not say that small businesses do \nnot have to comply with the law. It does not say that small businesses \ndo not have to meet their paperwork requirements. It simply says that \nif a small business has a legitimate Y2K failure that causes a hiccup \nin its paperwork flow, its federal fines can be waived.\n  As we enter the new century, I ask my colleagues: Do we want to start \nthe millennium by fining small businesses for unpredictable and \nunintentional first-time paperwork violations?\n  Fortunately, the answer is no.\n  I would like to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Bond for offering \nthis amendment, and my colleagues for adopting it. I would also like to \nthank the National Federation of Independent Business for its hard work \non this amendment and this bill. The ``Voice of Small Business'' was \nheard loud and clear in this Chamber today. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n624, as modified. The yeas and nays are ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nChafee) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \nvotes in this series be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will take 2 of my minutes, and the \nSenator from Oregon will take the remaining 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under a previous unanimous consent agreement, I requested \n4 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let's be clear about the importance of the \nbill and what is at stake. The bill is supported by virtually every \nsegment of our economy. It is important not only to the high-tech \nindustry or big business but carries strong support from small \nbusiness, retailers and wholesalers, and the insurance industry.\n  On one side of the issue we have the American economy, arguably the \nstrongest our Nation has ever enjoyed. It is driven in large measure by \nthe technological leadership our companies have and are providing to \nthe rest of the world, the resulting revolution in productivity for \nother industries. On the other side, we have those who, for whatever \nreason, desire encouraging disputes rather than solving problems.\n  The Y2K situation presents an unparalleled opportunity to tie up the \ncountry's judicial system and the economy's resources in litigation, \nwhich only profits the legal profession. Opportunistic litigation costs \nthe Nation's economy time and resources which then cannot be spent on \nvalue-added productivity.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. It is important to the \nfuture of the economy. It is important to the future development of \nthis technology, and it is of great importance to the future of average \nAmerican citizens.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is the Democratic technology \nleader. I join him now in saying that a vote against this bill is a \nvote against the entrepreneurs and risk-takers of this Nation who are \nworking their heads off to make their systems Y2K compliant but are \nlegitimately fearful of frivolous lawsuits.\n  Some have said that small businesses cannot recover their economic \nlosses under this bill. If that were the case, why would the Nation's \nsmall businesses overwhelmingly support the legislation?\n  The fact is, small businesses can recover economic losses just as \nthey do under the status quo. Specifically, a small business plaintiff \ncan recover whatever economic losses are allowed under State contract \nlaw. Many of these State laws say that if profits are lost as a \nconsequence of a Y2K failure, the small business plaintiff can recover \ntheir economic losses.\n  Failure to pass this bill would be similar to lobbing a monkey wrench \ninto the high-tech engine that is driving the Nation's economic \nprosperity. I join with Senator Dodd, our technology leader, in urging \nDemocrats to support the legislation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is a very serious moment for the \nSenate in that we now are going to legalize negligence and legalize \nfraud. How does this come about? It is very interesting that the \nindustry itself says 90 percent have no Y2K problems at all. Only 6 \npercent here, in this month's Investors Business Daily, said that 5\\1/\n2\\ months ahead of that they could possibly have any problem. \nStraussman of Xerox said it is managerial incompetence not to have it \nfixed by now. We still have 5\\1/2\\ months.\n  We are acting in spite of the fact that the States have been not only \ndoing an outstanding job with respect to product liability but also \nwith respect to Y2K, and in spite of the Conference of Chief Justices' \nresolve against this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Conference of Chief Justices of the State Supreme Courts.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Conference of Chief Justices, Office of Government \n           Relations, National Center for State Courts,\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ), to express our concern \n     with S. 96 and H.R. 775 in their present form. We understand \n     that S. 96 and H.R. 775 are attempts to address the serious \n     problem of potential litigation surrounding the Y2K issue. \n     However, in part, the bills pose a direct challenge to the \n     principles of federalism underlying our system of government. \n     We are particularly concerned that each bill would in effect \n     replace established state class action procedures in favor of \n     removal to the Federal courts in most cases. The members of \n     CCJ seriously question the wisdom of such an action.\n       In this regard, CCJ agrees with the position of the U.S. \n     Judicial Conference as submitted by Judge Walter Stapleton to \n     the House Judiciary Committee on April 13, 1999. His \n     testimony points out that:\n       ``State legislatures and other rule-making bodies provide \n     rules for aggregation of state-law claims into class-wide \n     litigation in order to achieve certain litigation economies \n     of scale. By providing for class treatment, state \n     policymakers express the view that the state's own resources \n     can be best deployed not through repetitive and potentially \n     duplicative individual litigation, but through some form of \n     class treatment. H.R. 775 could deprive the state courts of \n     the power to hear much of this class litigation and might \n     well create incentives for plaintiffs who prefer a state \n     forum to bring a series of individual claims. Such individual \n     litigation might place a greater burden on the state courts \n     and thwart the states' policies of more efficient \n     disposition.\n       Federal jurisdiction over class litigation is an area where \n     change should be approached with caution and careful \n     consideration of the underlying relationship between state \n     and federal courts.''\n       We would emphasize that State courts presently handle 95 \n     percent of the nation's judicial business. State and Federal \n     courts have developed a complementary role in regard to our \n     jurisprudence and these bills would radically alter this \n     relationship. It is not enough to argue these bills affect \n     only a segment of commerce, or that resolution of the problem \n     on a state by state basis is inconvenient. It is a bad \n     precedent that could have future ramifications. The founding \n     fathers created our federal system for a reason that Congress \n     should be extremely reticent to overturn.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me \n     directly, or contact Tom Henderson or Ed O'Connell who staff \n     our Government Relations Office. They can be reached at (703) \n     841-0200.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                               David A. Brock,\n\n                                         Chief Justice, President,\n                                     Conference of Chief Justices.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are acting in spite of the fact that no attorney \ngeneral, no Governor, or any other entity has come up and asked for it. \nThen the question is, Why do we, at the Federal level, rush to suspend \n200 years of State law?\n  Right to the headline here in the Washington Post, ``GOP Voice For \nBacking Of High Tech Leaders. Party Aims To Exploit Y2K Vote, CEO \nSummit.'' And yesterday morning's New York Times, the headline, \n``Congress Chasing Campaign Donors Early And Often.''\n  If you look on the Republican screen, it says there:\n\n       Senate again attempts to end minority stranglehold--the \n     great Y2K money chase.\n\n  There it is. This crowd, they want to do away with estate taxes, \ncapital gains taxes, immigration laws, now the State liability laws. If \nthis thing works, I am going to put in an exemption for the corporate \ntax.\n  You know, they rebuilt America--not us, who back in 1993 even taxed \nSocial Security, cut 300,000 employees, raised taxes some $250 billion \nand cut spending $250 billion so the economy could recover.\n  In spite of all that--so the economy could recover, so you could buy \nthese computers and everything else of that kind--what is happening \nhere is they do not even want a fix. The Senator from California just \nsays, ``Let's just get a fix. Get rid of the lawyers.'' They\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nvoted it down. ``Let's just help the consumers,'' said Senator Leahy. \nThey voted that down.\n  What they are trying to do is not get a fix but, rather, fix the \nsystem. They know how to do it. They suspend economic losses. I \npracticed law, and I can tell you here and now what will happen if all \nyou can get is, say, two-thirds of the cost of your computer because--\nafter I bring the investigation, the pleadings, discovery, \ninterrogatories, trial, appeal, and convince 12 jurors--after I have \ndone all of that, I am deserving of at least 20 or 30 percent. So I \nhave to tell the client that is the best you can do after a year in \ncourt and everything else of that kind. I have never seen such a thing \nin my life.\n  This is a bad bill. We could have passed a good one. We could have \ngotten alternative dispute resolution. We could have done this in a \nbipartisan fashion, as we did last year. We could have done this as I \ndid with the aircraft bill, which I voted for, or the securities bill, \nwhich I voted for. But they would not let us. They wanted that computer \nmoney.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Without objection, the substitute amendment is agreed to.\n  The substitute amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate bill will be read a third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report H.R. 775.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 775) to establish certain procedures for civil \n     actions brought for damages relating to the failure of any \n     device or system to process or otherwise deal with the \n     transition from the year 1999 to the year 2000, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, H.R. 775 is amended \nby striking all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof \nthe text of S. 96, as amended.\n  The bill will be read for the third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank a number of Senators and \nmembers of their staffs for the hard work and diligence that has \nresulted in the passage of the Y2K Liability Limitation legislation. \nThis bill was crafted through the determination of Senator McCain and \nSenator Wyden of the Commerce Committee, Senator Bennett and Senator \nDodd of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, and \nSenator Hatch and Senator Feinstein of the Judiciary Committee. \nAdditional help from Senator Gorton, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nBrownback also helped to secure passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to recognize the work of a number \nof the staff members for the Senators who were instrumental in the \nsuccessful efforts on this bill. We are very fortunate to have such \nintelligent, dedicated individuals working in the United States Senate, \nand the passage of meaningful legislation would not be possible without \nthe hard work of these people. Specifically, I would like to thank \nMarti Allbright, Mark Buse, Carole Grunberg, Shawn Maher, Wilke Green, \nLarry Block, Manus Cooney, David Hantman, Tania Calhoun, Laurie \nRubenstein, Karen Knutson, Brian Henneberry, and Steven Wall . The \nprofessional skills and abilities of these staff members were important \nin achieving this legislative success. These staff members and their \ncolleagues ensure that the United States Senate is a responsive, \neffective body for the American people. On behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues in the Senate, I again say ``thank you.''\n  Mr. President, the passage of Y2K liability relief provides a \nreasonable public policy for America as our nation enters the next \nmillennium. It ensures that America's technology sector focuses on \nsolutions to the Y2K problem, rather than spending limited time and \nresources on defending lawsuits. American ingenuity will make certain \nthat the Year 2000 problem is solved. Great strides have already been \nmade toward this goal, and this bill is an additional critical step in \nthe process for America.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, just three weeks ago I joined with 12 of \nmy Democratic colleagues to urge the leadership in both parties of the \nSenate to take up Y2K reform legislation as soon as possible. We got \nwhat we wanted and just completed debate. Many amendments were offered \nbut several that would have improved the bill were defeated. Certainly \nthe bill we passed today is much better than the proposal that passed \nout of the Senate Commerce Committee months ago.\n  Despite some reservations I voted for this bill, because potential \nproblems associated with Y2K failures and subsequent litigation could \nbe very harmful. Widespread litigation could harm businesses and hurt \nconsumers through increased costs in the essential products and \nservices we use in our information technology dependant lives. Moving \nthe process forward is necessary if we are to adequately protect \nconsumers and the businesses who have done all they can to ensure their \nproducts work at the turn of the century.\n  It is important we have mechanisms that will allow for quick \nremediation of Y2K problems, will encourage companies to correct their \nmistakes, and will fairly adjudicate cases when mediation fails. We all \nrecognize that computer problems associated with the new millennium \ncould be large. These problems need to be addressed.\n  Washington is one of the most high-tech-dependant States in the \nNation. Technology companies make up the most energetic and fastest \ngrowing segment of the Washington State economy. Information technology \nhas also become a major factor in the economic engine of the Nation. \nMany employees and consumers in my State depend on these companies' \nsuccess. The people I represent could be negatively impacted if we fail \nto take action on this issue.\n  What we passed today could do much to encourage remediation of the \nproblems we face in addressing the Y2K problem. The bill protects \nbusinesses that have acted responsibly and allows for consumers and \nbusinesses to punish those who have acted in bad faith. The bill is \nalso limited in scope and time with a sunset date just three years \nafter enactment, which focuses this bill\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\non the unique, one time event which we are seeking to address. What we \nhave done today is an important step toward protecting consumers and \nbusinesses from Y2K problems.\n  That said, I have some concerns about the bill. Individual consumers \nwere not as well protected as they should have been. While we've been \nable to retain for small businesses as large as 50 employees the \nability to get a broad array of damages, we were unable to get a \ncomplete exception for consumers. Individuals have less bargaining \npower and generally don't possess the expertise or money required to \nprotect themselves as well as businesses. Therefore, I am hopeful in \nconference we will get measures that exempt consumers from certain \nsections of the bill and allow them greater access and bargaining power \nwhen Y2K failures harm them.\n  I also have concerns about the bill's preemption of State contract \nand tort law. The class action provisions of this bill would allow for \neither party to remove an action from a State proceeding to Federal \ncourt at virtually any time. This impedes State's rights and could harm \nindividual plaintiffs by forcing them to incur more litigation costs by \nhaving to start anew in federal court. Unlike large companies, \nindividuals often have difficulty traveling to new venues and paying \nadditional attorney's fees. The court system should encourage \nindividuals who are harmed to seek redress, not discourage them as this \nbill does. I also hope we can work on this in conference.\n  It is important to note that the version that passed the House of \nRepresentatives is an even worse bill for consumers. It does not seek \nthe balance between plaintiffs and defendants, but resembles the pro-\ndefendant bill that originally passed from the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. The House bill is a step backward from what was achieved in \nthe Senate. If we move at all toward the House bill in conference, I \nwould hope and I'm confident that many of my colleagues will join me in \nopposing the conference report.\n  Overall, passing this bill helps get the process going. It certainly \nis not perfect and I am hopeful the problems I have outlined can be \ndealt with in conference. It is also my desire to see the \nadministration get involved in the negotiations at conference.\n  My constituents, high-tech companies, and consumers deserve a bill \nthat is fair and just, allows for remediation before filing suit, and \nprotects people and companies who have acted in good faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S6999-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Chair will \nrecognize the Senator from West Virginia, but his time will not start \nuntil the Senate is in order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his insistence upon \norder.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill and to vote for \nthe bill. I am going to direct my remarks to that portion of the bill, \ninsofar as I can in this brief period, that deals with the steel loan \nguarantee. Mr. Domenici and others will speak about the similar oil and \ngas loan guarantee.\n  There is a real need for this legislation, for this assistance to \nAmerican firms and to American workers, and that need is now. A crisis \ndoes exist in our own steel industry. The illegal dumping of below-cost \nsteel into our country is real.\n  Our domestic steel industry has been seeking remedy through \nantidumping and countervailing trade cases. The Commerce Department \ntells us these cases are being considered, but it takes\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\ntime. Opponents of this loan guarantee program would have us believe \nthis is an excessively costly solution to a nonexistent problem. It is \nneither. The loan guarantee program outlined in this bill would provide \nqualified steel producers access to loans through the private market \nthat are guaranteed by the Federal Government in the same way the \nFederal Government now guarantees loans made to homebuilders, farmers, \neven foreign nations such as Mexico, Israel, and Russia. It sets no \nprecedent. Similar programs have been successfully implemented for New \nYork City, Lockheed, and Chrysler.\n  Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and \nBudget have calculated the budget authority estimates of this program \nat $140 million, reflective of the fairly low risk of default and the \nvalue of the potential collateral to be offered. This cost is fully \noffset. I want to stress that. This cost is fully offset. The total \namount of all guarantees will not exceed $1 billion. All loans must be \nrepaid within 6 years with interest. The program also contains a \nfunding mechanism for the borrowers to pay for the cost of \nadministering the program. Importantly, this loan guarantee program is \nGATT legal. We are still playing fair. We are not subsidizing our steel \nindustry.\n  I respect those who will oppose this measure. But let me ask this \nquestion: Are we going to ship another U.S. industry overseas? We have \nalready shipped the shoe industry, the leather industry, the pottery \nindustry, the textile industry and other industries. Are we going to \nship another U.S. industry overseas, the steel industry this time? Are \nwe going to allow foreign entities to make ghost towns of our steel-\ndependent communities?\n  These are loan guarantees, similar to the guarantees we have provided \nfor all manner of national endeavors in the past whenever it was in our \nnational interests to do so. We have provided such guarantees to \nforeign nations as well whenever we deemed it to be necessary and \nbeneficial to our international interests. I am not against doing that, \nif it is in our national interests. This bill is a short-term helping \nhand to a vital American industry which is being severely damaged by \nillegal--illegal--foreign dumping. Can we not act here to stand up for \nAmerican businesses and for American workers? This is a pro-American-\nbusiness vote as well as a pro-American-jobs vote.\n  We have already lost 10,000 jobs in the U.S. steel industry since \nlast November. How many more must we lose before we act? When we \ncontinue to lose these industries and these jobs, are you going to \nexplain it on the basis that you voted against cloture? Good luck!\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly on the emergency steel and emergency oil and gasoline guarantee \nprogram.\n  Before discussing the merits of the pending issue--which I believe is \na very meritorious bill--I think it appropriate to comment on the very \nunique procedural status of this measure, and it is this:\n  This provision was in the emergency appropriations bill passed by the \nSenate, which went to conference with the House last month, on the so-\ncalled ``Kosovo emergency'' where we provided funding for the military \naction in Kosovo. The House of Representatives during the conference \nreceded to the Senate position, so this bill was accepted by both the \nSenate--where it passed--and by the House on the rescission.\n  On the next day, since the conference did not end that day, where the \nHouse receded, the House of Representatives changed its position, \nbecause the Speaker of the House took up the matter where two of the \nthree key voters in the House changed their vote. The House then \nchanged its position to be opposed to this guarantee loan program.\n  Then we had the controversy continuing, with the Senate including the \nprogram in its bill. The House, having first receded and adopting the \nprogram, then said it would oppose the program.\n  There was very considerable debate. One of our sessions lasted past \nmidnight. The conferees, of which I was one on the Appropriations \nCommittee, were trying to get this bill concluded so we could fund the \nKosovo military operations.\n  There were very considerable discussions. Finally, a small group went \nto Senate Room 128, the appropriations room. Senator Byrd was present, \nSenator Stevens was present, and I was present, all representing the \nSenate. There were just a few of the House Members present at that \ntime.\n  We finally agreed upon an approach where the sponsors of this \nmeasure--the principal sponsors being Senator Byrd and Senator \nDomenici, and I was a sponsor as well--agreed to have it removed from \nthe emergency supplemental to be attached to another supplemental, \nwhich was available.\n  The understanding was reached that the provision would be on the \nSenate bill going back to the House in an identical position, that the \nprovision was on the Senate bill, the emergency supplemental passed by \nthe Senate, and then up for consideration by the House. Senator \nStevens, as the chairman of the committee, made a commitment on behalf \nof the Senate that that would happen.\n  In order to comply with that arrangement, it would be necessary for \nthis bill to pass the Senate and then to go back to conference with the \nHouse--where, candidly, its fate is uncertain--because the House \nMembers, after the position taken by the Speaker of the House, appeared \nduring our conference as being unlikely to accept the bill. \nPresumptively, that position would continue. That, of course, would \nawait the events of the conference. But, that arrangement was made.\n  I think that is a strong point that ought to be considered by the \nSenate to put this provision in the same position it was in when \napproved by the Senate, with disagreement by the House after they had \nearlier agreed, so there would not be a procedural loss.\n  That was the essence that finally persuaded Senator Byrd to agree to \ntake it off of the earlier bill. So much for the procedure, which I \nthink speaks very strongly for having this measure enacted by the \nSenate.\n  On the merits, I submit there are very sound reasons for this loan \nguarantee program. We have seen the steel industry really decimate in \nthe recent past by dumped steel imports from many countries including \nJapan, Brazil, Korea, and Russia. In Russia there is a very great \ndemand for the dollar so the Russians are selling steel for any price \nthey can get for it.\n  The International Trade Commission, backed by the Commerce \nDepartment, recently confirmed the very high level of dumping.\n  We have had a very serious problem with thousands of layoffs in an \nindustry which had slipped down from some 500,000 steelworkers to about \n150,000 even while some $50 billion in capital had been put into the \nsteel industry. There is no way to compete with dumping. Dumping is \nwhen foreign exporters bring imports into the United States below the \ncost of production--below the cost they are selling it in other places. \nDumping is in violation of U.S. trade laws and is in violation of GATT.\n  Over the years, I have urged the adoption of legislation which would \nprovide for a private right of action. That was introduced early in the \n1980s to have injunctive relief granted to stop dumped and subsidized \nsteel coming into the country in violation of U.S. trade laws.\n  I introduced legislation, which is pending at the present time, which \nwould modify the injunctive relief but would provide for equitable \nrelief with duties imposed. This would be GATT consistent. Anybody who \ndumped steel in the United States would have a duty imposed equal to \nthe legitimate price minus the dumped price. With this legislation, \nthere would be no advantage to dumping steel in the United States.\n  The House of Representatives passed a very strong bill on quotas, by \n289 to about 141. It is veto proof, at least on that state of the \nrecord. That matter may be headed for debate on the Senate floor--but \nin the interim--I think this program for emergency steel and loan \nguarantees is very appropriate. It provides for a $1 billion revolving \nfund for steel companies, and a two-year, $500 million revolving fund \nfor oil and gas companies.\n  The bill would require commitment of collateral, which would be a \nguarantee that the loan would be repaid\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nand have a fee to be paid by the borrower to cover the cost of \nadministering the program with all loans to be paid in full within 6 \nyears.\n  The package has been estimated to cost $270 million which is offset \nby the executive travel budget. On the merits, it is a solid program \nand it does have an appropriate offset.\n  I speak with grave concern about the issue of steel--from the point \nof view of our Nation--because steel is essential for national security \npurposes. If an emergency were to arise, we would not be able to buy \nsteel presumptively from the Russians or probably from the Japanese, or \nwho knows, from the Brazilians. We ought to be independent and have a \nstrong steel industry.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I have grave \nconcern about the loss of jobs, which have been very heavy in my State, \nPennsylvania, but very heavy in other States as well. Three medium-\nsized companies have recently gone into bankruptcy: Acme Steel, Laclede \nSteel, and Geneva Steel. Others may be in the offing with the \ntremendous impact of the dumping of steel.\n  With respect to the problems in the so-called ``oil patch,'' Senator \nDomenici has spoken at some length. We are not talking about the big \noil companies. From my background years ago when my family owned a used \noil field equipment company--really, a junkyard in Russell, KS--I \nbecame familiar with the problems of the small oil dealers in the so-\ncalled ``oil patch.'' Senator Domenici will address that issue in \nsomewhat greater detail.\n  My familiarity at the moment is more intensive and extensive on \nsteel, but I do believe that the problems which have been faced by the \nsmall oil producers are extensive and warrant this kind of a loan \nguarantee program. With the provisions of collateral security, \nsafeguards, fees to be paid and with the offset present, this program \nis one which is structurally sound to have the loans repaid.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can \nconsider this matter on the merits, both because of the understanding--\nreally, commitment--reached as I earlier described and the merits of \nthe substantive program.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the bill before us today, and specifically the ``Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program'' provision authored by our distinguished \ncolleague Senator Robert Byrd. I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Byrd for his hard work, determination, \nand persistence in bringing this important measure to the floor.\n  Our steel industry is in trouble. Since last year, U.S. steel \nproducers have had to withstand an onslaught of illegally imported \nsteel. In 1998, 41 million tons were dumped--an 83 percent increase \nover the amounts imported for the previous eight years. Many steel \ncompanies are reporting financial losses, most attributed to the high \nlevels of illegal steel imports. It is estimated that approximately \n10,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs. The Independent Steel Workers \npredict job losses of as many as 165,000 if steel dumping is not \nstopped. I, along with many of my Senate colleagues like Senators Byrd, \nRockefeller, and Specter, have introduced legislation to help our steel \nindustry. It is time for action. All eyes are on the U.S. Senate to \nrespond to the crisis.\n  A good first step would be the adoption of Senator Byrd's Steel \nEmergency Loan Guarantee Program. This loan program is designed to help \ntroubled steel producers who have been hurt by the record levels of \nillegally imported steel. For many companies, this program is the only \nhope they have to keep their mills alive. Specifically, the program \nwould provide qualified U.S. producers with access to a two-year, $1 \nbillion revolving guaranteed loan fund. In order to qualify, steel \nproducers would be required to give substantive assurances that they \nwill repay the loans. A board chaired by the Secretary of Commerce \nwould oversee the program. The program will cost $140 million, all of \nwhich has been fully offset with other reductions in spending.\n  A strong and healthy domestic steel industry is vital to our nation. \nFortunately, our steel industry is a highly efficient and globally \ncompetitive industry. Yet, despite this modernization, our steel \nproducers face a number of unfair trade practices and market \ndistortions that are having a devastating impact in Ohio and other \nsteel-producing states. I have heard firsthand from industry and labor \nleaders about the crisis. Many steel companies are in serious trouble \nand are in desperate need of immediate assistance. The short term loans \nthat would be provided under Senator Byrd's program will provide that \nassistance without burdening taxpayers. If steel plants close, \ntaxpayers will be forced to pay for unemployment compensation, food \nstamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, child care, community adjustment \nassistance, and worker retraining--all of which will exceed the total \ncost of this program. Again, the steel companies are required to repay \nthe loan within six years, provide collateral, and pay a fee to cover \nthe costs of administering the program. The Commerce Department has \nidentified 10 companies that may qualify for the program.\n  I am a free trader. And I believe free trade does not exist without \nfair trade. Free trade does not mean free to subsidize, free to dump, \nfree to distort the market. Our trade laws are designed to enforce \nthose principles. However, the current steel crisis underscores flaws \nand weaknesses in those laws. I am pleased that the Majority Leader has \nscheduled time next week to deal with the issue of steel dumping. The \nHouse has already acted. It is time for us to act.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to help an industry that throughout its \nlong and illustrious history has been there for our country. Let us \npass this bill and commit to adopting meaningful legislation to deal \nwith the steel import crisis.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his tireless efforts in standing up for \nSteel. I cannot think of a more dedicated champion on this issue. I \nknow my colleagues in the Steel Caucus as well as the hard-working \nsteel producers and steel workers across America are very proud of his \nefforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from West \nVirginia, because he is tenacious. He is a very good legislator. I am \nafraid he is going to win on this vote on the motion to proceed. I hope \nhe does not, because I think we are making a serious mistake if we vote \nfor this, but I compliment him for his persistence in pushing this \nproposal. I am opposed to it. This proposal is a $1.5 billion loan \nguarantee, $1 billion for steel, $500 million for oil and gas. Senator \nDomenici added the oil and gas provision, because the oil and gas \nindustry is probably going through a greater economic crisis than even \nthe steel industry.\n  The Senator from West Virginia said steel has lost 10,000 jobs. The \noil and gas industry probably lost 40,000 jobs, and I will tell you, a \ngood percentage of those are in my State. So I am sympathetic with the \nobjectives they are trying to accomplish. I just disagree with the idea \nof having the Federal Government come in and make Federal loan \nguarantees.\n  We tried it before. The Carter administration did this in 1978. In \n1978, they came up with a loan guarantee proposal for steel. They ended \nup making 290 million dollars' worth of loans, net contingent \nliability. The steel industry defaulted on $222 million. That is a 77-\npercent default rate. I will read a couple of comments that were made \nin the CRS report, dated March 17, 1994.\n\n       Although only five loan guarantees were obligated to steel \n     companies. . .77 percent of the dollar value of these \n     guarantees were defaulted. Although the sample size is very \n     small, hindsight suggests that as a group, steel loans \n     represented a very high level of risk, which may account for \n     the lack of interest in the private markets to take these \n     debt obligations without a guarantee.\n\n  I also will read for the Record from a Washington Post article dated \nFebruary 28, 1988, just a couple of comments talking about the loan \nguarantees.\n\n       Less than a decade later, all five loans are in default, \n     and the Commerce Department's Economic Development \n     Administration, in an internal memorandum, notes that ``by \n     any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to be \n     considered a failure. The program is an excellent example of \n     the folly\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\n     inherent in industrial policy programs,'' the memo added. The \n     companies that received the guaranteed loans are either in \n     bankruptcy, out of business or no longer own the facility in \n     which the money was invested.\n\n  This is a news report that analyzed the loan guarantee program that \nwas initiated in the Carter administration back in 1978-1979.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom which I just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 1988]\n\n      Steel Loan Defaults Provide Hard Lesson in Government Policy\n\n                          (By Cindy Skrzycki)\n\n       For sale by government, the most modern steel rail mill in \n     the country. Like new. Capable of turning out 360,000 tons of \n     rail. Not far from Pittsburgh.\n       With a slick marketing campaign, the U.S. government is \n     attempting to recover a portion of the $100 million it lent \n     Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. in 1979 to build a steel rail mill \n     in Monessen, Pa. But it appears that its investment may be as \n     shabby as many of the abandoned mills that litter America's \n     industrial landscape.\n       The Monessen mill is an example of ill-fated government \n     intervention in an industry that is but a shadow of its old \n     self. Under a special loan-guarantee program put in place by \n     the Carter administration to help the ailing steel industry, \n     a total of five loans worth $365 million were approved, \n     backed by a 90 percent government guarantee.\n       Less than a decade later, all five loans are in default, \n     and the Commerce Department's Economic Development \n     Administration, in an internal memorandum, notes that ``by \n     any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to be \n     considered a failure.''\n       ``The program is an excellent example of the folly inherent \n     in industrial policy programs,'' the memo added.\n       The companies that received the guaranteed loans are either \n     in bankruptcy, out of business or no longer own the facility \n     in which the money was invested.\n       Carried on the ledgers of the EDA, which administered the \n     program in the late 1970s, the steel loan-guarantee program \n     is evidence that politically influenced government investment \n     decisions can result in unprofitable, if not disastrous, \n     results, many analysts say.\n       ``It says that in cases like these there is no reason for \n     the government to get involved and second-guess the private \n     capital markets,'' said Robert Crandall, an economist with \n     the Brookings Institution. ``The argument for government \n     intervention may be to develop seed technology with other \n     applications. . . . But these were investments in rather \n     rudimentary technology in a declining industry.''\n       Walter Adams, a steel expert at Michigan State University, \n     called the loan program ``another goodie, a lollipop thrown \n     to the industry to assuage complaints about unfair \n     competition and satisfy their demands for government \n     assistance.''\n       At the time the loans were approved, some of them whipped \n     up a storm of controversy in Congress.\n       At the time, the steel industry was being increasingly \n     pinched by imports and a dramatic falloff in demand for \n     steel. In an effort to save jobs and encourage investment, \n     the industry pressured the Carter administration to provide \n     some relief. Carter's response was to form a special steel \n     task force under the guidance of Anthony Solomon, the \n     Treasury's undersecretary for monetary affairs. One \n     recommendation was to provide industrial loan guarantees for \n     the industry.\n       Some of the loans, and the criteria under which they were \n     made, proved to be troublesome. For example, a $42 million \n     loan--which was never closed--was to go to a French-\n     controlled company called Phoenix Steel. Critics pointed out \n     that the loan not only encouraged overcapacity, but was a \n     subsidy to a foreign producer.\n       The government has written off the $19.6 million it paid on \n     a $21 million loan to Korf Industries, but hopes to recover \n     the $94.2 million it already has paid bond holders on a $111 \n     million loan to LTV Corp., which has filed for bankruptcy \n     reorganization. It has recovered about $16 million of a total \n     of $63 million it lent to the defunct Wisconsin Steel Co.\n       But the real eye of the storm has centered on the ill-fated \n     Wheeling-Pittsburgh deal--a facility that was up and running \n     barely six years.\n       ``Once you're in bankruptcy, you're just looking for ways \n     to eliminate unprofitable operations,'' said Raymond A. \n     Johnson, spokesman for Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which filed for \n     bankruptcy in 1985.\n       Though Wheeling-Pittsburgh's competitors in the rail \n     business--Bethlehem Steel Corp. and CF Steel Corp--insisted \n     in the late 1970s that there was not enough demand to support \n     another mill, officials at EDA and the company dismissed the \n     objections not only of the companies but of several members \n     of Congress, such as Sen. Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.)\n       Robert Hall, who was then assistant secretary for economic \n     development, called criticism of the new facility \n     ``misplaced.'' Dennis Carney, former chairman of Wheeling-\n     Pittsburgh, said at the groundbreaking of the Monessen mill \n     that ``a new rail mill was vitally needed.'' He also said he \n     felt sure that the company could repay the loan, which was \n     supplemented by yet another $50 million guaranteed loan from \n     the Farmers Home Administration for pollution control \n     equipment.\n       But demand has fallen far below the levels foreseen in \n     1979, when Bethlehem projected that the railroads would need \n     about 1.2 million tons per year of rail. Since the mid-1980s, \n     demand declined as the railroad industry shrank and turned to \n     recycling rail.\n       ``It's not a booming market,'' said Bob Matthews, president \n     of the Railway Progress Institute, an association of railroad \n     equipment manufacturers. He predicted that demand will be \n     only 500,000 tons, on average, over the next decade while \n     capacity--if Monessen is factored in--is at least double \n     that. Also, imports account for some 30 percent of the \n     market.\n       Last year, according to Bethlehem, industry shipments--\n     counting imports--were only 540,000 tons. The industry is \n     down to two producers: Bethlehem's unprofitable plant at \n     Steelton, Pa., and CF in Pueblo, Colo.\n       Left to mop up the loan mess is the current crop of EDA \n     officials, some appointed by the Reagan administration, which \n     itself has come under pressure to provide special help for \n     the steel industry such as import quotas.\n       ``We have vivid proof that federal government intervention \n     in the markets has disastrous results,'' said Orson Swindle, \n     assistant secretary for economic development at Commerce. \n     ``The taxpyer will take a bath.''\n       Just how big will the bath be?\n       In the case of the Monessen mill, the EDA, as instructed by \n     the bankruptcy court, is taking bids and hopes to cover its \n     share of the $63.5 million loan that financed the mill. The \n     chances of recovering the rest of the $100 million loan, \n     which went to finance pollution controls, are not good, said \n     Michael Oberlitner, director of EDA's liquidation division.\n       The government made good on its part of the deal after \n     Wheeling-Pittsburgh filed for bankruptcy in April 1985, \n     paying bond holders some $90 million.\n       To try to recoup its investment, the government has \n     undertaken a $110,000 marketing and advertising campaign that \n     includes having a public relations firm churn out press \n     releases and field inquiries. A brochure touts the Monessen \n     property as ``the most advanced rail rolling and finishing \n     facility in America.''\n       Most of the budget, said Oberlitner, has gone to placing \n     promotional ads in newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal \n     and the Financial Times of London.\n       ``We've had tremendous response to the advertising,'' said \n     Oberlitner, adding that some 130 inquiries have come from \n     domestic and foreign companies and investors.\n       But the most interesting--if not ironic--bid for the \n     Monessen mill has come from Wheeling-Pittsburgh's old \n     nemesis, Bethlehem Steel, which has offered $60 million for \n     the facility.\n       Although Bethlehem's own rail mill at Steelton is not \n     profitable and faces a soft market, the company thinks it can \n     combine the mills, rolling steel at Monessen that has been \n     shipped from Steelton's underutilized facilities.\n       ``We believe the acquisition of Monessen is vital,'' said \n     Tim Lewis, Steelton's plant manager.\n       In the end, which comes on April 7 when a buyer will be \n     chosen, the modern Monessen rail mill may run again. But as \n     it stands now, Monessen is an example of a failure of \n     industrial policy.\n       ``In cases like this, there is no penalty for failure,'' \n     Michigan State's Adams said, commenting on the lack of \n     corporate accountability for bad decisions. ``This was \n     largely a political phenomenon.''\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have tried it. It didn't work before. I am afraid it \nwon't work again, because it is basically saying we don't believe the \nmarketplace can make loans; we want the Federal Government to do it. We \nwant to set up a board of politicians that will make loan guarantees, \nand not only guarantee 70 or 80 percent of the loan but the bill that \nis before us says they can guarantee 100 percent of the loan.\n  I find that to be very irresponsible. We are saying the Secretaries \nof Labor and Commerce and Treasury have better wisdom on whether or not \nto be making loans than bankers throughout the country. I think that is \na serious mistake.\n  I also have objections because of the way this bill is drafted. It \nsays this is an emergency. We just voted on lockbox. We are going to \nvote on lockbox again later this week. We do not want to spend any of \nthe surplus of Social Security money on anything but Social Security.\n  This bill takes a bunch of that money, up to $270 million estimated \nby CBO, and says: Let's spend that on loan guarantees. Let's spend \nSocial Security money. Let's move the caps. Let's adjust the caps.\n  We are violating the so-called lockbox which we say we do not want to \nspend. As a matter of fact, President\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\nClinton said it in the State of the Union Address 2 years ago: We won't \nspend one dime of this Social Security money on anything else. This \nbill would say, let's spend $270 million of it. I think that is a \nmistake.\n  I urge my colleagues, we shouldn't be declaring an emergency this \nweek. We just did it 2 weeks ago. We did it 2 weeks ago as Kosovo \nmoney, $13 billion net for Kosovo. We declared that an emergency. We \nare declaring this an emergency; that is a $270 million cost. That \nshouldn't be counted. Even though it may have offsets on budget \nauthority, it is not offset in outlays. It does move the caps up. It \ndoes violate the budget. I think it would be a serious mistake.\n  What about dumping? The Commerce Department has already taken action \nagainst Japan and against Brazil to stop illegal dumping. That is the \nproper avenue to be moving if there is illegal dumping. It is not to \nhave the Federal Government come in and say: Let's make loan \nguarantees. Let's have the Federal Government underwrite it. \nPoliticians know best. We don't think the marketplace can work. We \nthink bureaucrats in three Departments should be making these loans.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The time of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has expired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time \nfor closing. Since we are trying to defend against an assault here, we \nwant to speak last.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, out of courtesy for our colleague from New \nMexico, I will go ahead and speak now.\n  First of all, let me make a couple of things clear. No. 1, this bill \ncontains an emergency designation so that not one penny of the funds \nexpended under these loan guarantees will count toward the spending \ncaps.\n  What that means is that in the next 2 years alone, in the years 2000 \nand 2001, that is $270 million, over a quarter of a billion dollars, if \noptimistic assumptions about defaults contained in this bill hold up, \n$270 million, over a quarter of a billion dollars will come directly \nout of the Social Security surplus.\n  Supposedly, there are offsets for cutting travel and furniture, but \nthe spending caps are not reduced by that amount. So that money, if in \nfact those cuts were ever made, would end up being spent on something \nelse. The spending in this bill is designated as an emergency, which \nmeans every penny of it will come out of the Social Security surplus.\n  We just had a vote about an hour ago where we said we want to stop \nthe plundering of the Social Security trust fund. We do not think \nCongress ought to be taking Social Security money and spending it on \nother things. In fact, Republicans have been pretty self-righteous \nabout it. We have held up our little lockboxes, and we have had press \nconferences. The problem is we hold these lockboxes up, but we keep \nsupporting measures that knock the doors off, springs go flying, the \ncombination thing goes rolling across the room. You cannot have it both \nways. You either want to spend money or you don't want to spend money.\n  Nobody should be confused about the fact that this is paid for. The \ncuts don't lower the spending caps. There is an emergency designation; \n$270 million minimum in 2 years will come right out of Social Security.\n  We are turning the clock back. The last time we had the Government \nmaking loans to business, engaging in industrial policy, was when Jimmy \nCarter was President. Someone earlier today tried to make an argument \nthat we were doing all of these things because the inflation rate was \ndouble digit at the time. Did anybody ever think the inflation rate got \nto be double digit because we did all of these things?\n  In a period of record prosperity, what are we doing having the \nGovernment override the decisions of the marketplace?\n  We do have laws against dumping, and those laws are being vigorously \nenforced by this administration. Some would say overly enforced. But \nthere are avenues to deal with dumping, and those avenues are being \naddressed.\n  The last time we guaranteed loans to American industry and to the \nsteel industry in particular, 77 percent of those loans were defaulted. \nIf that happens here, every penny of that is coming right out of the \nSocial Security surplus.\n  This is popular. I am from an oil State. There are going to be people \nwho say $500 million of loans could just do wonders for us. But we are \nnot paying for this. You take out the emergency designation, you change \nthis bill, because then you get cuts in other spending to pay for it.\n  I think we have to make a decision. We have to decide which side we \nare on. You cannot be for not plundering the Social Security trust fund \nand be for this bill. So while obviously my State, and the State of the \nSenator from Oklahoma, would be beneficiaries from some of these loans, \nwe can't have it both ways. We can't stand up an hour ago and say: \nDon't plunder Social Security, and then an hour later say: Well, if it \nis for a good reason such as providing loan guarantees for steel and \noil, it is OK to plunder Social Security, but it is not OK in the \nabstract.\n  I can't turn corners that quickly. I can't change sides on an issue \nin an hour.\n  I do not want people to be confused. This bill has an emergency \ndesignation. It will waive the cap for the spending. There are offsets \nin budget authority, but they do not match up with the spending. There \nis no lowering of the spending cap to enforce the savings. The truth \nis, every penny spent from the year 2000 when this program starts until \nit ends will come directly out of the surplus and, for the next few \nyears, every penny of it will come directly out of the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you are going to lock it up, you cannot spend it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. All the time has \nexpired except for 5 minutes for the Senator from New Mexico; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then we will vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture vote, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me remind everyone that this would \nhave been a great argument 3 weeks ago when the Senate passed, with an \noverwhelming vote, a supplemental appropriations bill that had this \nprecise bill in it. A vast majority of Senators voted in favor of the \nEmergency Supplemental bill. So we already passed it.\n  All of a sudden, steel and oil and gas become a very bad thing. But \nwe already passed it overwhelmingly. We sent it over to the House to go \nto conference. The Senate Conferees wanted their loan programs. The \nHouse was dead set against it. Because of these loan programs the \nEmergency Supplemental for Kosovo and Hurricane Mitch was deadlocked. \nThe Senate conferees said, all right, let's pass the Emergency bill \nwithout the loan provisions but let's take it back to the Senate, and \nwhen it gets back to the Senate, let's vote it out and take it to \nconference with the House so we can finally resolve the debate that \nstarted weeks ago in conference.\n  Frankly, the air tight lockbox that everybody thinks will really tie \nup Social Security forever--I want to confess, I invented it, I dreamt \nit up. But, you know, every time we turn around now for the next 6 or 8 \nmonths, as we work our way through, where is the lockbox? Do we really \nhave one, or don't we?\n  We will hear this ``plundering'' heard--led by the Senator from \nTexas--that we are plundering. If you divide $270 million by 10 years, \nwe are plundering it to the extent of $27 million a year.\n  If you want to look at the reality of things, in order to say to the \noil patch in the United States, which already has lost over 56,400 jobs \nout of an estimated 340,700 jobs just since October 1997. With oil \npatch in crisis our rural communities are dying on the vine. Those who \nservice the oil industry in the field--not the Exxons and the Texacos--\ngoing broke or belly up because they can't get loans, we are not going \nto fix that.\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\n  But I submit that if you are worried about making loans, we make \nhundreds of millions in loans for agriculture. We voted $6 billion or \n$8 billion in supplemental emergency funds for agriculture. If you \ndon't think the U.S. Government lends money to business, just go look \nat the Small Business Administration, where hundreds of thousands of \ndollars are loaned to small business on 90 percent guarantees. Guess \nwhat. They are making it. There is no gigantic default rate. They are \nbeing helped to get into business and succeed.\n  Frankly, from my standpoint, it just appeared to me, as a Senator \nfrom oil patch, that essentially if we are going to help other people, \nthen I just want to try to see in the Senate if you would like to help \nthe industry that is a core fundamental of any industrialized economy--\nthe production of oil and gas in the United States, which is withering \non the vine, and dependence is going through the roof. Our foreign oil \ndependence is now 57 percent.\n  Senator Nickles mentioned the steel program of the late 1970's. It \nwas a small, unstructured, ad hoc program. I believe there were a grand \ntotal of five loans made. We sit here tonight and equate this to an era \nin American corporate history when inflation was 18 percent, interest \nrates were 20 percent, and my friend from Texas says because that \nprogram didn't work very well we shouldn't try again.\n  That experience is a lesson, but frankly, it is irrelevant. The steel \nindustry of today bears no resemblance to the steel industry of the \n1970s. Our economy today, bears no resemblance to the economy then. \nInterest rates and default rates by American companies are nowhere near \nwhat they were then. The failure of business to default is all over the \nguarantee program in America. The failure is very small, because the \neconomy is strong and they are able to pay their loans back.\n\n  So Senators on my side of the aisle can feel free to vote against \nthis measure as a matter of substance. But I believe in fairness to \nhaving passed these bills already--we committed to go to conference \nwith the House to see what they would do--we ought to invoke cloture so \nas to delay this bill for the shortest period of time possible. It \ncould be amended post cloture, but at least we won't be here killing \nthe bill that is exactly what I have outlined--a revote on something we \nalready voted for.\n  I am not going to argue the economic condition of oil patch, because \nsome of the Senators on my side of the aisle, and a few on that side of \nthe aisle, already know that the United States, in terms of oil patch, \nthose people who service oil wells, they are experiencing a total \neconomic collapse. If we can't see fit to put $500 million on the books \nthat can be loaned to them, and have to argue about the philosophy of \nloans by the Federal Government and the default rate of 25 year ago, \nthen, frankly, I believe oil patch has the right to conclude that we \njust don't care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EMERGENCY STEEL LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This chapter may be cited as the \n     ``Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States steel industry has been severely \n     harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of \n     steel imports into the United States in 1998, caused by the \n     world financial crisis;\n       (2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than \n     10,000 steel worker jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause \n     of 3 bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme \n     Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;\n       (3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel \n     companies into--\n       (A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and\n       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations \n     and reinvestment in facilities;\n       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private \n     banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United \n     States steel industry for continued operation and \n     reinvestment in facilities;\n       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial \n     losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax \n     base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential \n     health, education, and municipal services that these \n     government entities provide to their citizens; and\n       (6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate \n     defense preparedness of the United States in order to have \n     sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, \n     and armaments necessary for the national defense.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee \n     Board established under subsection (e).\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Emergency \n     Steel Guarantee Loan Program established under subsection \n     (d).\n       (3) Qualified steel company.--The term ``qualified steel \n     company'' means any company that--\n       (A) is incorporated under the laws of any State;\n       (B) is engaged in the production and manufacture of a \n     product defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute as a \n     basic steel mill product, including ingots, slab and billets, \n     plates, flat-rolled steel, sections and structural products, \n     bars, rail type products, pipe and tube, and wire rod; and\n       (C) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or \n     financial losses since the beginning of the steel import \n     crisis, in January 1998 or that operates substantial assets \n     of a company that meets these qualifications.\n       (d) Establishment of Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan \n     Program.--There is established the Emergency Steel Guarantee \n     Loan Program, to be administered by the Board, the purpose of \n     which is to provide loan guarantees to qualified steel \n     companies in accordance with this section.\n       (e) Loan Guarantee Board Membership.--There is established \n     a Loan Guarantee Board, which shall be composed of--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce, who shall serve as Chairman \n     of the Board;\n       (2) the Secretary of Labor;

and\n       (5) In the case of a purchaser of substantial assets of a \n     qualified steel company, the qualified steel company \n     establishes that it is unable to reorganize itself.\n       (h) Terms and Conditions of Loan Guarantees.--\n       (1) Loan duration.--All loans guaranteed under this section \n     shall be payable in full not later than December 31, 2005, \n     and the terms and conditions of each such loan shall provide \n     that the loan may not be amended, or any provision thereof \n     waived, without the consent of the Board.\n       (2) Loan security.--Any commitment to issue a loan \n     guarantee under this section shall contain such affirmative \n     and negative covenants and other protective provisions that \n     the Board determines are appropriate.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am aware of the very tight budgetary \nconstraints under which this bill is being considered and I commend the \nchairman and ranking member for their good, hard work. One concern I \nhave, however, is that the fiscal year 2000 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill does not fund the Department of Energy's Scientific \nSimulation Initiative (SSI). The SSI is not only an integral part of \nthe President's Information Technology Initiative for the 21st Century, \nbut also a key element in the Department's effort to keep the United \nStates at the leading edge of scientific discovery. It is only through \nscientific modeling on computers 10-100 times more powerful than those \nnow available to civilian scientists that we can address many \nscientific problems with an enormous potential payoff for the Nation. \nThe SSI will build on DOE's successful history of making leading edge \ncomputers available for scientific modeling to provide us with \nreliable, quantitative and regional information about changes in \nclimate, and help us design more efficient internal combustion engines. \nIt will also help us create more effective drugs and materials, and \ncontribute to our understanding of basic scientific problems in a wide \nrange of disciplines. I hope that, should more funding become available \nduring this year's congressional appropriations process, the Senate \nwill work with the House of Representatives to fully fund this \nimportant program.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers have accepted the \namendment that I introduced along with Senators DeWine, Voinovich, \nMoynihan and Akaka, adding funds to help combat zebra mussels and other \ninvasive species which infest U.S. waterways. The funds provided will \nallow the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to meet its responsibilities \nunder the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 to research, develop \nand demonstrate environmentally sound techniques for managing and \nremoving aquatic nuisance species that threaten public infrastructure \nin U.S. waters. The Corps' efforts complement the work of other \nagencies to limit the introduction and spread of new species, providing \na desperately needed aquatic invasive species control program.\n  Mr. President, Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes degrade and disrupt \nthe ecosystem; they endanger other indigenous species, either by \nconsuming their food supply or smothering them, and zebra mussels cause \ngrave economic impacts as they damage public infrastructure. Similar \nnonindigenous species infestations harm virtually every U.S. waterway \nand coastal area. Over the years, legislation to prevent and control \nthese invasive species has received strong bipartisan, multi-regional \nsupport as a testimony to the serious threat they pose.\n  The Committee bill includes some other important items for Michigan \nand the Great Lakes. These include:\n  $400,000 for preconstruction, engineering and designing improvements \nto the locks in Sault Ste. Marie.\n  $1.7 million to repair the north and south piers and revetments at \nPentwater Harbor.\n  $100,000 to complete a study on Environmental Dredging in Detroit \nRiver.\n  $250,000 for corrections to deficiencies associated with the Clinton \nRiver Spillway.\n  $100,000 to complete seawall construction, dredging and other work \nassociated with the establishment of the Robert V. Annis Water Resource \nInstitute at Grand Valley State University.\n  $200,000 for planning and design of sea lamprey barriers at sites \nthroughout the Great Lakes basin. As my colleagues may know, the sea \nlamprey is a devastating invasive species that has plagued the Great \nLakes since it first appeared and these barriers play an important role \nin preventing this species spread and population growth.\n  Funding for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV)\n  Mr. President, on balance, this is a good bill, despite the budget \nconstraints that the managers faced in putting it together.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks about a \nserious threat to my home state of Ohio and to thank the honorable \nchairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee and Senator Levin for helping me to address this threat.\n  Mr. President, sometimes big problems come in small packages. Today, \nLake Erie--and just about every other body of water in the Midwest--are \nthreatened by a very small and unwanted intruder, the zebra mussel. \nThis small but prodigious mussel is just one of the many invasive \nspecies that have entered this country and which threaten to degrade \nthe natural resource capital of virtually every U.S. waterway and \ncoastal area. Free of their natural predators and other limiting \nenvironmental factors, alien species like the zebra mussel often cause \ngrave economic harm as they foul or otherwise damage public \ninfrastructure.\n  In the late 1980s, the zebra mussel was discovered in Lake St. Clair, \nhaving arrived from eastern Europe through the discharge of ballast \nwater from European freighters. The species spread rapidly to 20 states \nand as far as the mouth of the Mississippi River. U.S. expenditures to \ncontrol zebra mussels and clean water intake pipes, water filtration \nequipment, and electric generating plants and other damages are \nestimated at $3.1 billion over 10 years.\n  In Ohio, the zebra mussel poses a particular threat to public water \nintake systems. Ohio has more than 1,900 facilities that collectively \nwithdraw over 10 billion gallons of water per day. The costs to remove \nor prevent infestations of zebra mussels in large surface water intakes \ncan exceed $350,000 annually.\n  The mussels threaten native wildlife in Ohio by competing for the \nfood of native fish by filtering algae and other plankton from the \nwater. They have also been shown to accumulate contaminants which can \nbe passed up the food chain. During the summer of 1995, they were \nimplicated as the probable cause of a large bloom of toxic algae in the \nWestern Basin of Lake Erie. The frequency of these large and \ndestructive blooms has increased as the mussels spread through the \nlake. Since 1988, zebra mussels in Ohio have spread to 10 inland lakes \nand 6 streams.\n  Mr. President, along with my esteemed colleague and co-chairman of \nthe Great Lakes Task Force, Senator Levin, I urged funding for the \neffective implementation of a program to help mitigate the impact of \nzebra mussels in United States waters. Today, I want to thank Senator \nDomenici and Senator Reid for continuing to fund important research to \ncontrol the damage caused by the zebra mussel.\n  While other agencies work to limit the introduction of new species \ninto U.S. waters, the Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility \nunder the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of developing better \nmeans for managing those pest species already established. NISA expands \nexisting authority for the Army Corps to research, develop and \ndemonstrate environmentally sound techniques for removing zebra mussels \nand other aquatic\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nnuisance species from public facilities, such as municipal water works.\n  As the range of the zebra mussel expands, control is being undertaken \nby more and more raw water users. Without the benefit of this research, \nthe control methods chosen may be less efficient, and less \nenvironmentally sound than necessary. With the help of Senators \nDomenici and Reid and Levin I am glad to say that this bill will \nprovide $1.5 million to continue this important work.\n  The National Invasive Species Act of 1996, which I cosponsored and \nwhich reauthorized and expanded the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance \nPrevention and Control Act, received strong bipartisan and multi-\nregional support in both chambers, and the full support of the \nadministration, the maritime industry and environmental community. \nFunding for NISA programs is essential if the benefits of the law are \nto be realized.\n  Mr. President, again I want to thank Senator Domenici and Senator \nReid for their attention to this matter.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for a \nprovision in the Fiscal Year 2000 Energy and Water Development bill \nthat rescinds funding for a critical flood control project being \nsponsored by the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission (HMDC) \nin Lyndhurst, NJ. This project first began receiving Federal funds in \nFY 1995, while I was still a U.S. Congressman, and is necessary to \nreduce damage to local areas caused by Hackensack River flooding.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, the HMDC analyzed a number of local areas which \nexperience frequent flooding, and developed a list of improvements \ndesigned to reduce damage to the region. At my request, in FY 1995, the \nHMDC received $2.5 million to make this flood control project a \nreality, and the agency began to develop a plan to restore several \ndrainage ditches in the area, install tidal gates and reconstruct a \nmajor dike system along the Hackensack River.\n  Regrettably, because of the Army Corps' difficulties in reaching an \nagreement with the local sponsor on the scope of the work, and with \nfinding a source for the cost-share, only about $100,000 has been spent \nto date on this project. I understand that this year the subcommittee \nhas targeted projects with unspent balances, and, as a result, the FY \n2000 Energy and Water bill contains a rescission of $1.641 million for \nthis initiative.\n  However, I have been informed that the local sponsor is now ready to \nsign a Project Cooperation Agreement and that the local cost-share is \nnow available. As a result, I want to work closely with Chairman \nDomenici and Ranking Member Reid to address the concerns about the \nunspent balance while ensuring that this project remains ready to move \nforward.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member \nReid for their consideration and assistance with this initiative. I \nappreciate their personal involvement in trying to reach agreement on \nfunding for this project, and am hopeful that by working together we \ncan move forward in the effort to reduce flooding damage caused by the \nHackensack River.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7011-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7011-S7017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think most of those who are following \nthe activities on Capitol Hill understand that we are awaiting action \nin the other body, the House of Representatives, on a measure that was \npassed here several weeks ago concerning gun safety. This is a measure \nwhich received a bipartisan vote, a tie vote on the floor of the \nSenate, a tie that was broken by Vice President Gore. That issue, which \nreached, I guess, the highest level of national consciousness, came in \nthe wake of the Littleton, CO, tragedy.\n  I think most Members of Congress thought we on Capitol Hill had to \nlisten to the families across America who were asking us to do \nsomething to make life safer for our school children. The Senate \nresponded. After a week-long debate, we passed legislation and sent it \nto the House of Representatives--modest steps but important steps in \nsensible gun control.\n  It is our hope that the House meets its obligation, passes \nlegislation, and we can achieve something this year on the important \nissue of safety in our schools. This respite that we currently enjoy, \nbecause of summer vacation, should not lull us into a false sense of \nsecurity about school safety.\n  Sadly, the names of towns across America remind us that we have a \nnational problem: Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Jonesboro, AR; West \nPaducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR. The list goes on, sadly, to \ninclude too many towns, many of which I am sure we would never have \nguessed would be the site or scene of violence in a school. It has \nbecome a national problem.\n  I hope this Congress, which has done precious little in the last few \nmonths, can respond to this issue of school safety and do it quickly. \nWe would be remiss to believe the response to that issue satisfies the \nneeds of the American people as they look to Congress for leadership.\n  There is an area which most Americans understand and appreciate that, \nfrankly, we have failed to address over the last several years. I \nrefer, of course, to the whole question of the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand whether or not we, as a Congress, will respond to the need to do \nsomething about the state of health insurance in America.\n  We all know what has happened. There was a debate several years ago, \nwhen the Clinton administration first came in, over whether we would do \nhealth care reform. That debate broke down on Capitol Hill when the \ninsurance industry spent literally millions of dollars in advertising \nagainst any kind of reform. We stopped in place. We did nothing on \nCapitol Hill.\n  Families across America, as they look at the changing landscape of \nhealth insurance, might assume we passed some sweeping Federal \nlegislation. We did not. What happened was, there were dramatic changes \nin the private sector without any impetus from legislation on Capitol \nHill. Those changes started moving more and more Americans into what is \nnow euphemistically called managed care. Managed care, of course, is a \nhealth insurance approach that is designed to bring down costs. I do \nnot argue with the fact that it has brought down costs in some areas. \nWhat I argue with is whether or not we have paid too high a price for \nthose costs to be brought down and whether there is a more sensible way \nto address it.\n  It is estimated that by 1996, 75 percent of employees with employer-\nprovided health insurance were covered by managed care.\n  I have traveled around Illinois. I will bet Senators visiting their \nhome States would find the same thing that I did. I visited hospitals \nin cities and rural areas. I invited doctors and medical professionals \nto come to the cafeteria and sit around a table and talk about health \ninsurance. I didn't know if any doctors would take time out of their \nbusy day for that purpose, but they did.\n  In fact, in one hospital, as we were sitting in a cafeteria \ndiscussing the issue, all of the doctors' beepers went off. There was a \ncrisis in the emergency room, and they all left. They returned about 45 \nminutes later, still anxious to carry on the conversation. What these \ndoctors talked to me about was the changing environment in medical care \nin this country and their concern as to whether or not they could do \nthe right job professionally.\n  And it wasn't just the doctor's concern. I have heard the same thing \nfrom families all across Illinois, and we have heard it across the \nNation.\n  Too many people worry that when they go into a doctor's office with a \nmedical problem, or with a member of their family who is ill, they \naren't getting straight talk. They expect doctors to tell them honestly \nwhat the options are, the best course of treatment, the best hospital, \nthe best specialist. Unfortunately, because of managed care, there is \nanother party involved in this conversation. It is no longer just the \ndoctor and the patient, or the doctor and the parent of an ailing \nchild; there is also some clerk at an insurance company who is party to \nthat conversation. They might not be sitting at the examining table, \nbut most doctors, before they can recommend anything for a patient, \nhave to get on a phone and call some invisible clerk hundreds, if not \nthousands, of miles away for approval.\n  Let me tell you a real life story by a doctor. The doctor said that a \nmother came in with a young boy and said, ``My son has complained of \nheadaches\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nfor months.'' The doctor said, ``Are they in one particular part of his \nhead?'' She said, ``Yes; on the left side. He always complains about \nheadaches on the left side of his head.''\n  The doctor thought to himself that there was a possibility that this \ncould be a tumor if the child continued to complain about headaches on \none side of his head. So he thought that perhaps he needed some \ndiagnostic treatment--an MRI, CAT scan, or something to tell him \nwhether or not there was the presence of a tumor.\n  Before he said those words to the mother, he excused himself. He took \na copy of her chart and looked up the insurance company and had his \nsecretary call so he could ask the clerk at the insurance company \nwhether or not he could tell this mother they could go ahead with this \ndiagnostic treatment to determine the nature of the child's problem.\n  The clerk on the other side of the telephone said, ``No, it is not \ncovered; you can't do that.'' The doctor said to the clerk, ``What am I \nsupposed to do?'' The clerk said, ``Tell the mother to go home and wait \nand come back at a later time if the problem is still there.''\n  That doctor walked back into the room with the mother present and \nsaid, ``I think you should go home and wait and call me in a few weeks \nif things have not changed.'' He could not, under his contract with the \ninsurance company, even tell the mother why he had been overruled on \nhis course of treatment. That is what is known as a ``physician's gag \nrule.''\n  What that means for too many Americans is that when you sit across \nthe table from a doctor, you are never certain whether that doctor is \ntelling you everything you ought to know. When we erode the basic \nconfidence in the relationship between a doctor and a patient, we have \ngone a long way in this country in undermining quality health care, \nwhich has been one of the hallmarks of America. The physician-patient \nrelationship is so sacred under the law that it is recognized in court \nas a special, confidential relationship. Yet that very relationship is \nbeing undermined because of this fact.\n  Managed care restricts a doctor's right to decide and his or her \nright to even tell you why he has made a certain decision.\n  That is not the end of it by a long shot. In addition, many managed \ncare policies restrict the hospitals to which patients can go. I belong \nto a managed care plan in Springfield, IL. We have two excellent \nhospitals, but my plan really focuses on one hospital and says, you \nwill go to this hospital to the exclusion of the other hospital, or it \nwill cost you. It is not a big problem where I live, because the \nhospitals are a few blocks from one another. But in some areas of urban \nAmerica, and in rural America, it can be a problem.\n  In what way? Well, consider this. You are in your backyard at a \nfamily picnic for the Fourth of July, and the kids are playing around, \nas I just went through with Memorial Day at a family get-together. They \nare climbing trees, and a child falls out of a tree and starts crying, \nand there is fear that he might have broken his arm, or worse. They \ntake off for the emergency room.\n  But wait. Before you take off for the nearest emergency room, you had \nbetter ask yourself: Does my health insurance policy cover emergency \ncare at that hospital? Do I have to drive across town or to some other \nhospital under the terms of my policy? It makes no sense. If there is a \nsituation of medical necessity to protect your child or a member of \nyour family, you should not have to fumble around and try to remember \nwhich hospital is covered by your plan. Instead, you should do what is \nright for your family. That is one of the elements I think many people \nare concerned about when it comes to this whole question of managed \ncare.\n  There is also a question about the cost of this managed care and the \naccessibility of this care for many employees. It is a fact of life in \nAmerica that each year fewer and fewer working families in America have \nthe benefit of health insurance protection. Fewer and fewer employers \nare offering it. We are drifting away from our goal of universal health \ncoverage and leaving more and more Americans vulnerable. That is a \nclassic example of what is wrong with our system today, an instance of \nwhat we need to do in order to make certain that every American has the \npeace of mind to know they have health insurance coverage.\n\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I am in complete \nsympathy with the remarks he has made.\n  Everywhere I have gone in my State, people have brought up one horror \nstory after the next, whereby, say, accountants are making medical \ndecisions instead of doctors. I would like to relate to the Senator an \ninstance that I heard about, which was really frightening to me, and \nsee if the kind of proposal we are talking about might deal with that \nissue.\n  There was a young woman on Long Island, 24 years old and beautiful, \nwho had just got out of nursing school. She was an athletic individual. \nShe went to a physician because her upper leg was hurting. She went to \nthe physician, who determined that she had a tumor on the bone. The \nphysician recommended and told her privately that she ought to go to an \northopedic oncologist because they had to take the tumor off. She went \nto her HMO. The HMO said: No, no, no. All you need is a regular \northopedic surgeon.\n  Well, this was not a well-to-do family. She had her health plan \nbecause her father had retired as a lineman for the phone company. She \nfigured she would go along. She went to where the HMO recommended--to a \nregular orthopedic surgeon. The operation was had, and he said it was a \nsuccess.\n  Two months later, the tumor grew back. She called the HMO and said, \n``I really need an orthopedic oncologist.'' They said no. She then paid \nsomething like $45,000 or $50,000; she went into hock with loans to get \nthe operation done, which was a success. A day after the operation \noccurred, the HMO wrote her a letter saying, ``All right, you are \nright; we will give you an orthopedic oncologist.'' But it was too \nlate. She said, ``Why don't you reimburse me?'' They said no way. After \na lot of intervention from my office and others, they have finally \nreimbursed her.\n  One of the things that has been mentioned as part of the Patients' \nBill of Rights is guaranteed access to appropriate specialists. I was \njust wondering if the Senator from Illinois could enlighten us as to--\nin that type of situation, which I am sure is repeated time and time \nagain--how the Patients' Bill of Rights might rectify that situation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for that question.\n  Sadly, the Senator's experience can be repeated in almost every State \nunder managed care plans. What we are trying to provide in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, supported by the Democratic side, is a \ncontinuity of care and access to specialists when needed. I think that \njust makes common sense. I can't imagine anyone, such as this lady the \nSenator mentioned, or others, who would want to compromise the best \ncare possible to make sure they are taken care of.\n  Here is another example you are probably aware of. Many times, \ncompanies will change managed care plans. Someone who, for example, is \ngoing through cancer therapy and believes they have good, quality care \nthat is very promising in terms of full recovery may find a change in \nmanaged care plans which makes that doctor, that clinic, or that \nhospital ineligible. So that is another area where, frankly, we want to \nrestore peace of mind among the people across America--that they would \nhave this kind of access, access with continuity--even if a change in \nplan has taken place through the employer.\n  This access to needed specialists becomes equally important, because \nmost managed care plans have what they call gatekeepers. These \ngatekeepers are general practitioners, family internists, and the like \nwho try to decide whether or not you need a specialist. Many \nspecialists have come to me and said they have limited training, but \nthey have specialized training. And they are encouraged to pass them \nalong the chain to a specialist who might be initially more expensive \nbut, frankly, might save that patient a lot of worry, perhaps \nsuffering, and perhaps provide a cure that might not otherwise be \navailable.\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\n  That is the kind of thing that I think families across America are \nconcerned about.\n  They look at Capitol Hill and say: Do you get it up there? Do you \nunderstand? These are things our families worry about when we think we \nhave the protection of health insurance, and, yet, we are so \nvulnerable. What are you doing about it in Washington?\n  The honest answer is, we have done nothing.\n  The question is, before we leave town this year, perhaps even this \nmonth, whether or not we can bring up this bill, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and address some of the real family concerns we have run into.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I couldn't agree more with the Senator. These are \nthe kinds of things, it seems to me, that our constituents sent us to \nWashington to do--not to spend all day debating all sorts of things \nthat have very little relevance to their lives but to try to solve the \nproblems that families face.\n  I find families from one end of my State to the other are just \ntotally frightened about the ability to pay for health care and are \nfrightened that the HMO that they have is really not giving them good \nmedical care, that it is putting dollars above health care.\n  There is nothing wrong with HMOs. In fact, a lot of them have done a \ngood job in terms of reducing costs. But the pendulum has swung, it \nseems to me, too far.\n  When physicians who spend years and years of training, and whom this \ncountry subsidizes to train, are no longer making the decision, it \nseems to me the Senator has made a great point: It not only hurts \nhealth care but it actually costs more money. The example I gave is an \nexample where the operation has to be gone through twice because it was \ndone so poorly the first time.\n  My issue is, from what I understand, oftentimes, in access to \nspecialists as well as access to procedures, the gatekeeper is not even \na physician; some HMO is the gatekeeper. Someone who is an actuary is \nlooking at tables and statistics, and things like that, and overrules \nthe actual decisions of the medical doctor or the specialist.\n  Is that true in the Senator's State as well?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is. I was in Joliet, IL, at a hospital cafeteria, \nsitting at a table full of doctors. One of the doctors was so angry \nbecause he kept getting this clerk on the phone: No, that patient can't \nbe admitted. He finally said to the voice on the other end of the \nphone: Are you a doctor? The employee of the insurance company said no. \nWell, are you a nurse? No. Well, are you a college graduate? No. How \ncan you possibly overrule my decision on treating a patient? She said: \nI am going by the book.\n  She had a book in front of her that had the complaints that a person \nmight register and whether or not a treatment was warranted.\n  That medical care has now been reduced to the level that we have \npeople who are reading books and overruling doctors who have been \ntrained gives everyone concern.\n  One of the reasons we need to bring up this Patients' Bill of Rights \nis to make sure that doctors and medical care personnel across the \ncountry can make the best professional decision for the people they \ntreat--a decision based on a person's health and their well-being as \nopposed to the bottom line profit margin of the insurance company that \nis involved in it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I have one final question. \nThis is not a new issue. In other words, I think we have heard about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights for at least a year or two. I am new to \nthis body.\n  Have there be any attempts to deal with this issue in the past? What \nhas happened? What is stopping us from just voting on this right now? I \nam sure it is a measure that the American people in every one of our \nStates want us to discuss. What has been the history of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York. The history of the \nlegislation has been frustrating, because we came close to debating it \nlast year, then it fell apart.\n  There are two different points of view: The Republican side of the \naisle, not exclusively but by and large, has their own approach. The \nDemocratic side of the aisle has its own approach on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n\n  We would like to bring this out for a debate. Let's have a debate. \nLet's act as a legislative body, as we did during the gun debate. Let's \nlet the American people in on it. Let's let them hear arguments over \nthe amendments on one side and then the other, and let them join us in \nthis decision-making process. Unfortunately, that broke down last year \nand there has been no evidence of an effort to revive it this year.\n  We need to remember that in a few weeks, literally, we will all be \nheading home for the 4th of July recess, then for the August recess, \nand many people will say to us: Incidentally, what have you done? What \nis happening in Washington? If we can't point to real-life issues that \nfamilies care about, they have a right to be upset and wonder if we are \ndoing our job.\n  So I say to the Senator from New York, precious little has been done \non this subject. But we are prepared to go forward with debate. I think \nthat is what this body is supposed to be all about--the world's most \ndeliberative body, the Senate.\n  Let's not be afraid of amendments. Let's not be afraid of votes. I \ninvite the Members on the other side of the aisle to join us. Let's put \nthe issue on the floor. Let's come to some conclusion, send the bill on \nto the House and challenge them to do the same thing, bring the \nPresident into the conversation, and say to the American people that we \nare doing what you sent us to Washington to do--to respond to things \nthat people really care about.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield once more, it seems to me \nthat, again, if there is anything we should be doing, it is things such \nas this. There are lots of important issues. This is a big country. We \ndebate all sorts of things.\n  But, again, I go around my State. I can't think of anything that \npeople care more about, that we can do something concrete about, that \nis not a radical solution. This is not something that says scrap the \nwhole system and start from the beginning; this is simply something \nthat redresses the balances so people can have faith in their \nphysician.\n  This is an amazing thing to me. I don't know if the Senator has found \nthis. But as I go around the State, perhaps the most frustrated group \nis the doctors themselves. They are hardly a group of wide-eyed crazy \nradicals. The doctors come to me in place after place with anguish in \ntheir eyes, and they say: You know, I have spent so many years, I went \nto college and took all of the courses, I went to medical school, I \nperformed a residency, and I practiced medicine in the way I chose, in \nthe best I way I know how, for 30 years, and now, all of a sudden, \nbecause of these changes in health care, I can't deliver the quality \nhealth care that I want for my patients, whom I care about, many of \nwhom have been my patients for decades.\n  I would join my colleague in urging that we in this body debate and \ndebate rather quickly a Patients' Bill of Rights. We don't have the \nonly approach. Let every approach be aired. Let us have a real debate \non the issue. But let's not walk away from here before the July 4th \nbreak without having a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I am wondering if the Senator thinks that is within the timeframe of \npossibility that we could get such a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  We just spent 5 days debating whether or not certain computer \ncompanies should be protected from liability on Y2K problems. That is a \nserious issue. It is a bill that we passed today. We spent 5 days \ndebating it. I think we owe the American people to spend at least 5 \ndays, if not more, debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have the \ntime to do it. We don't have an overload of activity in the Senate, but \nwe have an overload of responsibility when it comes to the health care \nissue.\n  The last point I will make before giving up the floor is on the \nquestion of liability. Remember the example I used earlier about the \ndoctor who couldn't tell the mother that it wasn't his decision that \nher son couldn't have an MRI or CAT scan. He couldn't tell her. It was \nthe insurance company's decision.\n  Let's assume for a minute that something terrible occurred, and that \nchild\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\ndidn't have a brain tumor, and in fact suffered some long illness, or \nrecuperation, or maybe worse. Do you know that under current law, as \nwritten, in many of these managed care plans, even though the insurance \ncompany made the bad decision, the insurance company overruled the \ndoctor, the insurance company could not be held accountable for its \nwrongdoing in America?\n  There are very few groups that are immune from liability. I think \nforeign diplomats are one. When it comes to this issue of managed care \nand insurance companies, many doctors are saying: That is not fair; we \nwant to make the right medical decision, and we are overruled by the \ninsurance company. The doctors get sued. The insurance companies are \noff the hook.\n  That is not what this system or what this Government is all about. It \nis about accountability. I am held accountable for my actions as the \ndriver of a car, as the owner of a home--all sorts of different things. \nWhy should we exempt health insurance companies and say they are not \ngoing to be held liable for bad decisions--decisions not to refer you \nto the right specialist, decisions not to allow you to stay in a \nhospital, decisions not to allow you the kind of care you need? That, \nto me, is the bottom line in this debate.\n\n  I see Senator Kennedy on the floor. He has been a leader on this \nissue. I thank him for joining in this discussion. I hope he can give \nMembers some instruction.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join my friend, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, in his presentation, as well as the Senator from New \nYork, and urge that Members in this body begin debate on one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that we, hopefully, will have an \nopportunity to consider; that is, how we will ensure that medical \ndecisions are made by those in the medical profession, rather than the \naccountants and the insurance companies.\n  The Senator has made that case with an excellent example this \nafternoon. I wonder whether the Senator realizes it has been over 2 \nyears we have had legislation pending before the Senate. The Human \nResources Committee has the jurisdiction, and we were effectively \ndenied--I know the people who are watching or listening are not really \ninterested in these kinds of activities. We have to have the hearings \nin the committee. Then we have to try to work the will of the committee \nand report it out to the Senate.\n  This legislation has been before the Senate for 2 years, but we were \nnot even permitted to have a hearing under the leadership of our \nfriends on the other side, the Republican leadership. We were denied \nthe opportunity to debate these questions when we tried to bring this \nup in the last Congress.\n  I gather from what both Senators have said, they believe, as I do, \nthat this is one of the fundamental and basic issues of central concern \nto families all over this country. If we can spend 5 days dealing with \nthe Y2K issue, we can certainly afford to spend a few days--perhaps not \neven the 5 days, 4 days--on an issue that is so important to families, \nfamilies who may have an emergency, families who may want to have \nclinical trials for the mother, the grandmother, or the daughter, to \ndeal with problems of cancer. Or the whole issue of specialty care, to \nmake sure those who need the kinds of prescription drugs necessary to \ndeal with a particular illness and sickness would be able to get them.\n  I wonder if the Senator would agree with me that included in Senator \nDaschle's legislation is a series of recommendations that were made by \na bipartisan panel to the President, with Members who were nominated by \nthe leaders of both parties and by the President of the United States. \nIt had to be unanimous. They made a series of recommendations. Those \nrecommendations have been included in Senator Daschle's Patients' Bill \nof Rights. The only difference was the panel recommended they be \nvoluntarily accepted. We have seen that the companies are unwilling to \naccept those. The leader has said if they are not going to accept them \nvoluntarily, we will include them, but they reflect a bipartisan panel.\n  Secondly, they include some other recommendations that have been \nrecommended by the insurance commissioners. They are not a notorious \ngroup favoring the Democrats or Republicans. I imagine, if you looked \nover the field, most of them are actually Republicans. They made some \nrecommendations. Those effectively have been included.\n  Finally, there are the kinds of protections that have been included \nin the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We don't hear a murmur from the \nother side about those protections not being effective.\n\n  If that is the basis of this legislation, and it has the support of \n130 groups that have responsibility for treating the American families \nin this country, why in the world shouldn't we have an opportunity to \ndebate it?\n  On the other hand, our Republican friends haven't a single group, not \none, that represents parents, children, women, or disabled that support \ntheir program. Can the Senator explain to me why, if that is the case, \nwe are being denied? Does the Senator agree it is completely \nirresponsible to deny the Senate the full opportunity to debate these \nmeasures?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to respond.\n  I think the Senator's question is rhetorical. But if we can spend 5 \ndays debating protection for computer companies, can't we spend 5 days \ndebating protection for America's families concerned about the quality \nof the health care available to them and their children?\n  I think that is obvious. I think the Senator has clearly made the \npoint about the number of groups that endorse the Democratic approach \nto that, that they could and should have that kind of debate.\n  I see the minority leader on the floor, and I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I congratulate the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom New York for beginning this colloquy this afternoon. Certainly, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is a leader on health issues. This is, \nwithout a doubt, the single most important health issue facing this \nCongress this year, next year, and for however long it takes to pass.\n  Senator Kennedy's question is right on the mark: Why is it, with all \nof these groups that are urging the Senate to act, that are waiting for \nthe Senate to act, that cannot understand why we have not acted, why is \nit we cannot schedule legislation this week to get this bill passed?\n  If we can do Y2K, if we can do the array of other matters that have \ncome before this Congress this year, for heaven's sake, why, with 115 \nmillion people already detrimentally affected, can't we do it this \nweek? There isn't an answer to that question.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois if, from the experiences he has had \nin his own State, he has heard any other issue having the resonance, \nhaving the depth of feeling and meaning to the families of America that \nthis issue does; whether or not he ever had the kind of experience I \nhave had where people come up and volunteer that there is no more \nimportant question facing this Congress than this issue, and they want \nMembers to solve it; has the Senator had a similar experience?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have had a similar experience. Not only is this an \nimportant issue, the human side is compelling. We hear the stories from \nthe Senators from New York and Massachusetts, and we have run into \nthese real-life stories. These are not the kinds of stories you dream \nup or see on television.\n  People worry on a day-to-day basis whether they can protect \nthemselves and their own families under this managed care Patients' \nBill of Rights, on which Senator Daschle is the lead sponsor. It gives \na framework to give assurance to these people so they can have \nconfidence that not only good health care will be there but quality \nhealth care that will help respond to a lot of the family tragedies \nwhich we hear over and over as we travel about our States.\n  The other side of the aisle makes a serious mistake if they do not \nunderstand this is a very bipartisan issue. I am just not hearing from \nDemocrats or Independents; I am hearing from Republicans and Democrats \nand Independents alike. All families are in the same predicament. All \nfamilies look to the Senate to focus on this issue, which means so much \nto the future of this country.\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his leadership and comments he \nhas made.\n  Obviously, time is running out. We have 6 weeks left before the \nsummer recess begins in August. We have a few weeks left in September \nand October, and then we are at the end of the session already.\n  We have very little time to address an issue of this importance. That \nis why we have indicated we will find a way to ensure this issue is \naddressed in June. We cannot wait any longer. We waited last Congress. \nWe waited and came up with as many different ways with which to \napproach this issue procedurally as we knew how. We failed to convince \nour Republican colleagues to join this side of the aisle in passing it \nlast year. We will not fail this year. We will get this legislation \npassed. It has to happen this month.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership and for cooperating and making \nthis a part of our schedule this afternoon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I express appreciation for the very excellent commitment \nof our leader on this issue. He has been tireless in the pursuit of the \nprotections of our fellow citizens in the health area.\n  I see the Senator from New York on his feet. I will ask one or two \nquestions and then I will yield. Is one of the points the Senator from \nIllinois thinks worth debating, with the approach that has been taken \nby our Republican friends, the limited number of people who are \nactually being covered? As one who was the author of the HMO \nlegislation in the 1970s, we passed it five times here in the Senate \nbefore we finally got the House to pass it.\n\n  Then it was passed and it was on a pilot program. But the concept at \nthat time was we were going to change the financial incentives from \nhaving more and more tests and more and more treatment to having a \ncapitation payment that said to the health delivery system you have \nthis amount of money to take care of this patient, so they have an \nincentive to work for preventive health care, keep the person healthy. \nThey get more resources the healthier the person is and the longer the \nperson stays healthy. But we have seen abuses where they have cut back \non more and more of the coverage. That has stimulated this whole \nprogram.\n  The fact remains, under the Republican proposal we find out that \nsomewhere above a quarter, about 30 percent of all of those who are \ncovered, and even a lesser percent of HMOs, which is really the \nproblem, are actually covered. Would this not be an issue that ought to \nbe debated out here, that the Members of this body ought to be able to \nmake some call about? I do not think that is a very complex issue. Do \nwe want to cover 30 percent or do we want to cover 100 percent? How \nlong do you think that issue would really take, for people to \nunderstand it and be able to express a view? It does not seem to me \nthat would take a very long time. People can make that judgment. People \nought to be able to make that judgment. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. Isn't it an \ninteresting analogy to the debate we had on guns, where we had \namendments coming before us, and when the public had a chance to take a \nlook at it they were satisfied that amendment does not achieve the \nresult we want, keeping schools safer and guns out of the hands of \nchildren and criminals? The debate ensued for the week we were on it, \nand when it was all over the public prevailed. They passed a real \nsensible gun control bill as opposed to one that did not do the job.\n  I think what the Senator from Massachusetts says is let's let the \nAmerican public in on this debate, too. Do they think covering one out \nof three families is enough, or do we want to make sure we have a bill \nsimilar to the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights which really \nprovides protection and assurance of quality health care for the vast \nmajority of families under managed care plans? I think the Senator is \nright. That deserves to be debated on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just a final point. Does the Senator agree with me that \nnow the insurance industry has spent somewhere around $15 million to \nmisrepresent and distort the Patients' Bill of Rights, which has been \nintroduced by our leader, Senator Daschle, and of which many of us are \ncosponsors? They have spent that last year doing that, when people \nthought we were supposed to take it up. If you ask across the spectrum \nof America about the importance of this issue, the American people \nstill want action taken. They still want to have these protections for \nthemselves and for their families. I think this is a clear indication.\n  I think our friends on the other side ought to understand that \nAmericans understand this issue. I think parents understand it. I think \nmothers and grandparents understand it best. Those who are opposed to \nit can distort and misrepresent and advertise, as they have done in the \npast, but American people know what this issue is all about.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me on that, and that the American \npeople want action by this body?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree and I think we have precious little time left to \nrespond.\n  I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just one final question to the Senator. I first thank \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for the eloquence and passion and \nintelligence that he brings to these issues, and our leader, Senator \nDaschle, for sponsoring this legislation and leading us in this regard.\n  When you walk into an emergency room, the first question you should \nbe asked is not: What is your coverage? It should be: Where does it \nhurt? Yet, these days, the way our system is working, the first \nquestion that often has to be asked is: What is your coverage? That is \nso totally wrong.\n  One of the reasons I ran for the Senate was so I would have the \nopportunity to debate these bills, because the procedures in the Senate \nallow the American people, through their elected Representatives, to \ndebate in a much wider way than the process in the House. Yet we are \nnot being allowed to debate this, even though we have wished to do it.\n  I ask my senior colleague, what holds us back? I mean, why can we not \ndebate this issue? Not everyone is going to have the same view, but I \nthink everyone would agree this is an issue on the very top of the list \nof things that most Americans care about. What can hold us back? What \nis holding us back from debating an issue as important as the Patients' \nBill of Rights?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think it is a matter of political will and it is a \nquestion of whether the leadership on both sides of the aisle can agree \non a schedule.\n  I see on the floor the majority leader, Senator Lott. For the purpose \nof answering a question, I yield to the majority leader. Will he tell \nus whether or not we plan on scheduling this Patients' Bill of Rights \nfor consideration in the next several weeks?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senator asked a question and yielded to \nme for a response. First of all, I am standing so we can make an \nannouncement about what the schedule will be for the remainder of the \nnight and to get an agreement about how we will proceed during the day \ntomorrow. As soon as this 15-minute block of time that was agreed to is \nexhausted, I will be prepared to go to this.\n  In answer to the Senator's question, I will be delighted to go to \nthis Patients' Bill of Rights very soon. We could even do it next week \nif we could get an agreement that we will vote on your version of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and we will vote on our version of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We have a good bill. We are ready to go. We \nthink there are important things that need to be done in this area, and \nwe are prepared to debate the issue and vote on the two different \napproaches. So we can do that.\n  Or we can work together and see if there would be a limited number of \namendments that could be agreed to that would be offered on both sides. \nThe problem we ran into last year is somebody said we will need 100 \namendments. Please. We have lots of other work. If the Senator has a \nperfect product and we have a perfect product, why do we need 100 \namendments? Then it got down to 20 amendments on each side.\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\n  But I have designated Senator Nickles to work with the designee from \nthe Democratic side of the aisle. I believe Senator Daschle has \nindicated Senator Kennedy will do that. They are going to try to get \nsome agreement on exactly how to proceed. We will be glad to vote on \nthe two versions any time Senators are ready, because we think this is \nimportant. We have a bill that was developed by a task force that had \nbroad involvement. Senator Jeffords was involved, as were Senator \nCollins, Senator Gramm, Senator Nickles, Senator Santorum--really a \ngood group. So we are ready to go. It is just a question of getting an \nagreement on how the procedure will be worked out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might, without yielding the floor, say first to the \nmajority leader, I was told Senator Domenici was going to come forward \nto urge a vote or something of that nature. I have not seen him at his \ndesk, but I am happy to yield the floor.\n  But I ask the Senate majority leader one last question: If we could \nreach an agreement that we would limit the length of debate on \nPatients' Bill of Rights to the same period of time, the 5 days we \nspent on the Y2K, would that be a sound basis for agreeing that next \nweek we would take up the Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would have to take a look at that. First of all, I think \n5 days is probably excessive. There was no need to take up 5 days on \nthe Y2K bill. We could have done that in 2 days very easily, but there \nwere a lot of obstruction tactics and delays--having to vote on \ncloture. Finally, we came to a conclusion and 62 Senators voted for it. \nI am not prepared now to say we want to go that long or limit it. I \nthink we need to look at what we need, have a fair debate, and get \nvotes on the substitute. We do not have a list of the amendments. We \nhave asked for a list of the amendments so we are in the process of \ntrying to get an understanding of what is going on here.\n  I want to reemphasize we are aware that there needs to be some things \ndone in terms of patients' rights. We have a good bill. We do not think \nthe solution to the problem is lawsuits. Some people seem to think what \nwe need to solve the problems of managed care is more lawsuits. No. If \nI have a problem with a HMO in my family, I would prefer to have a \nprocess to solve the problem, either internally or an external appeal. \nI would prefer not to be the beneficiary of inheritance as a result of \na lawsuit 3 years later. So that is kind of the crux of it.\n  We have Dr. Bill Frist who has worked on this, I mean a doctor, \nsomebody who understands what it is like to have your heart replaced, \nsomeone who understands the need for managed care. We want to do this, \nso we will be glad to work with all the Senators who are interested. We \nwould like to get a list of amendments. I think it would be fair for \nthe other side, Senator Kennedy, to want to look at our amendments. I \nhope that process is underway.\n  Senator Nickles has been designated to work on this issue on our \nbehalf, and he might want to respond to your question, if you would \nyield to him for that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask you or Senator Nickles one last question, brought \non by what you just said.\n  Can we then agree we will bring this up for debate before we break \nfor the Fourth of July recess so we can say to the American people we \nunderstand the importance of this issue? We have a difference of \nopinion on liability and other questions. Before we leave for the \nFourth of July recess, we will have a vote on final passage on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. LOTT. As soon as we get agreement on how to proceed, we will take \nit up. We will be glad to vote on your substitute and our substitute. \nWe could do that this week, but if it is going to be that you have some \namendments or you want more debate, then we have to work through when \nthat is going to be. I was ready to do this bill last year, and we \ncould not get a reasonable agreement on how to handle it. If we get \nthat worked out, we will be glad to do it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not have the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will make a couple comments. The leader said we would \nbe happy to vote on the Democrat bill, and we would be happy to vote on \nour bill. We made that offer last year, I might mention. We asked \nunanimous consent to do that on two or three occasions last year. We \nalso made a unanimous consent request last year a couple of times to \nhave a limited number of amendments. That was not agreed upon.\n  I will inform my colleagues, I did discuss this last Wednesday with \nSenator Daschle and Senator Kennedy. They expressed a desire to bring \nit forward. I said I think we have to have some kind of time \nconstraints and limit on amendments. I did request that. They said they \nwould be forthcoming in giving me that list. We have yet to receive it. \nOur staff requested it from them as late as Friday. We have yet to \nreceive that list. Once we receive that list, we will try to see if we \ncannot negotiate some reasonable time agreement to get this thing \nresolved.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say, reclaiming my time, one of my colleagues and \nfriends from the home State of the Senator from Oklahoma, the late \nCongressman Mike Synar, used to say: If you don't want to fight fires, \ndon't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast tough votes, don't be a \nMember of Congress.\n  I think we ought to welcome the possibility of having some tough \nvotes on amendments. Let the Democrats squirm, let the Republicans \nsquirm, and let the body work its will. Don't be afraid of some \namendments. Let's bring out the best ideas on both sides and see if we \ncan craft it together in a bipartisan bill.\n  If we limit this debate to a few days or a certain number of \namendments, there is no reason why we should not be able to accomplish \nthis in the next week or two. Insulating Members from casting a tough \nvote on what might be a difficult amendment really should not be our \ngoal. The goal should be the very best legislation and the body working \nits will. If we have an up-or-down vote, take it or leave it, that is \nan odd way for the Senate to view this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We still have not seen the text of whatever it is we are \nsupposed to be amending. The Senator from Oklahoma and I talked about \nthat last week. He indicated it is going to be roughly the bill that \npassed out of the Labor Committee with some changes, as I understand \nit, but we have not seen the changes.\n  I must say, it would not be in keeping with the traditions in the \nSenate that we need approval from the majority with regard to \namendments before we can move to a bill. We are determined to be as \ncooperative as we can, but at the same time, we certainly do not seek \nour Republican colleagues' approval on a list of amendments. That \nshould not be our requirement.\n  We want to offer amendments that we expect to be debated and \nconsidered and hopefully voted on. As the Senator from Illinois has \nsaid, there are going to be tough votes on all sides on this issue, but \nthey are issues that have to be addressed. If we are going to deal with \na Republican bill that was passed out of the committee with an \nexpectation that, obviously, that may be the bill that passes, we are \ngoing to have to try to amend it.\n  We do not have any expectation necessarily that our bill can pass \nwithout some Republican support. We hope it will be, and we will work \nwith our Republican colleagues to support the Democratic bill. But we \nhave to have an opportunity to offer amendments, and we will protect \nour Senators' rights to offer those amendments, and hopefully we can \nwork through this.\n  We are prepared to come up with a reasonable list. I have suggested \n20 amendments, which is probably a third of what our colleagues would \nlike to offer on this side alone. But we will come up with a list. I \ncertainly do not expect that we will need to seek approval, however, \nfrom our Republican colleagues before we offer them.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from New York, and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Briefly, because I know we want to move on.\n  Just as an example, I ask the Senator this question: Our bill, it is \ncorrect, has the right to sue, and I respect the view of many on the \nother side. Our bill, for instance, has a far more ample\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\nprovision about having access to specialists. There might be a good \nnumber of Members in this body who want to see greater access to \nspecialists but not support the right to sue, and conversely. Giving us \nthe right to do some amendments might perfect a bill that can pass. I \nask the Senator, my being new here, if that would be sort of an ideal \nway that could work?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the way a deliberative body works. It deliberates \nand makes choices. It is important to make our views known on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and helping millions of American families \nconcerned about the adequacy of their health insurance and whether they \nhave guarantees to quality care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7017-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today--for the first time in many months--\nthere is peace in Kosovo.\n  Like all Americans, I hope with all my heart that the peace will be \nboth lasting and just.\n  I rise today not to discus the war--or the way it was conducted--or \nthe terms on which it was ended.\n  Many Americans risked their lives in the air over Kosovo in the \nbombers and helicopters flying over the front lines. Every night, \nAmerica watched the heroism and skill of those pilots as they braved \nanti-aircraft fire to drop laser-guided bombs and missiles and other \nordnance onto targets with amazing accuracy.\n  But what we often forget is that those heroics were made possible by \nthe efforts of thousands of Americans working behind the lines, off-\ncamera, in a variety of roles--maintaining the planes, feeding the \npilots, shipping supplies, performing countless other functions \ncritical to men and women in combat.\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\n  Now that the war is over, I think that we owe all of those countless \nAmericans, who helped in ways both large and small, a nod of thanks for \ntheir sacrifice and for their effort.\n  Today, I particularly want to acknowledge the unique contribution of \nseveral hundred men and women from my home state of Nevada.\n  The war in Kosovo was the first successful large-scale campaign waged \nexclusively by air. Much more than other wars, that kind of war relies \nheavily upon specialized ordnance--the laser-guided smart bombs and \nprecision rockets that were so effective in destroying Slobodan \nMilosevic's infrastructure and weapons of war.\n  Many of those weapons were supplied by the hardworking men and women \nof Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada.\n  Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada is the largest ammunition storage \nfacility in the world. It employs about 500 people in the state of \nNevada, and stores munitions of all kinds for our Armed Forces.\n  For the past several weeks, many of those 500 men and women worked \novertime--sometimes working 12 to 16 hour days, for days on end--to \nsupply many of the bombs, rockets, shells, and missiles used to such \ndevastating effect in Kosovo.\n  During the course of the war, Hawthorne Army Depot shipped about \n10,000 tons of munitions to our troops in Kosovo, including hundreds of \nthe 750-pound bombs used to destroy Slobodan Milosevic's \ninfrastructure.\n  And even though the war is over, their job is not. They still have a \nlong, tough job ahead of them to replenish the weapons and munitions \nexpended during the closing days of the conflict, to supply the \npeacekeeping forces now entering Kosovo, and to return to storage the \nthousands of bombs and munitions being shipped back now that the \nfighting is over.\n  I take this opportunity to say to those hardworking men and women at \nHawthorne, thank you for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7018-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7018-S7019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DRUG PROBLEM IN RIO ARRIBA COUNTY, NEW MEXICO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the drug \nproblem which is plaguing the northern part of my home state--a problem \nwhich has had particularly profound effects on the quality of life and \nthe health of the citizens in an area known as Rio Arriba County, New \nMexico.\n  Simply put, Rio Arriba County faces one of the most severe black tar \nheroin epidemics this nation has ever seen. In recent years, there have \nbeen 44 heroin overdose deaths in this small county--more per capita \nthan any other area of the country. Last year, New Mexico led the \nnation in per capita heroin overdose deaths, and Rio Arriba County led \nNew Mexico.\n  Just this weekend, one of the local papers printed a story about the \nblack tar heroin epidemic in northern New Mexico, and the reporter \ninterviewed several heroin addicts. Two of these addicts died of \noverdoses between the time they were interviewed and the time the story \nwas printed. That is how acute the problem is.\n  Rio Arriba County is a rural community with close to 40,000 \ninhabitants. Many of those who reside in this small county have family \nwho have lived there for several generations. Neighbors don't just know \neach other--they know each other's entire families and their family's \nhistory in the area.\n  This is a close-knit community, one which recognizes that it must \nband together to beat this problem. Families, political leaders, \ncommunity institutions and public safety and heath experts must work \ntogether in cooperative fashion to rid this area of the scourge of \nheroin.\n  Earlier this year, I mentioned this problem to Attorney General Janet \nReno, and she committed to help coordinate the federal response to the \nheroin epidemic in northern New Mexico.\n  After speaking with Attorney General Reno, I later convened a field \nhearing in Espanola, New Mexico in Rio Arriba County to begin to bring \npeople together at the local, state and federal levels to see what \ncould be done. The hearing was held under the auspices of the Commerce, \nState, Justice subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nchaired by Senator Gregg. I want to thank Senator Gregg for agreeing to \nthe hearing, and for his commitment to providing the necessary federal \nresources to begin to address the problem.\n  At the field hearing, we heard from Laurie Robinson, Associate \nAttorney General for Justice Programs, who has since sent a technical \nassistance team to the area to meet with state and local officials, \ntreatment providers, and community groups in order to begin to \nformulate a comprehensive plan to attack the problem. This technical \nassistance team returns to the county this week to continue its \nefforts, and I expect them to issue an action plan by mid-July.\n  This plan will include recommendations on how the county can best \ncoordinate local drug treatment and intervention efforts, and take \nadvantage of new federal resources made available in recent months.\n  I want to commend the Department of Justice, Attorney General Reno, \nand her partners in this effort--the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n(NIDA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA), as well as New Mexico's Department of Health \nand Human Services, which has worked closely with the federal team.\n  Their comprehensive effort will ensure that we don't simply throw \nmoney at this problem and hope that it goes away. I believe that the \nstrategy they produce will have a lasting, positive impact on the \nsubstance abuse problem in Rio Arriba County.\n  The strategy will include new federal resources for prevention, \ntreatment and law enforcement, and I want to outline federal efforts to \ndate to combat this problem.\n  In addition to bringing in the Department of Justice team to \ncoordinate federal resources, in April, I convinced the Senate to \ninclude $750,000 in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to \nallow Rio Arriba, Santa Fe and San Juan counties to participate in the \nNew Mexico High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA).\n\n  Expanding the New Mexico HIDTA will allow state and local law \nenforcement officials to enhance their efforts to rid northern New \nMexico of drug traffickers, many of whom are Mexican nationals who \nbring the heroin to New Mexico through the crime corridor between the \nsouthwest border and Rio Arriba County.\n  Because a crime corridor exists in New Mexico, with the help of \nSenator Gregg, the Committee also included $5 million in this year's \nCommerce, State, Justice appropriations bill for a pilot project \nthrough the United States Attorney's office in New Mexico.\n  Much of the heroin brought into northern New Mexico comes up \nInterstate 10 from Mexico between Las Cruces and Albuquerque. This \npilot project will allow the U.S. Attorney to undertake federal \nprosecutions of illegal immigration and drug trafficking along that \ncorridor. It is patterned after a similar successful initiative, called \nProject Exile, which significantly reduced illegal gun smuggling and \nviolent crime in the corridor between Camden, New Jersey and \nPhiladelphia.\n  Solving this problem will take more than just increased law \nenforcement. It also is critically important that we give children \nhealthy and safe alternatives to drugs and crime.\n  With Chairman Gregg's help, the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nprovided $750,000 for an after-school program in Rio Arriba, and \nincreased funding for the Boys' and Girls' Clubs nationwide. Northern \nNew Mexico has long faced a true shortage of worthwhile crime and drug \nabuse prevention programs, particularly for children.\n  We need to provide kids with constructive outlets for their time and \nenergy, so they do not become the next generation of addicts. I think \nthat our efforts here recently are going to change that for the better.\n  Finally, let me talk a little bit about treatment, because that is \nthe most difficult problem the county faces. Currently, there are 66 \ntreatment beds in Rio Arriba County. Yet, all but six of them are \nreserved for alcoholics. There is no in-patient treatment for heroin \naddicted kids and no detox facility in Rio Arriba. So the county has a \nlong way to go in dealing with the special health care needs of heroin \naddicts.\n  To assist with the efforts, I have requested $2 million from the \nbudget of\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nthe Department of Health and Human Services to help expand drug \ntreatment and prevention services in the county. Also, the state of New \nMexico has provided $500,000 for increased drug treatment in the area.\n  Successful treatment programs require more than a one-time infusion \nof federal or state funds. Communities, state and local governments and \ntreatment providers must work together to keep them viable and \noperational once facilities are established. Federal dollars can help, \nbut the bulk of the effort must come at the state and local level.\n  A big part of what the technical assistance team I have sent to Rio \nArriba County is doing is figuring out how to coordinate federal, state \nand local treatment resources, and how to make these treatment options \navailable for many years to come. This is a critical component in the \nstrategy we have begun to develop.\n  As I see it, the federal response to the drug problem in Rio Arriba \nCounty has been swift and comprehensive. We have done much more in a \nshort amount of time than simply throw money at the problem. We have \nbegun to build upon the three main components of any successful anti-\ndrug strategy: law enforcement, treatment and prevention, and the \nDepartment of Justice and other federal agencies have begun the process \nof working with the local community to improve in all three areas in \nRio Arriba County.\n  It is my hope that in a few years, after our efforts and ideas have \nbeen implemented, we will look to northern New Mexico as an example of \nhow small rural communities can overcome big drug problems. We have a \nlong way to go, but I look forward to continuing my efforts to defeat \nthe heroin problem in Rio Arriba County and help this proud community \nget it back on its feet.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7019-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAIWAN'S HUMANITARIAN AID TO KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the important \ncontribution Taiwan has made to the international effort to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to the refugees of Kosovo. Taiwan recently \nannounced that it will grant $300 million in an aid package to the \nKosovars. The aid package will include emergency support for food, \nshelters, medical care, and education for Kosovar refugees who were \ndriven from their homes and forced to live in exile. In addition, I am \npleased that Taiwan has offered short-term accommodations for Kosovar \nrefugees in Taiwan along with technical training in Taiwan to help the \nrefugees be better equipped for the restoration of their homeland upon \ntheir return.\n  Slobadan Milosevic initiated a brutal and calculated effort to rid \nKosovo of ethnic Albanians and fracture Europe. The United States and \nits NATO allies moved quickly and decisively to stop the massacres of \ninnocent women and children inside Kosovo, and the international \ncommunity joined the effort to provide relief to the hundreds of \nthousands of refugees who fled homes burned by Yugoslav police.\n  Over two months of NATO bombings resulted in the withdrawal of all \nYugoslav military and police from Kosovo and Milosevic's acceptance of \na NATO-led peacekeeping force to secure Kosovo for the refugees return. \nThe rebuilding and recovery efforts that are now beginning in Kosovo \nwill take many years and many resources. Taiwan has contributed \nsignificant financial and technical resources to this effort. However, \nmore importantly, Taiwan's generous actions should give comfort to the \npeople of Kosovo that the world's leaders will help them through this \ndifficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7019-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHALLENGE OF THE BALKANS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we have learned repeatedly over the \nlast three months, few things seem to go as planned in the Balkans. In \nfact, I think the warning ``expect the unexpected'' is quickly becoming \nthe first rule of statecraft in the post-cold-war world.\n  The provocative and disturbing occupation of the airport in Pristina \nby 200 Russian paratroopers has surely complicated our peacekeeping \nmission in Kosovo. Even more importantly, it exemplifies the huge \nchallenge confronting us as we seek to build a relationship with a \nformer superpower adversary that works to out mutual benefit and that \nof the world's.\n  I do not know if this action is evidence of a growing breach between \nRussia's political and military leadership or if Russia's political \nleaders sanctioned it. I don't pretend to be a scholar of Russian \npolitics. I do know, however, that Russia's continued refusal to accept \nNATO's command over the entire peacekeeping effort in Kosovo, whether \nthe Russian government or some independent-minded Russian generals \nissue that refusal, challenges the viability of the fragile peace we \nare committing 50,000 NATO troops to enforce. It is a challenge we must \novercome immediately, with steady nerve and firm resolve.\n  Even though, NATO obviously has the power and authority to work its \nwill in Pristina, overcoming the challenge should not require us to \nforcibly evict the Russians from the airport. But neither does it \nrequire us to pretend that the challenge is so insignificant that it \ndoesn't merit our notice. It is a problem, although not yet a disaster, \nand it requires our swift and sure-footed response to resolve it as \nquickly as possible.\n  We must take the necessary steps to prevent the reinforcement of \nthose troops. But, more importantly, we must make abundantly clear to \nMoscow that we consider this action to be evidence that Russia cannot \nyet be trusted as good faith partners in preserving European stability. \nIt even casts doubt on their efforts to convince Mr. Milosevic to \naccept NATO's terms for a settlement, raising the suspicion that there \nwere hidden commitments to secure a de facto partition of Kosovo.\n  Until those suspicions can be allayed--which would require, of \ncourse, Russian troops to accede to NATO's authority at the airport--\nprogress in constructing a new and mutually beneficial relationship \nbetween the United States and its allies and Russia will suffer. The \ncoming G-7 meeting in Germany, which was intended to consider efforts \nto assist the collapsed Russian economy, must now result in a clear, \nunequivocal statement that no such assistance will be forthcoming while \nRussian leaders either tolerate or are unable to stop attempts by their \nforces to undermine our efforts in Kosovo.\n  Moreover, we should exact some specific and public assurance from the \nputative leader of Russia, Boris Yeltsin--since the word of his \nministers is no longer credible--that Russia will play either a \nconstructive role or no further role in Kosovo. A constructive role \nwill entail, of course, Russia's acquiescence in the unified NATO \ncommand of the entire operation.\n  There must be no Russian sector in Kosovo even if we select some \nother euphemism to describe it because most Kosovars believe, quite \nunderstandably, it is a pseudonym for the partition of Kosovo. Few if \nany ethnic Albanians will return unarmed to an area where their \nsecurity is the responsibility of troops whose loyalties were \ndemonstratively pledged to the Serb persecutors.\n  The United States recognizes the importance of achieving stable, \nmutually beneficial relations with Russia. We expect Russia to \nrecognize that its best interests lie in friendship with NATO and not \nin old hostilities that stretch back to the cold war and beyond. The \nRussian military should be capable of recognizing that its interests \nare best served by better relations as well. An army that cannot \nadequately feed and fuel itself, or that is unable to offer a minimum \nstandard of life to its soldiers should see the error in nursing old \nenmities at the expense of progress toward the common goal of a more \nsecure world.\n  The United States expects nothing more of Russia than that it acts in \nits own best interests, for its best interests are compatible with the \ncause for peace and justice in Kosovo, and everywhere else for that \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7019-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7019-S7020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE SOCIAL SECURITY LOCK BOX\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Social Security ``lock box.'' This legislation is vital to the \nfuture of the Social Security program. I commend my colleagues, \nSenators Domenici, Abraham, and Ashcroft on their leadership and \ndedication to the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution which establishes \ngoals\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nfor the next ten years by setting aside projected Social Security \nsurpluses of $1.8 trillion.\n  The unified budget system created during President Lyndon Johnson's \nadministration allows the government to account for non-Social Security \nprograms using Social Security funds. For years it masked the size of \nthe federal deficit. When it comes to Social Security, this accounting \nmethod has fanned unfavorable public sentiment. According to a survey \nconducted by the National Public Radio, the Kaiser Foundation, and the \nKennedy School of Government, Americans believe that the Social \nSecurity trust fund is somehow being misused. Asked why the system is \nin trouble, more people (65%) selected ``money in the Social Security \ntrust fund is being spent on programs other than Social Security'' than \nany other reason. It's time to change the system. The lock box \nlegislation would help restore the public's trust in the system and \nensure Congress and the President don't squander the surpluses \naccumulating in the Social Security trust fund.\n  The surplus could be very tempting to the President and Congress to \nspend. The Social Security ``lock box'' would institute a 60-vote \nbudget point of order in the Senate which would limit Congress's \nability to pass a budget resolution which uses a portion of the Social \nSecurity trust fund for non-Social Security purposes. In addition, this \nlegislation would institute a limit on the debt held by the public.\n  Passing this legislation demonstrates Congress's ability and \ndiscipline to save money. Taxpayers and beneficiaries believe \n``reform'' will translate into higher taxes and lower benefits. One way \nto quell public concern is by starting out on the right foot. We can \nprotect the Social Security trust fund from being drained for non-\nSocial Security purposes. As Members of Congress, we owe this to the \nfuture generations of America. As Senators, we should understand the \ndynamics of saving the Social Security trust funds because we all have \nconstituents in our home states who have doubts about Social Security \nmoney being there for them when they retire. That is why this \nlegislation is so important: it will help restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in their government. Locking away the Social Security \ntrust fund is a key way to secure the public's peace of mind. Wage \nearners who contribute a sizable percentage of their paycheck every \nweek to the public retirement system have grown leery about the Federal \nGovernment using their Social Security taxes for other purposes.\n  President Clinton, pledged in his 1998 State of the Union Address, to \n``save every cent of the Social Security Surplus.'' Some Members of \nCongress including myself along with Senators Gregg, Breaux, and Kerrey \nhave put forth proposals to save Social Security. However, if Congress \nand the White House reach a Social Security stalemate this year, the \nlock box legislation offers a bonus economic benefit. It would ensure \nthe public debt is reduced. That's because the Social Security lock box \neffectively would limit the amount of public debt, which would prevent \nSocial Security revenue from being used for other programs.\n  Some have expressed concern that passing this legislation would \nstifle Congress's ability to address emergency situations such as \neconomic recession or war. Those situations were anticipated in the \ndevelopment of the lock box legislation. This bill would allow the \nflexibility necessary to address such situations by suspending the \npublic debt limit in specific instances such as recession or a \ndeclaration of war.\n  We are at a point in time where talk is cheap and execution is \neverything. At one time or another we all learned the steps of first \naid and the first step that is taken is to stop the bleeding. We need \nto stop the bleeding of the trust fund dollars from the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  I ask my colleagues to demonstrate the courage necessary to pass this \nbill and preserve the future of our great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7020-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7020-S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SECTION 201 DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today to discuss my grave concern \nregarding the Section 201 petition brought forward by America's \ndomestic lamb industry. This case has been sitting on President \nClinton's desk for more than 2 months. He has had more than ample time \nto make a decision. Furthermore, the decision was slated for June 5. \nFor 10 days, America's sheep producers have been waiting, wondering \nwhat is going to happen to their livelihood.\n  On February 9, 1999, the International Trade Commission voted \nunanimously that lamb imports are a threat to our industry. On March \n26, the sheep industry scored another victory with the decision by the \nInternational Trade Commission to support 4 years of market stability. \nSeveral remedies have been offered, including tariff rate quotas and \nad-valorem tariffs. Now a decision by President Clinton to approve, \ndeny, or modify those remedies has been expected since June 5.\n  This administration has virtually ignored the request by America's \nsheep producers to solve the issue of excessive imports. While these \nproducers are suffering, the President continues to deal with any and \nall other issues but this important agriculture case. While I \nunderstand that Kosovo and other world issues require much time and \nconsideration, domestic policy cannot stand still during international \nsituations.\n  The agricultural producers of this country that provide food and \nfiber for the rest of the Nation, warrant more time and attention than \nthis administration has paid them. I feel as though the crisis facing \nthe sheep producers of this country is receiving about the same \nconsideration from this administration as agriculture received 5 months \nago in the State of the Union Address. Agriculture received a mere \nthirty seconds during that address and is receiving even less time in \nthis important case.\n  The domestic lamb industry has every reason to believe their market \nhas been substantially undercut by these countries. Imports now make up \nnearly one-third of the domestic market, and comparisons of imported \nand domestic lamb meat have found that imports undercut domestic \nproducts nearly 80 percent of the time. Between 1993 and 1997 imports \nincreased 47 percent. The problems of imports are very real and have \nhad a substantial impact on sheep producers.\n  Furthermore, the domestic industry has followed the legal process for \ntrade action that is available to all industries under our trade \nagreements. The unanimous ruling of the ITC during the injury phase of \nthis 201 case, followed by the entire Commission's recommendation to \nimpose trade relief, clearly shows U.S. sheep producers have a viable \ncase.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in urging the president to \nmake an extremely timely decision in support of the section 201 \npetition and the recommendations made by the domestic sheep industry \nfor strong and effective trade relief.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the time has come. Our friends with \ndisabilities have waited patiently. Our bipartisan coalition has \nremained united. The last obstacles have been resolved. Assurances have \nbeen given. I am referring to our pending consideration of the landmark \nlegislation, S.331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative \npriorities was to provide access to the American dream for individuals \nwith disabilities. It was not an easy task. I learned quickly that \nproviding access for Americans with disabilities was complicated.\n  It involved providing access to education, it involved removing \nphysical barriers, and it involved ensuring access to rehabilitation, \njob training, and job placement assistance.\n  It required obtaining access to assistive technology and health care. \nMost importantly, access to the American dream for people with \ndisabilities meant gaining the opportunity to choose and to participate \nin the full range of community activities. Moreover, it involved making \nsure that the Federal Government, along with other entities, be made to \ncomply with laws affecting access for people with disabilities. We have \nmade tremendous progress in the last 24 years.\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation \nAct, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Assistive Technology \nAct have changed, and will continue to change lives. Children with \ndisabilities are being educated with their peers. No agency or \nindividual, including the Federal Government, can discriminate against \nindividuals on the basis of disability in employment, transportation, \npublic accommodations, public services, or telecommunications.\n  Job training and placement opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities are ever expanding because of the reforms we achieved in \nthe Work Force Investment Act of 1998 and because of low unemployment \nrates. I am proud of these accomplishments.\n  Today we will address the biggest remaining barrier to the American \ndream for individuals with disabilities--access to health care if they \nwork.\n  I began work on the Work Incentives Improvement Act more than 2 years \nago. Since then, I have learned a great deal. I suspect the same holds \ntrue for the 77 other co-sponsors of this bill. People with \ndisabilities want to work, and will work, if they are given access to \nhealth care. This bill does just that--it gives workers with \ndisabilities access to appropriate health care--health care that is not \nreadily available or affordable from the private sector.\n  People with disabilities want to work, and will work, given access to \njob training and job placement assistance. This bill does just that--it \ngives individuals with disabilities training and help securing a job.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act gives people with disabilities \nthe power to control their own destiny, the power to pay taxes and \nreturn the investment that society has made in them, and most of all \nthe power to go to work.\n  First, I must thank my bipartisan co-sponsors Senators Kennedy, Roth, \nand Moynihan the original co-sponsors of this bill who made a \ncommitment many months ago to work together to create a sound piece of \nlegislation to address this real problem for millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. Such commitment represents the best of what the Senate \ncan accomplish when sound policy is placed above partisanship.\n  I also thank the additional, original 35 co-sponsors of this bill and \nthe subsequent 45 co-sponsors who represent a total of over three \nquarters of this body, perhaps a Senate record on health care \nlegislation.\n  Over the last two weeks, the Majority Leader has been the driving \nforce who urged us to work out policy differences that were delaying \nFloor consideration. We did so through good faith efforts that \nbroadened support for the bill and reduced its overall modest cost.\n  In particular, I want to recognize Senators Nickles, Bunning, and \nGramm for their willingness to reach consensus with us on policy \nwithout compromising the integrity of the legislation, thus, allowing \nS. 331 to move forward.\n  I especially thank the over two hundred national organizations that \noffered time, energy, and ideas to create and support a bill that will \nimprove the quality of life for millions of Americans with disabilities \nwho want to work.\n  One at a time, we each have come to understand the importance of \nhealth care and a job to individuals with disabilities. Sometimes the \npower of common sense and the voices of reason transcend politics and \nhelp us to forge new policy that will make America a better place for \nall of its citizens. The Work Incentives Improvement Act is the right \npolicy at the right time, and we all know it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  This historic initiative, which Republicans have been working on for \nmany years now, has strong bipartisan support and will help tear down \nthe barriers that prevent disabled Americans who want to work from \nreaching their full potential and achieving economic independence.\n  Approximately 8 million American adults receive more than $73 billion \na year in cash benefits under the Supplemental Security Income and the \nSocial Security Disability programs, making these disability programs \nthe fourth largest entitlement expenditure in the Federal budget. In \nMaine, there are close to 55,000 people receiving more than $335 \nmillion each year in cash disability benefits under these two programs. \nIf only 1 percent, or 75,000, of these disabled Americans were to enter \nthe workplace, Federal savings in cash benefits would total $3.5 \nbillion over the worklife of these individuals.\n  While surveys show that the overwhelming majority of adults with \ndisabilities want to work, fewer than one half of 1 percent of them \nactually do. The reason is very simple: The current law contains \ndisincentives that prevent these people with disabilities from going \ninto the workforce. I know that the Presiding Officer has been working \non this issue for several years and shares our concern.\n  Removing the barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities from \nworking will not only assist these individuals in their pursuit of \nself-sufficiency, but it will also contribute to preserving the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Advances in medicine and technology, coupled with civil rights laws, \nhave made it possible for more and more people with physical and mental \ndisabilities to enter the workforce. These are people who genuinely \nwant to work. They have the skills and the talents necessary to \ncontribute greatly to the American economy, but they currently face a \nCatch-22. If they leave the disability rolls for a job, they risk \nlosing essential Medicare and Medicaid benefits that made it possible \nfor them to overcome the obstacles that prevented them from entering or \nreentering the workforce in the first place. Moreover, many of these \nindividuals' lives depend on the prescription drugs, the technology, \nthe personal assistant services and the medical care that they receive.\n  Let me put a human face on this problem which is facing too many \nAmericans with disabilities. In Bangor, ME, I know a young man in his \n20s who unfortunately suffers from a severe mental illness. The good \nnews is that if he takes his medicine, which is very expensive and is \nnow covered by Medicaid, he can hold down a part-time job. He very much \nenjoys working. He enjoys the skills he is learning. He enjoys the \ncompanionship. He enjoys the sense of pride he feels when he works. \nUnfortunately, if he goes to work, he loses the very Medicaid coverage \nthat provides the essential prescription drug that he needs to enable \nhim to work. He should not face that kind of dilemma.\n  The truth is that no one should have to make the choice between a job \nand essential health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 \nwill create and fund new options for States, to encourage them to allow \npeople with disabilities who enter into the workforce to buy into the \nMedicare program and the Medicaid program so that they can continue to \nreceive the essential prescription drugs they need which enable them to \nwork, and the personal assistant services and the medical care upon \nwhich they depend. It will also allow workers who leave the Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance program to extend their Medicare coverage \nfor 10 years.\n\n  This is tremendously important since many people returning to work \nafter having been on SSDI either work part-time and, therefore, are not \neligible for most employer-based insurance, or they work in jobs that \nsimply do not offer health insurance. Allowing these disabled Americans \nto maintain their Medicare coverage, and to maintain their Medicaid \ncoverage in some cases, will serve as a tremendous incentive for them \nto return to or to enter the workforce.\n  Other provisions of this legislation incorporate a more user-friendly \napproach in programs, providing job training and placement assistance \nto individuals with disabilities who want to and are able to work.\n  Our legislation gives disabled SSI and SSDI beneficiaries greater \nconsumer choice by creating essentially a ticket that enables them to \nchoose whether they want to go to a public or a private provider of \nvocational rehabilitation services. The bill also provides grants to \nStates and organizations to help connect people with disabilities with \nthe appropriate services, and it funds demonstration projects\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nand studies to better understand and identify the policies that will \nencourage and enable work.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is an investment in human potential \nthat promises tremendous returns. By ensuring that Americans with \ndisabilities have access to affordable health insurance, we are \nremoving a major barrier, a significant disincentive that too often \nkeeps them out of the workplace.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will both encourage and \nenable Americans with disabilities to be full participants in our \nNation's workforce and growing economy and, equally important, it will \nallow them to reach their full potential. It deserves our strong \nsupport and the President's signature. I am very proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999. I was an original cosponsor of the Work \nIncentives bill when we introduced it last year, and again this year, \nand was at the White House when the President endorsed the bill.\n  Almost nine years ago, the Americans With Disabilities Act became \nlaw. On that day, we told Americans with disabilities that the door to \nequal opportunity was finally open.\n  And the ADA has opened the doors of opportunity--plenty of them. \nAmericans with disabilities now expect to be treated as full citizens, \nwith all the rights and responsibilities that entails. And they are \nparticipating in American life like never before in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  But we have not been as successful in employment. Far too many people \nwith disabilities who want to work are unemployed. More than eight \nmillion people between 18 and 64 are on SSI and SSDI--and less than \none-half of one percent of them return to work each year.\n  Clearly, there are barriers to be torn down.\n  Let me tell you the story of a young woman from Iowa named Phoebe \nBall. Phoebe just graduated from the University of Iowa and she was \nshocked when she found that if she took an entry level job paying \n$18,000, she would suffer a huge loss--her health insurance.\n  Phoebe wrote an article for an Iowa City newspaper. Here is what she \nsaid:\n\n       I want off SSI desperately . . . I want to work. I want to \n     know that I have earned the money I have . . . I don't feel \n     good about the money the government sends me each month. I \n     don't feel entitled to it because I know what I am capable \n     of.\n       My parents and my society made a promise to me. They \n     promised me that I can live with this disability, and I can. \n     . . . What is limiting me right now is not this wheelchair, \n     and it's not this limb that's missing. It's a system that \n     says if I can work at all, then I'm undeserving of any \n     assistance, I'm undeserving of the basic medical care that I \n     need to stay alive.\n       . . . What is needed is a government that understands its \n     responsibility to its citizens . . . then we'll see what we \n     are capable of, then we will be working and proving the worth \n     of the ADA.\n\n  Mr. President, the Work Incentives Improvement Act is a well-crafted, \ncomprehensive bill that would be the answer to Phoebe Ball's dilemma.\n  It provides health care and employment preparation and placement \nservices to individuals to reduce dependency on cash assistance;\n  It creates new options for States to allow people with disabilities \nto purchase Medicaid coverage;\n  It lengthens the current period of extended eligibility for Medicare \ncoverage for working disabled individuals; and\n  It establishes a return to work ``ticket'' program that will allow \npeople with disabilities to secure the best possible services they can \nfind to get and keep jobs.\n  If only 1 percent--or 75,000--of the 7.5 million people with \ndisabilities, like Phoebe, who are now on benefits were to become \nemployed, Federal savings would total $3.5 billion over the work life \nof the beneficiaries. That not only makes economic sense, it also \ncontributes to preserving the Social Security Trust fund.\n  Mr. President, the disability community and members from both sides \nof the aisle here in the Senate have wholeheartedly endorsed this bill. \nThe Work Incentives Improvement Act has 78 cosponsors. 78! Rarely do we \nsee in this chamber such broad bipartisan support.\n  The Work Incentives Act will open the door to full participation by \npeople with disabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our \nAmerican Dream, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 331, the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  This is the most far-reaching Social Security disability bill to come \nbefore the Senate in a generation, and it's going to give thousands of \nmen and women who are trapped in the disability program the tools they \nneed to return to work.\n  While it's not a perfect bill, it's still a significant step forward.\n  Right now there are over 4\\1/2\\ million Americans on disability. Four \nand a half million, Mr. President. And of this group, less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent will return to work.\n  Many of these folks have permanent conditions and need assistance. \nBut, many of these people want to return to work, and can return to \nwork. For them, the disability program has become a black hole that \nswallows everyone who falls in. With proper training and \nrehabilitation, many of these people could work. But the disability \nsystem is not working for them.\n  Because of problems with the current program, they face too many \nhurdles, too many disincentives, in trying to return to the workforce. \nThat is a tragedy.\n  Some of us have been fighting for a long time to improve the Social \nSecurity Disability Program. When I chaired the House Social Security \nsubcommittee, we held numerous hearings on disability.\n  And we learned there are indeed many, many disabled who want to \nreturn to work, and can work. But they're afraid to try. They're afraid \nto try because returning to work often means losing their health care \ncoverage.\n  Many other disabled workers could return to their jobs if they had \nthe proper training. But because of backlogs and problems in the \ncurrent vocational rehabilitation system, they have not been able to \nget the assistance they need.\n  The bill before us today will change things for the better. It \nremoves barriers that discourage the disabled from returning to work. \nIt helps harness the power of the private sector and competition to \nhelp provide training for the disabled. And it extends basic health \ncare coverage to help them make the difficult transition back to work.\n  It represents a fundamental, revolutionary change for the disabled \ncommunity.\n  As an added benefit, this legislation will have money for Social \nSecurity--big money. For every 1% of the total number of disabled who \nreturn to work, we save $3 billion for Social Security. The legislation \nbefore the Senate today has the potential to literally save billions \nand billions for Social Security.\n  Mr. President, last year, the House did pass my disability bill by a \nvote of 410-1. Unfortunately, the bill was tied up in the Senate by \nsome shenanigans and it died. That was a tremendous disappointment to \nme, and to be honest, I didn't think we would be back to talking about \na disability bill in the Senate for a long, long time.\n  But we are back here today, and I am proud that the disability \nprovisions in the bill before us largely borrows from my old \nlegislation. The bill's sponsors did make some further changes to their \nbill at my request that I think improves it, and I appreciate that.\n  But we still have a way to go. And there are several conditions that \nhave to be met for me to support any conference report.\n  The bill has to be fully paid for with other spending reductions. \nUnder the unanimous consent agreement, the conference report has to be \nfully offset, and contain no new taxes. I intend to stick by that \nagreement.\n  I also want to see changes that the sponsors negotiated with me on \nthe ticket maintained in the final conference report. I appreciate \ntheir working with me, and I think our efforts have produced a better \nbill. We shouldn't move backward in the conference report.\n  This is a good bill, but it is not perfect. And we still have to hear \nfrom the House. But we are making progress. I'm eager to move forward.\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\n  I urge support for the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7023-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7023-S7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am aware that an amendment or amendments \nrelating to dairy policy may be offered during full committee mark-up \non the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Related agencies. I serve as ranking member for the \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee and I \nam proud of the work I have done with Senator Cochran, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, in preparing the bill for fiscal year 2000 and having it \napproved unanimously by the entire Subcommittee. I am, therefore, very \ndistressed to learn of possible amendments that are authorizing in \nnature, and that would result in setting dairy policy with disastrous \nconsequences for my State and region.\n  Due to my very strong commitment to keep the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriations bill clean of amendments of the nature suggested, I am \nprepared to take whatever steps possible to prevent inclusion of these \namendments during consideration of the bill by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. I strongly believe that the issues \nsurrounding these amendments are of such an important nature that \ndeliberation by the full Senate is imperative. If proponents of these \namendments wish to bring them to the floor to offer and debate them, I \nwelcome the opportunity for the discussion. However, I will do all I \ncan to ensure that these matters are not decided by the smaller number \nof Senators that comprise the Appropriations Committee.\n  In the event an amendment or amendments relating to dairy policy, \nsuch as one establishing or extending interstate compacts, are offered \nfor adoption by the full Appropriations Committee, I am prepared to \noffer, and will offer, a number of second degree amendments to \neliminate the harmful policy that amendment proponents apparently seek \nto impose on farmers and consumers. Also, in an attempt to keep this \nsort of anti-consumer, anti-farmer amendment from ending up on the \nbill, I am prepared to offer, either as first or second degree \namendments, a number of other amendments--some related to the bill and \nsome not. If the committee chooses to enter into controversial debates \nthat belong in authorizing committees, I too have several non-\nAppropriations issues that I would like considered.\n  I do not relish holding up the work of my Committee, and I will not \nif these sort of dairy amendments are not offered. But I feel it is \nonly fair to my fellow Committee members and to the Senate to let them \nknow how very seriously I take attempts to harm the dairy industry in \nthe State of Wisconsin.\n  The amendments I may offer that are relevant to the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, include, but are not limited to:\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the President's Food \nSafety Initiative.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the WIC program.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the President's Human \nNutrition Initiative.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the Conservation Farm \nOption Program.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the TEFAP program.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds relating to the Food Quality \nProtection Act.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the National Research \nInitiative.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the NET program.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the EQIP program.\n  An amendment to provide additional funds for the Fund for Rural \nAmerica.\n  An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on the history of \ndairy policy.\n  An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on diary compacts and \ntheir harmful effects on consumers.\n  An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on dairy compacts and \ntheir fundamental conflict with the principles of free trade.\n  An amendment to express the sense of the Senate on dairy compacts and \ntheir harmful effect on the Midwestern dairy industry.\n  An amendment to express a sense of the Senate on the economic policy \nproblems with dairy compacts.\n  In addition to these, I have at least 40 other amendments funding \nchanges to the bill that will require votes by the full Committee.\n  I also have many amendments not relevant to the bill and more in the \nnature of authorizing legislation. However, as I said before, if the \nCommittee is going to consider dairy legislation of an authorizing \nnature--legislation with a very real impact on my State--I would insist \non also considering other authorizing issues of importance to my \nconstituents. These would include:\n  The Patient Abuse Prevention Act: This amendment is based on my bill \nthat establishes a national registry of abusive long-term care workers, \nand requires nursing homes, home health agencies and hospices to check \nthe registry and do criminal background checks on potential employees \nbefore hiring them.\n  Folic Acid Promotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act: This amendment \nis based on a bill I will be introducing with Bond and Abraham next \nweek. It would authorize $20 million per year to provide education and \ntraining to health care providers and the public on the need for women \nto take folic acid to reduce birth defects.\n  Sense of the Senate on the nursing home bill: This amendment is based \non an amendment that passed two years ago on the Budget Resolution. It \nis a Sense of the Senate that Congress should create a national \nregistry system so long-term care facilities may conduct background \nchecks on potential employees.\n  Organ distribution amendment: This amendment would nullify the HHS \nproposed rule that changes the way organs are distributed across the \nnation.\n\n  Class size fix: This would amend the Class Size Reduction program to \nensure that smaller school districts have access to their class size \nfunds without having to form a consortium with other districts.\n  National Family Caregiver Support program: This would provide support \nservices, including respite services, to persons caring for a disabled \nor elderly relative.\n  Sodas in Schools: This is based on a bill introduced by Leahy, \nJeffords, Kohl, and Feingold last month) This would prohibit the \ngiveaways of free sodas during the school lunch program.\n  The Child Care Infrastructure Act: This amendment would establish a \ntax credit for employers who provided child care benefit to their \nemployees.\n  Child Support Pass Through: This amendment would reform the child \nsupport collection system to provide more income support for low-income \nfamilies.\n  Income Averaging for Farmers: This, and another amendment creating \nFarmer IRAs would establish more fairness for farmers.\n  Several foreign policy Sense of the Senates including: A sense of the \nSenate resolution calling for a United States effort to end \nrestrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people in \nthe occupied area of Cyprus; a sense of the Senate resolution \ncondemning Palestinian efforts to revive the original Palestine \npartition plan of November 29, 1947, and condemning the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights for its April 27, 1999, resolution endorsing \nPalestinian self-determination on the basis of the original Palestine \npartition plan; a sense of the Senate regarding a peaceful process of \nself-determination in East Timor, and for other purposes.\n  Apostle Islands: An amendment to direct the Secretary of the Interior \nto study whether the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore should be \nprotected as a wilderness area.\n  Zachary Baumel: An amendment to locate and secure the return of \nZachary Baumel, a citizen of the United States, and other Israeli \nsoldiers missing in action.\n  Women's Business center: A bill to amend the Small Business Act with \nrespect to the women's business center program.\n  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: A bill to designate a portion of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness.\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n  Military Reservists: An amendment to authorize the Small Business \nAdministration to provide financial and business development assistance \nto military reservists' small business, and for other purposes.\n  Menominee: An amendment to provide for the settlement of claims of \nthe Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7024-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7024-S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               33RD ANNIVERSARY OF MIRANDA VERSUS ARIZONA\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 33 years ago this week, the Supreme \nCourt issued possibly its most famous and far-reaching criminal law \ndecision of the twentieth century: Miranda v. Arizona. In response, the \nCongress enacted a law, codified at 18 U.S.C. section 3501, to govern \nthe admissibility of voluntary confessions in Federal court. The \nCriminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee, which I chair, recently held a \nhearing to discuss the Clinton Justice Department's refusal to use this \nFederal statute to help Federal prosecutors in their work to fight \ncrime.\n  Issued in 1966, the Miranda decision imposed a code-like set of \ninterrogation rules on police officers. Essentially, the Court held \nthat before a confession can be admitted against a defendant, \nregardless of whether the confession was voluntary, the police must \nread the defendant the now familiar Miranda warnings, and the defendant \nmust affirmatively waive his rights. We will never know how many crimes \nhave gone unsolved or unpunished because of Miranda.\n  The Miranda decision acknowledged that the warnings were not \nthemselves constitutionally protected rights but only procedural \nsafeguards designed to protect the Fifth Amendment right against self-\nincrimination. Subsequent Supreme Court opinions have repeatedly \nreaffirmed this conclusion. Further, the Miranda court expressly \ninvited Congress and the States to develop legislative solutions to the \nproblem of involuntary confessions.\n  In response to the Court's invitation, the Congress held extensive \nhearings on this issue as part of Federal criminal law reform. A \nbipartisan Congress with my participation and that of many others on \nboth sides of the aisle in 1968 passed an omnibus crime bill that \nincluded a provision that eventually became law as section 3501. That \nstatute, of which I was an original co-sponsor, provides that ``In any \ncriminal prosecution brought by the United States . . . a confession . \n. . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.'' The \nstatute goes on to list five nonexclusive factors that a judge may \nconsider in determining whether a confession is voluntary and, hence, \nadmissible. One of those factors is whether the Miranda warnings were \ngiven. Thus, the statute continues to provide police with an incentive \nto deliver the Miranda warnings.\n  More than thirty years after the original hearings on Sec.  3501, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice \nOversight, under my leadership, conducted a hearing to examine the \nstatute's enforcement.\n  The history of the statute begins with the Johnson Administration. \nAlthough President Johnson signed Sec.  3501 into law, his \nadministration viewed the statute unfavorably and refused to enforce \nit. Then, in 1969, the Nixon Justice Department issued an important \nmemorandum setting forth the Department's official policy toward \nsection 3501. According to that policy, ``Congress has reasonably \ndirected that an inflexible exclusionary rule be applied only where the \nconstitutional privilege itself has been violated.'' The memorandum \nalso concluded that ``the determination of Congress that an inflexible \nexclusionary rule is unnecessary is within its constitutional power.''\n  In 1975, the Department succeeded in enforcing the statute when the \n10th Circuit in United States v. Crocker affirmed a district court's \ndecision to apply Sec.  3501 rather than Miranda and upheld the \nconstitutionality of the statute.\n  The next significant chapter in the history of Sec.  3501 occurred \nduring the Reagan Administration. Judge Stephen Markman, who was then \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Office \nof Legal Policy, also testified before our Subcommittee. In response to \nan assignment from Attorney General Meese, Judge Markman's team issued \na comprehensive report on the law of pre-trial interrogation that \nconcluded that section 3501 represented a valid, constitutional \nresponse by the Congress to the Miranda decision. Later, as Judge \nMarkman testified, the Reagan Justice Department continued the \nlitigation effort to apply section 3501.\n  Judge Markman also testified that while he was U.S. Attorney in the \nBush Administration, he and other U.S. Attorneys attempted to apply the \nstatute, although appellate cases did not develop. Certainly, the Bush \nJustice Department never sought to undermine the statute's enforcement.\n  During the Clinton Administration, this Committee repeatedly has \nencouraged the Justice Department to enforce the statute. During an \noversight hearing in 1997, Attorney General Reno indicated to the \nCommittee that the Department would enforce it in an appropriate case, \nas did Deputy Attorney General Holder during his nomination hearing the \nsame year. However, when such a case clearly arose in United States v. \nDickerson, the Administration refused.\n  In that case, Charles Dickerson was suspected of committing a series \nof armed bank robberies in Virginia and Maryland. During questioning, \nhe voluntarily confessed his crimes to the authorities and implicated \nanother armed bank robber, but the Miranda warnings were not read to \nhim beforehand. The U.S. Attorney's office in Alexandria urged the \ntrial court to admit the confession under section 3501, but the Justice \nDepartment refused to permit the U.S. Attorney to raise it on appeal. \nIt was only the intervention of third parties in an amicus brief of \nProfessor Cassell and the Washington Legal Foundation, that the issue \nwas presented to the Fourth Circuit for its consideration.\n  The Fourth Circuit ruled solidly in favor of Sec.  3501's \nconstitutionality, holding that this statute, not the Miranda decision, \ngoverns the admissibility of confessions in Federal court. The court \ncriticized the Justice Department for its failure to enforce the \nstatute, saying that the Department's prohibition of the U.S. Attorney \nfrom arguing section 3501 was an elevation of politics over law.\n  The administration's actions in the Dickerson case are part of a \nlarger pattern by which the Clinton Justice Department has blocked \nopportunities for career prosecutors to raise section 3501. The \nDepartment has even gone so far as to order career Federal prosecutors \nto withdraw already filed briefs that contained arguments in favor of \nsection 3501. The Supreme Court in Davis v. United States expressly \nmade note of the Justice Department's decision not to rely on the \nstatute in a 1994 case where it was clearly relevant. In a concurring \nopinion in that same case, Justice Scalia wrote that ``[t]he United \nStates' repeated refusal to invoke Sec.  3501 . . . may have produced--\nduring an era of intense national concern about the problem of run-away \ncrime--the acquittal and the non-prosecution of many dangerous felons. \nThere is no excuse for this.''\n\n  The Executive Branch has a duty under Article II, Section 3, of the \nConstitution to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' \nSection 3501 is a law like any other. In Davis, Justice Scalia also \nquestioned whether the refusal to invoke the statute abrogated this \nduty.\n  Our hearing also demonstrated the strong level of support that exists \nfor the Justice Department to enforce section 3501, especially in the \nlaw enforcement community. I have received supportive letters in this \nregard from the Fraternal Order of Police, whose National President \ntestified at our hearing, as well as from the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, \nthe Major Cities Chiefs of Police, and others. Former Attorney General \nEd Meese also expressed his support for our efforts.\n  If section 3501 is upheld by the Supreme Court, this will encourage \nthe states to enact their own versions of the law in this area. Arizona \nalready has a statute almost identical to Sec.  3501, and the Maricopa \nCounty Attorney in Phoenix, whose predecessor prosecuted Miranda, \ntestified at our hearing that he and others could enforce their statute \nin Arizona if the Supreme Court upholds section 3501.\n  The Justice Department will not say what position it will take if the\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\nDickerson case is considered by the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, they \nrefused my invitation to testify at the hearing on section 3501. I \nrecognize the Department's reluctance to discuss specifics about \npending cases, but this is no excuse for its failure to discuss in \nperson its refusal to explain its general treatment of the law \ngoverning voluntary confessions. Even the dissenting judge in Dickerson \nrecognized that the Congress could invoke its oversight authority and \ninvestigate why the law is being ignored. As he stated, the ``Congress \n. . . may legitimately investigate why the executive has ignored Sec.  \n3501 and what the consequences are.''\n  In my view, the Administration clearly has a duty to defend Sec.  \n3501 before the Supreme Court and should be enforcing it in the lower \nFederal courts. The Justice Department has a long-standing policy that \nit has a duty to defend a duly enacted Act of Congress whenever a \nreasonable argument can be made in support of its constitutionality. \nThus far, all Federal courts that have directly considered Sec.  3501's \nconstitutionality have upheld it. Accordingly, reasonable arguments in \ndefense of the statute clearly exist and have been accepted by the \ncourts--most recently by the Fourth Circuit in Dickerson.\n  Indeed, before the Dickerson case, the Fourth Circuit in United \nStates v. Leong expressly rejected the Justice Department's argument \nthat it was not free to press Sec.  3501 in the lower Federal courts \nunless and until the Supreme Court overrules Miranda. In concluding \nthat the Government was ``mistaken'' in this regard, the Leong court \nstated that ``[t]he question of whether Miranda establishes a rule of \nconstitutional dimension, and thus whether Congress acted within its \nauthority in enacting Sec.  3501, is easily within the compass of the \nauthority of lower federal courts.''\n  Our subcommittee inquiry into section 3501 is ongoing. America does \nnot need its Justice Department making arguments on behalf of \ncriminals. On this the 33rd anniversary of Miranda v. Arizona, it is \nappropriate to note the Fourth Circuit's statement in Dickerson that \n``no longer will criminals who have voluntarily confessed their crimes \nbe released on mere technicalities.'' I hope the Clinton Justice \nDepartment will help make this promise a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7025-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The withdrawal received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7025-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 13, Public Law 806, 80th \nCongress (15 U.S.C. 714k), I transmit herewith the report of the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1997.\n                                                  William J.

Eighteen other central banks and monetary \nauthorities are guaranteeing portions of the BIS credit facility. In \naddition, through the Bank of Japan, the Government of Japan is \nproviding a swap facility of up to $1.25 billion to Brazil under terms \nconsistent with the terms of the BIS credit facility. Pursuant to the \nrequirements of 31 U.S.C. 5302(b), I am hereby notifying the Congress \nthat I have determined that unique or emergency circumstances require \nthe ESF financing to be available for more than 6 months.\n  The BIS credit facility is part of a multilateral effort to support \nan International Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by arrangement with Brazil \nthat itself totals approximately $18.1 billion, which is designed to \nhelp restore financial market confidence in Brazil and its currency, \nand to reestablish conditions for long-term sustainable growth. The IMF \nis providing this package through normal credit tranches and the \nSupplemental Reserve Facility (SRF), which provides short-term \nfinancing at significantly higher interest rates than those for credit \ntranche financing. Also, the World Bank and the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank are providing up to $9 billion in support of the \ninternational financial package for Brazil.\n  Since December 1998, international assistance from the IMF, the BIS \ncredit facility, and the Bank of Japan's swap facility has provided key \nsupport for Brazil's efforts to reform its economy and resolve its \nfinancial crisis. From the IMF arrangement, Brazil has purchased \napproximately $4.6 billion in December 1998 and approximately $4.9 \nbillion in April 1999. On December 18, 1998, the Banco Central made a \nfirst drawing of $4.15 billion from the BIS credit facility and also \ndrew $390 million from the Bank of Japan's swap facility. The Banco \nCentral made a second drawing of $4.5 billion from the BIS credit \nfacility and $423.5 million from the Bank of Japan's swap facility on \nApril 9, 1999. The ESF's ``guarantee'' share of each of these BIS \ncredit facility drawings is approximately 38 percent.\n  Each drawing from the BIS credit facility or the Bank of Japan's swap \nfacility matures in 6 months, with an option for additional 6-month \nrenewals. The Banco Central must therefore repay its first drawing from \nthe BIS and Bank of Japan facilities by June 18, 1999, unless the \nparties agree to the roll-over. The Banco Central has informed the BIS \nand the Bank of Japan that it plans to request, in early June, a roll-\nover of 70 percent of the first drawing from each facility, and will \nrepay 30 percent of the first drawing from each facility.\n  The BIS's agreement with the Banco Central contains conditions that \nminimize risks to the ESF. For example, the participating central banks \nor the BIS may accelerate repayment if the Banco Central has failed to \nmeet any conditions of the agreement or Brazil has failed to meet any \nmaterial obligation to the IMF. The Banco Central must repay the BIS no \nslower than, and at least in proportion to Brazil's repayments to the \nIMF's SRF and to the Bank of Japan's swap facility. The Government of \nBrazil is guaranteeing the performance of the Banco Central's \nobligations under its agreement with the BIS, and, pursuant to the \nagreement, Brazil must maintain its gross international reserves at a \nlevel no less than the sum of the principal amount outstanding under \nthe BIS facility, the principal amount outstanding under Japan's swap \nfacility, and a suitable margin. Also, the participating central banks \nand the BIS must approve any Banco Central request for a drawing or \nroll-over from the BIS credit facility.\n  Before the financial crisis that hit Brazil last fall, Brazil had \nmade remarkable progress toward reforming its economy, including \nreducing inflation from more than 2000 percent 5 years ago to less than \n3 percent in 1998,\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\nand successfully implementing an extensive privatization program. \nNonetheless, its large fiscal deficit left it vulnerable during the \nrecent period of global financial turbulence. Fiscal adjustment to \naddress that deficit therefore formed the core of the stand-by \narrangement that Brazil reached with the IMF last December.\n  Despite Brazil's initial success in implementing the fiscal reforms \nrequired by this stand-by arrangement, there were some setbacks in \npassing key legislation, and doubts emerged about the willingness of \nsome key Brazilian states to adjust their finances. Ultimately, the \ngovernment secured passage of virtually all the fiscal measures, or \nelse took offsetting actions. However, the initial setbacks and delays \neroded market confidence in December 1998 and January 1999, and \npressure on Brazil's foreign exchange reserves intensified. Rather than \nfurther deplete its reserves, Brazil in mid-January first devalued and \nthen floated its currency, the real, causing a steep decline of the \nreal's value against the dollar. As a consequence, Brazil needed to \nprevent a spiral of depreciation and inflation that could have led to \ndeep financial instability.\n  After the decision to float the real, and in close consultation with \nthe IMF, Brazil developed a revised economic program for 1999-2001, \nwhich included deeper fiscal adjustments and transparent and prudent \nmonetary policy designed to contain inflationary pressures. These \nadjustments will take some time to restore confidence fully. In the \nmeantime, the strong support of the international community has been \nand will continue to be helpful in reassuring the markets that Brazil \ncan restore sustainable financial stability.\n  Brazil's experience to date under its revised program with the IMF \nhas been very encouraging. The exchange rate has strengthened from its \nlows of early March and has been relatively stable in recent weeks; \ninflation is significantly lower than expected and declining; inflows \nof private capital are resuming; and most analysts now believe that the \neconomic downturn will be less severe than initially feared.\n  Brazil's success to date will make it possible for it to repay a 30 \npercent portion of its first (December) drawing from the BIS credit \nfacility and the Bank of Japan swap facility. With continued economic \nimprovement, Brazil is likely to be in a position to repay the \nremainder of its BIS and Bank of Japan obligations relatively soon. \nHowever, Brazil has indicated that it would be inadvisable to repay 100 \npercent of the first BIS and Bank of Japan disbursements at this point, \ngiven the persistence of risks and uncertainties in the global economy. \nThe timing of this repayment must take into account the risk that using \nBrazilian reserves to repay both first drawings in their entirety could \nharm market confidence in Brazil's financial condition. This could \nundermine the purpose of our support: protecting financial stability in \nBrazil and in other emerging markets, which ultimately benefits U.S. \nexports and jobs. Given that the BIS and Bank of Japan facilities \ncharge a substantial premium over the 6-month Eurodollar interest rate, \nthe Banco Central has an incentive to repay them as soon as is prudent.\n  The IMF stand-by arrangement and the BIS and Bank of Japan facilities \nconstitute a vital international response to Brazil's financial crisis, \nwhich threatens the economic welfare of Brazil's 160 million people and \nof other countries in the region and elsewhere in the world. Brazil's \nsize and importance as the largest economy in Latin America mean that \nits financial and economic stability are matters of national interest \nto the United States. Brazil's industrial output is the largest in \nLatin America; it accounts for 45 percent of the region's gross \ndomestic product, and its work force numbers approximately 85 million \npeople. A failure to help Brazil deal with its financial crisis would \nincrease the risk of financial instability in other Latin American \ncountries and other emerging market economies. Such instability could \ndamage U.S. exports, with serious repercussions for our workforce and \nour economy as a whole.\n  Therefore, the BIS credit facility is providing a crucial supplement \nto Brazil's IMF-supported program of economic and financial reform. I \nbelieve that strong and continued support from the United States, other \ngovernments, and multilateral institutions are crucial to enable Brazil \nto carry out its economic reform program. In these unique and emergency \ncircumstances, it is both appropriate and necessary to continue to make \nESF financing available as needed for more than 6 months to guarantee \nthis BIS credit facility, including any other rollover or drawing that \nmight be necessary in the future.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade \nadjustment assistance to farmers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the trade adjustment assistance for farmers act\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to make farmers eligible for \nTrade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) similar to that provided to workers \nin other industries who suffer when there is an increase in imported \nproducts. This bill would provide equitable treatment for farmers\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nwhen imports affect the prices of the commodities they grow.\n  When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, workers are \neligible for TAA. However, when imports cause agricultural commodity \nprices to drop, farmers lose income but they don't lose their jobs. \nThat means they generally don't get benefits from TAA. Let me explain \nwhy.\n  Farmers typically do not earn a salary check. Farmers get paid for \nthe crops or livestock that they grow. When commodity prices are low, \nthe check the farmers get for all the hard work of growing crops or \nlivestock for a whole year may be so low that they cannot cover family \nexpenses. In some cases, the payment they get for selling their crops \nor livestock is so low that they cannot even cover the costs necessary \nto produce the commodity (such as feed, seed, fertilizer, etc.), so the \nfarmers lose money for the year. Low prices resulting from imports \ndirectly reduce farmers' incomes, but because farmers do not actually \nlose their jobs, they do not qualify for the TAA benefit.\n  For example, farmers in my state are experiencing record low prices \nthat result, in part, from a flood of imports of wheat, barley and \nlivestock from Canada. These imports cost North Dakota farmers hundreds \nof millions of dollars in lost income. But North Dakota farmers have \nnot been able to take advantage of the TAA program. The bill that I am \nintroducing today would provide some equity by ensuring that farmers \nwhose income was affected by imports would be eligible for TAA benefits \njust like other workers.\n  Most of us would agree that trade is extremely important to our \noverall economy. International trade allows Americans to sell U.S.-made \nproducts to world markets, rather than just to those who live in this \ncountry. Trade also allows American to buy products that the rest of \nthe world produces. And trade is especially important to our \nagricultural economy. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \none-third of U.S. crop land produces for export.\n  U.S. agricultural exports are a bright spot for our nation's balance \nof trade. In 1999, the United States is expected to export $49 billion \nworth of goods, compared to agricultural imports this year of $37.5 \nbillion. Thus, agricultural exports contribute $11.5 billion to our \nbalance of trade with other nations.\n  Nonetheless, many farmers and other citizens feel that they can be \nhurt by free trade. When we import commodities that compete with what \nAmericans are producing, then some American producers--whether they are \nworkers, firms, or farmers--can be hurt by falling prices for the goods \nthey produce.\n  As a result, the lack of trade adjustment assistance for farmers has \nundercut support for trade among many family farmers.\n  By giving farmers some protection against precipitous income losses \nfrom imports, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers Act can help \nstrengthen support for trade agreements that expand agricultural export \nopportunities.\n  We need to be sure that we don't leave American farmers behind, and \nthat we treat farmers fairly in comparison with other American workers \nand industries. That's why I am introducing this bill, the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Farmers Act.\n  This bill would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade \nadjustment assistance to farmers by partially compensating them for \nincome lost due to the effect of imports. Here's how it will work.\n  Farmers would receive benefits that would be triggered when two \nconditions are met. First, the national average price for a specific \ncommodity for the previous marketing year must have dropped more than \n20 percent below the average price in the previous 5-year period. \nSecond, increased imports--or a high level of imports--must have \ncontributed importantly to the commodity price reduction.\n  A group of farmers who grow a particular commodity (or a commodity \ngroup representing them) would submit an application for trade \nadjustment assistance to the Labor Department. The Secretary of Labor \n(consulting with the Secretary of Agriculture) would determine whether \nthe two triggers had been met.\n  If the commodity is determined to be eligible, then individual \nproducers could apply for benefits. Farmers who are eligible for \nbenefits under the program would receive a cash assistance payment \nequal to half the difference between the national average price for the \nyear (as determined by USDA) and 80 percent of the average price in the \nprevious 5 years (the price trigger level), multiplied by the number of \nunits the farmers had produced. The maximum cash benefits available to \nfarmers under this program would be $10,000 per year.\n  Training and employment benefits that are available to workers under \nTAA would also be available, on an optional basis, to farmers who are \neligible for cash assistance benefits under the law. For example, a \nfarm family that was suffering from low prices due to increased imports \nmight consider retraining to learn skills in the high-tech computer \nindustry, which they could use in an at-home business to supplement \nfarm income.\n  In most years, this program would likely have a modest cost because \nvery few commodities, if any, would be eligible for assistance. \nHowever, in a year like the last we have just been through--when hog \nand wheat prices dropped precipitously--this program would be one tool \nto provide a modest amount of support to compensate farmers for the \nharmful effect of imports on their commodity prices and thus their \nincomes. Thus the bill would treat family farmers fairly, including \nthem in the protections available to others in our economy who are hurt \nby the increased trade that, in the aggregate, benefits us all.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nAmerican family farmers as they compete in the global market \nplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1223. A bill to provide for public library construction and \ntechnology enhancement; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n          andrew carnegie libraries for lifelong learning act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will prepare our nation's public libraries for the twenty-first \ncentury: the Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Lifelong Learning Act. Mr. \nPresident our nation's libraries are in crisis. Eighty-five percent of \nAmerica's nearly 16,000 libraries require expansion or renovation. In \nNew York State alone, 1.3 million citizens do not have access to free \nbasic library services and nearly one-half of the state's libraries \ncannot accommodate users with disabilities.\n  The Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Life-Long Learning Act is designed \nto prepare America's libraries for the twenty-first century by \nproviding grants of one billion dollars over five years for \nconstruction, renovation, and rehabilitation of public library \nfacilities. The bill will also permit libraries to use grants to \npurchase high-tech hardware and information technology so that all \ncitizens can take advantage of the tools of the information age. Since \nthe funds provided through this legislation must be matched dollar for \ndollar by states, cities, or private sources, billions of additional \ndollars will be leveraged. Moreover, since the grants will be awarded \ncompetitively, areas most in need will receive much needed assistance.\n  At the turn of the twentieth century, steel magnate Andrew Carnegie \ncreated nearly 3,000 libraries. His impact is still being felt in \nplaces like Astoria, Queens, Harlem, and Port Richmond Staten Island, \nwhere libraries endowed by Carnegie remain in service today. Imagine \nhow different America would be without this gift. Now, the information \nage is upon us and libraries must play an integral role in providing \ncitizens the resources they need to succeed in a knowledge intensive \neconomy. The future of America depends less on the minerals in our soil \nthan our intellectual capital. Strong public libraries can serve as \nanchors in communities so that young people can receive a strong \neducation and so that life-long learning can become a reality for every \ncitizen. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n                                S. 1223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \nAdvanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri.\n  Back in 1997, several community and state leaders approached me \nregarding funding for the Advanced Technical Center, which at that time \nexisted only\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\non paper and in the minds of these leaders. I immediately had a certain \naffection for this project. First and foremost, this project would be \nlocated in my hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Second, the local leaders \ncame to me with one of the most comprehensive partnerships that I have \never had the pleasure to work with. The partners included Linn State \nTechnical College, the University of Missouri, Moberly Area Community \nCollege, the Mexico Area Vocational and Technical School, the City of \nMexico, and the State of Missouri. Third, the Advanced Technical Center \nwould provide students with exceptional educational opportunities \nthrough highly specialized and advanced technical education and \ntraining at the certificate and degree levels in both emerging and \ntraditional technologies.\n  In the fall of 1997, the Senate approved and the President signed the \nappropriation bill providing $1 million in Federal funds for the \nAdvanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri. The federal support \nrecognized that the key to staying competitive in today's global \nmarketplace is investing in education and training of our current and \nfuture workers. The federal funds, in conjunction with the local and \nstate funds, made this project a reality.\n  This Friday, June 18, 1999, the Advanced Technical Center will \ncelebrate its Grand Opening. I am looking forward to being a part of \nthe celebration. But, more importantly, I am proud to have been a \nparticipant in the successful partnership that has led to the creation \nof a model, state-of-the-art technical training and learning facility \nin my hometown of Mexico, MO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7034-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HENRY AND MARILYN TAUB\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \ntwo very close friends, Henry and Marilyn Taub in honor of the June 15, \n1999 dedication of the Henry and Marilyn Taub Science and Technology \nCenter Faculty of Computer Science. This state-of-the-art facility, \nlocated at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, \nIsrael, will be one of the largest computer science facilities in the \nworld. It is only the most recent example of the Taubs' contributions \nto education. They have had a long history of philanthropic activity.\n  As Henry Taub's long-time business associate, I witnessed the Taubs' \nextraordinary commitment to the Technion. They established both the \nTaub Loan Fund, which aids faculty members in the Electrical \nEngineering and Computer Science Faculties, as well as the Henry Taub \nPrize for excellence in research. And their support helped the \nInstitute establish the Morris and Sylvia Taub Computer Center. These \noutstanding contributions to Israel's top technology institution are \nbut one example of the Taubs' commitment to Israel's strength and \nindependence through science and learning.\n  They have helped students keep pace with technological advances in \nthis century and have helped make Technion one of the leading \ntechnology centers for the next century.\n  It has been one of my life's most rewarding experiences to have \nworked with Henry and his brother Joseph. We shared successes together \nbut more significantly, a commitment to a strengthened Israel and world \nwide Jewish community.\n  I am honored by my friendship with Henry and Marilyn Taub. The course \nof my life was heavily influenced by my association with the Taubs and \nI am grateful for the example that Henry provided for all of us who \nknow him.\n  His activities serve as an outstanding model of how to respond to \nsuccess available, to those who will work for it, in this blessed \nAmerica.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this thoughtful, \nselfless couple for the excellent work they have done to improve life \nin America and Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7034-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF BENNINGTON, VERMONT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n250th anniversary of the Town of Bennington, Vermont. On behalf of all \nVermonters, I want to wish this historical town a very happy \nanniversary.\n  In 1749, the Governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, chartered \nthe first town in the territory that would eventually become the State \nof Vermont. In 1761, the town was named Bennington in his honor. With \nits access to the Walloomsac River as a power source, the new town \nquickly built up industries such as paper mills, pottery, grist mills, \nand the largest cotton batting mill in the United States. It became an \nimportant gateway to the region.\n  During the Revolutionary War, Bennington gained great notoriety with \nthe Battle of Bennington. As the British General, John Burgoyne, \nmarched his troops south from Canada with the plans to capture Albany, \nthey stopped in Vermont intending to forage for supplies. However, they \nunderestimated the strength of their enemy. On August 16, 1777, John \nStark, leading a militia of 1500 men, including the Green Mountain \nBoys, attacked. After two days of fighting, the militia defeated the \nBritish with the first decisive victory for the Americans. This \ncritical battle is seen as the turning point in the war because it \ngreatly weakened the British forces, revitalized languishing spirit of \nthe revolutionaries, and ensured another victory at Saratoga. \nBennington was also the base of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys \nwho led the taking of Fort Ticondaroga. To celebrate Bennington's vital \nrole in the American Revolution, I've enjoyed marching in many \nBennington Battle Day parades.\n  The Town of Bennington holds a special place in the Vermont history \nbooks. On Bennington's village green stands the meeting house where \nlegislators in 1791 voted for the Independent Republic of Vermont to \nbecome the 14th state.\n  In addition to the town's historical significance, Bennington has a \nrich cultural heritage. The buildings found in Old Bennington form one \nthe greatest concentrations of early Federal and Georgian architecture \nin the state. In North Bennington is the Park-McCullough House, built \nin 1865, which served as home to two Vermont governors. The Bennington \nMuseum houses a collection of paintings by the celebrated folk artist, \nGrandma Moses, known for her depictions of rural life and the \ncountryside.\n  Today, Bennington offers much to both its residents and to visiting \ntourists.\n  Continuing a long tradition of artistic appreciation, the new Arts \nCenter helps promote a variety of exhibits, threatre productions, \nliterary readings, artists' work space, and dance and musical \nperformances. Bennington also boasts two private colleges: Bennington \nCollege, a small liberal arts school with a strong performing arts \nprogram; and Southern Vermont College, a small college that prides \nitself on providing resources to and giving back to the Bennington \ncommunity.\n  But the heart of this small town has always been its indomitable \npeople and its close-knit community. It is a community dedicated to \nimproving the lives of all its citizens. This dedication can be seen in \nseveral innovative Bennington educational programs, in the town's \ncollaborative approach to helping children and families, and in the \nsignificant progress made toward meeting the community's needs for \naffordable housing.\n  It gives me great pleasure to recognize the Town of Bennington's \n250th anniversary, its significant role in both the history of our \ncountry and of the State of Vermont, and its strong, diverse \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7034-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7034-S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO THE ISRAELI MIA'S\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, around this time every year I \ndeliver this speech to the House of Representatives and now I am \nprivileged and honored to deliver it to the Senate. I rise today to pay \ntribute to the capture of several Israeli soldiers who were taken \nprisoner by the Syrians in the 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon.\n  On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit \nin Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The Syrians succeeded in capturing Sgt. \nZachary Baumel, 1st Sgt. Zvi Feldman and Cpt. Yehudah Katz. Upon \narrival in Damascus, the identified tank and crew were paraded through \nthe streets draped in Syrian and Palestinian Flags.\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\n  Since that terrible day in 1982, the Israeli and the United States \nGovernments have been working to obtain any possible information about \nthe fate of these missing soldiers, joining forces with the offices of \nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations and \nother international bodies. According to the Geneva convention, the \narea in Lebanon where the soldiers first disappeared was continually \ncontrolled by Syria, therefore deeming her responsible for the \ntreatment of the captured soldiers. To this day, despite the promises \nmade by the Syrian Government and by the PLO, very little information \nhas been forthcoming about the condition of Zachary Baumei, Zvi \nFeldman, and Yehudah Katz.\n  June 11 marks the anniversary of the day that these soldiers were \nreported missing in action. Sixteen pain-filled years have already \npassed since the families of the MIA's have last seen their sons, and \nyet President Assad has still not revealed their whereabouts.\n  One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen \nfrom my district in Brooklyn, N.Y. A dedicated basketball fan, Zachary \nbegan his studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved \nto Israel with other family members, and continued his education at \nYeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army \nservice. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his \nmilitary service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew study \npsychology. But fate had unfortunately decreed otherwise and on June \n11, 1982 he vanished.\n  Zachary's parents, Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in \ntheir pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have \nworked closely with the Jewish Congregation of America, the American \nCoalition for missing Israeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the \nconference of Presidents of major American Jewish organizations. The \nStella K. Abraham High School for Girls forged a project that has \nincreased awareness and support for the MIA's plight for freedom. These \ngroups have been at the forefront of this pursuit of justice. I want to \nrecognize their devoted efforts and ask my colleagues to join me in \ncommending their efforts. These families have been without their \nchildren for sixteen years. Answers must be found.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7035-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LOS ALAMOS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Los Alamos \nCounty on its 50th anniversary. This small northern New Mexico county \nhas packed an amazing number of contributions into its short history.\n  Los Alamos had already completed its momentous contributions during \nthe Second World War, when it was officially created in 1949. But the \nwork of Los Alamos and its contributions to national security were far \nfrom completed. Few might have anticipated that the nuclear stockpile \ncreated at Los Alamos would lead to an unprecedented five decades free \nof massive global conflict. During those five decades, the nuclear \nweapons of the United States have provided time for the world's leaders \nto strive toward global peace. Today they still serve as the ultimate \nguarantor of our precious freedoms.\n  Throughout the County's history, its support for the national \nsecurity objectives of Los Alamos National Laboratory has never \nwavered. The success of the lab is completely intertwined with the \nsuccess and history of the County. As we've advanced toward world \npeace, admittedly with steps far smaller than all of us would wish, the \nCounty has supported dramatic changes at the laboratory, from changing \ncharacteristics of our nuclear stockpile to new challenges that the \nlaboratory was called upon to address. For example, in 1949, most of \nthe non-proliferation and environmental challenges that the lab \naddresses today did not exist.\n  I believe it is also important to note on this anniversary that the \ntime of the closed secret city has long passed, and Los Alamos County \nhas now become a community open to scientific and economic growth and \ncultural diversity. Today, the lab and the surrounding County are \nmaking wonderful strides toward becoming fuller partners in the \nEspanola Valley and with all of New Mexico.\n  Los Alamos County and the laboratory have a wealth of challenges \nahead as national priorities are modified to adapt to new global \nconditions. The future of Los Alamos County should be as bright as its \npast, and the range of its contributions will continue to be of vital \nimportance in guaranteeing the nation's freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7035-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO BOY SCOUT TROOP 33\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one of the oldest boy scout \ntroops in the country, Troop 33 of Minneapolis, Minnesota, is \ncelebrating its eightieth anniversary with a trip to Washington, D.C. \nto learn about U.S. government. Founded in 1918, Boy Scout Troop 33 has \nserved its community for three generations and produced 269 Eagle \nScouts. Troop 33 has conducted extensive service projects, including: \nflood relief sandbagging in Fargo, North Dakota; collecting food and \nclothes for the poor; severe tornado damage clean-up in St. Peter, \nMinnesota; leading bingo games for veterans; volunteering at an AIDS \nhouse; visiting nursing home residents; entertaining disabled adults; \nbuilding wheelchair ramps; serving as a color guard at the Chapel at \nFort Snelling National Cemetery; and running a blood donation drive at \ntheir sponsoring church, Westminster Church of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n  The troop has extraordinary long-term continuity. Three families have \ncontributed three generations of Eagles and there are eight father-son \ncombinations on the Eagle list. The troop has also had continuity of \nleadership, with only seven men serving as Scoutmaster during Thirty-\nThree's eighty years: Kyle Cudworth, Ted Carlsen, Rich Wheaton, Stan \nMoore, Bill Braddock, Karl Ostlund, and Dave Moore.\n  Troop 33's current Scoutmaster, Dave Moore, has served as Scoutmaster \nto over 1,150 scouts over the course of 33 years, representing over \n3,000 boy-years in scouting. Now in his fiftieth year of scouting, Mr. \nMoore, who joined the Troop at age 12, has helped his boys to earn 2833 \nranks, including 130 Eagles, and over 5,900 merit badges. Mr. Moore has \nhelped thousands of young people to discover the enjoyment that comes \nfrom service and to dedicate themselves to building strong communities.\n  Over the years, the troop has received numerous honors and awards. \nLeaders have earned the prestigious Silver Beaver Award, the Eagle-to-\nEagle Award, and the This-is-Your-Life Award. On the national level, \ntheir scouts have received the Whitney Young Award and the George Meany \nAward. Also, former Scoutmaster Ted Carlsen received the national \nSilver Buffalo Award in recognition of his many years of service to \nscouting at the Troop, council, and national levels.\n  The achievements and dedication of Troop 33 exemplify the value of \nscouting as a learning experience, aiding boys in acquiring leadership \nabilities, recognizing the responsibilities of citizenship, and \ncontributing to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7035-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE LIEN\n\n Mr. GRAMS.

He is most \ndeserving of this long overdue recognition. I, therefore, take this \nopportunity to congratulate Clarence and thank him for his service and \nsacrifice. President Ronald Reagan said, ``Freedom is not something to \nbe secured in any one moment of time. We must struggle to preserve it \neveryday. And freedom is never more than one generation away from \nextinction.'' We must always remember the great debt of gratitude we \nowe to those like Clarence who have served our country in the Armed \nForces, protecting the freedom we all too often take for granted. \nAgain, congratulations, Clarence.

Mr. President, I would like to join the Colorado \nbanking industry in saluting an outstanding member of the Colorado \ncommunity, Don Childears, President/CEO of the Colorado Bankers \nAssociation. Mr.\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nChildears, a native of Colorado, born in Saguache, received his \nundergraduate degree from Colorado State University and his Juris \nDoctor from the University of Denver, College of Law.\n  For over 25 years, Mr. Childears has worked tirelessly building \nalliances between bankers, community leaders, and legislators. As the \nvoice of commercial banking in Colorado, Don has effectively and \nfaithfully championed the vital role of banking in our economy on both \na national and state level.\n  As a national leader in banking, Don chaired the American Bankers \nAssociation (ABA) State Association Division in 1991-1992; he assumed \nthe post of Vice Chairman of this division the previous year. As \nChairman, he guided the representation of all state bankers \nassociations in the United States. Don was also Chairman of the ABA \nRegulatory Burden Task Force from 1992-1994 and was given the honor of \naddressing the General Session of the ABA's Annual Convention and \nBanking Industry Forum in Boston during 1992. Don was the only state \nassociation executive to have done this in 17 years. This year, Don was \nasked by the Governor of Colorado, Bill Owens, to serve on Colorado's \nTask Force on Y2K Preparedness.\n  Don has served educational institutions as a Trustee for both the \nGraduate School of Banking at Colorado, University of Colorado, \nUniversity of Colorado, Boulder, and the Graduate School of Banking, \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, since 1980. As a banking spokesman, \nDon has always made himself available to public speaking opportunities, \nwhich has included everything from teaching courses on government, \npolitical influence, and banking at the Graduate School of Banking at \nColorado to addressing civic groups of all sizes and descriptions on a \nvariety of topics. He has also been heavily involved in various \ncharitable fund-raising and political campaign committees across the \nstate.\n  The recognitions and awards that have been bestowed upon Don are \nmany, as you may have gathered. He is a leader in his community on many \ndifferent levels. Beyond that, though, Don is an invaluable resource to \nthe banks of our nation, and in particular in my state of Colorado. I \nam proud to call Don Childears my friend and to recognize his \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/15/senate-section/article/S7036-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 707\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 123, submitted \nearlier by Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 123) to authorize representation of \n     Members of the Senate in the case of Candis Ray v. John \n     Edwards, et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1977, Candis Ray, who operated a tour \nbusiness in Washington, brought an action against Senator Proxmire and \nEllen Proxmire, the Senator's wife. The plaintiff claimed that Senator \nand Mrs. Proxmire had tortiously interfered with her business in order \nto favor Mrs. Proxmire's competing tour business. One of the \nplaintiff's claims was that Senator Proxmire had helped to arrange for \nSenate rooms for his wife's tours. In affirming the district court's \ndismissal of the complaint, the court of appeals observed that, to the \nextent that an issue had been raised about compliance with the Senate's \nrules on use of its facilities, ``[t]he judicial function is not \nimplicated at all, for only in the Senate forum can observance of the \nrule be compelled.'' Ray v. Proxmire, 581 F.2d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir.), \ncert. denied, 439 U.S. 933 (1978).\n  In the two decades since that decision, Ms. Ray has launched a \nbarrage of civil lawsuits, seeking to obtain damages in connection with \nthis matter, against the Senate, individual Senators, and Senate \nemployees, federal judges and government attorneys who have been \ninvolved in her prior lawsuits, and the President. In 1989, Ms. Ray \nsought to hold Senator Heflin, Sanford, Stennis, and Wallop, as well as \nan employee on Senator Sanford's staff and the Senate itself, \naccountable for the Senate's lack of favorable action on her complaints \nand petitions for financial payment. The Senate Legal Counsel obtained \nthe dismissal of that action.\n  The plaintiff has now filed her fifth lawsuit related to this matter, \nthis time against Senator Lott and Senator Edwards, her home-state \nSenator. The lawsuit again seeks to hold the Senators responsible for \nthe lack of favorable action on her demands for payment from the \nSenate.\n  The resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent \nSenator Lott and Senator Edwards and to move to dismiss the complaint.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 123) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
