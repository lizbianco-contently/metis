Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments \ntoday about a bill that many Senators, some 70 of us, believe will \nimprove the lives of millions of disabled Americans. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act would allow disabled adults to enter the \nworkforce without placing their Medicaid or Medicare benefits at risk. \nI particularly thank Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Moynihan, and Roth for \ntheir outstanding leadership in crafting this legislation. I am very \nproud to be a cosponsor.\n  Today, more than 8 million working-age adults receive disability \npayments from the Federal Government for conditions that range from \nparalysis to multiple sclerosis. A recent Harris poll showed that 72 \npercent of these disabled people would really like to work, but \ndisabled Americans face a terrible Catch-22. The Federal Medicaid \nprogram won't cover people who continue to work and remain disabled. So \nif a disabled adult earns more than $500 a month, he or she loses their \nMedicaid. That is the rub.\n\n  The eligibility criteria for Medicaid benefits have had a devastating \neffect on disabled Americans. The Medicaid program equates having a \ndisability with being poor and unable to work, furthering inaccurate \nstereotypes about disability. To make things worse, the Medicaid \nprogram ensures that disabled people who do work end up having to \nshoulder the cost of their care by themselves.\n  For all but the best-off disabled Americans, these costs are \nprohibitive. People with serious medical conditions can't pay the out-\nof-pocket costs of their medical treatment. These costs can run into \nthe tens of thousands of dollars each year. In other words, if a \ndisabled American does have a job, the minute that disabled American \nearns more than $500 a month, they fall off a cliff and they lose their \nMedicaid or\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\ntheir Medicare. So millions of disabled Americans remain dependent on \ncash assistance from the Federal Government simply because they can't \nwork and keep Medicaid at the same time.\n  Last year, I wrote to President Clinton urging a remedy to the \nsituation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act. This bill allows Americans with \ndisabilities to enter the workforce without losing their health \ncoverage under Medicaid or Medicare. Even if disabled people are \nworking in full-time jobs with health benefits, they will be able to \nbuy their Medicaid coverage for medical expenses that their regular \ninsurance does not cover.\n  In addition, the Work Incentives Improvement Act sets up a new system \ncalled Ticket to Work, to provide better job training and placement \nservices for the disabled. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will \nenable disabled Americans to pursue self-sufficiency, to achieve \nindependence, and to contribute in meaningful ways to our economy. It \nis certainly an idea whose time has come. That is why over 70 Senators \nhave signed on as cosponsors.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has not had the chance to vote on this \nimportant legislation. The reason I am on the floor today, as well as \nothers who I hope will be coming to the floor, is to urge Senate \nMajority Leader Trent Lott to bring the Work Incentives Improvement Act \nto the Senate floor for a vote soon. No one should have to choose \nbetween a job and their health. By preserving Federal health benefits \nfor disabled workers, we can avoid the Catch-22 and, most importantly, \nwe can help the disabled to live full and healthy lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the continuing \ncrisis in the farm economy. I have just been home the weekend before \nlast. Everywhere I went in my State, people were saying to me: Senator, \nsomething has to be done. We are facing a crisis in rural America. The \nprices we are getting for things continues to be at very low levels--in \nfact, we have the lowest prices in 53 years--and at the same time \neverything we buy is going up. That is putting us in a cost/price \nsqueeze that is truly strangling American farmers.\n  The result is going to be devastating unless there is a response. \nLast year, the Federal Government did respond with a $6 billion program \nof disaster assistance that made a significant difference in rural \nAmerica. About half of that money went for a support, a supplement that \ngave farmers some assistance when prices were collapsing. There was \nalso a second major element for a disaster program, natural disasters \naround the country that had dramatically reduced farm income. That \nprogram made a significant difference.\n  Those same conditions continue this year. Prices again are at very \nlow levels, and we have seen natural disasters once again strike rural \nAmerica. In fact, we now know to deliver on the promise we made last \nyear on a disaster program is going to require more money than we \nappropriated. We appropriated about $3 billion for that purpose. We now \nknow delivery on the program we passed is going to cost another $1.5 \nbillion, because the signup of agricultural producers that is now \ncompleted indicates to us there are far more who are eligible than we \nthought when we wrote the program. That is, of course, because we were \nfaced with a moving target. We were faced with additional natural \ndisasters that deepened and worsened and made more farmers eligible.\n  I believe we need that $1.5 billion to keep the promise made last \nyear and another $2.8 billion that will be necessary to give the same \nkind of income support we provided last year, about a 50-percent AMTA \nsupplemental.\n  Why are these necessary? What is happening out there so those of us \nwho represent farm country come to our colleagues and talk about a \ncrisis in rural America? Perhaps the best way of showing what has \nhappened is this chart that shows what has happened, over a 53-year \nperiod, to farm prices. As we can see, with spring wheat and barley \nprices from 1946 to 1999, we are now at the lowest level for barley and \nwheat prices in 53 years. That is the hard reality our farmers are \ncoping with, the lowest prices in 53 years. We know that earlier this \nyear hog prices fell to 8 cents a pound. It costs 40 cents a pound to \nproduce a hog.\n  To put these prices into some perspective, these are per bushel. We \nare down to a price per bushel of $2.60 to $2.70 for wheat. I know a \nbushel does not mean a lot to many people in our very urban society \ntoday, but a bushel of wheat weighs 56 pounds. So farmers are getting 5 \ncents a pound--actually something less than 5 cents a pound--for the \nproduct they produce. There is no way you can make it when you are \ngetting 5 cents a pound for a product that costs at least 10 cents a \npound to produce. But that is what is happening to farmers.\n  Let me go to the next chart that shows what is happening to wheat \nprices received by farmers in relationship to cost. This green line \nshows the cost of production in 1997. You can see it is just about $5 a \nbushel. That is the cost. That is the best estimate of what it costs \nacross the country to produce a bushel of wheat, just above $5. You can \nsee the last time farmers were getting above $5 was back in 1996. Since \nthat time, in 1997, it was far below the cost of production, and it has \ndone nothing but get worse through 1998 and on into 1999. We are far \nbelow the cost of production. As I indicated, we are running, down here \nat $2.60 a bushel. The cost of production is over $5. It is no wonder \nfarmers are saying we desperately need a Federal response.\n\n  Why is it a Federal responsibility? For the entire history of the \nUnited States, we have recognized the special role of agriculture. We \nhave recognized it is subject to dramatic swings in both production and \nprices, because, first of all, it is a product that depends on the \nweather, and the weather is very unpredictable, as we have seen across \nthe country for year after year after year. On top of that, we are \nsubjected to dramatic price swings. In the last several years, we have \nbeen influenced by the collapse in Asia; we lost one of our biggest \ncustomers. We have also seen a financial collapse in Russia. Of course, \nRussia was a key customer of the United States. Those two things have \nhad a dramatic and adverse impact on price. You can see it here--prices \ndown, down, down--and the cost of production staying up. That has put \nour farmers at an extreme disadvantage.\n  While farmers are paying more but receiving less, it is not \nsurprising, then, they find themselves in a cost/price squeeze. This \ngreen line shows the prices farmers paid for various inputs. As you can \nsee, the prices farmers had been paying had been going up rather \nsteadily. They have actually leveled off in the last 3 years. But look \nat what the prices that farmers have been receiving look like. That is \nthis red line. We can see it peaked right at the time we passed the \n1996 farm bill.\n  The 1996 farm bill changed everything. It said, instead of adjusting \nwhat Government provides by way of assistance when prices fall, we will \nno longer do that. The new farm bill said we are going to have fixed \npayments that are sharply reduced year after year no matter what \nhappens to prices.\n  Here is the pattern we see: the prices farmers pay for goods they use \nto produce products going up; the prices\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\nthey receive going down dramatically. The result is this enormous gap \nbetween what they are able to buy for, what they have to pay to receive \ngoods, and what they are able to get when they sell their goods. This \ndramatic gap, this chasm now, between the prices farmers pay for what \nthey have to buy and what they get for what they sell has opened up \ninto such a large difference that literally tens of thousands of farm \nfamilies are threatened.\n  It would be one thing if the United States was alone in this world, \nif we did not have competitors to worry about, but we do have \ncompetitors. The Europeans are our chief competitors, and it is very \ninteresting to see what they are doing.\n  At the very time when we have dramatically cut support for farmers, \ncut support at the very time they are in the greatest need, because the \ngap between what they pay for and what they get has opened up in such a \nvery serious way, we have cut dramatically the level of support we \nprovide our farmers. In the last farm bill, we cut in half the support \nwe provide our farmers. If we look at what our competitors, the \nEuropeans, are doing, we see quite a different pattern.\n  Our European competitors are spending far more than we are to support \ntheir farmers. If we go back to 1996, we can see the red bar is what \nEurope is spending in direct support; the yellow bar is what we are \nspending. We can see the pattern all through 1997, 1998, 1999, the year \n2000--and these are projections for 2001 and 2002--that our competitors \nare providing much more support to their producers than we are \nproviding ours.\n  I conclude by saying we have a crisis in rural America. It requires a \nFederal response. I hope very much before this year has concluded that \nwe have said farming is important in this country, that we understand \nit is in crisis, and that we are prepared to respond.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time between 12 noon and \n12:30 p.m. shall be under the control of the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Bennett. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5789-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5789-S5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUSPEND BOMBING IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to call for a suspension of the \nbombing in Kosovo, not because of anything Milosevic has done, such as \nthe release of three American servicemen; not because of differing \nopinions within NATO, such as those currently being expressed by the \nItalians and the Germans; not because of the inadvertent damage done to \naccidental targets, such as the Chinese Embassy; and not because of any \npersonal animus or distrust of any individuals in this administration. \nNo; I oppose continuation of the bombing in Kosovo because it has not \nworked. It is not working and shows no signs of working in the future.\n  The bombing has been of no help to the Kosovars, hundreds of \nthousands of whom have lost their homes, their neighbors, their \nchildren and perhaps even their lives while the bombing has gone on. It \nhas been of no help to the Albanians or the Macedonians who have seen \nhundreds of thousands of refugees flood cross the borders into their \nill-equipped countries. It has been of no help to NATO, an alliance \nthat has seen its military stocks drawn down to dangerously low levels \nwith no effect on the atrocities going on in the killing fields. And \nthe bombing has been of no help to our relationships with nations \noutside of NATO, particularly Russia and China, who have vigorously \nopposed our decision to proceed.\n  Again, in short, the bombing has not worked, even though we have \npersisted for a longer time than we bombed in Desert Storm. My call for \nsuspending the bombing comes from the modern wisdom that says: If at \nfirst you don't succeed, try something else.\n  There are those, including my colleagues on the Senate floor, \ncommentators and columnists for whom I have the utmost respect, who say \nwe cannot even consider suspension of the bombing. We are at war, they \nsay; we must press on to victory. Anything else would be dishonorable, \nand on a practical geopolitical level, would send the wrong signal to \nothers who might choose to confront us in the future.\n  Such language is often called Churchillian, echoing the electrifying \nrhetoric of the indomitable prime minister speaking in the darkest days \nof World War II.\n  No one has a higher regard for the magnificent rhetoric and the deeds \nof Winston Churchill than I, but, to me, the mantra, ``Because we're \nin, we have to win,'' is more suitable for a bumper sticker than it is \nfor Winston Churchill.\n  Let me take you to a Churchillian episode that I think applies here, \nand it comes not from the darkest days of World War II but World War I.\n  Those who remember their history will remember that Winston Churchill \nfell into great disregard during World War I as a result of his \nsponsorship of the Dardanelles operation. He was removed from any \nposition of responsibility. But because he was still an officer in the \nBritish Army, he agreed, indeed sought for, the opportunity to go to \nthe front in France. And so, as Major Churchill, he went to the front, \nand unlike most British officers of the time, he really went to the \nfront. He went all the way to the front lines and saw for himself over \na period of time the horrors and the futility of trench warfare. He saw \nit firsthand, and he came away convinced that it was not working.\n  When he returned to England, he became Minister of Munitions and put \nhis full support and strength behind searching for an alternative. If \nyou will, he put aside the patriotic rhetoric of his time and sought \nfor a policy that would work. William Manchester, in his biography of \nChurchill called the ``Last Line,'' refers to Churchill as the father \nof the tank. It was Winston Churchill who caught the vision of the fact \nthat you could do something different and created the modern tank, or \ncreated the prototype of what became the modern tank, and \nrevolutionized warfare, eliminating the failures of trench warfare.\n\n  If at first you don't succeed, try something else. The legacy of \nWinston Churchill was that he was willing to try something else when he \nsaw the reality of the failure on the ground. I think, frankly, that is \nthe Churchillian example we should seek to follow now: Suspend the \nbombing and try something else.\n  There are many suggestions on the table. The one, of course, we hear \nthe most these days is send in the ground troops. To those who urge \nthis, I ask, as I asked when the bombing was proposed in the first \nplace: Will it work? Will it accomplish our goals? And with that \nquestion, we get the next obvious question: What are our goals?\n  When Secretary Madeleine Albright made the case for the bombing to \nthe Senators in the Capitol, she told us if we did not bomb, the \nfollowing would happen: First, there would be brutal atrocities and \nethnic cleansing throughout all of Kosovo with tens of thousands of \npeople being slaughtered and hundreds of thousands driven from their \nhomes.\n  Second, she said there will be a flood of refugees across the borders \ninto neighboring countries, swamping their already fragile economies.\n  Third, she said there will be splits within NATO. This alliance will \nbe torn apart by disagreements.\n  And finally, she said Milosevic will strengthen his hand on his local \npolitical situation.\n  That was 8 weeks ago. Now, 8 weeks later, the bombing has failed to \nprevent any of those results. All four of them have taken place--the \nethnic cleansing and the brutality and the atrocities have gone on; the \nrefugees have appeared across the borders; NATO is split with arguments \ngoing on among its top leaders; and Milosevic has been strengthened as \nthe leader, martyr, hero, if you will, of the Yugoslavs. We have not \nachieved a single goal that the bombing set out to accomplish. I come \nback to the same question: What are our new goals?\n  As best I can understand them, from the various statements that have \nbeen made, one list of the new goals would be as follows: No. 1, \nremoval of all Serbian influence in Kosovo; No. 2, a return of the \nKosovars physically to their land; No. 3, a rebuilding of their homes \nand villages; and No. 4, an international police force in there for an \nindefinitely long period of time to guarantee that their homes will \nalways be protected.\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\n  Let us accept those goals for just a moment. I ask the same \nfundamental question I asked in the beginning with respect to bombing. \nWill it work? Will continuation of the bombing achieve these four new \ngoals when it did not achieve the four old ones? And what about ground \ntroops? Will ground troops achieve these new goals?\n  On the first question, as to whether the continuation of the bombing \nwill achieve these new goals, there is disagreement from the experts. \nIn this morning's Washington Post, General Short says: ``Yes, we will \nsee the achievement of these goals within a matter of months.'' Last \nFriday, the Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``No, \nthere was no indication that bombing would achieve the goals.''\n  I ask this fundamental humanitarian question: Do we have to continue \nto destroy the economy of Yugoslavia, depriving the civilian population \nof power and water, as we did over the weekend, raising the specter of \nthe epidemic spread of typhoid while we decide who is right, while we \ndecide which opinion is the correct one? Can we not suspend the bombing \nwhile that debate goes on?\n  With respect to ground troops, and those who say ground troops are \nthe only answer, those who are calling for an invasion and an \nindefinitely long occupation of part of Serbia, that part known as \nKosovo, to them I would refer the words of Daniel Ellsberg that \nappeared in the New York Times last Friday. I find them chilling. I \nwould like to read them now at some length. I cannot paraphrase them \nand put them in any better form than Mr. Ellsberg himself. He says, \nreferring to a ground invasion in Kosovo:\n\n       . . . I believe, it would be a death sentence for most \n     Albanians remaining in Kosovo.\n       By all accounts, it would take weeks to months to deploy an \n     invasion force to the region once the decision to do so was \n     made, and Slobodan Milosevic already has troops there \n     fortifying the borders. Wouldn't the prospect of an invasion \n     lead him to order his forces in Kosovo to kill all the \n     military-age male Albanians and hold the rest of the \n     population as hostages rather than continuing to deport them?\n\n  A very, very important question.\n  Daniel Ellsberg goes on:\n\n       We don't know how many male Kosovars of military age--\n     broadly, [those] from 15 to 60 years old--have been killed \n     already.\n\n  He says:\n\n       But even if the number is in the tens of thousands . . . \n     that would mean that most of the men were still alive. Facing \n     invasion, would Mr. Milosevic allow any more men to leave \n     Kosovo to be recruited by the K.L.A., or to live to support \n     the invasion? The Serbs could quickly slaughter 100,000 to \n     200,000 male Kosovars. (In Rwanda five years ago, an average \n     of 8,000 civilians a day were killed for 100 days, mostly \n     with machetes.)\n       Obviously, Mr. Milosevic and his subordinates are brutal \n     enough to do that. If they haven't done it already (and there \n     is no testimony [to suggest] that they have on that scale) it \n     may well be because they fear that such an annihilation would \n     make an invasion inevitable. A commitment now to ground \n     invasion would remove that deterrent, just as the commitment \n     in March to begin bombing in support of an ultimatum and the \n     consequent withdrawal of international monitors removed an \n     implicit deterrent against sweeping ethnic cleansing and \n     expulsion.\n       As for to the remaining civilians in Kosovo--\n     women, children and old people--tens of thousands of them \n     could be used against the invasion as human shields, in a \n     way never before seen in warfare. Fighting in built-up \n     areas, NATO troops would probably be fired on from \n     buildings that were packed on every floor with Kosovar \n     women and children. Using the traditional means--\n     explosives, artillery and rockets--to destroy those \n     buildings would make NATO forces the mass executioners of \n     the people we were fighting to protect.\n\n  The column goes on. I shall not continue with it except to summarize \nthe grim conclusion. Mr. Ellsberg says:\n\n       . . . We bombed Vietnam for seven and a half years in \n     pursuit of goals we refused to compromise and never secured.\n\n  I find that a chilling summary in terms of some of the language we \nare hearing now: We must never compromise until our goals are secured. \nThe first goals laid out were not secured. We now have a new set of \ngoals and we are determined once again not to give in.\n  When I first went into the briefing room to hear Secretary Albright, \nSecretary Cohen, National Security Adviser Berger, and General Shelton \ngive us the justification for proceeding in this area, I went in with \nno preconceptions one way or the other. Contrary to assumptions that \nhave been made in the press about those of us who voted against the \nbombing, I did not carry any impeachment baggage into that briefing.\n  I have a history of backing President Clinton when I think he is \nright. I supported him on the recognition of Vietnam, on most favored \nnation status for China, on the Mexican peso bailout, on NATO \nexpansion, on NAFTA and GATT and fast track, all to the discomfort of \nsome of my constituents. I did so because I thought the President was \nright. And I went into that briefing very much capable of being \nconvinced.\n  But during the briefing, as I became more and more uneasy about what \nI was hearing, when it came my turn to speak, I said to Secretary \nAlbright: Let me give you a little bit of history.\n  I did that because she had quoted history to us, talking about the \nBalkans being the beginning of World War I and the battleground of \nWorld War II.\n  And she said: If we don't act quickly enough, this will be the spark \nthat sets off World War III.\n  I did not choose to argue with her history. World War I did not begin \nbecause of a fight over the Balkans. While there were battles in World \nWar II which occurred there, to be sure, the pivotal points in World \nWar II were in places like North Africa, Stalingrad, Normandy, and \nBastogne, not to mention, of course, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Leyte \nGulf.\n  No. I said to her: Madam Secretary, let me give you a little piece of \nhistory. This comes out of the Eisenhower administration, presided over \nby a military general who had achieved international fame for his \nstrategic vision. This is when he was President.\n  I said, ``A group of his advisers came to him to describe an \ninternational situation and to recommend a military solution. They laid \nout all of the military actions they wanted to take and then said, Mr. \nPresident, it will achieve these results.''\n  President Eisenhower listened very carefully and then asked: ``Are \nyou willing to take the next step?'' They replied, ``What do you mean, \nMr. President?''\n  He said, ``If this doesn't work, this first step that you have \noutlined, are you willing to take the next step?''\n  ``Oh, Mr. President,'' they said, ``the next step won't be necessary. \nThere won't need to be any next steps. This first step will work.''\n  President Eisenhower asked again, ``You have not answered my \nquestion. Are you willing to take the next step?''\n  ``Well, let us explain to you, Mr. President, why the next----\n  He said, ``I accept your analysis that this will probably work. I \naccept your analysis that people will probably react in the way you are \nsuggesting they will react. But I am asking you this question: `Are you \nwilling to take the next step if the first one does not work?' And if \nthe answer is `No', then don't take the first step.'' I asked, ``Madam \nSecretary, my question to you is, `Are you willing to take the next \nstep?' If this doesn't work, what do we do?''\n\n  I got conversation, but I did not get an answer to my question. I \ncame out of that briefing saying, unless I can get an answer to that \nquestion, I will vote against the bombing. I was not satisfied and I \ndid vote against the bombing.\n  I did not prevail in this Chamber. A majority of the Members voted in \nfavor of the bombing, and so we have now had 8 weeks of it.\n  That date has an interesting meaning for me, because in this \nconversation, in the briefing, they were asked, ``How long will it take \nfor us to find out if this is going to work?'' We were told repeatedly, \n``We can't tell you that. We don't know.''\n  Finally, in some frustration, I spoke out of turn and said to the \nbriefer, ``How long would you be surprised if it were more than?''\n  I got kind of a dirty look and then grumpily the fellow said: ``8 \nweeks.''\n  Well, it has now been 8 weeks, and it hasn't worked, which is why I \nam here saying let's suspend the bombing while we talk about something \nthat might. Let us stop destroying the economy of Yugoslavia while we \ntalk about what might work in Kosovo, because our destruction of water \nworks and television stations and power-generating plants in Belgrade \nhas had no effect on the\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nkilling in Kosovo. Can't we stop killing civilians who are not involved \nin this while we talk about what our options might be?\n  I think one of the most trenchant and insightful analyses of what \nhappened to this country in Vietnam was written by Barbara Tuchman in a \nbook called ``The March of Folly.'' In that book she described how \npeople persist in going after solutions that do not work, because they \ndo not want to admit that it won't work, and they are sure that if we \njust keep bombing a little bit longer, somehow something will work out.\n  Shortly after I had my exchange with Secretary Albright, the \nPresident, President Clinton, was asked, ``What will you do if the \nbombing does not work?'' He was asked by the Prime Minister of Italy. \nAccording to the Washington Post, he looked startled at the question, \nthen turned to National Security Advisor Sandy Berger for an answer. \nMr. Berger gave him the answer, ``We will continue bombing.''\n  To me, that is folly. To me, that is not Churchillian. To me, that is \nnot looking around to see what else might be there. I suggest, again, I \ncall for a suspension of the bombing while we review our options, admit \nthat the bombing hasn't worked and try to devise a new strategy that \nwill. Perhaps there is none. After all of this analysis we may come to \nthe conclusion there is nothing we can do now that the brutalities have \ntaken place and the Kosovars have been driven from their homes. There \nmay be nothing we can do effectively to restore them. For those who say \nhow humiliating it would be for the United States to admit that, I ask \nthis question, ``How humiliating will it be if we go forward and fail \nto achieve our goals? Wouldn't we have been better off in Vietnam if we \nhad admitted that we were not getting it done long before the time came \nwhen that humiliating scene we all saw on our television screens of the \nhelicopters above the Embassy in Saigon was broadcast throughout all \nthe world?''\n  I voted for the supplemental bill that provided the military funds \nwith respect to the operation in Kosovo. I did so because I lost the \nfirst debate. The bombing went on. The funds were spent. The President \nhas exhausted all of the funds of the Department of Defense through the \nbalance of this year, and it would be irresponsible, in my view, not to \nreplenish those funds so the Defense Department can function now. I \nvoted to replenish the funds that have already been spent. But I call \non us to stop spending those funds now, while we undertake a \ncomprehensive review of our strategy and address, once again, the \nfundamental question that was not answered in the beginning, and has \nnot been answered so far, which is still, ``Will it work?''\n\n  I conclude by saying that the historic figure upon whom I called for \nthe rationality of answering that question is Winston Churchill, the \nman who went to the front lines and saw that trench warfare was \ninsanity and came back to become the father of the tank, who looked for \nanother alternative. There must be something better than what is \nhappening in Kosovo right now. Let us suspend the bombing and search \nfor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have an additional 5 minutes under my control, which \nI yield to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah for some additional time.\n  I rise today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of \nthe modern American Foreign Service.\n  We have all traveled abroad. I have visited over 60 countries over \nthe years. As many Americans, I have seen firsthand the dedication of \nprofessional Foreign Service officers in some of the most difficult and \ndangerous working environments in the world.\n  There is no longer any clear division between domestic and \ninternational issues. Transportation, trade, telecommunications, \ntechnology, and the Internet have changed all that.\n  As our Nation grew, it became more globally engaged. Over the last \n200 years, year after year, America has become an international \ncommunity. In 1860, we had only 33 diplomatic missions around the \nworld. But we had 253 consular posts abroad, primarily involved in \nsupporting our Nation's dramatic economic growth and trade expansion. \nAs America's role in the world grew, we took on more responsibility. \nAmerica's diplomacy needed to draw from the broad strength of our \ndemocratic society. And that, too, grew.\n  The solution was the Rogers Act of 1924. This act created America's \nfirst professional competitive Foreign Service. It merged the small, \nelite diplomatic corps with the more broadly based consular services. \nThe Rogers Act established a merit-based exam system to recruit the \nbest our growing Nation had to offer without regard to family ties or \npolitical favors.\n  America's diplomats are unsung heroes. Americans understand and \nappreciate the sacrifices of duty, honor, and country we ask every day \nfrom our military around the world. However, not enough Americans know \nabout the sacrifices we also ask every day from our American Foreign \nService officers around the world. Just like our military, they serve \nour national interests abroad in an increasingly uncertain and \ndangerous world.\n\n  Our military's purpose is to fight and win wars. The purpose of our \ndiplomats is to prevent wars. This makes recognition for their work \nmore difficult. This is a little like listening for the dog that \ndoesn't bark. But our Foreign Service officers do much more than \nprevent wars and resolve crises. They negotiate agreements to expand \ntrade and open up foreign markets. They protect Americans abroad who \nfind themselves in trouble and many more important responsibilities. \nThey explain American policies to often hostile nations. They help \nnegotiate arms control agreements to stem the dangerous proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction.\n  The work of the Foreign Service is relevant. It is very relevant to \nthe daily lives of every American. Their many successes are often \nunheralded. We take them for granted. The Foreign Service has endured \nthe same underfunding and poor working conditions as has our military \nservices. In the last decade, the Foreign Service has experienced \nsimilar recruitment and retention problems, as has the military.\n  Since 1992, the Foreign Service has declined 11 percent, even while \nwe have asked the Foreign Service to open up new missions in Central \nAsia and Eastern Europe and increase staffing in China. This has led to \nsharp staff reductions elsewhere in the world.\n  In my travels, as I am sure in your travels, Mr. President, and all \nof our colleagues' travels, we have also seen how run down and \ndangerous many of our embassies around the world have become. This has \na real impact on our national interest. This is as dangerous as what we \nhave been doing to our military. It is like asking the Air Force to \npermanently maintain an increased flight tempo with aging aircraft and \na severe shortage of pilots. This all has serious consequences to our \ncountry. Few appreciate how dangerous it has become for our diplomats \nwho defend America's interests the world.\n  Since World War II, more ambassadors have been killed in the line of \nduty than generals and admirals. The Secretary of State has \ncommemorated 186 American diplomats who have died under ``heroic or \ninspirational circumstances.''\n  Finally, in today's global community, we have a greater need for an \nactive, energetic, and visionary foreign policy and those who carry out \nthat foreign policy than ever before.\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\n  Today, we all commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of the \nmodern American Foreign Service, and we are stronger and better for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week we debated the Juvenile Justice \nAct. We had a good number of provisions, especially dealing with guns, \ngun shows, and gun sales that were very controversial. I did not speak \nlast week on an amendment I offered to the juvenile justice bill that \nbecame a part of that and is now a provision that has been passed by \nthe Senate. I want to take a few minutes today to describe the \namendment I offered and its importance.\n  Some while ago, I was watching a television program. It was about a \nserial killer, a man who killed four women and one man in Gainsville, \nFL. The program described the book this serial killer has written: \n``The Making of a Serial Killer: The Real Story of the Gainsville \nMurders in the Killer's Own Words.''\n  I thought: That cannot be the case. If you murder four or five people \nand are sent to prison, you lose your right to vote and you lose \ncertain rights. Do you have a right to write a book and profit from it? \nThis television program described the dilemma.\n  There was a murderer in New York who was described as the ``Son of \nSam'' murderer many years ago. He was sent to prison and wrote a book \nin order to profit from his murder. In other words, a violent murderer \ngoes to prison and spends his time writing a book to sell to the public \nto make money. Is that a right prisoners have in this country after \ncommitting a violent crime? Is there a constitutional right to profit \nfrom a violent crime in America? I do not think so.\n  The State of New York passed a statute, the ``Son of Sam'' statute, \nand the Federal Government passed a statute saying that the proceeds \nfrom a book written by a violent offender who is sent to prison cannot \nbe retained by the violent criminal.\n  That was appealed and went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Guess what. The \nU.S. Supreme Court said: No, you may not prohibit the expressive \nwritings of a violent criminal, because that is a violation of the \nfirst amendment. I am truncating the Supreme Court decision, but \nessentially the Supreme Court invalidated the ``Son of Sam'' laws. The \nFederal law has never been enforced, to my knowledge, and the State \nlaws have been invalidated.\n  So we had a circumstance where, on the program I watched, this serial \nkiller was interviewed. The woman with whom he apparently is \nromantically involved, who is one of the sponsors of this book, was \ninterviewed. It raised the question in my mind: Shouldn't we correct \nthis issue and these statutes so the next time this goes to the Supreme \nCourt, the Supreme Court will not overturn the law?\n  I wrote a piece of legislation, after consultation with some \nconstitutional lawyers, that I think does solve this issue and will say \nto any prospective author, some disgusting human being who murders four \nyoung girls and a man in Gainsville, FL, who now says, I want to write \na book to describe the detail, the horrible detail of these murders: \nYou can write until you are dead, but you will never ever profit, you \nwill never profit by writing the accounts of your murders and then sell \na book and keep the money. Not just you, but your agent, those to whom \nyou assign the profits--you will not be able to reap the rewards of \ntelling the gruesome, dirty tales of your sordid criminal lives.\n  The juvenile justice bill which passed last Thursday has an amendment \nin it that closes the loophole and rewrites the Federal law. It says \nthat any individual convicted of any Federal or State felony or violent \nmisdemeanor, if that convicted defendant tries to sell his book, movie \nrights, or other expressive work or any property associated with the \ncrime--a bloody glove, murder weapon, photos and so on--whose value has \nbeen enhanced by that crime, then the U.S. attorney will make a motion \nto forfeit all proceeds that would have been received by the defendant \nor the defendant's transferee--spouse, partner, friends, and so on.\n  Is this important? I think it is. I think we ought to have a Federal \nstatute, and if the Supreme Court said the ``Son of Sam'' statute is \nnot valid, we ought to have a Federal statute that says to anybody in \nthis country: If you commit a violent crime and you go to prison, do \nnot expect to sit in prison and write and profit by publishing a book \nabout your crime.\n  I offered that in the Senate last Thursday, and I was joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Evan Bayh. It has now passed the Senate, and my hope \nis my colleagues in the House will see fit to keep this in the Juvenile \nJustice Act, and it will go to the President and be signed into law.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n105 are located in today's Record under ``Submissions of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5792-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5792-S5793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a point about something \nwhich I think is critically important to the Senate and to this country \nand its future. It is something we are spending no time on and pay no \nattention to. It is the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  In the past two State of the Union Addresses, the President has asked \nCongress to report out and approve the nuclear test ban treaty.\n  Going back to a time when President Eisenhower talked about this \nissue, I think most Americans understand the value of and the interest \nin a test ban treaty.\n  Since 1945, six nations have conducted 2,046 nuclear test explosions. \nThat is an average of one test every 9 days. There are a few countries \nthat have the capability of producing a nuclear weapon and testing a \nnuclear weapon. There are many countries that want that capability. \nStopping the spread of nuclear weapons, stopping the spread of missile \ntechnology, the means by which nuclear warheads can be delivered, is \ncritically important.\n  It seems to me one of the underpinnings of those efforts must be the \npassage of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The United States \nhas been under a moratorium of nuclear tests. We have not been testing \nsince that moratorium began in 1992. We do not test nuclear weapons. We \nhave been a leader. In this area, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty is not only important public policy for our country and the \nworld, it is important in the context of our leadership in these areas.\n  The difficulties we now have in the Balkans and the ruptures that \nhave occurred with our relationship with the Russians, it seems to me, \nought to emphasize to us how important it is to turn back to these \nissues of arms control.\n  We know that the Iranians are testing medium-range missiles. We know \nthat the North Koreans are testing medium-range missiles. We know that \nIndia and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons under each other's nose, \nand they do not like each other.\n  Ought that be of some concern to us? Of course it should. Yet, the \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty--the CTBT it is called--the Comprehensive \nNuclear\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nTest Ban Treaty is here in a committee without movement. There were no \nhearings on the treaty in the last session of the 105th Congress. We \nare now 5 months into the 106th Congress. I very much want our country \nto do the right thing: Ratify that treaty before September of 1999, \nwhen the committee will be formed of the countries that are signatories \nto that treaty and who have ratified that treaty, about how it will be \nbrought into force and how it will be verified.\n  I know some say: Well, if you have a treaty on banning nuclear \nweapons tests, only those who are willing to ban them will ban them, \nand you can't deal with the rogues or the outlaws.\n  Look, if that is the attitude, no arms control of any type is worth \npursuing. But, of course, that is absurd. Arms control has brought real \nrewards and real reductions in nuclear weapons.\n  I have in my desk here in the Senate a piece of a backfire bomber. I \nam not at my desk to get it, but it is a piece of a wing of a backfire \nbomber. Normally you would get a piece of a potential adversary's \nbomber wing by shooting down a bomber. We did not do that. We cut the \nwing off the bomber as part of an arms control agreement in which they \nreduced the number of bombers, they reduced the number of missiles, and \nthey reduced the number of warheads.\n  Arms control reductions have worked. So too will the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. I intend to work with a number of my \ncolleagues to see if we are able, in the coming weeks, to speak with \nsome aggressiveness on this issue here on the floor of the Senate and, \non behalf of the American people, to make the case that we ought to \nhave the opportunity to vote on the ratification of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. We ought to do it soon.\n\n  I have seen the agenda that has been offered by the Majority Leader \nas to what he hopes to bring to the floor to the Senate before Memorial \nDay, before the Fourth of July. This is not on it. It must be. It \nshould be. I hope it will be, because this is a critically important \nissue to our country and to the world.\n  Efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons are critical to \nour future.\n  Many countries want them. Only a few countries have access to them. \nWe must, at every step of the way, try to forge arms control agreements \nthat work. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is one step in \nthat direction.\n  Other steps include forging additional alliances with Russia who, as \nall of us know, is in some significant economic difficulty. We worry a \nlot about a range of issues with respect to their command and control \nof nuclear weapons.\n  But the first step, I think, is for the Senate to be given the \nopportunity to vote on and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty. I hope that is sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lawrence \nSlade, a fellow on the staff of Senator McCain, be granted privileges \nof the floor during the discussion of S. 1059, the national defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nS. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  It is my distinct privilege as chairman to make the initial statement \nregarding this bill. I acknowledge the presence on the floor of my \nsenior and most respected member, Mr. Thurmond, the former chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. He will be speaking to the Senate just \nafter the statements by the chairman and the ranking member. I thank \nSenator Levin, the ranking member. We came to the Senate together. I \nthink this is our 21st year. We have collaborated on many, many special \nassignments given to us by previous chairmen and/or ranking members \nthrough the years. I value our professional relationship and, indeed, \nour friendship.\n  I also wish to pay special acknowledgment to the subcommittee \nchairmen of the Armed Services Committee. Prior to this year, for some \n20 years, I was a subcommittee chairman. I understand the role of a \nsubcommittee chairman on our committee. But I must say, with great \nhumility, I think each of the subcommittee chairmen this year exceeded \nbeyond any current precedent their leadership, their hard work, \ntogether with their ranking member, in\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\npreparing the respective parts of this bill over which their \nsubcommittees have jurisdiction.\n  We have on our committee today marvelous participation by all members \nof the committee, on both sides of the aisle. I think our committee has \nhistorically operated and tried in every way to be nonpartisan on \nmatters of defense, and we have succeeded.\n  We are supported by just an extraordinary professional staff, and \nindeed other Members have their various personal staff members who work \nwith the professional staff, and it is all a team together working to \nproduce not only the bill but throughout the year to be responsive to \neach and every Member of the Senate with regard to their requests, or \nwhatever the case may be, as they relate to the jurisdiction of our \ncommittee. So I thank them all at this time, as we begin this very \nimportant presentation to the Senate for the year 2000.\n  I am extremely pleased to observe that this is the first time in \nnearly 15 years--15 consecutive years--that the defense budget before \nthe Senate represents an increase in real terms, real dollars in our \ndefense spending. This is a much-needed change, one that recognizes the \nproblems brought on by 14 years of decline in defense spending. This \noverlaps, as the Chair will quickly recognize, both Republican and \nDemocrat administrations. So this is not a political statement, \nalthough I do believe that the cuts under President Clinton have been \ntoo long and too deep. It was this year that the President, largely at \nthe urging of a very courageous and fine Secretary of Defense, our \nformer colleague, Secretary Cohen, and, indeed, members of the Joint \nChiefs, gave his support to raising defense spending levels.\n  Today, particularly under President Clinton, who has sent forward our \ntroops into harm's way more times on more different specific missions \nthan any other President in the history of this country, we are asking \nevery day, every month, every year, more and more of the men and women \nof the armed services at a time when we have this very, very low level \nof manning of all branches of our services.\n  At the same period, this world remains a place of ever increasing \nviolence and uncertainty. As U.S. national interests are challenged \nthroughout the globe, it is incumbent upon our military to be prepared \nto act when necessary, and act they have, with extraordinary commitment \nand professionalism.\n  Our military forces are currently strained by ongoing day-to-day \noperations. The contingency operations in Bosnia, Iraq, and throughout \nthe Balkan regions are putting a very severe strain on our overall \nmanning and commitments, and the families --may I underline ``the \nfamilies''--of these service members. In order for the military to \nrespond effectively, it must receive the resources necessary to equip, \ntrain, and operate.\n  Unfortunately, after years of declining budgets and continually \nincreasing deployments overseas, the military services are showing the \nbeginning signs of this overburdening. Recruiting and retention \nproblems are leading to shortfalls in key skills. Insufficient \nprocurement budgets have left our forces with equipment that is \nsomewhat unreliable because of age and, indeed, more costly every day \nto maintain. Inadequate infrastructure funding has resulted in the \ndegradation of the facilities in which our military personnel work and \nlive.\n  We must provide additional resources if we are to preserve this \nNation's security and the readiness of its Armed Forces. That is why \nthis bill before the Senate authorizes $288.8 billion in budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2000--$8.3 billion above the President's \nrequest.\n  I commend the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, for his \nsupport and his leadership. It doesn't just go back a few weeks; it \ngoes back well into last year. When consulting with him and, indeed, \nour distinguished chairman at that time, Senator Thurmond, the three of \nus recognized, together with other leaders in the Senate, such as \nSenator Stevens and Senator Domenici, that we have to bring about a \nreversal in this decline of defense spending. Those are the origins of \nthe change of this curve.\n  I want to note the extraordinary relationship that exists today \nbetween our committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nparticularly thank Senator Stevens and his staff director, Steve \nCortese, for their cooperation and support throughout the process of \nputting this bill together. Hopefully, Senator Stevens will follow soon \nbehind with his bill so that the Senate can have both to consider.\n  At this point I wish to take a moment to give credit to the Joint \nChiefs of Staff for helping to secure the additional funding for \ndefense. I think this is the first year in my 21 years that they have \nstepped forward with such absolute determination, vigor, and \nprofessional honesty and integrity and told the Senate--in effect, told \nthe American people--of the concerns they have not only for their \npersonnel but for the lack of funding needed to train the personnel, \nthe research and development needed for the future, and the procurement \ndecline we have experienced through these years. They came before the \nSenate committee last September and again in January, and they were \nvery forthright. I don't doubt for a minute that their determination \nwas the primary reason the President and the Secretary of Defense \nstepped up and began to support additional funding.\n  The Secretary of Defense, of course, all along had been counseling \nthe President, but I want to pay special respect to the Joint Chiefs.\n  It is by necessity that I address this question of the shortfall in \ndefense spending and lay it out historically over these 15 years.\n  But let no one, let no nation, let no leader, let no rogue or \nterrorist think for a moment that the men and women of the Armed Forces \nof the United States, together with their equipment and their readiness \nand training, aren't prepared to turn back any threat posed against \nthis Nation, or this Nation together with its allies.\n  In numerous committee hearings this year, the frightening magnitude \nof some of these problems was revealed. General Shelton, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff stated, ``Anecdotal and now measurable \nevidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the \nlong-term health of the Total Force is in jeopardy.'' General Shelton \nfurther informed the committee that our ability to execute our national \nmilitary strategy has declined so severely that it would ``* * * take \nus more time, and that time to victory would mean that we would lose \nterrain that we subsequently would have to regain. It means that the \ncasualties to the U.S. would be higher.'' Furthermore, according to the \nlatest Quarterly Readiness Report: ``* * * there are currently 118 \nCINC-identified readiness related deficiencies, of which 32 are \ndesignated category 1 deficiencies--ones which entail significant war \nfighting risk to execution of the National Military Strategy and are \nkey risk drivers for the MTW, Major Theater War, scenarios.''\n  During the committee's hearings on September 29, 1998 and January 5, \n1999, the Service Chiefs outlined the essential funding requirements \nnecessary to maintain the readiness of the armed forces. General \nShelton and the Chiefs identified a series of readiness and \nmodernization problems that, without additional funding of \napproximately $17.5 billion per year--I repeat, Mr. President--$17.5 \nbillion per year--would continue to degrade our military capability.\n\n  This figure does not include the additional funding necessary for \ncontingency operations such as those we are facing in Kosovo today and \nin Bosnia and Iraq. It does not include additional funding for these \ncontingency operations and increased pay and retirement benefits \nnecessary to address the serious problems in recruiting and retention. \nThis would cause additional requirements to exceed $20 billion per \nyear.\n  While the committee acknowledges that the administration's budget \nrequest contained additional money for defense--primarily because of \nthe Joint Chiefs and Secretary Cohen's direct pleas to the President, \nthe proposed budget request for fiscal year 2000 still falls short of \nmeeting the Service Chief's minimum requirements.\n  One of the noteworthy shortfalls within the budget request is the \nAdministration's request to incrementally fund military construction. \nSuch incremental funding would actually result in increased costs and \ndelays in\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nthe construction of critical facilities. In addition, although the \nadministration's fiscal year 2000 request represents an increase of \napproximately $500.0 million over the fiscal year 1999 budget request, \nit does not adequately fund the quality of life needs of the military \ndepartments. Therefore, the bill before the Senate allocates an \nadditional $3.3 billion to MILCON to fully fund the fiscal year 2000 \nmilitary construction and family housing programs requested by the \nAdministration, and to fund additional quality of life programs--those \ndetermined by the members of our committee to have that high priority.\n  A focus of the committee's action this year has been to address the \nserious problems we are having with recruiting and retaining a quality \nforce. In January, the committee moved quickly to report out--and the \nSenate subsequently passed--S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. The act authorized a 4.8-percent \npay raise, reformed the military pay tables, and improved the military \nretirement system.\n\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for 2000--this bill--includes \npay and compensation elements of S. 4, as well as other innovative \nproposals to offer incentives to potential recruits and active-duty \npersonnel.\n  We believe the policies recommended in this bill will enable the \nmilitary services to recruit and retain the number of quality personnel \nrequired to meet our national military strategy.\n  That is the heart and soul of this bill.\n  Again, I wish to commend Senator Lott and others who let this \ncommittee move out and have this as the first bill in the Senate to \nsend the strongest message to the men and women in the Armed Forces all \nacross the world that the Congress of the United States--certainly the \nSenate--stands beside them to see they are properly compensated and \nthat their families receive a fair return for their services and the \nrisks they take.\n\n  There it is. It is in here. I hope it receives the strongest support \nof the Senate.\n  The funding level of $288.8 billion for defense contained in the bill \nbefore the Senate represents a real increase of 2.2 percent over the \nfiscal year 1999 level. With the additional $8.3 billion over the \nbudget request, the committee has done the following:\n  Added more than $1.2 billion to primary readiness accounts, including \nammunition, training funds, base operations, and real property \nmaintenance.\n  Two, authorized net increases of $509.3 million for ballistic missile \ndefense programs; $218 million for military space programs and \ntechnologies; $111.6 million for strategic nuclear delivery vehicle \nmodernization; and $55 million and a fraction for military intelligence \nprograms; authorized $12.2 billion for atomic energy defense activities \nunder the Department of Energy, an $187 million increase over the 1999 \nfunding levels. That is an area in which the Presiding Officer has \ntaken a great deal of interest through the years.\n  Recommended a comprehensive set of provisions to enhance safeguards, \nsecurity and counterintelligence at DOE facilities in response to \nrecent and very, very grave and serious allegations regarding lack of \nsecurity at DOE laboratories.\n  We are learning every day about this breakdown in our \ncounterintelligence. Members are participating in this analyzation. It \nis very serious and requires the closest attention by every single \nMember of the Senate.\n  The committee has spent a good deal of time examining the allegations \nof Chinese espionage at the DOE facilities. The initiatives contained \nin this bill, I believe, will go a long way toward fixing the problems \nthat Congress continues to discover. I say ``continues,'' because more \nand more comes out every day.\n  In addition to the other items contained in this package, we have put \ninto statute many of the items contained in the Presidential Decision \nDirective 61. The Secretary of Energy has indicated his support for our \nlegislation. That is in this bill. We passed these provisions with \nstrong bipartisan support in the committee.\n  We also authorized a $855 million increase to the procurement budget \nrequest and a $213 million increase to research, development, test, and \nevaluation for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force seapower and \nstrategic lift programs. In addition, the committee authorized the \nbudget requests for construction of six new ships and robust research \nand development in the future ships DD-21, CVN(X), the Virginia class \nsubmarines, and CVN-77.\n  We added nearly $1.9 billion to procure a range of critical, unfunded \nrequirements, and over $280 million of vital research and development \nactivities for both air and land forces.\n  We establish 17 new National Guard Rapid Assessment and Initial \nDetection Teams for domestic response to terrorist attacks involving \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  This is a problem that this Senator considers the most serious facing \nthe United States of America. That is, terrorism, which no longer is \nbeyond our shores but which could be brought to our shores by any of \nthe people crossing through the ports and the airports of this great \nnation of ours. Regrettably, even someone of deranged mind here at home \ncould bring about the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Therefore, this Senator, and indeed this committee, is giving its \nstrongest support to prepare ourselves, hopefully, to deter any such \nattacks. If they occur, then the resources of the Department of Defense \nstand well trained to assist other departments and agencies of this \nGovernment in bringing about what solutions we would be faced with in \nsuch a horrible situation.\n  I established a new subcommittee this year called Merging Threats \nunder the very capable leadership of the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts. He will have more to say today about the very valuable work of \nthis subcommittee and its ranking member and other Members toward what \nI have described in meeting this particular threat here at home.\n  These particular teams, each comprised of 22 full-time National Guard \npersonnel specifically trained and equipped to deploy and assess \nsuspected nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological events in \nsupport of local first responders--that is, the local police, the local \nrescue, hospitals, volunteers all across our country; that is a local \nresponding--would provide greater team coverage nationwide and greatly \nincrease our ability to respond quickly to terrorist attack in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Now, I note that the National Guard is involved. Throughout this \nbill, throughout current military history, there is an ever and ever \nincreasing role for the Guard and Reserve forces. They comprise the \ntotal force, when you calculate the military capabilities of this \ncountry, and as each year goes by, more and more responsibility must be \nshared by the Active Forces with the Guard and the Reserve. They have \nperformed brilliantly.\n  Further, we establish a Department of Defense central transfer \naccount for all funds to combat terrorism both at home and abroad, \nestablish an information assurance initiative to strengthen DOD's \ninformation assurance program, and add an additional $120 million to \nthe administration's request for information assurance programs, \nprojects, and activities.\n  The committee also considered additional base closings. This is a \nvery serious subject, and my colleague, Mr. Levin, will have more to \nsay about this, as will Senator McCain. During markup, the committee \naddressed two amendments submitted by these Senators. Both were not \nvoted favorably by the committee.\n  Speaking for myself, I have historically supported BRAC as a means of \nreducing excess military infrastructure. As Secretary of the Navy, I \nremember vividly having closed the Boston Naval Shipyard, one of the \nmost significant base closings since World War II. I know how difficult \nit is on the local community and the State to see one of these \nfacilities close. It is not just a matter of economics, although that \nis very serious; it is a matter of pride; it is a matter of patriotism; \nit is a matter of generations of association of the men and women of \nthe military forces who were trained at and operated these bases. It \ngoes back into the sinews of our history.\n  Today, it is quite clear that the infrastructure and our inventory \nexceeds that which is needed by the current levels of the Armed Forces. \nMuch of our war-fighting capability has\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nchanged dramatically. I remember the first BRAC. I was coauthor of that \nlegislation. We closed a number of the old cavalry outposts that were \nbuilt for the sole reason of protecting the territories when Americans \nwere settling the West.\n  By the time we got around, I think, 10, 12 or 15 years ago, to \nclosing these bases, they had long since outlasted their military \ncontribution to the overall security of our Nation. Historically, the \ncountry has always been behind.\n  Again, I was the coauthor of the last BRAC bill. However, this time I \ndeclined and voted against the BRAC legislation for reasons that I will \nstate more succinctly and fully at the time the amendment is brought to \nthe floor today.\n  I believe the bill before the Senate is a vital first step in \nenhancing military readiness, modernizing our forces, and improving the \nquality of life of our service members and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a strong signal of support, a strong \nsignal of support to the men and women of the Armed Forces bravely \nperforming their responsibilities as their forefathers have done \nthroughout the history of this great Nation, formed 209-plus years ago. \nI anticipate with this bill and the bills that will follow we will \nalways keep America strong, a beacon of hope and freedom and security \nto the whole world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee in bringing S. 1059 to the floor. This is our \nfiscal year 2000 defense authorization bill. It is the product of many \nmonths of hard work by the committee under the leadership of our new \nchairman, Senator Warner, who has taken the baton from Senator \nThurmond, who had done an extraordinary job. Senator Thurmond, who is \non the floor, was chairman of our committee for many years. This year \nhe turned that responsibility over to Senator Warner, and Senator \nWarner has carried on with great strength and great commitment that is \nin keeping with the leadership Senator Thurmond showed when he was \nchairman of this committee. I commend Senator Warner for carrying on \nthat tradition of Senator Thurmond and, indeed, those before Senator \nThurmond.\n  As Senator Warner has pointed out, our staffs have been instrumental \nin helping us bring this bill to the floor. We had a unanimous vote for \nthis bill in committee. I think that is a real testament to the \nchairman's leadership. I commend him for it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it was a \npartnership between the Senator from Michigan and myself together with \nall members of our committee.\n  I think in the context of talking about Senator Thurmond, in the 21 \nyears we have been here, he served with the chairmen before Senator \nThurmond--Senator Nunn, Senator Tower, Senator Goldwater, Senator \nStennis. Indeed, both you and I were well trained by these very, very \nstrong and able leaders in the defense of our Nation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that is a view I fully share.\n  The bill we bring to the floor is a sound bill that goes a long way \nto meet the priorities which have been established by Secretary Cohen \nand the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is brought to the floor based on a \nvery sound foundation because General Shelton, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, has assured us, assured the committee, assured the \nCongress, and assured the Nation our Armed Forces are fundamentally \nsound and fundamentally capable of fulfilling their role in our \nnational military strategy. So we start with that sound foundation. \nObviously, there are some places where we have to put some additional \nresources. But the foundation is a sound one and the Chairman of our \nJoint Chiefs has assured us of that.\n  So, what we seek to do in this bill is build on that sound \nfoundation. I believe we have done so. In accordance with the fiscal \nyear 2000 budget resolution, the bill includes an $8 billion increase \nin budget authority above the level provided in the President's budget.\n  Unlike some of the budget increases in the past years, the added \nmoney in this bill will be spent in a much more responsible way than we \nhave sometimes done in the past, because the money we have added this \nyear is entirely spent for programs for which the Department of Defense \nhas indicated a real need. The bottom line is, this bill will improve \nthe quality of life for our men and women in uniform. It will improve \nthe readiness of our military. It will continue the process of \nmodernizing our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the future.\n  Virtually all the items for which the committee added funding were \ntaken from either the Services' unfunded priority list for fiscal year \n2000 or from the outyears of the future years' defense program, the so-\ncalled FYDP, which we deal with in the Armed Services Committee. These \nadd-ons include substantial increases for the highest priority \nreadiness items identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including an \nadded $554 million for real property maintenance, $420 million for base \noperations, $120 million for ammunition, $73 million for spare parts, \n$60 million for reserve component training, $40 million for depot \nmaintenance. This money will significantly enhance the ability of our \nArmed Forces to carry out their full range of missions.\n\n  These are areas where we sometimes fall short. These are not the most \nglamorous areas. They do not have a lot of people lobbying for them. \nBut they are critically important areas--real property maintenance, \nbase operation, spare parts, reserve component training, depot \nmaintenance.\n  In addition, the bill includes the triad of pay and retirement \ninitiatives sought by Secretary Cohen and by the Joint Chiefs--a 4.8-\npercent military pay raise for fiscal year 2000, reform of the military \npay table to increase pay for midcareer NCOs and officers, and changes \nto the military retirement system. These changes will, hopefully, help \naddress recruiting and retention problems we have in the services.\n  When S. 4 was considered on the Senate floor, we indicated then we \nwanted to do everything we could to ensure the men and women in uniform \nreceived fair compensation for the service they provide to our country. \nAt that time, I expressed concern about proceeding with the pay bill \noutside the context of the defense authorization bill and before \nCongress had passed a budget resolution. We have now revisited this \nissue in the context of the budget resolution and the authorization \nbill. I am pleased to report the changes in military pay and benefits \nproposed in this bill are all paid for.\n  Unfortunately, the committee has not yet been able to find a way to \nfund one of the most important aspects of S. 4, and that aspect is \nSenator Cleland's proposals to enhance the GI bill, which is so \nimportant in providing educational opportunities to the men and women \nin our Armed Forces. These provisions, Senator Cleland's proposal, \nwould provide substantial incentives to help address the current \nrecruiting and retention problems which face the military services \nwhile offering our men and women in uniform an educational opportunity \nin the proudest tradition of our country. I expect Senator Cleland will \nraise this issue again as we debate the bill on the floor.\n  I sincerely hope we will find a way to adopt these proposals. They \nare very important proposals. They are important to the retention we \nneed to enhance. They would be important even if there were not a \nretention problem, in terms of opportunities we should offer to the men \nand women in our Armed Forces.\n  The bill reported by the committee also provides full funding for the \nDepartment of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program with Russia \nand with other countries of the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, two \nof the three companion programs at the Department of Energy received \nsubstantially less funding than requested by the administration. The \nbill also contains some unfortunate restrictions on the DOE Nuclear \nCities Program, which I hope we will be able to address on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the related Department \nof Energy programs are one positive cornerstone of our relationship \nwith Russia. They play a vital role in our national security by \nreducing the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nfrom Russia and\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nfrom rogue nations with which Russia might be pressured to form closer \nties in the absence of these programs.\n  One area where I am most disappointed with the outcome of the markup \nis base closures, and our chairman has made reference to this issue.\n  The case for additional rounds of base closures is overwhelming. The \nSecretary of Defense has told us that more base closures are critical \nto meeting our future national security needs. The Secretary's letter \nreads, in part, as follows:\n\n       [N]o other reform--\n\n  No other reform--\n\n       even comes close to offering the potential savings afforded \n     by even a single round of BRAC.\n\n  Which is the base closing process.\n\n       There simply is no substitute for base closure and \n     realignment.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The two additional rounds under consideration by the \n     Committee will ultimately save $20 billion and generate $3.6 \n     billion annually. Both the Congressional Budget Office and \n     the GAO affirm the reasonableness and credibility of our \n     estimates for savings from BRAC. In exchange for property \n     that we neither want nor need, we can direct $3.6 billion on \n     an annual basis into weapons that give our troops a life-\n     saving edge, into training that keeps our forces the finest \n     in the world, and into the quality of life of military \n     families.\n\n  The Secretary concluded:\n\n       The Department's ability to properly support America's men \n     and women in uniform today and to sustain them into the \n     future hinge in great measure on realizing the critical \n     savings that only BRAC can provide. As such, the Chairman and \n     Joint Chiefs are unanimous in their support of our \n     legislative proposals, and I most strongly solicit your \n     support and that of your colleagues.\n\n  The Chiefs themselves--all of them, the Chairman and the other \nChiefs--wrote to us on May 10, a very strong letter, about the \nnecessity of adopting an additional round of base closings. Here is \nwhat they wrote to our chairman:\n\n       Previous BRAC rounds are already producing savings--$3.9 \n     billion net in 1999 and $25 billion through 2003. We believe \n     that two additional rounds of BRAC will produce even more \n     savings--an additional $3.6 billion each year after \n     implementation. This translates directly into the programs, \n     forces, and budgets that support our national military \n     strategy. Without BRAC, we will not have the maximum possible \n     resources to field and operate future forces while protecting \n     quality of life for our military members. We will also be \n     less able to provide future forces with the modern equipment \n     that is central to the plans and vision we have for \n     transforming the force.\n\n  These are our top military officials telling us about the importance \nof additional rounds of base closings, to remove the unneeded \ninfrastructure that we are now supporting, which drains resources that \nare needed for modernization, for readiness, for morale, for training.\n  We cannot justify maintaining excess infrastructure that we do not \nneed and, at the same time, say we have needs that must be addressed. \nWe cannot have this both ways. We do have needs that must be addressed, \nand we have infrastructure we do not need which, if removed, will \nprovide the resources to meet those needs.\n  Our top uniformed officers tell us the following:\n\n       BRAC is the single most effective tool available to the \n     Services to realign their infrastructure to meet the needs of \n     changing organizations and to respond to new ways of doing \n     business. No other initiative can substitute for BRAC in \n     terms of ability to reduce and reshape infrastructure. Simply \n     stated, our military judgment is that further base closures \n     are absolutely necessary.\n\n  Absolutely necessary is what the chairman and the members of the \nJoint Chiefs tell us.\n  These are not words of subtlety; these are very direct words which \ncome from our uniformed leadership in this country, and we should heed \nthem. I hope we will do that during consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two letters to which \nI have referred, in addition to a letter from the Service Secretaries \ndated May 11, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carl: As I have on many occasions, I want to convey my \n     strong support for approval of additional rounds of Base \n     Realignment and Closure (BRAC) authority as part of the FY \n     2000 Department of Defense Authorization Bill, which the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee is marking up this week.\n       As you are aware, the first three rounds of BRAC have \n     already yielded some $3.9 billion net savings in FY 1999 and \n     will generate more than $25 billion by the year 2003. These \n     savings have proven absolutely critical to sustaining ongoing \n     operations and current levels of military readiness, \n     modernization and the quality of life of our men and women in \n     uniform. Even still, the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     points out that the Department of Defense continues to retain \n     excess infrastructure, which we estimate at roughly 23 \n     percent beyond our needs.\n       As you know, we are aggressively reforming the Department's \n     business operations and support infrastructure to realize \n     savings wherever possible. Nevertheless, no other reform even \n     comes close to offering the potential savings afforded by \n     even a single round of BRAC. There simply is no substitute \n     for base closure and realignment.\n       The two additional rounds under consideration by the \n     Committee will ultimately save $20 billion and generate $3.6 \n     billion dollars annually. Both the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the GAO affirm the reasonableness andcredibility \n     of our estimates for savings from BRAC. In exchange for \n     property that we neither want nor need, we can direct $3.6 \n     billion on an annual basis into weapons that give our troops \n     a life-saving edge, into training that keeps our forces the \n     finest in the world, and into the quality of life of military \n     families.\n       I well appreciate both the difficult decision you and your \n     colleagues now face, as well as the legitimate concerns of \n     bases and communities potentially affected by additional \n     rounds of BRAC. At the same time, many success stories across \n     the nation prove that base closure and realignment can \n     actually lead to increased economic growth. In fact, the GAO \n     recently noted that in most post-BRAC communities incomes are \n     actually rising faster and unemployment rates are lower than \n     the national average. Moreover, the Department continues to \n     streamline the process, making it even easier for communities \n     to dispose of base property and to create new jobs in the \n     future.\n       The Department's ability to properly support America's men \n     and women in uniform today and to sustain them into the \n     future hinge in great measure on realizing the critical \n     savings that only BRAC can provide. As such, the Chairman and \n     Joint Chiefs are unanimous in their support of our \n     legislative proposals, and I most strongly solicit your \n     support and that of your colleagues.\n\n     Bill Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to you to express our \n     strong and unified support for authorization for additional \n     rounds of base closures when the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee marks up the FY 2000 Department of Defense \n     Authorization Bill next week.\n       Previous BRAC rounds are already producing savings--$3.9 \n     billion net in 1999 and $25 billion through 2003. We believe \n     that two additional rounds of BRAC will produce even more \n     savings--an additional $3.6 billion each year after \n     implementation. This translates directly into the programs, \n     forces, and budgets that support our national military \n     strategy. Without BRAC, we will not have the maximum possible \n     resources to field and operate future forces while protecting \n     quality of life for our military members. We will also be \n     less able to provide future forces with the modern equipment \n     that is central to the plans and vision we have for \n     transforming the force.\n       The Department's April 1998 report to Congress demonstrates \n     that 23 percent excess capacity exist. The Congressional \n     Budget Office agrees that our approach to estimating excess \n     capacity yields a credible estimate. The General Accounting \n     Office also agrees that DOD continues to retain excess \n     capacity.\n       The importance of BRAC goes beyond savings, however. BRAC \n     is the single most effective tool available to the Services \n     to realign their infrastructure to meet the needs of changing \n     organizations and to respond to new ways of doing business. \n     No other initiative can substitute for BRAC in terms of \n     ability to reduce and reshape infrastructure. Simply stated, \n     our military judgment is that further base closures are \n     absolutely necessary.\n       BRAC will enable us to better shape the quality of the \n     forces protecting America in the 21st century. As you \n     consider the 2000 budget, we ask you to support this \n     proposal.\n\n     Gen. Henry H. Shelton, USA,\n       Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff;\n     Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, USAF,\n       Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff;\n     Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, USA,\n       Chief of Staff, U.S. Army;\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\n     Adm. Jay L. Johnson, USN,\n       Chief of Naval Operations;\n     Gen. Michael E. Ryan, USAF,\n       Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force;\n     Gen. Charles C. Krulak, USMC,\n       Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This letter expresses our unqualified \n     support for legislative authority this year to conduct future \n     rounds of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).\n       Each of our services needs to reshape our base \n     infrastructure to meet new mission requirements. As a \n     practical matter, BRAC is the only tool we have available to \n     divest ourselves of unneeded infrastructure, consolidate \n     missions and free funds to improve priority programs on the \n     scale that we know is required. These priority programs are \n     the readiness, modernization and quality of life programs \n     that support our people. Prudent management of our \n     infrastructure requires us to stop spending critical funds on \n     the estimated 23 percent excess base capacity we no longer \n     need, so that we can focus our investments on those bases \n     that support our 21st century missions. We must refocus to \n     provide an efficient warfighting structure and to provide the \n     quality of life that is essential to retention and \n     recruitment.\n       The benefits of BRAC are real, significant and long \n     lasting. The estimated net savings through 2003, over $25 \n     billion, have already allowed us to better fund priority \n     programs. The annual recurring savings of almost $6 billion, \n     which the Congressional Budget Office considers reasonable, \n     will allow us to further improve these programs well into the \n     future. Additionally, we estimate two future BRAC rounds \n     could provide almost $20 billion in savings through the \n     implementation period and over $3.6 billion thereafter in \n     annual recurring savings.\n       We remain fully committed to assisting communities recover \n     economically from BRAC actions. Right now we are \n     concentrating on initiatives to accelerate property transfer \n     to further enhance economic redevelopment.\n       We ask that you support legislation for future BRAC rounds \n     so we can continue readiness, modernization and quality of \n     life improvements well into the 21st century.\n\n     Richard Danzig,\n       Secretary of the Navy;\n     F. Whitten Peters,\n       Acting Secretary of the Air Force;\n     Louis Caldera,\n       Secretary of the Army.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as our chairman indicated, the committee \nspent a great deal of time addressing security concerns at the \nDepartment of Energy. The revelations of Chinese espionage directed at \nthe DOE nuclear weapons program underscore 20 years of failure by the \nFBI and the Department of Energy, over the course of three \nadministrations, to take adequate steps to address security problems in \nthe Laboratories.\n  This problem has been ongoing for 20 years, through three \nadministrations, and we have not seen, until a Presidential decision \ndirective last year, an effort to significantly tighten security at the \nLaboratories.\n  We have in that Presidential decision directive, which is called PDD-\n61, a strong effort by this administration to tighten that security. \nWhat we do in this bill is to build on that effort, and we do so in a \nway which does not undermine the ability of the Department of Energy to \nperform its vital national security function.\n  I commend our chairman for his leadership in this effort. It is \nimportant that we do strengthen the security at the Department of \nEnergy. It is important that we take the effort which finally was made \nwhen this administration signed a Presidential decision directive, and \nthe President did so, but that we build additional safeguards which \nneed to be in law.\n  Here is what we have done. We have written much of that Presidential \ndecision directive into law. We have established an outside Commission \non Safeguards, Security and Counterintelligence at the Department of \nEnergy facilities. We have required a certification of the security \naspects of the lab-to-lab and foreign visitors programs from the \nSecretary of Energy, the Director of the CIA, and the Director of the \nFBI.\n  The bill reported by our committee includes many other important \nprovisions which will contribute to the national security and the \neffective management of the Department of Defense. Some of these \nprovisions are: a provision establishing a single account for all \nDepartment of Defense funds to combat terrorism, both at home and \nabroad; a series of provisions to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of health care provided to service men and women under the \nTriCare Program; a provision promoting reform of Department of Defense \nfinancial management systems; a series of provisions promoting more \neffective management of defense laboratories and test and evaluation \nfacilities; a provision extending the Department's mentor-protege \nprogram for small disadvantaged businesses.\n  I conclude by, again, thanking our new chairman, Senator Warner, for \nthe manner in which he and his staff have handled this bill. He has \nmaintained a great tradition of this committee, working with all \nmembers to make sure that all voices are heard in the effort which will \nalways be needed to protect the Nation's security.\n  I know there is going to be vigorous debate on some provisions of \nthis bill. We hope that Senators will, indeed, come to the floor and \noffer their amendments so that we can complete Senate action on the \nbill in a timely manner and go to conference.\n  But whatever the outcome of the debate on specific amendments or the \nvehemence of that debate, I think I can say unequivocally that our \nchairman, following in the footsteps of Senator Thurmond, has done so \nwith tremendous strength and has, in doing so, enhanced the security of \nthis Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I think his statement reflects the \npartnership in which we have worked and will continue to work.\n  We do urge Members to bring their amendments to the floor. Currently, \nwe have the following--I share with my colleague, and I think he is \naware of this: Senator Roberts has an amendment, Senator Specter has an \namendment, and Senator Roth has an amendment, the subject matter I am \nsure the Senator is familiar with.\n  It is the desire of the majority leader, and I presume with the \nconcurrence of the minority leader, that votes on these amendments will \noccur not before 5:30, but as soon thereafter as we can package them \nand have them sequentially. So that is for the information of all \nSenators.\n  I now yield the floor.\n  I see our distinguished former chairman, the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank you.\n  I want to withhold comment on what the chairman just said in terms of \nsequencing votes, because we are checking with some Senators on this \nside who may wish to debate one or more of those amendments to which \nthe Senator has referred. We have not seen final language on any of \nthem, I do not believe, so I want to at least alert the chairman I \nwould not want my silence to indicate concurrence in what he indicated \nand said until we have had a chance to review that. There is the \npossibility we would want to withhold votes on those until tomorrow, \nfor instance, but we need to see the language on those amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will provide our distinguished \ncolleague with those amendments. I believe at the desk now is the \nSpecter-Landrieu amendment. So one is before the Senate. I am now \nworking with Senator Roberts on a revision of his. I presume that the \nRoth amendment is pretty well in final form. I hope someone can inform \nthe Senator from Virginia as quickly as possible as to the text of the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Senator Warner and Senator Levin and my colleagues, as \nthe Senate begins consideration of the national defense authorization \nbill for fiscal year 2000, I join my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee in congratulating Chairman\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nWarner and the ranking member, Senator Levin, on their leadership in \npreparing a strong, bipartisan defense bill.\n  As the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I am well \naware of the challenges and demands they faced in the preparation of \nthe bill and believe they acheived all the objectives the committee \nestablished at the start of the year.\n  At the Armed Services Committee hearing on September 29, 1999, \nGeneral Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:\n\n       It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets \n     the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These \n     talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and ensured \n     our victory in Operation Desert Storm. These dedicated \n     professionals make it possible for the United States to \n     accomplish the many missions we are called on to perform \n     around the world every single day.\n\n  The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2000 ensures \nthat our Armed Forces can continue to carry out their global \nresponsibilities by focusing on readiness, future national security \nthreats, and quality of life. I am especially pleased with the focus on \nthe quality of life issues. Our military personnel and their families \nare expected to make great sacrifices and they deserve adequate \ncompensation. Therefore, I strongly support the 4.8 percent pay raise, \nthe changes in the retirement system, and the authority for military \npersonnel to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. These are critical \nprovisions, which when coupled with the additional family housing and \nbarracks construction, will result in a well-earned improvement in the \nstandard of living for all of our military personnel.\n  During the past several years many Senators have raised the specter \nof the declining readiness of our Armed Forces. The administration had \ncontinually denied this assertion until last fall, when each of the \nService Chiefs--I repeat, each of the Service Chiefs--acknowledged that \nreadiness was in fact a serious problem within our Armed Forces.\n  General Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff stated: ``Your Army is \nunderfunded today to adequately meet all the competing demands.''\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson, stated: ``I am deeply \nconcerned that we are at the beginning of a free-fall in terms of \nreadiness.''\n  And General Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, put it in \nthese words: ``We are ready today, but in order to maintain readiness \nand the current budgetary shortfall and those of previous years, we are \neffectively mortgaging the readiness of tomorrow's Marine Corps.''\n  The defense bill before us is a significant step toward correcting \nthe readiness issues identified by our Service Chiefs. It increases \nprimary readiness accounts by more than $1.2 billion; it increases the \nprocurement budget by more that $855 million and increases research and \ndevelopment by more than $200 million. Despite these significant \nfunding increases, I must emphasize that they are but a first step \ntoward reversing the readiness trends. We cannot be satisfied with \nthese increases and ensure continued robust funding increases for these \nprograms in future bills.\n\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall our Nation has faced ever changing \nthreats. Among these are the spread of nuclear and weapons of mass \ndestruction, international terrorism, and the ever increasing \nsophistication of weapons in the hands of countries throughout the \nworld. The bill provides the funding for the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of Energy to ensure that the Nation's military forces, \nboth active and reserve, are prepared to counter these threats as we \nenter the new millennium.\n  As with all legislation, there are provisions in this bill that I did \nnot support during the markup that I hope will be amended. \nSpecifically, I am opposed to the provision that would limit the \nability of the Federal Prison Industries to sell products to the \nDepartment of Defense and the provision in Title C of the bill \nregarding Tritium production. In my judgement, the Armed Services \nCommittee is overstepping its jurisdiction by legislating on the \nFederal Prison Industries, which is under the purview of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Regarding Tritium production, I am concerned that the \nprovision has been weakened to the point where the reliability and \nviability of our Nation's nuclear weapon's stockpile may be at risk. \nUnless we have strong language to support the Secretary of Energy's \ndecision to complete design for the Advanced Tritium Production source \nthere is a strong possibility that those who oppose a reliable and \neffective nuclear stockpile will delay tritium production beyond the \ntime we need tritium.\n  I have previously congratulated the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir work on this bill. Before closing, I want to congratulate each of \nthe subcommittee chairmen: Senator Smith, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Santorum, Senator Roberts, and Senator Allard, and the \nranking members for their contribution to this bill. Their leadership \nand work provided the foundation for this legislation. Finally, I \nbelieve it is important that we recognize Les Brownlee and David Lyles \nfor their leadership of a very professional and bipartisan staff. I \ndesire to thank Col. George Lauffer for his fine work.\n\n  This national defense authorization bill is a strong and sound bill. \nI intend to support it and urge my colleagues to join me in showing our \nstrong support for the bill and our men and women in uniform.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our distinguished former chairman \nfor that powerful statement. His firm hand and leadership are very much \na part of the everyday activities of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I can think of no Member of this body who has served in \nuniform longer than our distinguished colleague, who entered, in my \nrecollection, through the Army Reserve. I was there at a ceremony.\n  What was the year that you entered the Army Reserve, Senator? Anyway, \nway back----\n  Mr. THURMOND. What was the question?\n  Mr. WARNER. What was the year you entered the Army Reserve? I \nremember I was there when we recognized----\n  Mr. THURMOND. I finished college in 1923 and became 21 years of age \nin December of that year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Isn't that interesting. I remember when we gathered on \nthe steps of the west front of the Capitol to recognize the Senator for \nhis service. He fully understands the commitments made by men and women \nin the Armed Forces through several generations. That historical \nknowledge has been brought to bear many times on the decisionmaking \nresponsibilities of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, seeing no other Senator at the moment \nseeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 377\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, before I make remarks on behalf of the \namendment, which pretty well dovetails the second-degree amendment \nintroduced by the distinguished chairman of the committee, I would like \nto pay a deserved tribute to our distinguished chairman, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, for his leadership in forging a defense bill during a \ntime of great, great challenge.\n  During a time when our military is stressed, strained, and some of us \nbelieve hollow, our Nation needs those who will take a stand--a stand, \nif you will--to really try to fulfill the first obligation of our \nFederal Government, and that is to safeguard our national security.\n  Our new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in the \ntradition of Senator Thurmond, has been the right man at the right time \nfor the right job. He has, without question, reaffirmed the standing of \nthe influence of the committee. He has actually given the committee--in \nthis case, the creation of a new Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee--a chance to take a look at really what our Nation faces \nin terms of our national security threat in the post-cold-war period. I \nwant to thank him publicly for discussing with me the possibility of \nbeing the chairman of that committee and for that appointment.\n  I think the thing I want to mention the most in regard to the \nchairman's leadership and also that of Senator Levin is the pay raise \nand retirement reform contained in this bill. After hearing from the \nJoint Chiefs and knowing that we have a crisis in regard to retention \nof our men and women in uniform, the chairman, actually during the \nimpeachment process, sat us down to work and really hit the ground \nrunning.\n  Despite the criticism of those who wanted a much larger bill, a more \ncomprehensive bill, to address all of the problems that we face in the \nmilitary--and, by the way, I mention that these challenges include the \nquality of life issues, the health care issues, the issue of the \noperations tempo, the issue of the personnel tempo, and then that of \nmission quality. There are those who said, we are not quite sure that \nthis pay raise or this retirement reform will really address the \nretention problem. There are others who said they wanted to study it \nfurther. I suggest to them that if we studied it actually further, we \nwould be in such a problem with retention we would be past the marrow \nof the bone.\n  John Warner really took the issue by the horns and provided the \nleadership. We are sending a message to every man and woman in uniform, \nsaying that we care. And we took action, as I said before, despite the \nimpeachment proceedings and despite a very, very busy schedule here in \nthis Congress.\n  So thank you to John Warner and also to Senator Levin, whose \nexpertise in regard to his oversight and his policy actually keeps the \ncommittee with very strong leadership. It is a privilege to serve with \nboth Senators. I will make a statement at a later time in regard to the \nefforts by Senator Bingaman, who is the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Emerging Threats Subcommittee, and what we think we have been able \nto achieve.\n  Mr. President, I rise with the support of the chairman of the \ncommittee, as well as my colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, to \noffer an amendment to this bill, S. 1059. It is my hope that this \namendment will reaffirm the Senate's important responsibility of either \nrejecting or consenting to fundamental changes in the letter and spirit \nof existing treaties--in particular, when those changes actually \nbroaden the nature of U.S. military missions, responsibilities, and \nobligations overseas.\n  I ask my colleagues' support for a simple sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that calls for complete transparency on the part of the \nPresident and Senate consideration in regard to the de facto editing of \nthe original North Atlantic Treaty.\n  My sense-of-the-Senate simply asks the President to certify whether \nthe new strategic concept of NATO, this formalization of new and \ncomplicated United States military responsibilities in Europe, as \nevidenced by the war in Kosovo and the possibility of future Kosovos \naround the world, is in fact a document that obligates the United \nStates in any way, shape, or form. If so, my sense-of-the-Senate \naffirms that this body be given the opportunity to debate, accept, or \nreject the new blueprint for future NATO actions. These future actions \nwill undoubtedly include substantial components of our own Armed Forces \nengaged completely outside the province of the original treaty. We see \nthis today in regard to the ongoing operations in Bosnia, Albania, \nMacedonia, and over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. These \ndeployments are dominated by U.S. forces, ostensibly because of our \nresponsibilities as a NATO member.\n\n  During the cold war, the Congress and the American people believed \nthe original Nato Treaty was in our vital national security interest. I \nam not so sure we know now whether these new NATO missions meet that \nimportant criteria for the possibility of spilling American blood and \ntreasure. There has been a transformation Mr. President, and, while yes \nthe world has transformed since 1949, Congress still needs to be given \nthe opportunity to formally consider and endorse what we're signing up \nfor and committing to do in Europe and elsewhere around the world. \nGiven this situation, I believe it is imperative the Senate ask the \nPresident to formally certify whether the new Strategic Concept, which \nwas adopted during the 50-year anniversary here in Washington about a \nmonth ago, represents commitments by the United States, and, if so, \nsubmit the document for formal congressional scrutiny.\n  Let's be honest with the American people, Mr. President. If the new \nStrategic Concept of 1999 is the particular direction we're headed in \nregards to Europe, let's give this body and the\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nAmerican people a chance to formally agree or disagree. If only for \nbudgeting reasons, let's understand what we are committing to do so we \ncan plan and budget for it.\n  In this discussion, we must not lose sight of the fact that NATO is a \nmilitary alliance and the new Strategic Concept of 1999 is its guide \nfor the 21st century. This is a very important document the nineteen \nnations of NATO have drafted and I encourage every Senator to examine \nit closely, comparing it with the original North Atlantic Treaty. I \nbelieve Senators will find that the new Strategic Concept of 1999 \ndocument is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the original \ntreaty in critical areas. That means the treaty has been changed, \nalbeit rather quietly, during the 50-year anniversary celebration, and \nthe United States has formally committed to a new strategic direction \nin Europe.\n  It's time for the Senate to stop, take notice of what is happening to \nNATO, and go on record asserting its constitutional role.\n  Through the new Strategic Concept of 1999, President Clinton, along \nwith the member nations of NATO, has quite possibly taken the \ncommonsense notion of mutual consultation for self-defense purposes \nimplicit in Article Four of the original NATO Treaty and altered \nsubstantially the very purpose of the NATO Alliance from one of \ncollective self-defense of member territory to international crisis \nmanagement and humanitarian relief operations. As a matter of fact, I \nthink the Strategic Concept is reflective for the most part in \nreference to a speech the President gave over 2 years ago at The Hague \noutlining what he thought the Strategic Concept and the new goals of \nNATO should be.\n  Additionally, I believe the new Concept document is not merely a tool \nfor justifying existing extraterritorial NATO deployments of American \nmilitary forces, but is a precedent toward formalizing as U.S. policy \nthe lazy tendency of this Administration and yes, others to rely \nincreasingly on the military services to solve social and political \nproblems in Europe and elsewhere. Problems, I would say, Mr. President, \nfor which other instruments of power are clearly better suited for \nthose tasks.\n  I want to assure my colleagues, Mr. President, I have decided to \nsubmit my amendment as a Sense of the Senate because my objective is \nnot to brazenly force the President to do something he, in his \nauthority as Chief Executive to represent the nation in foreign \naffairs, has decided not to do or would not do. However, I am trying to \nencourage the Administration to be clear with the Congress and the \nAmerican people--indeed to seek our consent and the public's approval--\nin regards to this national security policy divergence.\n  I am sure opponents of my amendment will argue that the new Strategic \nConcept of 1999 is only that, a concept, an intellectual exercise, mere \nmusings as to future security challenges in the North Atlantic region. \nI disagree. My colleagues, do not let the title fool you! The 65-point \ndocument states its intent is to be a ``guide that expresses NATO's \nenduring purpose and nature and its fundamental security tasks, \nidentifies the central features of the new security environment, \nspecifies the elements of the Alliance's broad approach to security, \nand provides guidelines for the further adaptation of its military \nforces.'' That is a direct quote.\n\n  For a Congress constitutionally required to provide funding for and \noversight to the Departments of State and Defense, those are specific \npurposes and very clear intentions.\n  I am sure some opponents will also argue that regardless of the \nspecificity of the new Strategic Concept, it is not a formal treaty and \ntherefore should not be sent to the Senate. I really think that is \nputting the cart before the horse. First, let's get our definitions \nstraight. The U.S. Department of State Circular 175, Procedures on \nTreaties, defines a treaty as ``an international agreement regardless \nof title, designation, or form whose entry into force with respect to \nthe United States takes place only after the Senate has given its \nadvice and consent.''\n  I will certainly concede that the new Strategic Concept is not a \ntreaty per se, that that is only because the Senate has not given nor \nhad an opportunity to give its advice and consent. If we formally \nadopted the logic that the President should only send actual treaties \nto the Senate, the treaty clause of article II of the Constitution \nwould become irrelevant, contrary to the framers' intent.\n  My point is that the decision of the President to submit an \ninternational agreement to the Senate is largely a political decision. \nNonetheless, when a document tacitly commits the United States to a new \nstrategic direction in Europe, it should contain the Senate's stamp of \napproval. It does not have it.\n  Opponents of my amendment will further argue that the new Concept is \nnot even an international agreement, much less a potential treaty. I \nbelieve any document that contains even tacit commitment by the United \nStates and other nations to engage in new types of NATO missions \noutside the domain of the original treaty, as well as the commitment to \nstructure military forces accordingly, can be considered an \ninternational agreement.\n  Incidentally, the U.S. Department of State Circular 175, Procedures \non Treaties, also sets forth eight considerations available for \ndetermining whether an agreement or an accord should be submitted to \nthe Senate for ratification. Among them: The extent to which the \nagreement involves commitments or risks affecting the Nation as a \nwhole--if that is not a description of Kosovo, I do not know what it \nis--whether the agreement can be given effect without the enactment of \nsubsequent legislation by the Congress; past U.S. practices as to \nsimilar agreements and the preference of Congress as to a particular \ntype of agreement.\n\n  In mentioning these criteria, I must note that last year Senators \nCleland, Snowe, and I attempted to clarify administration policy in the \nuse of military force by attaching several consulting requirements to \nfiscal year 1999 defense spending legislation.\n  My question is: In order to determine what the strategic plan is, \nwhat our obligations are, what we are doing in Kosovo and other areas \nof the world, does that have to be done each year? Let's get the Senate \ninvolved at the outset. It is the Strategic Concept that is at the \ngenesis of this kind of policy.\n  The first State Department consideration is the most significant for \npurposes of our discussion. I genuinely believe that the new Strategic \nConcept of 1999 and its predecessor document, without question, \ninvolved commitments and risks affecting the Nation as a whole. In \nfact, I could not have put it more succinctly. That is one of the \nreasons our distinguished chairman, Senator Warner, wrote to the \nadministration on this issue as the recent NATO summit, the 50-year \nanniversary, approached. He knew the document's revision was very \nimminent. He wanted to have a debate here in the Congress before moving \nforward with the other 19 nations. I commend our chairman for his \nknowledge, his foresight, and his leadership on this issue.\n  As for the second State Department consideration I mentioned, the new \nConcept of 1999 probably cannot be given effect without the enactment \nof subsequent legislation by the Congress--without, that is, huge \ndefense appropriation and authorization acts that try to balance the \nreadiness and the modernization and quality-of-life requirements which \nthis bill tries to address with numerous peacekeeping enforcement \nmissions.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle may also argue--in good faith, I \nmight add--that the Resolution of Ratification for an expanded NATO \nwhich passed this body last spring contained conditions for revising \nNATO's Strategic Concept which effectively constitute a Senate \nendorsement of the new Strategic Concept of NATO.\n  Again, I disagree. When we compare the actual text of the new Concept \nand the Resolution of Ratification adopted only last year, not only do \nwe see the complete abandonment of the original 1949 treaty, but it is \nalso a document that has gone way beyond what the Senate actually \nintended.\n  Section 3 of the Resolution of Ratification as passed by the Senate \nApril 30 of last year contained the following conditions for the new \nStrategic Concept. Let's compare these with the Concept document. The \nRatification Resolution stated:\n\n       (1) The strategic concept of NATO: (A) Policy of the United \n     States toward the strategic concept of NATO--the upcoming \n     revision of\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\n     that document will reflect the following principles:\n       (i) First and foremost a military alliance: NATO is first \n     and foremost a military alliance. NATO's success in securing \n     peace is predicated on its military strength and strategic \n     unity.\n       (ii) Principal foundation for defense of security interests \n     of NATO members: NATO serves as the principal foundation for \n     collectively defending the security interests of its members \n     against external threats.\n\n  However, Senators, I urge you to read this--this document is on your \ndesks--in the Strategic Concept adopted at the 50th anniversary \ncelebration in Washington last month:\n\n       Strategic Concept point #24: Any armed attack on the \n     territory of the Allies, from whatever direction, would be \n     covered by Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty. \n     However, Alliance security must also take account of the \n     global context [emphasize the word ``global'']. Alliance \n     security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider \n     nature, including acts of terrorism, sabotage, organized \n     crime, and by the disruption of the flow of vital resources. \n     The uncontrolled movement of large numbers of people, \n     particularly as a consequence of armed conflicts, can also \n     pose problems for security and stability affecting the \n     Alliance. Arrangements exist within the Alliance for \n     consultation among the Allies under Article 4 of the \n     Washington Treaty and, where appropriate, co-ordination of \n     their efforts including their responses to risks of this \n     kind.\n\n  I must point out, that last phrase is completely original. There is \nnothing in article 4 of the original NATO treaty even remotely similar \nto the term ``the coordination of their efforts including their \nresponses to risks of this kind.'' It is just not there. I cannot \nimagine more substantive change to the NATO treaty than adding a \ncollective response obligation for the United States to respond to \nterrorism and other asymmetrical threats not only in Europe but all \naround the globe.\n  The Resolution of Ratification continues--again, that was the \nexpansion treaty that was passed as of last year:\n\n       (iii) Promotion and protection of United States vital \n     national security interests: Strong United States leadership \n     of NATO actually promotes and protects United States vital \n     national security interests.\n       (iv) United States leadership role: [Now, this is in last \n     year's language in regard to the ratification of the \n     expansion.] The United States maintains its leadership role \n     in NATO through the stationing of United States combat forces \n     in Europe, providing military commanders for key NATO \n     commands, and through the presence of United States nuclear \n     forces on the territory of Europe.\n\n  However, 1 year later in the Strategic Concept, point No. 18 --and I \nurge Senators to pay attention to it:\n\n       As stated in the 1994 Summit declaration and reaffirmed in \n     Berlin in 1996, the Alliance fully supports the development \n     of the European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI) within \n     the Alliance by making available its assets and capabilities \n     for Western European Union (WEU)-led operations. To this end, \n     the Alliance and WEI have developed a close relationship and \n     put into place key elements of the ESDI as agreed in Berlin. \n     In order to enhance peace and stability in Europe and more \n     widely, the European Allies are strengthening their capacity \n     for action, including by increasing their military \n     capabilities. The increase of the responsibilities and \n     capacities of the European Allies with respect to security \n     and defense enhances the security of the environment of the \n     Alliance.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the WEU will be using NATO military equipment \npaid for by the taxpayers of the United States. That may be proper, \nthat may be a role for NATO, but I think we need to review that \nproposal.\n  The Resolution of Ratification of last year does continue:\n\n       (v) Common threats: NATO members will face common threats \n     to their security in the post-Cold War environment \n     including--\n       (I) the potential for the re-emergence of a hegemonic power \n     confronting Europe;\n       (II) rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver \n     these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles, or other \n     unconventional delivery means;\n       (III) threats after wider nature, including the disruption \n     of the flow of vital resources, and other possible \n     transnational threats; and\n       (IV), conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic \n     disputes, and the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n\n  All that was contained in the language when we ratified the expansion \nin regard to that treaty last year, 1 year later.\n\n       Strategic Concept point #20: The security of the Alliance \n     remains subject to a wide variety of military and non-\n     military risks which are multi-directional and often [very] \n     difficult to predict. These risks include social and \n     political difficulties, ethnic and religious rivalries, \n     territorial disputes, inadequate or failed efforts at reform, \n     the abuse of human rights, and the dissolution of states can \n     lead to local and even regional instability. The resulting \n     tensions could lead to [the] crises affecting [the] Euro-\n     Atlantic stability, to human suffering, and to armed \n     conflicts.\n\n  Nonmilitary risks, Mr. President? Inadequate or failed efforts at \nreform? What are we talking about? I do not recall those phrases in the \nResolution of Ratification. Why would a military alliance such as NATO \ncare about a nonmilitary risk? What is a nonmilitary risk anyway?\n  The Resolution of Ratification continues, as of last year:\n\n       (vi) Core mission of NATO: Defense planning will affirm a \n     commitment by NATO members to a credible capability for \n     collective self-defense, which remains the core mission of \n     NATO. All NATO members will contribute to this core mission.\n\n  No argument there. That is the historical purpose of NATO and that is \ncollective security.\n  One year later, with the Strategic Concept, while they were popping \nchampaign corks in regard to NATO being 50 years old:\n\n       Strategic Concept point #10: To achieve its essential \n     purpose, as an Alliance of nations committed to the \n     Washington Treaty and the United Nations Charter, the \n     Alliance performs the following fundamental security tasks:\n       Deterrence and defense: To deter and defend against any \n     threat of aggression against any NATO member state as \n     provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty.\n       Crisis management: To stand ready, case-by-case and by \n     consensus, in conformity with Article 7 of the Washington \n     Treaty, to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to \n     engage actively in crisis management, including crisis \n     response operations.\n\n  I am glad to see that deterrence and defense is still there. But, \nagain, this emphasis on conflict prevention and crisis management is \nextremely disconcerting and not consistent with the Resolution of \nRatification that was passed in the Senate as of last year.\n  The Resolution of Ratification continues--we are talking about \nsection 7:\n\n       (vii) Capacity to respond to common threats: NATO's \n     continued success requires a credible military capability to \n     deter and respond to common threats. Building on its core \n     capabilities for collective self-defense of its members, NATO \n     will ensure that its military force structure, defense \n     planning, command structures, and force goals promote NATO's \n     capacity to project power when the security of a NATO member \n     is threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members. This will require that \n     NATO members possess national military capabilities to \n     rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations \n     for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the \n     United States in high intensity conflicts.\n\n  However, 1 year later, in the Strategic Concept point No. 49:\n       In contributing to the management of crises through \n     military operations, the Alliance's forces will have to deal \n     with a complex and diverse range of actors, risks, situations \n     and demands, including humanitarian emergencies. Some non-\n     Article 5 crisis response operations may be as demanding as \n     some collective defense missions. Well-trained and well-\n     equipped forces at adequate levels of readiness and in \n     sufficient strength to meet the full range of contingencies \n     as well as the appropriate support structures, planning tools \n     and command and control capabilities are essential in \n     providing efficient military contributions.\n\n  I do not know how this Nation is to fund, structure, and train U.S. \nmilitary forces to manage parochial crises in Europe, no matter how \nsmall, through military operations. Nor do I think that is the best use \nof our forces, if you consider already we must meet the two major \nregional conflict response thresholds within serious budget \nconstraints.\n  Again, I do not see this use of military forces endorsed in the \nResolution of Ratification that the Senate passed last year. The \nResolution of Ratification does continue:\n\n       The fundamental importance of collective defense:\n\n  This was last year.\n\n       The Senate declares that--\n       (i) in order for NATO to serve the security interests of \n     the United States, the core purpose of NATO must continue to \n     be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO \n     members; and\n       (ii) NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis, engage in other \n     missions where there is a consensus among its members that \n     there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO \n     members.\n\n  However, once again, in the Strategic Concept, 1 year later, at the \ncelebration, the 50-year celebration, No. 48:\n\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n\n       The maintenance of the security and stability of the Euro-\n     Atlantic area is of key importance. An important aim of the \n     Alliance and its forces is to keep risks at a distance by \n     dealing with potential crises at an early age. In the event \n     of crises which jeopardize Euro-Atlantic stability and could \n     affect the security of Alliance members, the Alliance's \n     military forces may be called upon to conduct crisis response \n     operations. They may also be called upon to contribute to the \n     preservation of international peace and security by \n     conducting operations in support of other international \n     organizations, complementing and reinforcing political \n     actions within a broad approach to security.\n\n  What do we mean by this--``keep risks at a distance by dealing with \npotential crises at an early stage''? Isn't that the job of diplomacy? \nAnyway, the list of inconsistencies between the Resolution of \nRatification and the new Strategic Concept of 1999 goes on and on and \non.\n  I have taken a great deal of time of the Senate and my colleagues to \nbe specific about this. Even if they were more consistent, it does not \nchange the fact that the Strategic Concept of 1999 fundamentally alters \nthe nature and the domain of the original treaty that this Senate \nratified just a year ago.\n  So, in closing, I think my bipartisan amendment, warrants support \nbecause it is time to go on record that the Senate insists that changes \nto the original scope and purpose of the alliance go through proper \nchannels, specifically article II, section 2, clause 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment, which the Senator and I \nrefer to as the Roberts-Warner amendment, is one which obviously I \nstrongly support.\n  I first ask unanimous consent that correspondence the Senator from \nVirginia had with the President of the United States be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend the Senator. We have been working on parallel \ntracks on this issue for some months now. I cannot think of a more \nimportant amendment that will be added to this bill than the one of \nwhich my distinguished colleague from Kansas is the principal sponsor. \nAt this very moment, well over half of the tactical aircraft are being \noperated by U.S. air men and women; well over 70 percent of the support \naircraft, the tankers, the intelligence aircraft and all of those, the \nspotters and the like, are being operated by U.S. airpersons.\n  It is the Strategic Airlift Command which is heroically--together \nwith the Air Guard, I add, which, of course, is part of that command--\ncarrying out the vast preponderance of the missions associated with \nairlift in this operation in Kosovo.\n  If there is one thing this operation tells us, it is that future \nconflicts are becoming more and more dependent on modern technology. \nThe weapons being employed in this air-only campaign are guided \nmissiles, again predominantly provided by the United States.\n  The other nations of NATO, for whatever reasons, simply have not \nequipped themselves or trained their personnel in sufficient numbers to \nconduct an operation of this magnitude. That is not in any way to \ndetract from their courage in flying their missions, and approximately \neight other nations are joining in this air operation. Whether they are \nsingle aircraft, or two aircraft or one mission a day--whatever it is--\nthey are an integral part. I salute them, and I respect them, but \nstatistically, it is the taxpayers of the United States and it is the \nyoung men and women wearing the uniform of the United States who are \ncarrying the brunt of this operation.\n  The Senator brings to the attention of the Senate that at this 50th \nanniversary summit conference, this document, to which he has referred \nseveral times, was adopted. In any reading of this document by this \nSenator, and I think any other Senator, it will clearly show that it is \nthe intention of the summit to push beyond the horizon of the original \nNATO of 1949, to push beyond the horizon of the 1991 Strategic Concept \nthe potential missions of this historic organization.\n  It is the absolute fundamental right of the Senate, under the treaty \nclause of the Constitution, to review in detail, and I say carefully, \nwhat is proposed--I repeat, proposed--by the 50th anniversary summit.\n\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct a series of hearings \nonce the hostilities and the risk of NATO forces is in one way or \nanother--I hesitate to use the word ``terminated'' because I am not \ncertain if that word is applicable to this situation which in itself is \nso filled with uncertainty, but whenever the hostilities are contained \nto the point where the Armed Services Committee can begin to look at \nwhat went right and what went wrong in the conduct of the military \noperations and, most particularly--most particularly--this consensus by \nthe 19-nation doctrine by which this operation has been, is, and will \nbe conducted for an indefinite period of time.\n  I first became concerned about this new doctrine early this spring. I \nwrote to the President on April 7 urging him not to allow the summit to \n``finalize''--that is the word I used--or write in stone, I said at \nthat time, a new Strategic Concept. Why not just wait until the Kosovo \noperation gets to that point where hopefully hostilities have subsided \nand you sit down and study that operation, and from that study you \nwould be better able to devise what NATO should do in the future \nregarding comparable operations.\n  I said:\n\n       The intent of this letter is to give you my personal view \n     that a final decision by NATO on the Strategic Concept should \n     not be taken--risked--against the uncertainties emanating \n     from the Kosovo situation. The United States and our allies \n     will have many lessons learned to assess as a pivotal part of \n     the future Strategic Concept. Bosnia and Kosovo have been \n     NATO's first forays into aggressive military operations. As \n     of this writing----\n\n  That is April 7--\n\n     the Kosovo situation is having a destabilizing effect on the \n     few gains made to date in Bosnia. This combined situation \n     must be carefully assessed and evaluated before the United \n     States and our allies sign on to a new Strategic Concept for \n     the next decade of NATO.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President disagreed with my assessment, and on \nApril 24, NATO went on to finalize a new Strategic Concept, and that \ndocument has been discussed in length by my colleague.\n  The main difference in the security tasks identified in the 1991--Mr. \nPresident, about every decade, NATO seems to get down to revising its \nfuture missions, and the 1991 document was clearly out of date. It \nstill referred to the threat from the Soviet Union. So time had come, \nof course, to revise it. All I said is let's just wait a reasonable \nperiod of time and assess the lessons learned and let the American \npeople give direction to the President and give direction to the \nCongress if, in fact, they want to be part of a military alliance where \ncertainly in this operation well over half of it is being conducted by \ntheir own sons and daughters, and the price to be paid is still \nunknown. It will be heavy and it will be paid by the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I recently had a very distinguished former Secretary of Defense write \nand tell me: Assess the costs being borne by the United States and the \nother NATO nations and that will be, I say to my former friend, the \nSecretary of Defense many years ago, that will be a central focal point \nof the hearings by this committee in the future.\n  But those costs are going to be enormous to the American taxpayers. \nWe first have the risk to the men and women of our country, the \ndisproportionate contribution by our military assets, and the costs \nthat will be allocated to the American taxpayer.\n\n  Back to my letter to the President. I said that we can wait another 2 \nor 3 months. We have waited since 1991. Why do we have to rush into \nanother one? But the President, in his letter, declined to do it.\n  The main difference in the security tasks identified in the 1991 \nStrategic Concept and the document adopted this April is the addition \nof a ``crisis management'' task, and an emphasis on non-article 5 \ncrisis operations. Non-article 5 operations were not even mentioned in \nthe 1991 Strategic Concept.\n  I say to my colleague from Kansas, they were not even mentioned, but \nthey are written throughout this new one which was promulgated this \nApril. I will read one paragraph:\n\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n\n       The security of all allies is indivisible. An attack on one \n     is an attack on all. With respect to collective defense under \n     article 5 of the Washington Treaty--\n\n  Of course, that is the 1949 treaty--\n\n     the combined military forces of the alliance must be capable \n     of deterring any potential aggression against it, of stopping \n     an aggressor's advance as far forward as possible should an \n     attack nevertheless occur and assuring the political \n     independence and territorial integrity of its member states.\n\n  Here is the key sentence:\n\n       They must also be prepared to contribute to conflict \n     prevention and to conduct a non-article 5 crisis response \n     operation.\n\n  That means going beyond the territorial boundary of the 19 nations.\n  The vote of the American people through its elected Members of the \nSenate is absolutely essential before we sign on to such a mission. I \ncommend my colleague for bringing that to the attention of the Senate \nin the form of this amendment.\n  According to the new Strategic Concept, the alliance is tasked ``to \nstand ready, case-by-case by consensus . . . to contribute to effective \nconflict prevention, and to engage actively in crisis management, \nincluding crisis response operations.\n  Kosovo is an example of a non-article 5 crisis response operation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Administration, in consultation \n     with our NATO allies, is now finalizing various documents to \n     be submitted to the Heads of State for ratification at the \n     upcoming 50th anniversary NATO Summit to be held in \n     Washington later this month. A key decision, in my view the \n     most important one, is the revision of the Strategic Concept \n     for the future--perhaps a decade--that will guide NATO in its \n     decision making process regarding the deployment of military \n     forces.\n       I am recommending, Mr. President, that a draft form of this \n     document be reviewed by the principals, but not finalized, at \n     this 50th anniversary Summit. Given the events in Kosovo, a \n     new Strategic Concept for NATO--the document that spells out \n     the future strategy and mission of the Alliance--should not \n     be written `in stone' at this time. Instead, NATO leaders \n     should issue a draft Strategic Concept at the Summit, which \n     would be subject to further comment and study for a period of \n     approximately six months. Thereafter, a final document should \n     be adopted.\n       NATO is by far the most successful military alliance in \n     contemporary history. It was the deciding factor in avoiding \n     widespread conflict in Europe throughout the Cold War. \n     Subsequent to that tense period of history, NATO was, again, \n     the deciding factor in bringing about an end to hostilities \n     in Bosnia, and thereafter providing the security essential to \n     allow Bosnia to achieve the modest gains we have seen in the \n     reconstruction of the economic, political and security base \n     of that nation.\n       Now NATO is engaged in combating the widespread evils of \n     Milosevic and his Serbian followers in Kosovo.\n       I visited Kosovo and Macedonia last September and witnessed \n     Milosevic's repression of the Kosovar Albanians. Thereafter, \n     I spoke in the Senate on the essential need for a stabilizing \n     military force in Kosovo to allow the various international \n     humanitarian organizations to assist the people of Kosovo--\n     many then refugees in their own land, forced into the hills \n     and mountains by brutal Serb attacks. Since then, I have \n     consistently been supportive of NATO military action against \n     Milosevic.\n       Unfortunately, it is now likely that the NATO Summit will \n     take place against the background of continuing, unfolding \n     events relating to Kosovo. At this time, no predictions can \n     be made as to a resolution.\n       We are just beginning to learn important lessons from the \n     Kosovo conflict. Each day is a new chapter. For example, NATO \n     planners and many in the Administration, and in Congress, \n     have long been aware of the disparities in military \n     capabilities and equipment between the United States and our \n     allies. Now, the military operation against Yugoslavia has \n     made the American people equally aware and concerned about \n     these disparities. The U.S. has been providing the greatest \n     proportion of attack aircraft capable of delivering \n     precision-guided munitions. Further, the United States is \n     providing the preponderance of airlift to deliver both \n     military assets (such as the critically needed Apache \n     helicopters and support equipment) and humanitarian relief \n     supplies, the delivery of which are now in competition with \n     each other.\n       Until other NATO nations acquire, or at least have in place \n     firm commitments to acquire, comparable military \n     capabilities, the United States will continually be called on \n     to carry the greatest share of the military responsibilities \n     for such `out of area' operations in the future. This issue \n     must be addressed, and the Congress consulted and the \n     American people informed.\n       It is my understanding that the draft Strategic Concept \n     currently under consideration by NATO specifically addresses \n     NATO strategy for non-Article 5, `out of area' threats to our \n     common interests--threats such as Bosnia and Kosovo. \n     According to Secretary Albright in a December 8, 1998 \n     statement to the North Atlantic Council, `The new Strategic \n     Concept must find the right balance between affirming the \n     centrality of Article V collective defense missions and \n     ensuring that the fundamental tasks of the Alliance are \n     intimately related to the broader defense of our common \n     interests.' Is this the type of broad commitment to be \n     accepted in final form, just weeks away at the 50th \n     anniversary Summit?\n       During the Senate's debate on the Resolution of \n     Ratification regarding NATO expansion, the Senate addressed \n     this issue by adopting a very important amendment put forth \n     by Senator Kyl. But this was before the events in Kosovo. The \n     lessons of Kosovo could even change this position.\n       The intent of this letter is to give you my personal view \n     that a `final' decision by NATO on the Strategic concept \n     should not be taken--risked--against the uncertainties \n     emanating from the Kosovo situation.\n       The U.S. and our allies will have many ``lessons learned'' \n     to assess as a pivotal part of the future Strategic Concept. \n     Bosnia and Kosovo have been NATO's first forays into \n     aggressive military operations. As of this writing, the \n     Kosovo situation is having a destabilizing effect of the few \n     gains made to date in Bosnia. This combined situation must be \n     carefully assessed and evaluated before the U.S. and our \n     allies sign on a new Strategic Concept for the next decade of \n     NATO.\n       A brief period for study and reflection by ourselves as \n     well as our Allies would be prudent. NATO is too vital for \n     the future of Europe and American leadership.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your thoughtful letter on \n     the upcoming NATO summit and the revised Strategic Concept. I \n     appreciate your attention to these important issues, and I \n     agree strongly with your view that NATO's continued vitality \n     is essential to a safeguarding American and European \n     security.\n       I have thought carefully about your proposal to delay \n     agreement on the revised Strategic Concept in light of NATO's \n     military operations in Kosovo. While I share your deep \n     concern about the situation in Kosovo and the devastating \n     effects of Serb atrocities, I am convinced that the right \n     course is to proceed with a revised Strategic Concept that \n     will make NATO even more effective in addressing regional and \n     ethnic conflict of this very sort. Our operations in Kosovo \n     have demonstrated the crucial importance of NATO being \n     prepared for the full spectrum of military operations--a \n     preparedness the revised Strategic Concept will help ensure.\n       The Strategic Concept will reaffirm NATO's core mission of \n     collective defense, while also making the adaptations needed \n     to deal with threats such as the regional conflicts we have \n     seen in Bosnia and Kosovo as well as the evolving risks posed \n     by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It will \n     also help ensure greater interoperability among allied forces \n     and an increased European contribution to our shared \n     security. The Strategic Concept will not contain new \n     commitments or obligations for the United States but rather \n     will underscore NATO's enduring purposes outlined in the 1940 \n     North Atlantic Treaty. It will also recognize the need for \n     adapted capabilities in the face of changed circumstances. \n     This approach is fully consistent with the Kyl Amendment, \n     which called for a strong reaffirmation of collective defense \n     as well as a recognition of new security challenges.\n       The upcoming summit offers a historic opportunity to \n     strengthen the NATO Alliance and ensure that it remains as \n     effective in the future as it has been over the past fifty \n     years. While the situation in Kosovo has presented difficult \n     challenges, I am confident that NATO resolve in the face of \n     this tyranny will bring a successful conclusion.\n       Your support for the NATO Alliance and for our policy in \n     Kosovo has been indispensable. I look forward to working \n     closely with you in the coming days to ensure that the summit \n     is an overwhelming success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I assure the Senate that we will deliberate this \namendment tomorrow again, I say to the Senator. We are not able to \ncomplete it today due to the absence of several colleagues and the fact \nthat right now the Nation's capital is engulfed in a series of storms \npreventing a number of our Members from returning. Also, I think it is \nimportant that every Member of the Senate hear the words of the Senator \nfrom Kansas and others about this very important amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the distinguished chairman yield for several \nquestions?\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his very kind \ncomments.\n  Would it be helpful, I ask the distinguished chairman, if Members of \nthis body would know that the same basic feeling exists in regards to \nthe British Parliament in the House of Lords?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is a very important point.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have a statement here by a member of the Parliament. \nMenzies Campbell says:\n\n       . . .''It is a matter of considerable regret that the House \n     of Commons has never debated properly the issues surrounding \n     the NATO Strategic Concept.'' He argued that, ``Parliament \n     should have had the opportunity to consider matters such as \n     NATO's right of independent action without Security Council \n     authority and further expansion of the alliance and its \n     consequences.''\n\n  He said that:\n\n       Foreign and security policy is the responsibility of the \n     government, but the legislature is surely entitled to express \n     its views.\n\n  This was also true in regards to the statement by Lord Wallace of \nGreat Britain in the House of Lords.\n\n       . . .''no intelligent debate''. . .it is ``quite \n     astonishing that we allow British defence strategy to be \n     structured by an international organisation without any form \n     of input and debate by our Parliament.''\n\n  Then he went on to say, in drawing the example here in the Senate:\n\n       Both Republicans and Democrats. . .argue that the. . . \n     [overemphasis on] the enlargement issue in the run-up to \n     NATO's 50th anniversary celebration. . .came at the expense \n     of any meaningful debate over the evolution of NATO and the \n     role that the. . .Alliance will play in the 21st century.\n\n  If I could ask my distinguished chairman, would he recall the many \ntimes that we have had briefings in regards to the situation in Kosovo \nand the question over and over again that was posed prior to the \nbombing: Would this be in our vital national security interest?\n  I know the Senator asked that question many times. I know that the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, who made a very eloquent \nspeech in this Chamber this morning, asked that question. I tried to \nask the question in regards to an amendment to the defense \nappropriations bill last year. I said: Before we would actually commit \nany troops under this ever-changing concept in that part of the world, \nwould the administration please answer eight questions--as to cost, \npurpose, exit strategy, end game, and et cetera, et cetera?\n  That public law requirement was not addressed for 6 months. I am \nworried about the future of NATO, I would say to my distinguished \nfriend. I know the chairman is. I think that Kosovo is a rock that has \nhit the NATO windshield, and it has been like shattered glass. It does \nnot matter if you feel that involvement is a fine mess we have gotten \ninto or whether or not we think that this policy is the right policy.\n\n  I am sure the distinguished chairman--I have talked with him about \nit--will have the full committee or perhaps my subcommittee look at the \ntactics that have been used, the stress and strain on others, on other \nservices in other parts of the world.\n  I am sure we have talked about the ethics of conducting a war above \n15,000 feet; immaculate coercion, where no allied NATO soldier has \nsuffered any casualty as opposed to the people we are trying to help.\n  I know that we have talked, Mr. Chairman, about the law of unintended \neffects; what is happening today in regard to Russia, China, India, \nPakistan, South America, and Central America. President Zedillo of \nMexico wondered aloud in the international press: Will NATO now come to \nenforce human rights within the sovereign territory of Mexico in \nregards to the Chippewa Indian situation? How about East Timor, \nChechnya, Turkey, and the Kurds, et cetera, et cetera? Rwanda, that \nsituation is far more difficult.\n  I don't know, Mr. Chairman. I just think there are a lot of real \nquestions that Members have. If you go back to the basic genesis as to \nwhy we are there, it comes right back to the President's speech at the \nHague over 2 years ago, reflected in the Strategic Concept of NATO.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, you are right on.\n  Indeed, go back before Kosovo to Bosnia. How many debates took place \non this floor where the central question was: Was it in the vital U.S. \ninterest to make our commitments there? Time and time again, the \nadministration dropped the word ``vital,'' and then talked about how it \nwas in our interest.\n  But when we put life and limb of the American person on the line, \nwhether it is in the cockpits or on the ground or on the sea, I really \nbelieve it should be in the vital interest of the United States of \nAmerica for our families to be asked to make those commitments of life \nand limb. That is central to this question, as you pointed out, I think \nvery carefully.\n  If I might, because I think it bears worth repeating: ``The NATO \ncharter requires the use of force in only one instance''--now this is \nthe 1949 treaty, under article 5--``to respond to an armed attack \nagainst one or more of the member nations.'' Strike one, strike all. \nThere is nothing in that charter that calls for the use of force to \nprotect common interests.\n  This is being created out of whole cloth, this non-article 5 combat. \nIt is as if we are writing a new article to the original treaty. It is \nfor that reason that we should bring this before the Senate. Because \nthrough the guise of calling it a strategic concept through the panoply \nof the 50th anniversary, what they have done here, in my judgment, is \ncreate a new article to the fundamental treaty of 1949, and that they \ncannot do without the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would my distinguished chairman yield for one additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am worried about the future of NATO. If in fact our \ninvolvement in Kosovo was at one time not in our vital national \ninterest, there is, I think, a good argument that can be made--has been \nmade by the national security team and the President--that since NATO's \ncredibility or the future of NATO is now on the line, it is in our \nvital national security interest.\n\n  Having said that, and having looked at the war in Kosovo and the \ntactics used, and the result, and all six of the goals, as outlined by \nthe distinguished Secretary of State in our briefings, being turned on \ntheir head as a result of the tactics that have been used in the \nmilitary strategy, and the law of unintended effects, can you imagine a \nsituation under this Strategic Concept that all 19 nations will ever \nagree to ever bomb anybody again? On a proactive basis? Where we are \ngoing outside of the NATO territory, ignoring the U.N.? I doubt it.\n  Eight nations, right now as I speak, more especially three, want the \nbombing ended. Many others in this Chamber--not this Senator, for \nreasons that I could go into, but I will not--did not want to start the \nbombing campaign. Others wanted to start it. Others wanted to use the \nground forces. That debate is going on right now.\n  We are negotiating within the NATO--within the NATO--alliance as \nopposed to trying to negotiate, as we are trying to do, with Mr. \nMilosevic, who, by the way, is a thug and an international terrorist \nand all the things people say about him. That does not enter into this. \nBut can you imagine, Mr. Chairman, under what circumstance, after \nKosovo, that NATO would bomb again, or for that matter ever use ground \ntroops?\n  What kind of message does that send to the bad guys and the hard \ntargets and the real people that we should be worrying about all around \nthe world? I think we have decimated--well, there is a stronger word \nfor it, but I will not use it--in regards to NATO. I think under this \nStrategic Concept we have wandered so far afield and into a dangerous \npasture that we are endangering the true mission of NATO, which is \ncollective security, not to mention all the rest of these things that \nare in this concept.\n  That is what worries me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, in my judgment, \npredicated on a lot of study in the lifetime of this Senator of the \nNATO treaty, the doctrine of consensus was predicated on keeping the \noperations within the borders.\n  And now, under this proposed 1999 Strategic Concept, to take it \nbeyond the borders, I question whether or not the doctrine of consensus \nwill work.\n  What a tragedy it would be if we took this magnificent NATO \norganization,\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nwhich fulfilled beyond the dreams of all its mission, as laid down in \n1949, which kept the peace in Europe for that half century, and allow \nit to be pulled apart by a doctrine such as this new Strategic Concept. \nI think the Senator is quite right. We are in this conflict, in all \nprobability, not because of our national vital security interests but \nbecause of NATO. It is because of NATO that we cannot allow our \nmilitary commanders to promulgate the actions which are necessary to go \nahead and win it.\n  I often think, I say to my good friend, as over 50 percent of the \nairmen are flying tactical missions and over 70 percent of the support \nmissions and the airlift, are we unfairly asking those young aviators \nto bear the brunt of war disproportionately because NATO did not devise \nand put in place, concurrently with the air operations, starting a \nground operation? Because a ground operation would have transformed \nthis conflict considerably. It might well, in my judgment, have brought \nabout a far earlier conclusion of this conflict and saved the prolonged \nrisk to airmen which is going on today and tomorrow and for the \nindefinite future, given the absence of bringing together all the force \ncapable of the 19 nations to bear.\n  Indeed, the other nations that do not have the air power, as we have \nit, could have been the primary components of the ground action, \nleaving to the American airmen the operations in the sky but they \nundertake the operations on the ground. It would have forced Milosevic \nto put in place, making in all probability his ground assets a better \ntarget than they are today, widely dispersed and hidden in the villages \nand towns throughout Kosovo and elsewhere.\n  I think the whole dynamics of this conflict would have been changed \nhad we not limited solely to air but done a ground-air combination, for \nwhich our forces have trained these 50 years in NATO, as well as the \nother NATO nations, for a ground-air coordinated defense.\n  I point out, NATO was always to be a defense treaty.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I may ask my distinguished friend, the chairman, one \nother question; that is, I do not think there is any question in the \nminds of many that to state that you are not going to use grounds \nforces before you decide to use force was a mistake. There is no \nquestion about that.\n  I am not sure I could still support or still support--I never did \nsupport--the use of ground troops, unless I know what their specific \nmission is: What do we expect them to do. And then, if you ``win,'' if \nwe could ever define ``winning,'' what is it that we have won.\n  So from the standpoint of tactics, I say again to the chairman, I am \nvery hopeful, once this war is over, we hope and pray that all of this \ntalk that has been rather critical will be secondary, and, if Milosevic \nwould agree to some of the negotiating principles that have been \noffered, we shall see. I see where one NATO general indicated it is \ngoing to take another 2 months. I hope that is not the case.\n  I hope the Senate Armed Services Committee--and I ask the chairman, \nwould it be his intent to take a hard look. I have a subcommittee that \nlooks at low-intensity conflicts--this became a high-intensity \nconflict--and military tactics and strategy. I hope we can take a look \nat this, especially with the asymmetrical threat that Mr. Milosevic has \nused so well against us. He basically took one look at our tactics and \nacted accordingly and played rope-a-dope. He has achieved most of his \nobjectives. That seems to me to be a real problem here. I hope we have \nthose hearings.\n\n  Again, I go back to the genesis of this whole business, and that is a \nStrategic Concept that puts us in far different pastures. I know there \nwill be some of my colleagues who say this is not a treaty. The fact \nthat we are having this debate today, I think, is encouraging. We had a \ndebate on ratification of NATO expansion last year. To my knowledge, we \nhave not had any debate, or very little discussion, of this Strategic \nConcept and what it means.\n  So the Senator's cosponsorship of this amendment is much appreciated. \nIf, in fact it is not a treaty, it has the effect of a treaty.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are going to have that series of \nhearings. I do not want to have a hearing or a series of hearings on \nthe Armed Services Committee until the men and women of the NATO forces \nare, hopefully, in a very limited situation with regard to personal \nrisk.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the chairman will, I heartily agree. The war must be \nover.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me just bring up a final concluding point to my good \nfriend here. I know others want to speak to this. Then we will have to \nlay it aside.\n  I point out that during the 1994 debate on modifications to the ABM \nTreaty, the Armed Services Committee included a provision, and I was a \ncosponsor of that effort in the 1995 DOD authorization act--I ask my \ncolleague to listen carefully--which required the President to submit \nto the Senate for advice and consent any international agreement which \nwould ``substantially modify the ABM Treaty.''\n  I think that is a direct parallel and an exact precedent for what the \nRoberts-Warner amendment seeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first I commend our good friend from Kansas \nfor the energy he has put into a very significant issue which has to do \nwith the new Strategic Concept of NATO.\n  This is not a new issue. The question of NATO's role since the fall \nof the Soviet Union has been an issue of a number of new Strategic \nConcepts. Listen to what NATO said in 1990. We have heard a lot about \n1999 in Washington, but just listen to the heads of state in July 1990, \nspeaking in London. Here is what the heads of state said: While \nreaffirming the basic principles on which the alliance has rested since \nits inception, they recognized the developments taking place in Europe \nwould have a far-reaching impact on the way in which its aims would be \nmet in the future and the need for a fundamental strategic review, \nfundamental strategic review.\n  And what came out of that strategic review in 1991, fundamental \nstrategic review for NATO? They have listed many new security \nchallenges and risks in 1991. Listen to risk No. 9, language very \nsimilar to what was adopted in Washington this year:\n\n       Risks to allied security less likely to result from \n     calculated aggression against a territory of the allies but, \n     rather, from adverse consequences of instabilities that may \n     arise from the serious economic, social and political \n     difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial \n     disputes, which are faced by many countries in central and \n     eastern Europe. The tensions which may result, as long as \n     they remain limited, should not directly threaten the \n     security and territorial integrity of the members of the \n     alliance. They could, however, lead to crises inimical to \n     European stability and even to armed conflicts, which could \n     involve outside powers or spill over into NATO countries, \n     having a direct effect on the security of the alliance.\n\n  Does it sound familiar? It sure does to me. It sounds like 1999 to \nme.\n\n       Risks to allied security are less likely to result from \n     calculated aggression against a territory of allies but, \n     rather, from the adverse consequences of instabilities that \n     may arise from the serious economic, social and political \n     difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial \n     disputes. . . .\n\n  I didn't hear too many calls then for a submission of amendments to \nthe NATO treaty. I don't think we heard any calls then, although the \nrisks changed. They changed in a significant way: No longer likely to \ncome from calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but \nfrom adverse consequences of instabilities.\n  I don't think there was a change to the NATO treaty then, and I don't \nthink there is a change to the NATO treaty now. There were no new \ncommitments or obligations for the United States then, in 1991, nor do \nI believe there are any now.\n  Are there different challenges? Yes. Is there a different strategic \nconcept? Yes. Are there different risks? Yes. But is there a change to \nthe treaty, new commitments or obligations for the United States now? I \ndon't think so. Were there in 1991 when all the allies signed a new \nstrategic concept? No. Even though the Soviet military capability still \nwas constituting the most significant factor, all of a sudden because \nof the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, we now had new risks. \nListen to these words in paragraph 12. This is the 1991 Strategic \nConcept, paragraph 12:\n\n       Alliance security must also take account of the global \n     context.\n\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\n\n  Wow. You talk about a different challenge and you talk about a new \nstrategic concept. In 1991, the NATO allies suddenly say that alliance \nsecurity must take account of the global context. Those are pretty \nbroad words. But I didn't hear any suggestion back in 1991 that it was \nan amendment to the NATO treaty that required submission to the \nSenate--and for a good reason. There were no commitments or obligations \nundertaken in 1991, and there are no strategic concepts which contain \nnew commitments or obligations in 1999. In 1999, the allies said that \nalliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider \nnature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \ndisruption of the flow of vital resources, and actions of terrorism and \nsabotage. That is a lot different from an attack on the territory of \nthe allies. But nobody suggested in 1991 that was an amendment to the \nNATO treaty, to the Washington Treaty.\n  Why didn't anyone suggest that in 1991? Because that did not \nconstitute the undertaking of new commitments or obligations for the \nUnited States, even though we all agreed that alliance security must \ntake into account the global context--and that is a lot beyond Europe. \nIn 1991, everyone agreed to that. I don't remember one amendment, not \none amendment, not one proposal that suggested that the new Strategic \nConcept constituted a commitment or obligation binding upon the United \nStates which would require a change in the NATO treaty. It wasn't \nsuggested in 1991 because there was no new commitment or undertaking \nbinding upon us, because there was simply a new strategic concept. The \n1999 Strategic Concept does not constitute a new commitment or \nobligation, either. The same principle applies now as applied then.\n  So the amendment of the Senator, which says if there are new \nundertakings, whether or not the new Strategic Concept imposes any new \ncommitments or obligations on the United States, it seems to me is a \nrequirement on the President that is perfectly appropriate. I have no \ndifficulty whatsoever in asking the President to tell us whether or not \nthe 1999 Strategic Concept represents new commitments or undertakings. \nIt is perfectly appropriate--as this resolution does--to call on the \nPresident to inform us as to whether or not there are new commitments \nor undertakings.\n  As a matter of fact, the President has already informed us of exactly \nwhat this resolution says he should inform us. The President wrote \nSenator Warner on April 14 that ``the Strategic Concept will not \ncontain new commitments or obligations for the United States.'' Those \nare the President's words.\n\n  So what this resolution does is say: Does it? The President said, in \nApril, that it won't. I have no doubt that the President will reaffirm \nthat it didn't. But I must say I don't have a difficulty with what \nSenator Roberts is doing because it is perfectly appropriate to ask the \nPresident: Is there anything in this new Strategic Concept which \nimposes on us a new obligation for commitment? If so, submit it to us \nas a treaty amendment.\n  This is very different from some earlier language that was circulated \nin the Armed Services Committee. This doesn't make a finding that there \nare new commitments or obligations in this agreement in Washington in \n1999. The language before us doesn't make any such finding. The \nlanguage before us in the Senator's resolution, which I find to be \nappropriate, requires the President to determine and certify whether or \nnot the Strategic Concept imposes any new commitment or obligations on \nthe United States--whether or not.\n  And so as I read this resolution, I think the language is appropriate \nin this resolution, that the President reaffirm what he told us on \nApril 14, tell us if there is any change in his thinking on that. \nAgain, as he wrote Senator Warner on April 14--and this letter has been \nmade part of the Record now, I believe--the President said:\n\n       The Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or \n     obligations for the United States, but rather will underscore \n     NATO's enduring purposes, outlined in the 1949 North Atlantic \n     Treaty.\n\n  There has been reference here to the significance of changes in \nstrategic concepts, and I think it is important that the Senate spend \nsome time doing what Senator Roberts and others have done, both on the \ncommittee and off, in focusing on this Strategic Concept. It is \nimportant that we understand what these new threats and risks are. It \nis important, in my judgment, that we make a determination as to \nwhether or not we do have new legal commitments and obligations.\n  I don't believe the 1999 Strategic Concept creates any new binding \nobligations or commitments any more than I did that the 1991 Strategic \nConcept created any new binding commitments and obligations. But our \ncommittees of jurisdiction surely should focus on that resolution.\n  Senator Warner has indicated in the last few minutes that the Armed \nServices Committee will, indeed, be holding a series of hearings on \nthis subject. As he stated it, if I heard him correctly, those hearings \nwill occur after the events in Kosovo are resolved. But as of this \ntime, we have not yet had such hearings. I am not certain of this. But \nI don't believe that the Foreign Relations Committee has either, at \nleast after the Washington agreement was signed. There may have been a \nhearing before the Washington agreement. But I don't believe there has \nbeen one since it was signed. The agreement has some very significant \nprovisions in it relative to a European commitment to take on greater \nresponsibility for European defense.\n  Senator Warner made reference to the European Security and Defense \nInitiative, a very significant change--a very significant initiative in \nterms of what Europe will do. It is something that I have believed for \nsome time that Europe should do. The reference is very specific inside \nof the Washington agreement.\n  Two, the European allies taking on--in the words of the agreement--\n``assuming greater responsibility in the security and defense field in \norder to enhance the peace and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area, \nand, thus, the security of all allies.''\n  Then it goes on to say: ``On the basis of decisions taken by the \nAlliance in Berlin in 1996 and subsequently, the European Security and \nDefense Initiative will continue to be developed within NATO.''\n  I think it is a very significant change. It is something which we in \nthe United States should welcome. It means that the Europeans will be \ntaking on greater responsibility for the defense of Europe against \nthreats, old and new.\n  We ought to welcome as well the reference or the discussion of a new \ninitiative where European countries will have greater defense \ncapability; capabilities to address appropriately and effectively the \nrisks that are associated with weapons of mass destruction; new \ncapabilities so that they can deploy more readily greater mobility, \ngreater survivability of forces, greater infrastructure and \nsustainability. These are initiatives inside of the new strategic \ndoctrine which will make it possible for Europe to take greater \nresponsibility for the defense of Europe. We should welcome this.\n  I don't think there has been very much emphasis in the United States \non what Europe has agreed to do in the new Strategic Concept--what they \nhave, in effect, put into black and white, the commitment to greater \nEuropean resources being used for the European defense.\n  As I said a few moments ago, this resolution which is before us says \nthat if there are new commitments and obligations--if--then the \nPresident should so certify to the Senate. And I believe there is none.\n  Indeed, the Senator from Virginia has been assured by the President \nin the letter which he put in the Record that the Strategic Concept \nwill not contain new commitments or obligations. I believe there is \nnone in this 1999 Strategic Concept, and I believe there was none in \nthe 1991 Strategic Concept. There was none in 1991.\n  Even though the language is very similar--again, my good friend from \nVirginia being here--I just want to read some of the language in the \n1991 Strategic Concept again. I will be very brief. But article 12 of \nthe 1991 Strategic Concept said that ``alliance security must also take \naccount the global concepts''--``global concepts.'' ``Alliance security \ninterests can be affected\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nby other risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, disruption of the flow of vital resources and actions \nof terrorists and sabotage.''\n  That was in 1991. That is just one part of a Strategic Concept which \nwe all agreed to.\n  Did that represent changes in the North Atlantic Treaty? No, it did \nnot, in my judgment. Nobody suggests that it did back then. No one \nsuggested that the President back then, President Bush, submit that \nkind of change in strategic concept to the Senate as a change in the \ntreaty, for a very good reason: It did not constitute a legal \nobligation or commitment which represented a change in the North \nAtlantic Treaty. That is why nobody proposed back then that we have to \nratify this.\n  Those are broad words in here, section 9 of the 1991 new Strategic \nConcept--it was called new Strategic Concept 1991:\n\n       Risks to allied security are less likely to result from \n     calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but \n     rather from the adverse consequences of instabilities that \n     may arise in serious economic, social and political \n     difficulties--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     including ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes which are \n     faced by many countries in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n  They could lead to crises in European stability.\n  Did that create legally binding obligations and commitments on the \nUnited States in 1991? No, it didn't. And nobody suggested that the \nPresident should submit that language, because there is no legally \nbinding obligation or commitment from that kind of language, although \nin the words of the Strategic Concept in 1991 they recognized--this is \nwhat our leaders said in all of the NATO nations--``that the \ndevelopments they can place in Europe would have a far-reaching impact \non the way in which NATO's aims would be met in the future.''\n  ``Far-reaching impacts,'' 1991.\n  I commend--and I had an opportunity to do this a few minutes ago--the \nefforts of the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Virginia, and the \nSenator from Maine, and others to bring to our attention what this new \nStrategic Concept is, so that we as a Senate can understand what it is \nthat NATO is looking at in terms of a strategic concept. It is very \nimportant that those hearings the Senator from Virginia made reference \nto take place. In my own opinion, if the Foreign Relations Committee \nhas not already done so--and I don't believe they have, but I may be \nwrong--it is important that the Foreign Relations Committee have \nhearings on this Strategic Concept.\n  Again, I don't have any difficulty with the language in this \nresolution, because I think it is appropriate that the President tell \nus whether or not we have undertaken in this language any new \nobligations or commitments. The President wrote my good friend from \nVirginia on April 14 that the Strategic Concept will not contain new \ncommitments or obligations for the United States. I assume that he \nwill reaffirm that in fact there are no new commitments or obligations \nwhen he gives us the certification which is required in this \nresolution.\n\n  I just want to summarize by saying that I have no difficulty with \nthis language, because I think it is appropriate we have that \nassurance, because if there are new commitments or obligations--it \nseems to me there should be--then it would be presumably an amendment \nto a treaty which should be submitted to the Senate. But, again, just \nas there was none in 1991 when that new Strategic Concept which I just \nread was adopted by NATO, I don't believe there are more important--my \nbelief is that the President has written the good Senator from Virginia \nthat in fact there are no new commitments or obligations contained in \nthis new Strategic Concept in 1999.\n  Again, I want to commend the Senators who have focused on this. I \nthink we must address the new kind of environment we face in this \nworld, and that it is important that NATO, which is going to play such \na critical role in the stability of Europe and the new kinds of threats \nwhich we and Europe face, address those threats, that we do so in the \ncontext of the most successful alliance in the history of mankind, an \nalliance which is now growing, an alliance which when we added three \nnew countries in this Senate, on this floor--we adopted the Kyl \namendment that, as I remember it, contained 10 provisions--very similar \nto what is in this 1999 Strategic Concept.\n  I won't take the time to read more than just one section of the 10 \nprinciples in the Kyl amendment.\n  The Senate understands that the policy of the United States is that \nthe core concepts contained in the 1991 Strategic Concept of NATO, \nwhich adapted NATO's strategic strategy of the post-cold-war \nenvironment, remain valid today in that the upcoming revision of that \ndocument will reflect the following provisions, and there are many.\n  One is:\n\n       (IV) conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic \n     disputes, or the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n\n  That is one of the principles of the Kyl amendment in which we \nconfirmed three nations would be added to the NATO alliance.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to engage in a few more minutes of colloquy. Other \nSenators are waiting and we have momentum under this bill. One Senator \ndesires to lay down some additional amendments. I cannot let this \nopportunity go by.\n  Article 5 of the 1949 treaty laid out in very clear language exactly \nthe reasons for which NATO was established. It could be understood by \nanyone, whether he or she wears four stars or is a private. It simply \nsays:\n\n       The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more \n     of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an \n     attack against them all.\n\n  The word ``attack'' goes all the way through article 5.\n\n       We will assist the parties so attacked.\n       It was a defensive treaty, whether it was armed \n     aggression across the border against a member nation. That \n     is the only reason that NATO was founded.\n\n  Now in the Bosnia and Kosovo operation, there wasn't any attack on a \nmember nation but it was unsettling to the security of Europe. There \nwas no attack.\n  They decided it was a non-article 5 military operation. There is no \nnon-article 5 in here. You have to go to a preamble. You have to work a \nstrain for the basis on which we are in Bosnia and in Kosovo.\n  We are there; we are committed as a nation. If in the next decade we \nwant to do something beyond article 5, then let's put it down as a new \narticle. Let's write it as a new article, article 15, and put it down \nin very clear language so that everybody can understand what it is we \nwant to do, rather than going back and getting a strange interpretation \nof a preamble to begin to justify putting men and women of the Armed \nForces of the United States in harm's way.\n  The burdensharing concept: The financial relationship between the \nUnited States, which pays 25 percent of the costs of NATO--eventually \nour committee will get all those costs and spread them out. I think we \nought to, plain and simple, start a new article if we want to do \nsomething different than article 5 and not go back within the confines \nof this magnificent document and try to get some strained, whatever it \nis, to justify military action beyond the borders.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1991 this is what the NATO new Strategic \nConcept said:\n\n       Risks to Allied security are less likely to result from \n     calculated aggression against the territory of the Allies, \n     but rather from the adverse consequences of instability that \n     may arise from the serious economic, social, and political \n     difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial \n     disputes which are faced by many countries in central and \n     eastern Europe.\n       They could . . . lead to crises inimical to European \n     stability and to armed conflicts.\n\n  That is section 9.\n  Then they say, in addition to article 5, article 6 which they made \nreference to, an armed attack of the territory of the allies from \nwhatever direction. In 1991, this new Strategic Concept said, \n``However, alliance security must also take account of the global \ncontext.'' That is 1991--``Global context.''\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest my good friend is making my argument.\n  What I am saying is this is likened to statute law. What the Senator \nis reading are regulations. How often in the\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\nhistory of our country have regulations just about emasculated the \nstatute?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My only point in response to the Senator from Virginia, is \nthat nobody suggested in 1991 that those words created a new binding \nobligation or commitment on the United States. I didn't hear it in \n1991; I didn't hear it in 1992; I didn't hear it in 1993; I didn't hear \nit in 1994.\n  ``Global context'' alliance security must take account.\n  Why didn't anybody make that argument in the 8 years since 1991? The \nanswer is, because it didn't create any commitment or obligation, or \nelse I assume somebody on this floor would have argued there was a new \ncommitment or argument--the very similar language.\n  In 1990, NATO got together and said the Soviet Union has fallen \napart, and developments taking place in Europe have a far-reaching \nimpact. This is a fundamental strategic review.\n  The only point I am making is I have no difficulty with the language \nin the good Senator's amendment, because I think we should have the \nassurance that there is no binding obligation or commitment represented \nby these new strategic concepts that NATO adopts. I happen to think \nthat is very important.\n  I repeat that the Senator has received that assurance from the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may procedurally address what I \nbelieve is about to take place. The good Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe good Senator from Louisiana have an amendment which will soon be \npresented to the Senate and become the pending business. However, \nbefore, as I understand it, the Senator from Minnesota will lay down \nthree amendments and we will immediately lay them aside; then our \ndistinguished colleague and member of the committee will address the \nSenate with regard to the bill for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have worked out with the Senator from Maine that I \nwill speak first and then yield to the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Louisiana who will speak at somewhat greater length.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 380 Through 382, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent to send three amendments to \nthe desk and then have them temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes \n     amendments Nos. 380 through 382, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title 10 add the following:\n       The Senate finds that:\n       The United Nations Security Council created the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (in \n     this concurrent resolution referred to as the ``ICTY'') by \n     resolution on May 25, 1993;\n       Although the ICTY has indicted 84 people since its \n     creation, these indictments have only resulted in the trial \n     and conviction of 8 criminals;\n       The ICTY has jurisdiction to investigate: grave breaches of \n     the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Article 2), violations of the \n     laws or customs of war (Article 3), genocide (Article 4), and \n     crimes against humanity (Article 5);\n       The Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, Justice Louise Arbour, \n     stated on July 7, 1998, to the Contact Group for the former \n     Yugoslavia that ``[t]he Prosecutor believes that the nature \n     and scale of the fighting indicate that an `armed conflict', \n     within the meaning of international law, exists in Kosovo. As \n     a consequence, she intends to bring charges for crimes \n     against humanity or war crimes, if evidence of such crimes is \n     established'';\n       Reports from Kosovar Albanian refugees provide detailed \n     accounts of systematic efforts to displace the entire Muslim \n     population of Kosovo;\n       In furtherance of this plan, Serbian troops, police, and \n     paramilitary forces have engaged in detention and summary \n     execution of men of all ages, wanton destruction of civilian \n     housing, forcible expulsions, mass executions in at least 60 \n     villages and towns, as well as widespread organized rape of \n     women and young girls;\n       These reports of atrocities provide prima facie evidence of \n     war crimes, crimes against humanity, as well as genocide;\n       Any criminal investigation is best served by the \n     depositions and interviews of witnesses as soon after the \n     commission of the crime as possible;\n       The indictment, arrest, and trial of war criminals would \n     provide a significant deterrent to further atrocities;\n       The ICTY has issued 14 international warrants for war \n     crimes suspects that have yet to be served, despite knowledge \n     of the suspects' whereabouts;\n       Vigorous prosecution of war crimes after the conflict in \n     Bosnia may have prevented the ongoing atrocities in Kosovo; \n     and\n       Investigative reporters have identified specific \n     documentary evidence implicating the Serbian leadership in \n     the commission of war crimes.\n       Sec. 2. It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States, in coordination with other United \n     Nations contributors, should provide sufficient resources for \n     an expeditious and thorough investigation of allegations of \n     the atrocities and war crimes committed in Kosovo;\n       (2) the United States, through its intelligence services, \n     should provide all possible cooperation in the gathering of \n     evidence of sufficient specificity and credibility to secure \n     the indictment of those responsible for the commission of war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the former \n     Yugoslavia;\n       (3) where evidence warrants, indictments for war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and genocide should be issued \n     against suspects regardless of their position within the \n     Serbian leadership;\n       (4) the United States and all nations have an obligation to \n     honor arrest warrants issued by the ICTY, and the United \n     States should use all appropriate means to apprehend war \n     criminals already under indictment; and\n       (5) NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the \n     conflict in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, \n     apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals for crimes \n     conmitted during operations in Kosovo.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as stated very briefly before, I intend \nto speak for about 10 minutes. Then we have worked out an arrangement \nwhere the Senator from Maine will speak for about 10 minutes. We will \nbe preceding Senator Landrieu, because she intends to talk for about 30 \nminutes. That is the speaking order which we have arranged among \nourselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that in the form of a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which \nhas been submitted provides for the prosecution of war criminals in \nKosovo, arising out of the atrocities and war crimes which have been so \nblatantly committed in Kosovo.\n  The somewhat polite term of ``ethnic cleansing'' has been used to \ndescribe these atrocities. But they are, in effect, mass murders and \nexecutions committed by the Serbian forces against the people of \nKosovo. We have, to the credit of the civilized world, established a \nWar Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The establishment of this War Crimes \nTribunal to prosecute crimes in the former Yugoslavia has already \nreturned 84 indictments and the resulting conviction of some 8 \ncriminals there.\n  The importance of establishing the rule of law is something that may \nbe the most important legacy that will come out of the Bosnian war and \nthe war in Kosovo, and hopefully will be embodied in a permanent \ninternational criminal court--which will remain for another day. Those \nresolutions have been introduced and pressed by a number of Senators, \nincluding Senator Dodd and myself and others. But in Bosnia, we saw the \nwar crimes and we have seen very strenuous activity by the War Crimes \nTribunal in the 84 indictments and in the 8 convictions.\n  Now we have seen ethnic cleansing at a high level. We have seen acts \nof violence which go to the very top of the Serbian-Yugoslavian \nGovernment, right to the doorstep of President Milosevic himself. \nAlthough he is not named in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it is \nplain that the kind of atrocities which have been carried out could \nonly be carried out by his order, at least with his knowledge and, at \nthe very minimum, with his acquiescence--any of which is sufficient to \nestablish criminal culpability for those war crimes.\n  Recently, Justice Louise Arbour visited the United States. On April \n30, she met with Senator Landrieu, other Senators, and myself, and \nexpressed the need for adequate financing for the investigations. The \nadministration had requested funding of some $5 million. On the \nemergency supplemental which passed both Houses of Congress last week, \nup to an additional $13 million was added, for a total of $18 million, \nwhich was the sum requested by Justice Arbour.\n  At that time, she made a plea that the NATO forces or the IFOR forces \nundertake activity to arrest high-level indictees who are at large, \nreferring specifically to Karadzic, whose whereabouts has been \nidentified in the French Quarter, and who could be taken into custody.\n  Mladic, the other principal indictee, is said to be in Belgrade and \nit might require an invasion to apprehend and take him into custody. \nBut at least as to the arrest of Karadzic, that could be accomplished.\n  Justice Arbour also stated there were other high-ranking officials \nfor whom sealed indictments had been obtained. Those sealed indictments \nwere in the hands of military authorities, and those individuals, too, \ncould be taken into custody.\n  Justice Arbour expressed the judgment that if these war criminals, \nalleged war criminals--these individuals indicted on charges of war \ncrimes, to be specific--were taken into custody, then she believed it \ncould have a profound effect on the subordinates, on perhaps Milosevic \nhimself or certainly on the subordinates immediately under Milosevic.\n\n  It is our hope this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will impel the \nauthorities to apprehend those individuals.\n  I shall not go through the whereas clauses, setting forth the \nfoundation for the U.N. action on establishing the War Crimes Tribunal \nor the atrocities themselves, but focusing for just a minute on the \nfive clauses following the resolution:\n  First, that the United States, in coordination with the United \nNations, supply sufficient funds for the investigation of the \nallegations of the atrocities and war crimes committed in Kosovo.\n  That can be accomplished with the $18 million appropriated by the \nUnited States and appropriations by other responsible nations.\n  Second, that the United States, through its intelligence services, \nshould provide all cooperation in the gathering of evidence to secure \nthe indictments of those responsible for war crimes.\n  Third, that where the evidence warrants indictment, those indictments \nwill be brought for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, \nregardless of the position of the indictees within the Serbian \nleadership.\n  This is directed at President Milosevic himself.\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n  Fourth, that the United Nations and all nations have an obligation to \nhonor the warrants issued by the War Crimes Tribunal, and the United \nStates and other responsible nations should use all appropriate means \nto apprehend the war criminals already under indictments.\n  That refers to Karadzic, Mladic, and the others under sealed \nindictments as previously mentioned, having been identified by Justice \nArbour.\n  Fifth, NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the \nconflict in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, apprehension, or \nprosecution of war criminals for crimes committed during operations in \nKosovo.\n  If there is any inclination, as part of a plea bargain on any of the \nnegotiations, to spare President Milosevic or other high-ranking \nofficials, that should be rejected as part of the diplomatic resolution \nof the conflict in Kosovo if such a diplomatic resolution should be \nobtained.\n  Last Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testified before \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations, a committee of \nwhich I am a member. She was questioned at that time and stated that \nthe United States was not negotiating with Milosevic.\n  Well, in effect, an indirect negotiation is not a whole lot \ndifferent. But it may be--and I made this statement at the time of the \nhearing--that the line could be drawn so that the United States would \nmaintain its position that it would not be a party to any settlement \nwhich, by way of a plea bargain, gave immunity or absolved Milosevic or \nany other high-ranking diplomatic official or anyone from \nresponsibility for the war crimes warranted by indictments and \nwarranted by the evidence.\n  I commend Senator Landrieu for her leadership on this important \nresolution, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the amendment \noffered by my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Louisiana expressing the \nsense of Congress regarding the need for vigorous prosecution of war \ncrimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in the former Republic of \nYugoslavia.\n  This amendment expresses the Sense of Congress that:\n  The United States should provide sufficient resources for an \nexpeditious investigation of the allegations of war crimes committed in \nKosovo;\n  The United States should provide all possible cooperation to the \nTribunal in the gathering of evidence;\n  Where evidence warrants, indictments should be issued for war crimes \nand that the United States and all nations have an obligation to honor \narrest warrants; and,\n  NATO should not accept a settlement in Kosovo that would bar the \nindictment, apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals.\n  During the past two months, Kosovo has witnessed carnage and \nbloodshed unseen in Europe for almost fifty years. These events are the \nculmination of a decade-long campaign of terror and bloodshed in the \nBalkans engineered by Mr. Milosevic.\n  Over 1.2 million Kosovar Albanians are now displaced, having been \nforced to flee their homes. Over 700,000 Kosovars are now refugees, \nmost in Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro. Others have been forced to \nhide in the forests and mountains.\n  The United States now has hard evidence that war crimes have been \ncommitted. A report issued by the State Department earlier this month \nentitled ``Erasing History: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo'' argued that: \n``At this writing, the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic \ncontinue to burn, loot, rape, shell, and de-populate Kosovo, and \nthousands of refugees continue to flee into neighboring Albania and \nMacedonia. The refugees coming out of Kosovo are only now beginning to \ntell their stories. Yet even these fragmented accounts portray a \nsystematic policy of ethnic cleansing.''\n  This report alleges that:\n  Serbian forces have made Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, a ghost \ntown. Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces expelled \nbetween 100,000 to 120,000 persons from Pristina in only four days. \nKosovars in Macedonia indicate that only 100 ethnic Albanians remain in \nPristina. Serbian forces are stealing and ``confiscating'' furniture \nfrom abandoned homes.\n  In Pec, Serbian forces herded young Albanian women to the Hotel \nKaragac [Kara-jack], and raped them repeatedly. The commander of the \nlocal base used a roster of soldiers' names to allow his troops to \nvisit the hotel on a rotating basis.\n  Violence in western Kosovo is stronger than in any other region of \nthe province. Pec was emptied of ethnic Albanians in 24 hours. In \nDjakovica's [Jack-o-vika] old city, Serbian forces burned 200 to 600 \nhomes the day after NATO airstrikes began. By the next day, the rest of \nthe old city had been torched.\n  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stated that the Djakovica \nregion, and I quote, ``undoubtedly has been one of the most violent and \ncruel in the whole of Kosovo, turning it at times into a virtual \nkilling field.''\n  In fact, the bulk of these crimes are being committed by the Serb \nparamilitary units, such as the ``White Eagles'' and ``Tigers'' under \nthe direct control of the Ministry of the Interior, and, in turn, \naccountable to Mr. Milosevic.\n\n  Indeed, the campaign waged by Mr. Milosevic in Kosovo is a virtual \ncatalog of systematic crimes which I believe merit investigation by the \nInternational War Crimes Tribunal. The crimes, to summarize, are:\n  Forced expulsions: Over one million people have been forced from \ntheir homes;\n  Looting and Burning: Some 500 residential areas have been burned \nsince late March, including over 300 villages burned since April 4;\n  Detentions: Consistent refugee reports that Serbian forces are \nseparating military-aged men from their families in a systematic \npattern. Some analysts estimate that the total number of missing men is \nas high as 100,000. Their fate is unknown;\n  Summary Execution: Refugees have provided accounts of summary \nexecutions in at least 70 towns and villages throughout Kosovo;\n  Rape: Ethnic Albanian women are reportedly being raped in increasing \nnumbers. Refugee accounts indicate systematic and organized mass rapes \nin Djakovica and Pec;\n  Identity Cleansing: Refugees report that Serbian authorities have \nconfiscated passports and other identity papers, systematically \ndestroyed voter registers and other aspects of Kosovo's civil registry, \nand even removed license plates from departing vehicles as part of a \npolicy to prevent returns to Kosovo.\n  The civilized world must send a strong and unambiguous message that \nethnic cleansing, genocide, and mass rape are not acceptable, and will \nnot be tolerated.\n  I will never forget, about 4 years ago, I picked up a copy of the New \nYork Times and opened it. There was a rather large picture of a young \ngirl about 15 years old. She had sort of a Dutch cut, bangs hanging \nover her forehead. She had on a school uniform. But there was something \nvery wrong with the picture: She was hanging from a tree. Dead in \nSrebrenica.\n  And then it came out that there was a major massacre of thousands of \npeople in that supposedly protected enclave by the Serbian military. \nAnd to this day, 5,000 to 7,000 Muslim men and boys are simply missing. \nA few have been found in mass graves, but the most still remain \nmissing.\n  This crime, too, was committed by those who followed Mr. Milosevic's \norders.\n  I would say that when any nation on earth permits their military \npolice to wear hoods and cover their face while they are carrying out \ntheir official duties, then you know that what they are doing is not \nlegal.\n  And there can be little doubt that those who conduct these activities \nin Kosovo--be they in the Yugoslav military or in paramilitary outfits \nsuch as the ``White Eagles'' or the ``Tigers'' --that they are acting \non orders which come from Mr. Milosevic.\n  And now there are reports that Yugoslav authorities have begun to dig \nup the mass graves in Kosovo in an effort to destroy evidence that \ncould be used against them in war crimes trials.\n  Try as they might to hide their crimes, the world now knows what has \nhappened in Kosovo. The regime of Mr. Milosevic has been waging war on \nthe people of the Balkans for close to ten years now. The international \ncommunity must stand up to this, or we will\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nset the stage for further bloodshed and tragedy in Asia, in Africa, and \nelsewhere in Europe. Mr. Milosevic must be held accountable for the \norders which he has given, and the crimes which he has ordered \ncommitted.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and the distinguished Senators from \nPennsylvania and Louisiana and support this amendment. It sends a clear \nmessage to Mr. Milosevic and others who commit crimes against humanity: \nYou will be held accountable, and you will be brought to justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Fiscal Year \n2000 National Defense Authorization Act. This critical legislation \nbrings the military to the threshold of a new century posing new \nchallenges to the U.S. national security. Under the superb leadership \nof our distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Virginia, the \nArmed Services Committee has reported a bill that shapes a more \nflexible, mobile, and precision Total Force required for the future.\n  This bill takes a proven and fundamental approach to enhancing our \nnational defense by devoting more resources to readiness and \nmodernization accounts and improving the quality of life for military \nfamilies. The total authorized funding of $288 billion in the \nlegislation increases the administration's request by $8 billion and \nrepresents a 2.2-percent increase in real terms over the fiscal year \n1999 level.\n  These responsible funding levels try to rescue a defense budget that, \nas a percentage of the Nation's GDP, has reached its lowest points in \n50 years. In modernization programs--those for weapons procurement--\nfunding has fallen by 67 percent since 1985.\n  At the height of the Reagan buildup, the Pentagon obligated $138 \nbillion for procurement. Since then, the spending fell to a low point \nof $44 billion in 1997. The fiscal year 2000 budget increases the \naccount to $56 billion, and I commend Secretary Cohen for planning the \nfirst budget of this administration that brings procurement back to a \nthreshold of $60 billion, as recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nstarting in the year 2001.\n  The major weapons and systems authorized by this bill, particularly \nservice combatants, strategic and tactical aircraft, and high-speed \narmored vehicles, will give the armed services more endurance and \nfirepower at lower life cycle costs. Smooth construction materials will \ndeceive the enemy radars that can detect the hard angles of older \nplatforms. Information technologies will give ships, tanks, and \naircraft battlespace data that shows potential enemy movements before \nthey occur. A new series of rapid transporters will bring forces to the \nshorelines of instability. And from safe distances in the air or at \nsea, smaller crews will program missiles for strategic inland targets.\n  As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I had the honor of witnessing \nfirsthand the revolution in capabilities by traveling to the Persian \nGulf to visit the sailors of the carrier Enterprise and the guided-\nmissile cruiser U.S.S. Gettysburg and the minesweeper U.S.S. Ardent \nduring the Easter recess. Without exception, the men and women of these \nships, forward deployed between Iran and Iraq, demonstrated a solid \ncommitment to defending the interests of their nation in some of the \nmost dangerous waters on the planet.\n  I listened and talked with dozens of sailors and returned to \nWashington with a fresh understanding of the human dimension of \nreadiness. Only dedicated people can deliver the capabilities needed to \nproject our military power. Far removed from their families and the \nluxuries of life ashore, the crews of the Enterprise, the Ardent, and \nthe Gettysburg admirably performed their missions of containing the \nIraqi military and ensuring the freedom of commerce.\n  The diligence of the crews of these ships makes a visitor forget \ntheir youth. From galleys and control rooms to flight decks and \nbridges, sailors cooperated with professionalism to ensure that our \nmaritime power upheld peace and stability.\n  They reminded me that patriotism hinges on sacrifice, and that \nCongress can perform no greater service in defense policy than to \nimprove the quality of life for military families.\n  Therefore, I think the legislation before us reinforces the wisdom of \nadditional personnel provisions in both this authorization bill, as \nwell as the legislation that was passed by the Senate that would \nincrease the retirement and the pay for the members of our Armed \nForces. The Bill of Rights Act, the pending legislation, as well as the \nfiscal year 1999 supplemental, will move closer to this goal by \nauthorizing a universal active-duty pay increase of 4.8 percent, the \nlargest since 1982, and giving troops enrolled in the retirement plan \nthe option of drawing pension benefits calculated under the same \nformula as other personnel who served for at least 20 years.\n\n  I believe this certainly reinforces the conversations that I have had \nwith a group of senior noncommissioned officers aboard the Enterprise \nwho stressed the need for equity in the Pentagon's compensation and \nretirement systems. I repeatedly heard that uniformed personnel could \nnot obtain timely care for their families and waited months on end for \nreimbursement.\n  As a result, I sponsored a provision in this bill permitting TriCare \nbeneficiaries to receive treatments at qualified medical offices if \nthey live more than 50 miles from a DOD health installation. This \ninitiative, coupled with the Bill of Rights Act, directs to the Defense \nDepartment to rely on more efficient claims processing procedures to \ntackle the issue of access to quality treatment that several sailors \nraised in their encounters with me.\n  I also include a provision in this legislation--of course, it was \nauthored with Senator Kennedy--that would create a Defense Department \ntask force on domestic violence. This is another issue that has become \na serious concern within our Armed Forces.\n  This task force will consist of military representatives, family \nadvocacy program experts, and civilian domestic violence professionals \nto develop guidelines for a coordinated response to this tragic problem \nthat has grown from 14 reported cases per 1,000 families in 1990 to 22 \nper 1,000 families by 1998.\n  The second major provision of the Kennedy-Snowe amendment mandates \ncreation of a central departmentwide database to receive information on \nreported domestic violence cases in the Armed Forces.\n  No military family should endure the trauma, fear, and alienation \nthat flows from acts of domestic violence. I am hopeful that the \nKennedy-Snowe amendment will represent a crucial beginning in the \nprocess of setting standards and imposing penalties to deter spousal \nand child abuse in the armed services.\n  I want to highlight a few provisions under this legislation which \nwere within the jurisdiction of my Seapower Subcommittee. I thank \nSenator Kennedy, the ranking Democrat of the subcommittee, along with \nthe panel's other members, for their diligent work on this year's \nlegislation.\n  The Seapower Subcommittee held five hearings in our review of the \nfiscal year 2000 budget request. Our hearings focused on the \noverarching question of how the Pentagon can sharpen its ability to \nreinforce U.S. political and economic objectives overseas with an agile \nmaritime fleet.\n  Towards this end, we explored programs designed to maintain the sea \nlanes vital to international trade. The subcommittee also summoned Navy \nand Marine Corps witnesses to discuss strategic air and sealift in \nsupport of regional commanders in chief, littoral force projection and \nprotection, evolving submarine requirements, and priorities in the \nrealms of research and acquisition.\n  Witnesses before the Seapower Subcommittee testified that the \nproliferation of weapons and advanced technology caused by the \nwillingness of countries to sell expertise, hardware, and technology \npresent a challenge for the United States to predict potential \nadversary threats. This trend of proliferation shortens the timeline \nfor an enemy to field an offensive weapon that can disable our forces \nin any region of concern.\n\n  For these reasons, research and development in systems designed to \ncounter enemy air, land, and sea-launched missiles, in addition to \nantiship torpedoes and mines, will enhance the Navy's capacity to deter \nconflict throughout the littoral areas of the\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\nglobe. These coastal zones, within 200 miles of any sea, contain three-\nquarters of the world's population, 80 percent of the capital cities, \nand the major corridors of commerce.\n  Subcommittee witnesses expressed concern that traditional threats, as \nwell as nontraditional threats, from hostile countries and \ninternational terrorists would attempt to disrupt seagoing trade and \nmilitary operations. They pointed out that over 50 countries possessed \nover 150 types of naval mines; over 60 countries have inventories of \nmore than 60 types of torpedoes; over 75 countries have more than 90 \ntypes of antiship cruise missiles; and by 2016, 40 to 50 countries will \ndeploy at least one theater ballistic missile.\n  Navy and Marine Corps witnesses testified that their services will \nfunction as the force of choice in the 21st century. They based this \nassessment on compelling demographic facts. Water covers 70 percent of \nthe world's surface, and by the year 2010, over 70 percent of the \nworld's population will live in urban areas within 300 miles of a \ncoastline.\n  An ever-increasing world population--to top 7.5 billion by the year \n2015--will only intensify this surge of urbanization and leave new \nenvironmental, housing, and health care problems in its wake.\n  Competition among ethnic and religious populations will furthermore \nmake the urbanized littorals ripe for conflict in the 21st century. The \nNavy and Marine Corps can, therefore, use the sea area as an operating \nbase and a maneuver space without permission from a foreign country. In \nthis context, maritime forces can serve as a first echelon of U.S. \nmilitary power projection.\n  Force modernization must subsequently remain on schedule since \nAmerica needs high-technology fleet able to steam at a moment's notice \nto any point on the planet. Our witnesses, however, cited a number of \nbudgetary and operating tempo developments that compete with core \nmodernization requirements.\n  From 1988 to 1998, the Navy's total obligational authority, in \nconstant 1998 dollars, decreased by 40 percent. Coincident with this \ndecrease, the Navy and Marine Corps have experienced a dramatic \nincrease in forward presence and contingency operations.\n\n  In the past 50 years, naval expeditionary forces have responded to \nover 250 crises worldwide. Since 1992 alone, as this ``Commander-in-\nChief Requirements'' chart illustrates, naval forces have responded to \n77 different contingency operations or threats around the world--that \nis between 1992 and 1998--while between the years of 1988 and 1991, \nthey only responded to 27 different threats worldwide. So it shows the \ndisparity in the threats between this decade and the previous decade, \nto show the tremendous pressures that are being placed on our naval and \nour marine forces.\n  During the cold war, Marines were called upon to respond to a threat \non average of once every 15 weeks. Since 1990, the Marines have been \nresponding to a threat once every 5 weeks. That is a threefold \nincrease. So as a result of the naval force structures, as one witness \nsaid during the Seapower Subcommittee's first hearing, there is ``no \nshock absorbency left'' when it comes to our force structures and the \ndemands they are placing on our naval and marine forces.\n  Again, as this chart will illustrate in terms of where we are today \non the 300-ship Navy, we are going to have to build, on an annual rate, \n8 to 10 ships a year in order to sustain a 300-ship Navy. We are going \nto decline pretty rapidly. As we are in 1999, we have 315 ships; for \nthe year 2000, 314; by the year 2005, we will be down to 305 ships. In \norder to sustain 300 ships, we will have to increase the number of \nships we are building to 8 to 10 a year from the 6 we are building \ncurrently.\n  Based on the testimony, and also my visits to the deployed fleet \nunits, and discussions with the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Army and \nAir Force officials, the subcommittee reached the following \nconclusions:\n  First, the Navy and Marine Corps capabilities must remain ahead of \nthe threats designed to disrupt or deny maritime operations on the high \nseas and in the littorals. To respond to this conclusion, the Seapower \nportion of this bill adds $213 million to the budget request for \nresearch, development, testing, and evaluation.\n  Second, the Navy and Marine Corps future readiness will decline if \nrecapitalization and modernization are deferred. I think again these \ncharts illustrate the problem. So to respond to this challenge, the \nSeapower portion of this bill adds $1.068 billion to the budget request \nfor procurement.\n  Third, strategic sea and airlift are required to support daily \noperations overseas, emergent requirements, and sustained military \ncampaigns of a major theater war. The force deployment goals of the \n1995 Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update established \nthe strategic lift requirements as those required for one major theater \nwar and, later, to swing that lift to support the second nearly \nsimultaneous MTW.\n  So to respond to this challenge, the bill adds $40 million to the \nbudget request for national defense features in ships.\n  In addition, the full committee approved the budget request for $3 \nbillion for procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft, $70 million for \nmodifications to the C-5 aircraft, $170 million for the C-17 research \nand development, and $63 million for the C-5 research and development.\n  Fourth, the Navy must build no fewer than 8 ships per year to \nmaintain a force structure of approximately 300 vessels, as I mentioned \nearlier. Ship designs and technologies must respond to these challenges \nof both the littorals and the open ocean warfare.\n\n  Quantity has a quality of its own, especially when naval operations \noccur at the same time in different geographic regions. The Seapower \nportion of the bill therefore adds $375 million advanced procurement \nfor the LHD-8 and extends the DDG-51 multiyear procurement authority to \ninclude the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 ships.\n  The committee, however, remains concerned with the overall \nshipbuilding rate included in the administration's budget requests. The \ntopic of ship force structure was discussed more than any other issue \nin the Seapower hearings.\n  Witnesses stated repeatedly that the current force structure of 324 \nships already strains worldwide operations. This problem will only \ngrow, since the projected size of the fleet, as I said, will decrease \nto 305 platforms in the next 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has provided few specifics \non the planned size of the Navy force structure beyond the calendar \nyear 2015 and how it intends to address the impending ship shortfall \nproblem beyond lowering acquisition costs and reducing the size of \nships' crews.\n  The time has come for the administration to demonstrate an \nunderstanding of the ship acquisition problem and to share with \nCongress a systematic plan to address this serious national security \nconcern.\n  The report accompanying this bill requires the Secretary of Defense \nto submit, with the fiscal year 2001 budget request, a report that \ndetails the Department's long-range shipbuilding plan through fiscal \nyear 2030 and describes the annual funding required to procure 8 to 10 \nships a year between fiscal years 2001 and 2020.\n  Finally, attack submarines have reached the limits of sustainable \noperations. The submarines of the 21st century will generate key \nstrategic and tactical intelligence, deploy surveillance and \nreconnaissance teams, and enhance the firepower of carrier battle \ngroups. In recognition of these facts, the bill approves the request of \n$116 million for submarine advanced technology and adds $22 million for \nthe Advanced Deployable System.\n  Finally, the key to reducing the operating costs of ships lies in \nresearch and development to design future ships that can operate \neffectively with smaller crews. Our bill approves well-funded research \nand development programs for developing new ship designs to reduce \noverall life-cycle costs.\n  All of these naval programs, as well as the major systems of the \nother three Services, will require an adequate domestic basing \nstructure for maintenance and deployment. This factor, along with the \nchanging mix of threats to our national security, triggered the two \nbipartisan Armed Services Committee votes this year against amendments \nauthorizing additional base realignment and closure rounds.\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\n  The committee first rejected the BRAC amendments because no base \nclosure round yet has yielded the taxpayers any clear or proven \nsavings. To appreciate this point, one only need to consider the \nconclusion of the leading advocate of BRAC, the Department of Defense. \nDOD's April 1998 base closure report to Congress stated explicitly that \n``no audit trail, single document, or budget account exists for \ntracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC.''\n\n  Furthermore, the conflict in Kosovo illustrates how hostilities can \nstrain our ability to project military power in unstable areas of the \nworld. Since this war began in March, the United States has diverted \nits only aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific, near North Korea, to \nSerbia's Adriatic Sea basin. We have more than 400 aircraft from \nairfields across the country now engaged over Kosovo.\n  In the meantime, the Department of Defense has almost depleted the \nNation's air-launch precision missile stocks, strained our aerial \ntanker fleet, and called up 33,000 reservists. Congress and the \nadministration should therefore consider how to improve, rather than \nphase out, the shore- and land-based systems that sustain our deployed \nforces.\n  We cannot forget that America's overseas basing infrastructure has \ndeclined by more than 40 percent since the end of the cold war. The \nfour previous BRAC rounds have eliminated about 25 percent of domestic \nmilitary installations.\n  The key challenge of the 21st century force will focus on long-range \ndeployments from American territory to protect interests and allies on \nshort notice. We need a master base plan, still undeveloped, that \nidentifies categories of ports, staging grounds, airfields, depots, and \nmaintenance facilities to meet these strategic requirements. The \nadministration cannot ask Congress to approve more closure commissions \nin a vacuum about what physical support assets at home the troops of \ntomorrow will need to complete their missions abroad.\n  This authorization bill advances the goals of shaping the modernized \nArmed Forces on which Americans will rely to safeguard their interests \nin a changing and volatile world.\n  I again thank the committee chairman, Senator Warner, for his \nleadership, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for his leadership \nas well in crafting this significant bipartisan legislation. I urge all \nSenators to support it.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Laurell Brault, my \nmilitary fellow, be given floor privileges during the Senate \nconsideration of S. 1059.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, first I thank our distinguished \ncolleague from Maine. She comes from a great State which has a maritime \ntradition that really predates the United States of America. Am I not \ncorrect in that?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. How fortunate we are in the Senate to have one with that \ntraditional background as now head of the Seapower Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee of the Senate. You share that with another \ndistinguished colleague in the next-door State of Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, who is the ranking member. We are well represented on \nthis committee.\n  I commend you for your report and bring to the attention of the \nSenate and the American people the underlying theme of our pay bill, \nhow many times our men and women of the Armed Forces are required now \nin missions beyond our shores. That is very important. Of course, as to \nthe 300-ship Navy--a famous figure--I hope that you and I and others \ncan hold the line, because we are a maritime Nation. Our entire \neconomic strategy is dependent on the security of our overseas markets \nand the ability to get our products out. Our entire defense strategy is \ndependent on what we call forward deployment. The ships of the Navy are \na lifeline protection for both our economic as well as our national \nsecurity responsibilities in this country. I commend the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman for his comments. I certainly feel \nprivileged to chair the Seapower Subcommittee and to focus on some of \nthe critical challenges facing our naval forces in the future. Having \nhad the opportunity to visit our personnel on the U.S.S. Enterprise, \nthe U.S.S. Gettysburg, and the U.S.S. Ardent, I had a firsthand \nappreciation of the pressures placed on the men and women in our Armed \nForces and the more we need to support them in every way possible. That \nis why I think the pay and retirement provisions are all necessary, \ngiven the demands that are being placed on our naval forces overseas. \nThe deployments are longer and they are more rigorous. It is becoming \nfar more difficult for them when they return to home port because they \nhave to begin retraining. So there is very little time for them to \nprepare for the future and also the demands that these challenges \npresent in keeping them from their families. We have to recognize that. \nI think the administration has to recognize that in terms of the number \nof contingency operations, that, ultimately, is really putting a \ntremendous strain on all of our armed services.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague. I \ndare say that she will establish a record far superior to that of her \npredecessor; namely, the Senator from Virginia, as chairman of the \nSeapower Subcommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from Maine be \nadded as a cosponsor to the Roberts-Warner amendment now pending at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I understand the order is our \ndistinguished colleague, also a new member of our committee and one who \nhas certainly pulled her weight by a margin of two in her service on \nthe committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 384\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous unanimous consent order, the \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank our chairman for the fine work that he has \ndone in bringing this very important bill to the floor and to \nacknowledge the work of my colleague from Maine. As a Senator who \nrepresents another State with a great maritime tradition, I most \ncertainly appreciate the hard work and the intensity to which she \nbrings to bear in making sure we maintain adequate naval power to \nsupport all of our missions around the world. Her leadership has been \ntremendous. I look forward to working with her, along with our \nchairman, in the years to come.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, could I interrupt the Senator. I ask \nunanimous consent that at 5:30 today--I beg the forgiveness of the \nChair and our distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. On an equally important note, I rise to support the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, now in amendment form, offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and myself. We feel very \nstrongly about presenting it to the whole chamber, and we hope to get a \nvery strong bipartisan vote, in just a few minutes, on this resolution.\n  Madam President, at the close of World War II, Europe was devastated. \nThe allied armies, in liberating Eastern Europe, had uncovered a horror \nbeyond imagination--6 million Jews, men, women, and innocent children, \nhad been massacred, and millions of other civilians and soldiers had \nbeen killed on all sides by fruitless wars of aggression.\n  Once Germany itself had been occupied, the documentary evidence of \nthese atrocities came to light. Along with victory came the eventual \ncapture of the Nazi leadership, and slowly but surely, the German war \nleaders who did not kill themselves outright, fell into allied hands. \nAt that time there were two competing ideas on how to deal with these \nprisoners. The English and the Russians simply wanted to take the \nleaders of Nazi regime outside and shoot them. After all, it was the \nway victors had treated the vanquished in Europe for hundreds of years, \nparticularly when the vanquished had been so merciless themselves.\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\n  However, the American Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, proposed a \nvery different, and actually, radical solution. He wanted to use the \natrocities perpetrated by Nazi Germany to make real the notion of \ninternational law. In retrospect, it seems very strange, indeed, that a \nSecretary of War would be the primary advocate for holding a legal \nproceeding. But Secretary Stimson was wise. He understood something \nvery fundamental: America had not joined World War II to prop up the \nsame, tired cycle of war and revenge that had made Europe the bloodiest \ncontinent on Earth during the 20th century. We entered the war to \ncreate a fair and lasting peace. We had no territorial demands. We \nasked for no war reparations, and we did not come to loot and rob \nGermany of its treasures. All we wanted in exchange for the great \nsacrifice that we made as a people was the assurance that after the \nwar, peace, democracy and freedom would prevail.\n  The Nuremberg trials were one of the central steps in fulfilling this \nobjective. Instead of revenge, the trials stood for justice. Instead of \ncollective blame, these trials stood for individual accountability. \nInstead of Europe's bloody past, the Nuremberg trials held the promise \nthat we could break the cycle of violence.\n  Over 50 years since the conclusion of those trials, the Nuremberg \nprinciples are being called into question. I believe we reached the \nright conclusions at those trials. We hit upon some universal truths \nabout what needs to be done to bring true peace to a region wracked by \nwar. We determined it was necessary to establish justice, to hold \nindividuals accountable for their acts, and to try to stop future wars \nof revenge. Those principles ring true even today.\n  Ironically, as this map shows and as we are well aware, another \nconflict in Europe now puts the lessons of the Nuremberg Trials to the \ntest. We began strongly enough. In May of 1993, the United Nations \nSecurity Council created the first international war crimes court since \nthe Second World War, since the Nuremberg trials. The International \nCriminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia was formed to investigate and \ntry war crime cases resulting from the war in Bosnia. It was hailed \nthen as the first step towards reconciliation of the warring factions.\n  If the international community could bring justice to Bosnia, if they \ncould expose the wanton destruction of human life by the Bosnian Serbs, \nthere might be a real chance for the same collective soul searching \nthat occurred in Germany at the end of World War II. That reflection \nand acknowledgment of wrongdoing has generated a peace between the \ngreat powers of Western Europe that was simply unthinkable at the \nbeginning of this century. If it can happen between the Germans and the \nFrench, why not between the Croats and the Serbs?\n  For a number of reasons, mostly political, the international \ncommunity has simply not grasped the opportunity that this \ninternational tribunal has offered to us.\n  In the 6 years since its formation, the Tribunal has indicted 84 \npeople. However, of those 84 indicted, it has completed only 6 trials. \nTwenty-five others are now in custody, either awaiting trial, or \ninvolved in proceedings. But six convictions in 6 years is a very \nmediocre showing for a conflict that was marked by intense brutality on \nall sides. Furthermore, the most significant war criminals remain at \nlarge. We are aware of where they are, but they continue operating \nunmolested. The reality is that while the vast majority of war crime \nindictments were against Bosnian Serbs, the Croatian and Muslim \nindictees are far more frequently held in custody because their \ngovernments have been cooperating with the Tribunal.\n  Unfortunately, the moment for effective action has passed and the \nresults are clear. When we do not uphold the principles established at \nNuremberg, it gives license to thugs and dictators to pursue their aims \nby brutality and illegal means. We can only wonder if there would have \nbeen different headlines today had we been more insistent that the \nperpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia stand before the bar of justice.\n  I am joined by my colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, in \nintroducing this amendment that seeks to prevent a repeat of our \nmistakes. Let us make the Tribunal truly effective. That is what this \namendment offers. The chief prosecutor, Justice Arbor, has made clear \nthat the Tribunal's jurisdiction does extend to Kosovo. We need to \nensure that when this war is over--and one day, hopefully soon, it will \nbe--the parties responsible for these crimes will be made to answer \npersonally. Our amendment addresses a number of the obstacles currently \nfacing the tribunal.\n  First, the amendment asks that the United States, in coordination \nwith other United Nations contributors, provide the resources necessary \nfor a rigorous investigation of the war crimes committed in Kosovo. I \nam happy to report, as was mentioned by my friend from Pennsylvania, \nthat an additional $18 million has already been passed by this Senate \nin the supplemental appropriations bill for this specific purpose. At \npresent, the Tribunal has a mere 70 investigators at its disposal. This \nnumber covers not only the 600,000 refugees from Kosovo, but all of the \nongoing investigations of Bosnian war crimes. Clearly, the Tribunal is \nundermanned to undertake a project of the enormity presented by Kosovo.\n  Secondly, the resolution calls on our Government, through our \nintelligence services, to provide all possible cooperation in the \ngathering of evidence necessary to prosecute war crimes. While \ntestimonial evidence is sufficient to bring charges against those \nresponsible for the mass execution, the rapes, gang rapes and arson, \nbut such evidence rarely addresses the crimes of a country's \nleadership. Such is the case in Kosovo. Milosevic is not out in the \nfield shooting civilians himself, but the situation certainly looks as \nif he is issuing the orders--proving that connection requires \nintelligence sources that only we and our NATO allies can provide. And \nwe should do it forthwith.\n  Additionally, we cannot be afraid of where the war crimes evidence \nleads. This resolution will make it clear that no one--no one--will be \nexempt. We shall not compromise long-term peace prospects for short-\nterm political expediency. Wherever the evidence leads, indictments \nwill follow.\n  Equally important, this resolution reflects the fact that all nations \nhave an obligation to honor arrest warrants issued by the International \nCriminal Tribunal. Many of those already indicted are living normal \nlives while their whereabouts are well known. Such selective \nprosecution and inaction breeds cynicism and creates an atmosphere that \nsupports the sort of thugs now operating in Serbia. It undermines our \neffort and it should not be tolerated. This must stop.\n  The resolution we introduce today calls on the United States to use \nall appropriate means to apprehend war criminals already under \nindictment.\n\n  Lastly, and most critically, this resolution insists that NATO should \nnot accept any diplomatic resolution to the war in Kosovo that would \nbar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals. The \nproper resolution of this conflict may be our last opportunity to bring \na lasting peace to this region. It cannot be done if those responsible \nfor the war are not punished for their actions.\n  It is often easier to exclude tyrants from justice to secure a \ntemporary lull in the fighting than to support a thorough and complete \npeace. If we go for easy answers, we will doom the people of that \nregion to repeat these same horrors again and again. As historians have \noften noted, one war frequently sows seeds for the next. This is \nparticularly true of the kind of incessant ethnic warfare going on in \nthe Balkans. The only way to change this reality is to insist that \nindividuals be held accountable for their barbaric actions and be \nbrought to justice.\n  People must understand that there are international standards of \nbehavior and they will be held accountable. It makes a huge difference \nin the way they interact with their neighbors. In short, we must \ndemonstrate that might does not make right and that no one can benefit \nfrom the misery of their neighbors.\n  Our State Department recently issued a report entitled ``Erasing \nHistory: Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo.'' This is one of a hundred \npictures that have been taken, showing the horrors of mass executions \nand murder of innocent men, women and children. That\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nreport details much of what is already known--700,000 refugees forced \nto flee their homes; 500 villages looted and burned; at least 70 \ninstances of summary executions; the systematic rape of women and young \ngirls, and the list goes on.\n  What is odd about ethnic cleansing is that while it tries to erase \nhistory, it actually has the opposite effect. It brands indelibly into \npeople's minds the memories of the fire, torture, the shooting, the \nrape, the running, the horrors of the night and the morning. The entire \nhistory of the Balkans reads like one giant tragedy where the past \nmotivates evil in the present. Instead of erasing history, Yugoslavia \nmust move beyond it, and NATO needs to continue to press them in that \ndirection to achieve those ends. Justice, provided impartially and \nequally, is the most effective means for doing that, and we can do that \nthrough a strong, well-financed, determined War Crimes Tribunal.\n  There may be no clean hands in the Balkans, but there can be new \nbeginnings. I believe this resolution will anchor the United States \npolicy to creating one.\n  I would like to put up another chart of something that shows a video \ncapture from a tape recently smuggled out of Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator allow me to interrupt \nto make a unanimous-consent request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \ntoday, which is just minutes away, the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Specter-Landrieu amendment No. 384 with no amendments \nin order to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might draw the Senate's attention \nto the last paragraph, which is section 5, can the Senator read that?\n  It says: ``NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the \nconflict in Kosovo that would bar''--and then, my first question is, Is \nit conceivable that the United Nations should likewise not accept any? \nI mean in the final analysis, it is difficult to predict now. Certainly \nNATO will have a voice in the matter. But it could be that this thing \nwould be involved before the United Nations. Is the spirit of this to \ninclude the United Nations, so to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. I would say so. The spirit of this resolution is \nclear that no diplomatic end to this war should allow any immunity for \nthose who are guilty of war crimes.\n  I would have no objection. I would want to talk with Senator Specter \nabout adding reference to the United Nations. Clearly though, it is a \nNATO conflict.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me proceed to another item.\n  The Senator used the key phrase, she doesn't want any amnesty or \nanything to prohibit the prosecution, and I think the Senator said ``of \nthose who are guilty.'' But who has to establish guilt in terms of who \nis and who is not guilty? It seems to me if this were to read that it \nwould ``bar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of persons \nalleged to have committed,'' because the Senator said ``war \ncriminals,'' that could be interpreted as saying somebody is already \ndesignated one, two, three, and four as a war criminal and, therefore, \nyou cannot give them amnesty, but there are some, I would presume, in \nthis conflict who have not been designated ``war criminals'' but there \nare allegations to that effect, and they would have to proceed through \nthe indictment process. But as this is written, the date of the \nagreement might cut off a class of individuals who are guilty but have \nnot been as yet designated ``war criminals.''\n  Do I make myself clear?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand, I believe, what the Senator from Virginia \nis asking me. But I think the language of this amendment covers his \nconcerns. We have not been allowed into Kosovo 1 day, but when we are, \nit will reveal atrocities and evidence of those responsible. It will \nhappen in the same way as when we entered into Central Europe to find \nthe concentration camps. This resolution simply states that no \nresolution of this conflict should give immunity in advance to anyone \nwho could be charged and then later convicted of war crimes.\n  I think the language is clear on that intent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's hope this colloquy has cleared up any other \nquestions. Before we started the debate, I talked with the Senator, and \nI thought she was very candid in her private comments to me.\n  Supposing that this frightful conflict drags on and the only basis on \nwhich anyone can reach any resolution is the question of amnesty, do I \nunderstand the Senator's position to be that under no circumstances \nshould the sole remaining provision to stop this conflict be waived by \nthose negotiating and those who eventually have to accept the \nresolution? Is that your position?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. It is quite a serious point of this \nresolution, and I recognize that it may take a tool off the table, but \nit is purposefully done that way. I happen to believe it would be a \ngreat mistake for this Nation and our NATO allies to enter into any \nagreements that give immunity to people who are charged with war \ncrimes, with the brutality of gang rapes, and torture. And there are \nhundreds of examples that we have had now from eyewitness accounts that \nwe hope to prosecute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I don't intend to take the Senator's \ntime. I intend to support the resolution. I thought a colloquy would \nbring out questions that others might have in mind and would clarify \nany doubts.\n  Madam President, thank you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield further while she is being \ninterrupted, I want to commend the good Senator from Louisiana for her \nsteadfastness, and for the sponsors' steadfastness on that very point. \nThere was no provision for amnesty in Dayton. There was no provision \nfor amnesty at Rambouillet. There should be no such provision, nor \nshould the door be opened a crack to any such possibility. People must \nbe held accountable for war crimes. I do not think for 1 minute that \nthere is room for negotiation on that issue, or else we will see an \nendless repetition of the kind of cleansing of ethnic groups that we \nhave seen in the Balkans.\n  I commend the sponsors, and particularly the Senator from Louisiana \nfor her strength and support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I likewise commend the esteemed \ncolleague and Senator from Louisiana for an important amendment which \nwill send a signal at this time. It is very timely.\n  I wish to commend my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. It is \na very interesting combination of two Senators coming to the floor on \nan important point.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nsurely brings a tremendous amount of expertise, having been a \nprosecutor and having dealt with these issues on a domestic basis and \nan international basis.\n  Let me just conclude by pointing out and explaining what this picture \nis. This looks like a picture of people burying bodies. But actually, \nbecause this is part of a 20-minute video, this is a snapshot, of \npeople exhuming bodies, digging up a mass grave, to try to hide or \nrelocate these victims. The State Department believes that the Serbs \nare placing the bodies around bomb sites to mislead the Yugoslavian \npeople and the international community.\n  This is an important part of the world. If I can close by putting up \na map of Yugoslavia--this is not a small, insignificant area--\nYugoslavia lays in the heart of Europe on the Mediterranean Sea where \ncivilizations have lasted for thousands and thousands of years. We have \nfought wars and millions of soldiers have died. Americans have spent \nfortunes and generations of blood helping Europe to achieve peace. In \nlarge part we have succeeded. With this one important exception. \nEstablishing law and order through the Tribunal is the first step on a \nlong road of recovery. That is the point of this resolution.\n  I hope we will be successful today, and that it will give us the \nstrength to maintain our resolve to bring justice to people who are \ndepending on us.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  One of the points raised by the Senator from Virginia is a technical \ndrafting issue, which I think is a relevant one. I believe we can \ncorrect it in conference. I think its importance was pointed out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5:30 having arrived, the question \nis on agreeing to Amendment No. 384.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), \nthe Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time on behalf of the \ndistinguished majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 on \nTuesday, tomorrow, the Senate resume the DOD authorization bill and \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire be recognized for up to 20 minutes on a \nmatter regarding the historic connection of the U.S.S. Indianapolis to \nthe history of our Nation, to be immediately followed by 30 minutes for \ndebate, equally divided, with an additional 10 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Gramm relative to Senator Roth's amendment regarding \nAdmiral Kimmell and General Short.\n  I further ask consent that following that debate, the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and there then be 1 hour for debate equally \ndivided relative to the Roberts-Warner amendment No. 377.\n  I further ask that following that debate, the amendment be laid aside \nand then there be up to 1 hour equally divided relative to the \nWellstone amendment No. 382.\n  I finally ask consent that at 2:15 on Tuesday, the Senate proceed to \na vote on or in relation to the Roth amendment and, following that \nvote, the Roberts-Warner amendment No. 378 be agreed to and the Senate \nimmediately proceed to a vote on amendment No. 377, as amended, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to amendment No. 382, with 2 \nminutes for explanation prior to each vote.\n  For the information of all Senators----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President--no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  For the information of all Senators, the next votes will occur at \n2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. It is the hope of leadership that passage could \noccur by close of business Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. On \nbehalf of the majority leader and, I am sure, the minority leader, we \nurge our colleagues to do everything they can to make this possible.\n  The distinguished whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know of two more able managers of a \nbill than the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan. But \non behalf of the minority, I say that it would break all records of the \nSenate to finish this bill tomorrow night. It simply is not possible to \ndo.\n  We in the minority are going to cooperate in every way we can. The \nfact that we have these two fine managers doesn't mean we can perform a \nmiracle.\n  Additionally compounding the issue, I have been told that there has \nbeen an amendment filed dealing with the Kosovo situation that could \ntake days of debate, not hours of debate.\n  We are willing to cooperate. There is no one on this side who wants \nto hold up this bill for any purpose other than the fact that we want \nto have a good bill. In short, we have shown in the past few months \nsince this Congress has been in session that we have cooperated every \nway we can, as indicated by the work that was done in reducing 91 \nDemocratic amendments on the juvenile justice bill to a mere handful of \namendments so we could get that passed by Thursday evening.\n  In short, we want to help. We want to cooperate in any way we can. \nBut we cannot be part of this miracle, because it won't happen.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Nevada for \nnot only all of his help in getting bills passed but also in \nrealistically assessing situations, which is part of his job.\n  I must say, given the amendments we already know of, while I am \nhopeful, too, of completing action on this bill at some point this \nweek, I do not see how the hopes, as expressed here, can come to \nreality, given the substance of some of these amendments.\n  Again, the Kosovo amendment alone, I think, would precipitate a \nsignificant, lengthy debate on this floor, given all of the \ncircumstances and the length of time which that subject has already \nrequired for debate, and the fact that we are in the middle of a \nconflict right now, and the ramifications for that conflict and the \nsignals which would be sent to the prime creator of that conflict, Mr. \nMilosevic. It would be a lengthy debate, I think. I would like to \nfinish this bill by Wednesday, too, but I just can't see, given that \namendment and other amendments which are significant, that that is a \nrealistic assessment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. It is not a member of the minority who filed that \namendment. It is a member of the majority who has filed that amendment; \nis that true?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n106 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 388\n\n  (Purpose: To request the President to advance the late Rear Admiral \n  (retired) Husband E. Kimmel on the retired list of the Navy to the \n highest grade held as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, during \nWorld War II, and to advance the late Major General (retired) Walter C. \n  Short on the retired list of the Army to the highest grade held as \n Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, during World War II, as was \n   done under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for all other senior \n    officers who served in positions of command during World War II)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous amendments \nwill be set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 388.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 388) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and on behalf of Senator Thurmond and Senator \nKennedy to introduce an amendment whose intent is to redress a grave \ninjustice that haunts us from the tribulations of World War II.\n  Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior \ncommanders of U.S. forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the \ndisastrous surprise December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the attack, they were unfairly and publicly \ncharged with dereliction of duty and blamed as singularly responsible \nfor the success of that attack.\n  Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily \nprepared report to the President, the Roberts Commission--perhaps the \nmost flawed and unfortunately most influential investigation of the \ndisaster--levelled the dereliction of duty charge against Kimmel and \nShort--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized.\n  Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this \nCommission, later disavowed its report, stating that these two officers \nwere ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to trial, they would \nhave been cleared of the charge.''\n  Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor \nas Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote:\n\n       In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in \n     the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn \n     up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of \n     the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and \n     deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government \n     Printing Office.\n\n  After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a \npainfully enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nnot advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of war-time \ncommand--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who \nserved in war-time positions above his regular grade.\n  Admiral Kimmel, a two star admiral, served in a four star command. \nGeneral Short, a two star general, served in a three star command. Let \nme repeat, advancement on the retired lists was granted to every other \nflag rank officer who served in World War II in a post above their \ngrade.\n  That decision against Kimmel and Short was made despite the fact that \nwar-time investigations had exonerated these commanders of the \ndereliction of duty charge and criticized their higher commands for \nsignificant failings that contributed to the success of the attack on \nPearl Harbor. More than six studies and investigations conducted after \nthe war, including one Department of Defense report completed in 1995 \nat Senator Thurmond's request, reconfirmed these findings.\n  Our amendment is a rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution 19, the Kimmel-\nShort Resolution, that I, Senator Biden, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nHelms, Senator Stevens, Senator Cochran, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nAbraham, Senator Craig, Senator Durbin, Senator John Kerry, Senator \nKyl, Senator Hollings, Senator Bob Smith, Senator Collins, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Voinovich, Senator DeWine, and Senator Feinstein--a \ntotal of 23 cosponsors--introduced last month.\n  The amendment calls upon the President of the United States to \nadvance posthumously on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort to the grades of their highest war-time commands. Its passage \nwould communicate the Senate's recognition of the injustice done to \nthem and call upon the President to take corrective action.\n  Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of \nblame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of these two officers. \nIt is a correction consistent with our military's tradition of honor.\n  Mr. President, the investigations providing clear evidence that \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame \ninclude a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board \nof Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee, and a 1991 Army \nBoard for the Correction of Military Records.\n  To give you the sense of the thoroughness of these investigations, I \nhave before me the volumes that constitute the Joint Congressional \nCommittee's final report that compiles many of these studies.\n  I think they demonstrate, beyond question, the thoroughness with \nwhich the investigation had proceeded.\n  The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four \nprincipal points.\n  First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not \nprovided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in \nWashington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and \nconsistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short.\n  In my review of this fundamental point, I was most struck by the \nhonor and integrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was \nArmy Chief of Staff at the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl \nHarbor.\n  On November 27 of that year, General Short interpreted a vaguely \nwritten war warning message sent from the high command in Washington as \nsuggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, he \nconcentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, \nthus inadvertently increasing their vulnerability to air attack. When \nhe reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the \nGeneral Staff took no steps to clarify the reality of the situation.\n  In 1946, before a Joint Congressional Committee on the Pearl Harbor \ndisaster, General Marshall testified that he was responsible for \nensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He \nacknowledged that he must have received General Short's report, which \nwould have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that \nhe failed to do so.\n  Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of \nresponsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able \nto have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort.\n  A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the \nDepartment of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the \nflow of intelligence. The 1995 Department of Defense report stated that \nthe handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up \nto the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, \nineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \nclarification and follow-up.\n  The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned \nreports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed \nonly upon the Hawaiian commanders. They all underscored significant \nfailures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that \ncontributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  The 1995 Department of Defense report put it best, stating that \n``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely \non the shoulders\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\nof Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly shared.''\n  This is an important quote. It shows that the Department of Defense \nrecognizes that these two commanders should not be singled out for \nblame. Yet, still today on this issue, our government's words do not \nmatch its actions.\n  Kimmel and Short remain the only two officials who have been forced \nto pay a price for the disaster at Pearl Harbor.\n  Let me add one poignant fact about the two wartime investigations. \nTheir conclusions--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly \ndisposed according to the information available to them and that their \nsuperiors had failed to share important intelligence--were kept secret \non the grounds that making them public would have been detrimental to \nthe war effort.\n  Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the \ncruel myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the \ndisaster at Pearl Harbor. Admiral Spruance, one of our great naval \ncommanders of World War II, shares this view. He put it this way:\n  ``I have always felt that Kimmel and Short were held responsible for \nPearl Harbor in order that the American people might have no reason to \nlose confidence in their government in Washington. This was probably \njustifiable under the circumstances at that time, but it does not \njustify forever damning those two fine officers.''\n  Mr. President, to do so is not only unfair, it tarnishes our nation's \nmilitary honor.\n  Mr. President, this sense of the Senate has been endorsed by \ncountless military officers, including those who have served at the \nhighest levels of command. These include former Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and Admiral William J. Crowe, \nand former Chiefs of Naval Operations Admiral J.L. Holloway III, \nAdmiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost.\n  Moreover a number of public organizations have called for posthumous \nadvancement of Kimmel and Short. Last August, the VFW passed a \nresolution calling for the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort.\n  Let me add that Senator Robert Dole, one of our most distinguished \ncolleagues and a veteran who served heroically in World Warr II, has \nalso endorsed this sense of the Senate resolution.\n  This resolution now in amendment form is about justice, equity, and \nhonor. Its purpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short are treated with the dignity and honor \nthey deserve, and to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate \nthe memory and lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor.\n  As we approach Memorial Day and prepare to honor those who served to \nprotect our great nation, it is a most appropriate time to redress this \ninjustice. After 58 years, this correction is long overdue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this joint resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of exhibits be \nprinted in the Record, including a statement from the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, including a resolution adopted by the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, a letter from several distinguished admirals of the U.S. Navy who \nare alive and sent this to us comparatively recently, likewise a letter \nfrom the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, Inc., and finally a copy \nof the letter from Senator Bob Dole to myself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: All Members of the United States Senate 105th U.S. \n         Congress\n     From: Thomas A. Pouliot, Commander-in-Chief Veterans of \n         Foreign Wars of the United States\n     Date: 28 September 1998.\n       On August 31, 1998, the delegates to 99th National \n     Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \n     States unanimously approved Resolution Number 441, ``Restore \n     Pre-Attack Ranks to Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General \n     Walter C. Short.'' A copy of VFW Resolution Number 441 is \n     attached for your review.\n       Based on our resolution and a review of S.J. Res. 55, we \n     believe the goals of both the Senate and VFW resolutions are \n     similar and consistent.\n       Therefore, we strongly endorse this bill and ask that the \n     Senate remove the burden of guilt for the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor from the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Thomas A.

William S. Cohen,\n     The Secretary of Defense,\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Last month, Senators Joe Biden and \n     William Roth of Delaware sent a letter urging you to \n     recommend to the President that Admiral Husband Kimmel and \n     General Walter Short be advanced posthumously to their \n     wartime ranks of four star Admiral and Lieutenant General \n     respectively.\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States supports \n     the recommendation of Senators Biden and Roth, and asks that \n     you consider their request.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John E. Moon,\n     Commander-in-Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Resolution No. 441--Restore Pre-Attack Ranks to Admiral Husband E. \n                   Kimmel and General Walter C. Short\n\n       Whereas, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. \n     Short were the Commanders of Record for the Navy and Army \n     Forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, when the \n     Japanese Imperial Navy launched its attack; and\n       Whereas, following the attack, President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts to \n     a commission to investigate such incident to determine if \n     there had been any dereliction to duty; and\n       Whereas, the Roberts Commission conducted a rushed \n     investigation in only five weeks. It charged Admiral Kimmel \n     and General Short with dereliction of their duty. The \n     findings were made public to the world; and\n       Whereas, the dereliction of duty charge destroyed the honor \n     and reputations of both Admiral Kimmel and General Short, and \n     due to the urgency neither man was given the opportunity to \n     defend himself against the accusation of dereliction of duty; \n     and\n       Whereas, other investigations showed that there was no \n     basis for the dereliction of duty charges, and a \n     Congressional investigation in 1946 made specific findings \n     that neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short had been \n     ``derelict in his duty'' at the time of the bombing of Pearl \n     Harbor; and\n       Whereas, it has been documented that the United States \n     military had broken the Japanese codes in 1941. With the use \n     of a cryptic machine known as ``Magic,'' the military was \n     able to decipher the Japanese diplomatic code known as \n     ``Purple'' and the military code known as JN-25. The final \n     part of the diplomatic message that told of the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor was received on December 6, 1941. With this \n     vital information in hand, no warning was dispatched to \n     Admiral Kimmel or General Short to provide sufficient time to \n     defend Pearl Harbor in the proper manner; and\n       Whereas, it was not until after the tenth investigation of \n     the attack on Pearl Harbor was completed in December of 1995 \n     that the United States Government acknowledge in the report \n     of Under Secretary of Defense Edwin S. Dorn that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not solely responsible for the \n     disaster, but that responsibility must be broadly shared; and\n       Whereas, at this time the American public has been deceived \n     for the past fifty-six years regarding the unfound charge of \n     dereliction of duty against two fine military officers whose \n     reputations and honor have been tarnished; now, therefore\n       Be It Resolved, by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the \n     United States, that we urge the President of the United \n     States to restore the honor and reputations of Admiral \n     Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n     To: Honorable Members of the United States Senate.\n     From: Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former \n         Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Former Chief of Naval \n         Operations; J.L. Holloway III, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), \n         Former Chief of Naval Operations; William J. Crowe, \n         Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs \n         of Staff; Elmo R. Zumwalt, Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), \n         Former Chief of Naval Operations; Carlisle A.H. Trost, \n         Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.), Former Chief of Naval \n         Operations.\n     Re: The Honor and Reputations of Admiral Husband Kimmel and \n         General Walter Short.\n       Dear Senator: We ask that the honor and reputations of two \n     fine officers who dedicated themselves to the service of \n     their country be restored. Admiral Husband Kimmel and General \n     Walter Short were singularly scapegoated as responsible for \n     the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December \n     7, 1941. The time is long overdue to reverse this inequity \n     and treat Admiral Kimmel and General Short fairly and justly. \n     The appropriate vehicle for that is the current Roth-Biden \n     Resolution.\n       The Resolution calls for the posthumous advancement on the \n     retired list of Admiral\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\n     Kimmel and General Short to their highest WWII wartime ranks \n     of four-star admiral and three-star general as provided by \n     the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. They are the only two \n     eligible officers who have been singled out for exclusion \n     from that privilege; all other eligible officers have been so \n     privileged.\n       We urge you to support this Resolution.\n       We are career military officers who have served over a \n     period of several decades and through several wartime eras in \n     the capacities of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and/or \n     Chief of Naval Operations. Each of us is familiar with the \n     circumstances leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       We are unanimous in our conviction that Admiral Husband \n     Kimmel and General Walter Short were not responsible for the \n     success of that attack, and that the fault lay with the \n     command structure at the seat of government in Washington. \n     The Roth-Biden Resolution details specifics of this case and \n     requests the President of the United States to nominate \n     Kimmel and Short for appropriate advancement in rank.\n       As many of you know, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \n     the Hawaiian Commanders in charge of naval and ground forces \n     on Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack. After a hurried \n     investigation in January, 1942 they were charged with having \n     been ``derelict in their duty'' and given no opportunity to \n     refute that charge which was publicized throughout the \n     country.\n       As a result, many today believe the ``dereliction'' charge \n     to be true despite the fact that a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel of blame; a Joint Congressional \n     Committee specifically found that neither had been derelict \n     in his duty; a four-to-one majority of the members of a Board \n     for the Correction of Military Records in the Department of \n     the Army found that General Short had been ``unjustly held \n     responsible'' and recommended his advancement to the rank of \n     lieutenant general on the retired list.\n       This injustice has been perpetuated for more than half a \n     century by their sole exclusion from the privilege of the Act \n     mentioned above.\n       As professional military officers we support in the \n     strongest terms the concept of holding commanders accountable \n     for the performance of their forces. We are equally strong in \n     our belief in the fundamental American principle of justice \n     for all Americans, regardless of creed, color, status or \n     rank. In other words, we believe strongly in fairness.\n       These two principles must be applied to the specific facts \n     of a given situation. History as well as innumerable \n     investigations have proven beyond any question that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster. And we submit that where there is no \n     responsibility there can be no accountability.\n       But as a military principle--both practical and moral--the \n     dynamic of accountability works in both directions along the \n     vertical line known as the chain of command. In view of the \n     facts presented in the Roth-Biden Resolution and below--with \n     special reference to the fact that essential and critical \n     intelligence information was withheld from the Hawaiian \n     Commanders despite the commitment of the command structure to \n     provide that information to them--we submit that while the \n     Hawaiian commanders were as responsible and accountable as \n     anyone could have been given the circumstances, their \n     superiors in Washington were sadly and tragically lacking in \n     both of these leadership commitments.\n       A review of the historical facts available on the subject \n     of the attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrates that these \n     officers were not treated fairly.\n       1. They accomplished all that anyone could have with the \n     support provided by their superiors in terms of operating \n     forces (ships and aircraft) and information (instructions and \n     intelligence). Their disposition of forces, in view of the \n     information made available to them by the command structure \n     in Washington, was reasonable and appropriate.\n       2. Admiral Kimmel was told of the capabilities of U.S. \n     intelligence (MAGIC, the code-breaking capability of PURPLE \n     and other Japanese codes) and he was promised he could rely \n     on adequate warning of any attack based on this special \n     intelligence capability. Both Commanders rightfully operated \n     under the impression, and with the assurance, that they were \n     receiving the necessary intelligence information to fulfill \n     their responsibilities.\n       3. Historical information now available in the public \n     domain through declassified files, and post-war statements of \n     many officers involved, clearly demonstrate that vital \n     information was routinely withheld from both commanders. For \n     example, the ``Bomb Plot'' message and subsequent reporting \n     orders from Tokyo to Japanese agents in Hawaii as to \n     location, types and number of warships, and their replies to \n     Tokyo.\n       4. The code-breaking intelligence of PURPLE did provide \n     warning of an attack on Pearl Harbor, but the Hawaiian \n     Commanders were not informed. Whether deliberate or for some \n     other reason should make no difference, have no bearing. \n     These officers did not get the support and warnings they were \n     promised.\n       5. The fault was not theirs.

Kimmel,\n     Wilmington, DE.\n       Dear Mr. Kimmel: I am writing to you in regards to the \n     resolution that we of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, \n     Inc. passed at our National Convention in Albuquerque, NM. \n     this past December 6, 1990.\n       Subject: A resolution to restore the full wartime rank of \n     Adm. Kimmel and Gen. Short, (posthumously).\n       Whereas: Following the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl \n     Harbor December 7, 1941 the two officers in command of U.S. \n     armed forces at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel \n     (Pacific Fleet Commander) and Lieutenant General Walter C. \n     Short (Hawaii Army Commander) were retired in ``permanent \n     grade'' from their respective branches of the armed forces.\n       Whereas: At the time of the attack Admiral Kimmel was \n     serving in a temporary appointment as full Admiral (four \n     stars) but was retired as Rear Admiral (two stars), his \n     permanent grade.\n       Whereas: At the time of the attack, Lieutenant General \n     Short was serving in a temporary appointment as Lieutenant \n     General (three stars) but was retired as a Major General (two \n     stars), his permanent grade.\n       Whereas: In 1947 provisions were enacted in the laws \n     governing retirement from the armed forces which permitted \n     officers who had temporarily served in a higher rank to be \n     advanced on the retired list to that higher rank, without \n     benefit of higher pay, when recommended for such advancement \n     by the Secretary of Defense and approved by the President of \n     the United States and concurred in by the Senate.\n       Whereas: Recently published historical writings and film \n     documentaries established that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short were unjustly made scapegoats for the success of the \n     surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and other military \n     installations on Oahu on December 7, 1941.\n       Whereas: At its National Convention in December 1984 at \n     Grossingers Resort in New York State, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, Inc. representing voices of the time, \n     unanimously passed a resolution honoring the memory of \n     Admiral Kimmel and General Short and praising them for having \n     single-handedly shouldered the full blame for the disaster at \n     Pearl Harbor when, in fact, others, and the whole nation \n     should have shared the burden.\n       Whereas: The terms of the 1984 resolution were fulfilled at \n     the PHSA 45th reunion in Hawaii in December, 1986 when these \n     officers' nearest living next-of-kin were presented \n     beautifully inscribed plaques honoring Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short with an expression of admiration and respect.\n       Resolved: (1) That the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association \n     urges the Secretary of Defense to recommend to the President \n     of the United States that he nominate Rear Admiral Husband E. \n     Kimmel (Retired) (Deceased) for posthumous promotion to the \n     rank of full Admiral on the list of retired naval officers \n     and Major General Walter C. Short (Retired) (Deceased) for \n     posthumous promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General on the \n     list of retired army officers, these ranks being the highest \n     in which these officers served while on active duty in the \n     armed forces of the United States in 1941.\n       Resolved further: (2) That the Pearl Harbor Survivors \n     Association urges the President of the United States to make \n     the aforedescribed nominations and send them to the Senate of \n     the United States for its advice and consent with the \n     recommendation that they be favorably acted upon by that \n     body.\n       Resolved further: (3) That the Pearl Harbor Survivors \n     Association, Inc. urges the Senate of the United States to \n     give its advice and consent to the aforementioned \n     nominations.\n       Resolved further: (4) That the Secretary of the Pearl \n     Harbor Survivors Association, Inc. forward copies of these \n     resolutions to the Secretary of Defense, the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the U.S. Senate, and to the \n     Chairman and each member of the Senate Armed Forces \n     Committee.\n       Submitted by Alex D. Cobb, Jr.\n       We the officers of the Association are now in the process \n     of complying with the above resolution and hopefully will \n     have it in place for the 50th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\n       If I can be of further help please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kenneth R. Creese,\n     National Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Senator Bob Dole\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1999.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: I will join my voice with yours in support of \n     the Kimmel-Short Resolution of 1999.\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\n       The responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should be \n     shared by many. In light of the more recent disclosures of \n     withheld information Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short should have had, I agree these two commanders have been \n     unjustly stigmatized.\n       Please keep me informed of the progress of this resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nsponsored by my friends from Delaware--Senators Roth and Biden.\n  Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short were both \nunfairly maligned for their roles during the invasion of Pearl Harbor. \nThey were blamed for not anticipating nor being prepared for the \nattack. Admiral Kimmel was commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, and \nGeneral Short was commander of U.S. Army forces. The overwhelming \nconsensus of the academic community and retired flag officers, most \nnotably naval officers, concur that history must be set straight in \nthis matter.\n  Admiral Kimmel and General Short are, in my opinion, the two final \nvictims of Pearl Harbor. Both officers were relieved of their commands, \ntheir careers and reputations destroyed after being blamed for \nnegligence and dereliction of duty. These men were doing their duty to \nthe best of their ability, and without full cooperation from superiors \nin their chain-of-command. Despite the fact that the charge of \ndereliction of duty was never proved, that charge still exists in the \nminds of many people.\n  Surprisingly, almost everyone above these two officers escaped \ncensure. Yet, we know now that civilian and military officials in \nWashington withheld vital intelligence information which could have \nmore fully alerted the field commanders to their imminent peril.\n  In judging Admiral Kimmel and General Short, the following facts have \nbeen repeatedly substantiated, but wrongfully and continually ignored:\n  The intelligence made available to the Pearl Harbor commanders was \nnot sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was \nmaintained prior to the attack.\n  Neither officer knew of the decoded intelligence in Washington \nindicating the Japanese had identified the United States as an enemy.\n  Both commanders were assured by their superiors they were getting the \nbest intelligence available at the time.\n  There were no prudent defensive options available for the officers \nthat would have significantly affected the outcome of the attack.\n  Military, governmental and congressional investigations have provided \nclear evidence that these two commanders were singled out for blame \nthat should have been widely shared.\n  In 1995, I held an in-depth meeting to review this matter which \nincluded the officers' families, historians, experts and retired high-\nranking military officers, who all testified in favor of the two \ncommanders.\n  In response to this review, Under Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn's \nsubsequent report disclosed officially--for the first time--that blame \nshould be ``broadly shared.'' The Dorn Report stated members of the \nhigh command in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese messages \nthat in their totality ``. . . pointed strongly toward an attack on \nPearl Harbor on the 7th of December, 1941 . . .'' and that this \nintelligence was never sent to the Hawaiian commanders.\n  The Dorn Report went so far as to characterize the handling of \ncritically important decoded Japanese messages in Washington as \nrevealing ``ineptitude . . . unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, \nlimited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and \nfollow-up at higher levels.''\n  They are eligible for this advancement in rank by token of the \nOfficer Personnel Act of 1947, which authorizes retirement at highest \nwartime rank. All eligible officers have benefitted. All except for \ntwo: Admiral Kimmel and General Short. This advancement in rank would \nofficially vindicate them. No retroactive pay would be involved.\n  The posthumous promotion of Admiral Kimmel and General Short will be \na small step in restoring honor to these men.\n  It is time for Congress and the Administration to step forward and do \nthe right thing.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with great reluctance, I oppose this \namendment. I do so based on some independent study that I have made, \nand indeed, I guess, throughout my lifetime. I had a very, very modest \nperiod of active service at the end of World War II in 1945 for a \nperiod of about 15 or 18 months. I can't remember now.\n  Anyway, I lived my lifetime through this period of history. \nTherefore, all of my active service in that period was here in the \nUnited States, preparing to join others of my generation for the \ninvasion of Japan, which I thank the Dear Lord did not take place.\n  I have gone through enough of this material to satisfy me that what \nwe are faced with here is one generation trying to provide revisionist \nhistory upon another. That is, in my judgment, unwise, and it could \nwell promote many other meritorious cases during that period of \nhistory--and who knows, going way back in history--to be brought to \nthis Congress for similar rectification or whatever the petition may \nsay.\n  The records show that the request by my two distinguished esteemed \ncolleagues initiated correspondence beginning in 1994--that is roughly \n5 years ago. Secretary Perry on 7, September, 1994; again on 22 \nNovember, 1994; President Reagan, 1, December, 1994; Deputy Secretary \nJohn Deutch, 10, December, 1994; Perry, 5 March, 1995; Deutch, 24 March \nof 1995; the Dorn Report on 6, October, 1995; Deputy Secretary Defense \nJohn White, December of 1995; Secretary Cohen here in 18, November, \n1997; and P de Leon, on 20, July, 1998.\n  In other words, for 5 years the Department of Defense has devoted a \ngood deal of time and effort to try--I presume and I certainly assume--\nto make an objective analysis of all of these letters, and have turned \ndown the various requests from my two senior colleagues.\n  First, I ask my distinguished colleague from Delaware, because I look \nat this very imposing collection of documents and I reflect on the \nnumber of inquiries that have been held throughout history, these are \nthe inquiries that have been held regarding these two officers and \ntheir association with the tragic losses of men, women, and assets of \nthe United States on December 7, 1941.\n  We start with the Knox Investigation, December 9 through 14, in 1941. \nThat was followed by the Roberts Commission, December 18 through \nJanuary 23, 1942; the Hart Investigation, February 12 through June 15 \nof 1944; the Army Pearl Harbor Board, July 20 through October 20, 1944; \nNavy Court of Inquiry, July 24 through October 19, 1944; the Clark \nInvestigation, August 4 through September 20, 1944; the Hewitt Inquiry, \nMay 14 through July 11, 1945; the Clausen Investigation, January 24 \nthrough September 12, 1945; the Joint Congressional Committee, November \n15 through May 23, 1945.\n  Based on the results of all those investigations, Secretary of \nDefense Cohen wrote to Senator Thurmond and presumably Senator Roth. He \nsaid:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:  Thank you for your interest in \n     exonerating the names of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. In \n     the years since the fateful events at Pearl Harbor there have \n     been numerous formal investigations of the events leading up \n     to the attack, including sharp debate over our state of \n     readiness at the time.\n       While Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \n     Readiness, Mr. Edwin Dorn conduced a thorough review of this \n     issue in 1995. He carefully considered the information \n     contained in nine previous formal investigations, visited \n     Pearl Harbor and personally met with the Kimmel and Short \n     families. His conclusion was that responsibility for the \n     Pearl Harbor disaster must be broadly shared, but that the \n     record does not show that advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short on the retired list is warranted.\n       I appreciate the fact that the overwhelming consensus of \n     the organizations and personnel mentioned in your letter \n     recommend exoneration of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. \n     Absent significant new information, however, I do not believe \n     it is appropriate to order another review of this matter.\n       Ed Dorn and I both agree that responsibility for this \n     tragic event in American history must be broadly shared, yet \n     I remain\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\n     confident in the findings that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short remain accountable in their positions as leaders.\n\n  The first question to my distinguished colleague, this amendment \nwould have the effect of no longer holding them accountable for this \ntragedy. If that be the case, who is to be held accountable for this \ntragedy?\n  Mr. ROTH. I point out to my distinguished colleague that first of \nall, the Dorn Report makes the very clear finding that responsibility \nfor the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders \nof Admiral Kimmel and General Short. It should be broadly shared.\n  When it says it should be broadly shared, it seems to me it is saying \nin effect that all of those who had any responsibility for the act \nshould be treated the same. That is basically what we are saying here. \nThese two distinguished gentlemen gave a lifetime of service to their \ncountry with distinction. There are many factors that were shown in the \nother investigations: That they did not have the intelligence, they did \nnot have the information that they were entitled to if they were going \nto properly discharge their responsibility.\n  We are not saying here that they were not partly responsible, but \nthey were no more responsible than other leaders in Washington. To me, \nit is unfair, inequitable and not in the tradition of the military to \ntreat two individuals differently from others.\n  This is not an effort of a younger generation trying to correct what \nwe think is an unfair situation. I, like the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, served in World War II with the military. \nI just think it is only right, it is only just that we treat them \nexactly the same and let them be promoted to their higher wartime \nranks.\n  There is a responsibility, accountability, among many. Any number of \nthese studies clearly showed that a large part of that responsibility \nwas in Washington.\n  All we are asking is, let's treat all these people alike--fair and \nwith justice.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator has raised a very key \npoint. That is, equality of treatment.\n  First, the Dorn Report specifically said that they--Kimmel and \nShort--do bear part of the responsibility. We are in agreement on that.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can the Senator point to any of the investigations that I \nrecited, beginning back in 1941, which in any way, totally or \notherwise, exonerated Kimmel or Short?\n  Mr. ROTH. There were some findings that because of the lack of \nintelligence, they were not advised of the most up-to-date information \nthat Washington had; they were not at fault.\n  As a matter of fact, the finding was made that their disposition \nbased on the information they had was appropriate and proper.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before we leave that point, if none of \nthese reports that I recited--some nine in number which had before them \nlive witnesses, clarity of mind and clarity of recollection--did not \nexonerate these officers, then why should we now at this late date in \nhistory try to make a different finding? There could have been other \nofficers who possibly were not advanced in rank. You cite they should \nbe treated equally. How do I know there are not other officers, Army \nand Navy, who were not advanced in rank because they bore part of the \nresponsibility for this tragedy? So, when you ask for equality, it \nwould seem to me you would have to come forth with all the cases of all \nthose who bore part of the responsibility and show that they were \ntreated differently than Kimmel and Short.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. With all due deference to my colleague, that is \nhypothetical. It is possible that somewhere someone was mistreated. But \nthose facts are not before us. I am not aware of any such charges.\n  But here we have two individuals about whom many different people \nagree, from those like Bob Dole, who served with great distinction, \nfrom the admirals who were in command, both of the Navy and our \nmilitary forces, all coming forward with the recommendation that, to be \nfair, these two individuals should be advanced to their highest wartime \nrank.\n  The point the Senator is making is true in life. Many times lawsuits \nare brought but you cannot, in settling that lawsuit, with the \nindividuals before you--you are not going to solve all the problems of \nmankind because you only have the facts of those you are considering. \nOur resolution is a followthrough for two individuals, about whom, time \nand time again, it was said they served with distinction.\n  Mr. WARNER. But the Senator said let's treat these two individuals \nequally with others who bear part of the responsibility--a reasonable \nrequest. But I would want to know beforehand, who are the others? How \nwere they treated? Was their treatment commensurate with what the \nSenator asked for tonight?\n  Mr. ROTH. No one of whom I am aware, who served in World War II at \nthe time of Pearl Harbor and had any responsibility in Washington, was \nheld accountable and given less rank.\n  General George Marshall admitted that he had a responsibility, but I \ndo not think anyone suggested, or would want to suggest, that he should \nhave been penalized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am primarily concerned with the junior \nofficers in the command of the Army in Hawaii, the command of the Navy \nin Hawaii. There may have been a number of officers and, indeed, \nenlisted men--say an intelligence officer. There was a good deal of \nintelligence out there that the situation was getting very serious, and \nI will refer to that momentarily. But how do I know their careers were \nnot impeded? They may not have been general officers or flag officers \nof the U.S. Navy. But whether they were lieutenants or commanders, \ntheir careers may well have been blocked. There may be relatives out \nhere and descendants of those officers who feel just as strongly as to \nthe punishment that was meted out to their grandparents or whatever the \ncase may be.\n  If you are going to open up a case like this, it seems to me it is in \nthe nature of a class action: Let everybody come forward.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the good chairman, the others have not presented \nthe case. These individuals, their families, have tried to correct what \nI think is a serious wrong. Again, all I can say is that rare is it \nthat by one stroke of action you correct all inequities, all \ninjustices. But here we have two individuals who were scapegoated. \nLet's face it. They needed to blame somebody. I think as a matter of \nfact the Roberts investigation was not known for the legal \njurisprudence with which it was conducted.\n\n  I believe, in fairness to these individuals, the record ought to be \nset straight. They served their country with great distinction through \nthe years. Disaster occurred at Pearl Harbor, but they alone cannot be \nheld responsible. Most of these reports will admit that. The others \nwere permitted to rise to their highest rank, and I just say as a \nmatter of justice----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we do not know. You make an assumption \nthat others were allowed to rise to their highest rank. I do not know \nthat. There is no evidence before the Senate tonight.\n  This is but one of, what? How many volumes here? The hearings before \nthe Joint Committee on the Investigation of Pearl Harbor, U.S. \nCongress, 1945, I count, what, 15 volumes here? To me, that is \nthoroughness of an investigation. I mean, document after document, page \nafter page in which--let's see, how many Members of Congress, if they \nlist the committee here? I do not see on this volume, but perhaps it is \nin others, how many Members of Congress were involved. Usually they \nlist them.\n  How many Members were involved, does the Senator know?\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say this. What I do know, as far as the record \nshows, only two officers were penalized, were punished.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, what record does the Senator speak of, \nthat shows only two? Is there any record that shows only two officers \nin the U.S. military were ever penalized?\n  Mr. ROTH. No. But to me it is the same sort of thing. You are in a \nlaw case. Can you talk about the others who may be involved in the same \nkind of a problem? We are only trying to correct what I think are two \nserious cases.\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n  Let me point out any number of distinguished groups and organizations \nwho have come out in support.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has recited them. Certainly, I accept that \nfor the record. I also commend your able assistant, Mr. Brzezinski \nhere, who has worked tirelessly on this for several years and done the \nresearch. But let me ask you this question. We are both lawyers; we \nspent years in courtrooms. What new evidence do you bring before the \nSenate tonight to ask for a reversal of some nine different boards and \ncommissions that have reviewed this over a period of these many years? \nWhat new evidence do you bring in support of your petition?\n  Mr. ROTH. It really is not a question, I say to my colleague, of new \nevidence. The evidence has been there for many years, since 1944, when \ninvestigations were made both by the Army and Navy. Time and again, it \nhas been found that these two individuals were not the only ones \nresponsible. Admittedly, they share blame with others. But everybody \nelse in the Service was permitted to keep their rank or raised to their \nhighest.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we do not know that as a fact. The Senator \nkeeps repeating everyone else was allowed to advance. I do not see \nanything before me.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say, to the contrary, what is the evidence that there are \nothers? Theoretically, you keep saying there are others. Who are they?\n  Mr. WARNER. Look at the Dorn report. I would like to refer to that at \nsome point here. Let's just go over the Dorn report. This is a very \ncomprehensive analysis by the Department of Defense over a considerable \nperiod of months. I would like to refer to some of their findings.\n  First, that these officers did receive warning messages on November \n27, stating that Japan might take hostile action at any moment. Kimmel \nand Short concluded the attack would occur in the western Pacific and \nnot Hawaii.\n  That was apparently their independent judgment.\n  The Army and Navy were separate departments reporting directly to the \nPresident. There is a question about the collaboration of these two \nsenior officers on the islands of Hawaii.\n  Lack of mission discussion between Kimmel and Short on defense plans \nfor Hawaii and long-range air patrols--in other words, they had not \ncollaborated to coordinate the assets of the United States as a \ndeterrent, or indeed a defense against any attack on which they had \nwarning on November 27. Kimmel and Short did not share their internal \nintelligence with each other. That, to me, is a very troubling fact.\n  Just to say, as this report does, that responsibility is broadly \nshared does not absolve Kimmel and Short of accountability for this \naction to some degree. For example, the commander has plenary, that is, \nfull, complete, and absolute, responsibility for the welfare of the \npeople under his command and is directly accountable for everything the \nunit does or fails to do. That is legendary in military history.\n  Even in the Navy, there are cases where the captain was in his \nquarters, properly, perhaps, taking a rest and arose with the ship, and \nthere are hundreds of cases where he is held accountable, even though \nhe was not on the bridge at the time.\n  Three- and four-star positions are listed as positions of importance \nand responsibility. Both commanders made errors in judgment. The most \nserious ones were failure to establish a state of readiness in light of \nwarnings received and to liaison between the two commands, i.e., Army \nand Navy, and to coordinate defensive measures and to maintain \neffective reconnaissance. Intelligence available to Kimmel and Short \nwas sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was \nmaintained. An officer may be relieved of command if a superior decides \nthe officer has failed to exercise sound judgment. And that is \nprecisely what was done in this case.\n  The Senator points out that history does show, facts and mitigation, \nthat responsibility was shared in Washington for failure to communicate \non a timely basis some intelligence, but it does not absolve them from \ntaking prudent actions as field commanders at a time of very high \ntension. That is the point I make. Indeed, those facts may have been \nthe mitigating facts that these men were not actually court-martialed \nand incarcerated for this tragedy. This was an absolute, at the time, \nfrightful blow against the United States of America. All of us have \nseen the pictures, and we know the history well. That is why it \nconcerns me to try this revisionist action at this late date.\n  Relief does not require a finding of misconduct or unsatisfactory \nperformance, merely a loss of confidence with regard to the specific \ncommand in question. There is a vast difference between a degree of \nfault which warrants court-martial action and a level of performance \nwhich warrants removal of command.\n  Promotion is based on potential and not past performance. That is, \npromotion is based on expectation of performance to the level at which \nthe individual is being considered for promotion. Posthumous \nadvancement in rank would be based on the judgment that, at a minimum, \nthey had served satisfactorily at the three- and four-star level. Their \nsuperiors at the time decided they had not, and there is no compelling \nbasis to contradict this earlier decision, made at a time when there \nwere live witnesses and clarity of memory in the minds of many.\n  There may be a debate as to fairness and justice, but there can be no \nargument about the legitimacy of those who exercised their power for \nrelief in retirement. The official treatment--this report goes on--of \nKimmel and Short was subsequently temperate and procedurally proper; \nmention of court-martial but no charges brought; some allegations that \nthere was no court-martial because the Government feared bringing \ncharges would implicate other senior military and civilian leaders; \ncould also be there were sufficient grounds for successful court-\nmartial prosecution.\n  Mr. President, there is no new evidence before the Senate tonight. I \nwould like to go on. I am going to put this in the Record. Is there \nsome other point the Senator wishes to make? If I understand--you have \nbeen very forthright--there has been no new evidence. So what we are \nreally doing is trying to exercise fair and impartial judgment by \ngiving our own independent assessment of facts that were deduced in a \ntimely manner in the period of 1941 to, say, 1946. That is \nthe conclusion of this congressional review.\n\n  Now we are determining from those facts which were deduced at the \ntime of clarity of memory and presumably many witnesses who testified \nbefore the Congress. We are now asked to make this important decision \nwhich is tantamount, in the minds of many Americans, to exonerating \ntotally these two officers from any misconduct or dereliction of duty \nat the time of Pearl Harbor. I just simply cannot go along with that, I \nsay to the Senator.\n  First, again, there are no new facts. We are agreed on that.\n  Mr. ROTH. The issue is not the question of new facts. The issue is \nthe question of fairness. I believe that is as critically important \ntoday as it was at the time it occurred. The record is clear that these \nindividuals, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, did not have the \nintelligence information available at the time that would have enabled \nthem to better address the challenge from the Japanese.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I ask, is that fact not borne out in many of these \nhearings that were held in the period of 1941 to 1946? My recollection \nis that that was always presented at that time, or at least certainly \nin the congressional one when the war was over.\n  Mr. ROTH. To me, it is just a difference, I guess, in approach. If \nyou take the position that it happened in the past and it should not be \nchanged, I think that is wrong. I think there is a strong case that \nthese individuals were not treated fairly. The President was given \nauthority under the 1947 act to raise any retired flag officer to the \nrank----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remember it well. The Senator will \nrecall we referred to it, those of us down in the ranks, as the \ntombstone promotion; am I not correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That shows our vintage.\n  Mr. ROTH. I just think it is not fair to these individuals, to their \nreputation. Admittedly, even the Dorn report makes all kinds of \nconclusions that\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\nthey did not have the information to which they were entitled, that \nothers shared in the responsibility for what happened.\n  In this country, in the tradition of the military--and I am not a \nprofessional soldier, although I did have the pleasure of serving \nseveral years in the military----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I might say, with distinction; a fine \nofficer.\n  Mr. ROTH. I appreciate that. I think the important thing is to show \nthat in our country, individuals who were not treated equitably, the \nrecord can be set straight.\n  Mr. WARNER. On that point, so the Senator's argument tonight is one \nof fairness. But I say to him, if the Senate were to go along with him, \nimplicitly it would say that all of these reports involving hundreds of \nconscientious men and perhaps women who were on these boards, some \nseven or eight boards, were unfair.\n  Mr. ROTH. I go back to the fact, it was the President who decided in \nthe 1947 act not to raise them to their wartime ranks. I think it is a \nrank injustice. I think it is a blot on the history of World War II. \nThere are many people one can probably point out who said this, that, \nor the other.\n  Here were two gentlemen, one an admiral who had been in command, a \nnaval CO, who was in charge in Hawaii. General Short was in command of \nthe Army Hawaiian department. They did not have the intelligence.\n  One has to remember, in a time of war and stress, one of the concerns \nwas that the country was so shocked by what took place in Hawaii that \nthere was concern over what would be the reaction of the American \npeople. Even though they were found innocent of dereliction of duty, \nthat did not become public information, for the simple reason they \nwanted to make certain that the American people supported the efforts \nof this country and more. That was kept secret indefinitely, until \n1947, at which time it came out.\n\n  But I know the chairman is a fair man. I admire him greatly. I know \nthere are those in the military saying: Well, don't go back and change \nnow. Let history judge. I just think it is unfair to these individuals \nwho did serve with excellence, who did serve with distinction, to be \npenalized when they were the only two.\n  Mr. WARNER. But, Senator, what do you say to all of these people--I \nwish we had a volume here that showed how many Members of Congress \nparticipated? Perhaps you can provide that. I do not know how many sat \non all the boards that Frank Knox had. I recited all of them here, but \nI did serve in the Department of Navy as an Under Secretary for 5-plus \nyears.\n  Mr. ROTH. With great distinction.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not so sure, but you are nice to say it. It was a \nchallenge. I was privileged and humbled to do so.\n  But my point is, a naval court of inquiry, that is usually about 9 or \n10 officers certainly for a matter of this importance. All of these \ninvestigations involved, I think, at a minimum 10 or 12 people, not to \nmention all the staffs on both sides. I am sure they had the \nopportunity for these two officers to make known their own views and to \nturn over all of the investigations and say that they did not act \nfairly towards these two men.\n  Here we are, here in May of 1999, with no new evidence. I do not have \nthe records of all these boards. I suppose somebody has gone through \nthem. And Mr. Brzezinski maybe has.\n  Could I ask, have you got an estimate of how many persons were \ninvolved in all these boards which rendered a judgment that these two \nmen must be held accountable for this tragedy at Pearl Harbor? Does \nanyone have an estimate of how many Members of Congress?\n  Mr. ROTH. I think the point is that in these investigations, the \npurpose of them was not to determine who was accountable but, rather, \nit was a statement of fact. But, again, let me underscore. You keep \ncoming back and saying: Why should we be looking at it today?\n  I think that is what makes this country different. If there is a \nwrong, an error, it is never too late to correct it.\n  Here we have a case where these individuals were found not to be \nsolely responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor. As a matter of fact, \nthere were findings in agreement that many in Washington played a key \nrole. Most persuasive to me is the fact that the intelligence they \nneeded to address the attack was not made available to them, yet they \nare the ones who were denied promotion. The only two.\n  Mr. WARNER. But you don't know that. I don't know that. There is no \nrecord before us to show that these were the only two men who were \ntreated unfairly. You come back to that.\n  Mr. ROTH. We do know----\n  Mr. WARNER. I reject that argument.\n  Mr. ROTH. You reject the argument, but you give me no names. Who else \nwas involved? These are the two who many distinguished former officers \nof the service, of the Navy, of the Army, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nfind this is unfairly treating these individuals. I am merely trying to \ncorrect a wrong. I recognize different people--I think we are both fair \nminded, to be honest. We just happen to disagree.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. You want to correct. On what basis do you \ncorrect other than the palpitations of your heart?\n  Mr. ROTH. Because of the fact that--\n  Mr. WARNER. Where is the evidence?\n  Mr. ROTH. There were findings that these individuals did not have the \nintelligence to which they were entitled. In Washington, it was known \nthat war was imminent. If you had the full information, it was fairly \nclear that there could be an attack on Pearl Harbor. There was a so-\ncalled bomb, 14-part message, all of which indicated that attack was an \nimmediate threat.\n  That information was denied the two individuals with the key critical \nresponsibility in Hawaii. I just think that to hold them responsible \nand not to give them the lifetime is unfair.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could again refer to the Dorn Report:\n\n       The failure of Kimmel and Short to make adequate \n     preparations in light of the information they did have.\n\n  That was a major finding.\n\n       They knew their primary mission, arguable their only \n     mission, was to prepare for war.\n       They knew that war with Japan was highly likely.\n       They knew that a surprise attack probably would precede a \n     declaration of war.\n       They knew Japan, not the US, would strike the first blow.\n       They knew the initial Japanese attack would fall on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       They knew that an attack on Pearl Harbor could come from \n     aircraft carriers.\n       They knew from their own staffs of the danger of a surprise \n     air attack.\n       They knew from recent events that the idea of a carrier air \n     attack on Pearl Harbor was not new.\n       They made statements prior to December 7 that acknowledged \n     the possibility of an air attack on their forces.\n\n  Now, that was the finding of the Dorn group here just in 1995. I have \nit here, some numerous pages of this report.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me make--I do not want to interrupt.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me point out those findings were general findings. But \nthe fact is, the up-to-date intelligence that Washington had in the \ndays immediately before Pearl Harbor was not made available to General \nShort or Admiral Kimmel.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that sum portion of intelligence, I think \nthat all throughout history has been conceded. And these tribunals, \nparticularly the Congress, had that before it. It is for that reason \nmaybe they were not court-martialed and incarcerated, if found guilty.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, you knew an air carrier attack was possible. But to \nknow, for example, as they knew in Washington in the days right before \nthe attack that the Japanese wanted to know where the warships were \nlocated, it was this kind of information that gave immediacy to the \nthreat. To me, that was critical.\n  You talk about the Dorn Report. Let me just say, as part of the Dorn \nReport, they sort of are all over the map in their finding. They say:\n\n       It is clear today, as should have been clear since 1946 to \n     any serious reader of the JCC hearing record, that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not solely responsible for the \n     defeat at Pearl Harbor.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       * * * more information was available in Washington but not \n     forwarded to them. Army and Navy officials in Washington were \n     privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\n     communications (notably the ``bomb plot'', ``winds'', \n     ``pilot'', and ``fourteen-part'' messages) which provided \n     crucial--\n\n  Now, this is the Dorn report--\n\n     which provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war. \n     Read together and with the leisure, focus, and clarity of \n     hindsight, these messages point strongly towards an attack on \n     Pearl Harbor at dawn on the 7th.\n\n  That is the Dorn Report:\n\n       The immediacy of an attack on Pearl Harbor at dawn on the \n     7th.\n       The evidence of the handling of these messages in \n     Washington reveals some ineptitude, some unwarranted \n     assumptions and misstatements, limited coordination, \n     ambiguous language and lack of clarification and followup at \n     higher levels.\n\n  I could go on.\n\n       A careful reading of the proceedings and reports of those \n     panels suggests clear recognition of the faults at all \n     levels. Yet these two gentlemen were singled out and were not \n     given advance to their wartime rating.\n\n  I think it was inequitable. I think it was not fair, and it seems to \nme the greatness of this country is that we can go back and make \nchanges where warranted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just located, I think, a document \nthat interests me a great deal. It is entitled, ``Investigation of the \nPearl Harbor Attack: Report of the Joint Committee on the Investigation \nof the Pearl Harbor Attack,'' pursuant to a resolution of Congress, S. \nRes. 27. And it was reported on July 5, 1946.\n  Just listen to those Senators who were on this commission: Alben \nBarkley, you remember him. What an extraordinary man; Walter George, \nGeorge was considered one of the great, great internationalists; Scott \nLucas of Illinois, one of the most senior Senators from the State of \nIllinois, the Presiding Officer's State; Owen Brewster from Maine; \nHomer Ferguson from Michigan.\n  I say to my good friend, those names still reverberate with absolute \ndistinction and credibility in this Chamber today. They made the \nfindings which left history intact. And we here, just the two of us, \nreally, on the floor tonight, are to urge our colleagues tomorrow to \nreverse that history?\n  With all due respect, there is not the foundation, in my judgment, \nfor the Senate to so act and overrule the findings of these men.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, I have the greatest \nrespect for his soundness of judgment, for his honesty and integrity. I \nhave the same for the Senators named. But the fact remains, honorable \nmen and women often disagree. Here we do disagree.\n  I am just trying to join my colleagues--there are 23 of us --in \nseeking to correct what we think was unfair treatment to two \nindividuals who devoted a lifetime of service to this country. Yes, \nthere are differences of opinion on this matter, but nothing seems to \nme more important than to try to correct a record which I think, on the \nbasis of the studies I have seen, results in unfairness. We are trying \nto correct that.\n  I understand you disagree with the basis of our proposal, but I think \nboth of us want the same thing, and that is fairness.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no one in this body for whom I \nhave greater respect than my dear friend and colleague, Senator Roth. \nHe has put a lot of work, together with his able staff, into this case. \nBut it seems to me that we stand in a momentous hour in the history of \nthis country. We are asking our colleagues to trust in our own \njudgments and our findings as to whether or not one of the most \nremarkable and tragic chapters in the history of this Nation, in \neffect, should have this significant reversal these many years hence, \nbased on no new evidence, based on the fervent plea of my \ncolleagues, Senator Roth and Senator Thurmond.\n\n  I shall take the floor tomorrow and most vigorously oppose this. I \nthink for the night we have pretty well concluded this debate. I have \nto tell the Senator, it is an interesting one for me and not altogether \nwithout some implications in my own life, thinking back in that period \nof history. I will never forget Pearl Harbor.\n  If I could just reminisce for a moment, it is hard to believe that \nshortly thereafter this city, the Nation's Capital, endured periods of \nblackout. I remember it very well, as a small--well, I wasn't so small. \nI remember my father was a physician and he was able to drive at night \nonly with a slit on the headlights to get to the hospital. I remember \nvery well our home was equipped with blackout curtains. All the \nstreetlights went out. We were fearful of an attack here in Washington, \nDC, and, indeed, other east coast cities. There were Nazi submarines \npatrolling off the east coast of the United States, sinking ships.\n  How well I recall on the beaches of Virginia there was washed up \ndebris from sunken ships. The people on the west coast lived in \nconstant fear that there would be an invasion. These were serious and \nstrenuous times, calling on the men and women of the Armed Forces for a \nduty and a commitment and an assumption of risk without parallel, \nbecause this Nation in many respects was unprepared. How well we recall \nthe pictures of the Army practicing maneuvers with broomsticks rather \nthan rifles.\n  When I think of the tragic death, loss of life and property, indeed, \nif we were to follow your logic--President Roosevelt had that \nintelligence--we could go back and judge the record of many others. It \nseems to me that what is before the Senate tonight is clear facts that \nmen and women of clear conscience, with the ability to assess fresh \ninformation, have painstakingly gone through it, reached their \nconclusion year after year, and then a President, Harry Truman, is my \nrecollection, am I correct, made the decision that he did with respect \nto these two officers.\n  I just do not believe that the Senate at this time should reverse \nthat history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5825-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

In response, 48 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto \nRico have adopted State-level standards. Recent results of the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show improved performance for \nthe economically disadvantaged and other at-risk students who are the \nprimary focus of ESEA programs. NAEP reading scores for 9-year-olds in \nhigh-poverty schools have improved significantly since 1992, while \nmathematics achievement has also increased nationally. Students in \nhigh-poverty schools and the lowest-performing students--the specific \ntarget populations for the ESEA Title I program--have registered gains \nin both reading and math achievement.\n  I am encouraged by these positive trends, but educational results for \nmany children remain far below what they should be. My proposal to \nreauthorize the ESEA is based on four themes reflecting lessons from \nresearch and the experience of implementing the 1994 Act.\n  First, we would continue to focus on high academic standards for all \nchildren. The underlying purpose of every program within the ESEA is to \nhelp all children reach challenging State and local academic standards. \nStates have largely completed the first stage of standards-based reform \nby developing content standards for all children. My bill would support \nthe next stage of reform by helping States, school districts, schools, \nand teachers use these standards to guide classroom instruction and \nassessment.\n  My proposal for reauthorizing Title I, for example, would require \nStates to hold school districts and schools accountable for student \nperformance against State standards, including helping the lowest-\nperforming students continually to improve. The bill also would \ncontinue to target Federal elementary and secondary education resources \non those students furthest from meeting State and local standards, with \na particular emphasis on narrowing the gap in achievement between \ndisadvantaged students and their more affluent peers. In this regard, \nmy proposal would phase in equal treatment of Puerto Rico in ESEA \nfunding formulas, so that poor children in Puerto Rico are treated \nsimilarly to those in the rest of the country for the purpose of \nformula allocations.\n  Second, my proposal responds to research showing that while qualified \nteachers are critical to improving student achievement, far too many \nteachers are not prepared to teach to high standards. Teacher quality \nis a particular problem in high-poverty schools, and the problem is \noften exacerbated by the use of paraprofessionals in instructional \nroles.\n  My bill addresses teacher quality by holding States accountable for \nstronger enforcement of their own certification and licensure \nrequirements, while at the same time providing substantial support for \nState and local professional development efforts. The Teaching to High \nStandards initiative in Title II would help move challenging \neducational standards into every classroom by providing teachers with \nsustained and intensive high-quality professional development in core \nacademic subjects, supporting new teachers during their first 3 years \nin the classroom, and ensuring that all teachers are proficient in \nrelevant content knowledge and teaching skills.\n  The Technology for Education initiative under Title III would expand \nthe availability of educational technology as a tool to help teachers \nimplement high standards in the classroom, particularly in high-poverty \nschools. My bill also would extend, over the next 7 years, the Class-\nSize Reduction initiative, which aims to reduce class sizes in the \nearly grades by helping districts to hire and train 100,000 teachers. \nAnd the Title VII Bilingual Education proposal would help ensure that \nall teachers are well trained to teach students with limited English \nproficiency, who are found in more and more classrooms with each \npassing year.\n  Third, my bill would increase support for safe, healthy, disciplined, \nand drug-free learning environments where all children feel connected, \nmotivated, and challenged to learn and where parents are welcomed and \ninvolved. The recent tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, \nColorado, reminds us that we must be ever vigilant against the risks of \nviolence and other dangerous behaviors in our schools. Our \nreauthorization bill includes several measures to help mitigate these \nrisks.\n  We would strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities \nAct by concentrating funds on districts with the greatest need for \ndrug- and violence-prevention programs, and by emphasizing the use of \nresearch-based programs of proven effectiveness. Moreover, with respect \nto students who bring weapons to school, this proposal would require \nschools to refer such students to a mental health professional for \nassessment and require counseling for those who pose an imminent threat \nto themselves or others; allow funding for programs that educate \nstudents about the risks associated with guns; expand character \neducation programs; and promote alternative schools and second chance \nprograms. A new School Emergency Response to Violence program would \nprovide rapid assistance to school districts that have experienced \nviolence or other trauma that disrupts the learning environment.\n  My High School Reform initiative would support innovative reforms to \nimprove student achievement in high schools, such as expanding the \nconnections between adults and students that are necessary for \neffective learning and healthy personal development. This new \ninitiative would provide resources to help transform 5,000 high schools \ninto places where students receive individual attention, are motivated \nto learn, are provided with challenging courses, and are encouraged to \ndevelop and pursue long-term educational and career goals.\n  Fourth, in response to clear evidence that standards-based reforms \nwork best when States have strong accountability systems in place, my \nproposal would encourage each State to establish a single, rigorous \naccountability system for all schools. The bill also would require \nStates to end social promotion and traditional retention practices; \nphase out the use of teachers with emergency certificates and the \npractice of assigning teachers ``out-of-field;'' and implement sound \ndiscipline policies in every school. Finally, the bill would give \nparents an important new accountability tool by requiring State, \ndistrict, and school-level report cards that will help them evaluate \nthe quality of the schools their children attend.\n  Based on high standards for all students, high-quality professional \ndevelopment for teachers, safe and disciplined learning environments, \nand accountability to parents and taxpayers, the Educational Excellence \nfor All Children Act of 1999 provides a solid foundation for raising \nstudent achievement and narrowing the achievement gap between \ndisadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers. More important, \nit will help prepare all of our children, and thus the Nation, for the \nchallenges of the 21st century. I urge the Congress to take prompt and \nfavorable action on this proposal.\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois relative to senior \n     citizens; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 70\n\n       Whereas, The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established a new \n     reimbursement system for Medicare home health services \n     effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after \n     October 1, 1997 which has threatened to ruin the home health \n     benefit; and\n       Whereas, The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created an interim \n     payment system which is cost-based with reduced limits and is \n     in effect until a prospective payment system is initiated \n     with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, \n     2000; and\n       Whereas, While the 105th Congress made strides to rectify \n     the interim payment system, the real effect of the Omnibus \n     Reconciliation Act of 1998 was to raise the per-\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\n     visit reimbursement for home health between only $0.50 and \n     $1.00 and the per-beneficiary limits by less than 5% for the \n     majority of home health agencies; and\n       Whereas, If the home health program, which is only 9% of \n     the overall Medicare budget, is slashed, other programs will \n     bear the burden, and in many cases Medicare patients will be \n     transferred to the Medicaid program; and\n       Whereas, If these patients are not served by home health, \n     they will drive up health care costs in other arenas, \n     including nursing homes, hospitals, and emergency care; and\n       Whereas, One out of every 10 Medicare beneficiaries \n     received some form of home health care in 1996; and\n       Whereas, On average, a home care visit in 1996 cost between \n     $40 and $140, while the cost of staying in a hospital per day \n     is $2,071, and a skilled nursing facility, $443; and\n       Whereas, The average home health agency has seen a 39% \n     reduction in Medicare revenue since the implementation of the \n     interim payment system; and\n       Whereas, Fifty-eight, or 15%, of Illinois home health \n     agencies have closed in the past year; and\n       Whereas, Rural home health agencies report revenues at \n     least one-third lower than this same period last year; and\n       Whereas, Three-fourths of Illinois Home Care Council \n     freestanding agency members (those not affiliated with a \n     hospital or network) estimate that, unless something changes \n     with the interim payment system, they will be closed within 6 \n     months to a year; and\n       Whereas, The interim payment system is based on average \n     costs, which creates strong incentives to avoid caring for \n     patients with complex or long-term medical problems, forcing \n     many Illinois home health agencies to choose between staying \n     in business and serving highly complex, high visit volume \n     patients; and\n       Whereas, Three prominent public policy research \n     organizations, George Washington University, the Commonwealth \n     Fund, and the Lewin Group, independently concluded that the \n     home health provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 are \n     causing a crisis in the Medicare home health benefit by: (i) \n     eliminating access to medically necessary home health \n     services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries; \n     (ii) rewarding higher cost and penalizing lower cost home \n     health agencies by establishing radically different payment \n     limits that do not reflect current patient mix or efficiency; \n     and (iii) eliminating access to Medicare home health in rural \n     areas; and\n       Whereas, The prospective payment system is a system by \n     which home health agencies are paid according to types and \n     numbers of patients actually served which assures a \n     predictable reimbursement rate and schedule, beneficial to \n     both the federal government and home health agencies; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-First General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we urge Congress to \n     hold the Health Care Financing Authority accountable for the \n     timely implementation of a fair prospective payment system; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the federal government to rectify \n     some of the damage wrought by the interim payment system by \n     raising the per-beneficiary and per-visit limits, so that \n     agencies can keep serving patients until the prospective \n     payment system is implemented;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to the regulation of \n     insurance matters by the states; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, In 1994, the Michigan Legislature passed \n     legislation (HB 5281) granting lending institutions the \n     authority to sell all lines of insurance; and\n       Whereas, That legislation, which became 1994 PA 409, \n     includes necessary consumer and fair market protections, such \n     as requiring the separation of lending and insurance \n     transactions; prohibitions against offering or discussing \n     insurance while a loan transaction is pending; requiring \n     separate lending and insurance areas; requirements for full \n     written disclosures to customers; and inclusion of strong \n     prohibitions against sharing confidential insurance-related \n     information in bank loan files with bank-affiliated agencies; \n     and\n       Whereas, In a joint letter published November 7, 1994, HB \n     5281 was lauded and strongly supported by the Michigan \n     Bankers Association, Michigan Association of Insurance \n     Agents, Michigan League of Savings Institutions, Michigan \n     Association of Life Underwriters, Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, Michigan Consumer Federation, Michigan Credit Union \n     League, Small Business Association of Michigan, Michigan \n     Association of Credit Unions, Michigan Retail Hardware \n     Association, Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce, and \n     National Electrical Contractors Association (Michigan \n     Chapter); and\n       Whereas, In 1995, the Rhode Island Legislature resoundingly \n     passed legislation substantially similar to Michigan law, \n     granting lending institutions the authority to sell \n     insurance; and\n       Whereas, The Comptroller of the Currency is an appointed, \n     federal bureaucrat who has a track record of promulgating \n     regulations that serve to expand bank insurance powers. These \n     new insurance activities, deemed to be banking issues by the \n     Comptroller, often conflict with established state laws; and\n       Whereas, On January 13, 1997, the Office of the Comptroller \n     of the Currency (OCC) issued a request for comments on Rhode \n     Island's Financial Institution Insurance Sales Act to assist \n     in the determination as to whether Section 92 of the Federal \n     Bank Act provided the Comptroller of the Currency sufficient \n     authority to preempt Rhode Island's banks-in-insurance \n     statute; and\n       Whereas, The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 relegates \n     authority to the individual states for regulation of the \n     insurance activities of all entities; and\n       Whereas, The preemption of state insurance laws by an \n     unelected federal bureaucrat is in direct conflict with the \n     fifty-four-year tradition of state regulation of insurance \n     under McCarran-Ferguson and thereby raises vitally important \n     questions of states' rights and the primacy of duly elected \n     representatives to enact laws governing insurance activities \n     within their state borders; and\n       Whereas, In the Eighty-ninth Michigan Legislature, \n     Michigan's Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, Speaker of \n     the House and House Minority Leader, members of the Senate \n     Financial Services Committee, and Majority and Minority \n     Chairs of the House Insurance and Banking Committees all \n     delivered letters to the Comptroller of the Currency \n     forcefully opposing the OCC's desire to preempt Rhode \n     Island's banks-in-insurance statute; and\n       Whereas, The National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners (NAIC); National Conference of State \n     Legislators (NCSL); and the National Conference of Insurance \n     Legislators (NCOIL) all submitted letters strongly opposing \n     the Comptroller of the Currency's desire to preempt state \n     insurance law; and\n       Whereas, In past court disputes between federal banking and \n     state insurance regulators, federal courts have granted \n     ``unequal deference'' to federal regulators, thereby \n     rendering decisions based not on the merits of the case, but \n     on deference to the federal regulator; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation to affirm the authority of the \n     states to regulate insurance matters, including preventing \n     the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency from preempting \n     state laws regulating the sale of insurance through lending \n     institutions and ending the practice of federal regulators \n     being able to be granted ``unequal deference'' in litigation \n     between state and federal regulations on insurance matters; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-126.

The legislation failed, but the interest in \n     having a memorial gained patriotic support and subsequent \n     legislation prevailed; and\n       Whereas, federal Public Law 103-32 authorizing a World War \n     II Memorial in the District of Columbia or its environs was \n     signed into law on May 25, 1993; and\n       Whereas, the Memorial Advisory Board was created to advise \n     the American Battle Monuments Commission in site selection \n     and design and to promote donations to support the memorial \n     construction; and\n       Whereas, a memorial design by Freidrich St. Florian at the \n     site of the historic Rainbow Pool on the National Mall was \n     approved; and\n       Whereas, former Senator Bob Dole and Frederick W. Smith, \n     CEO, Federal Express, were named as National Co-chairmen of \n     the World War II Memorial Campaign; and\n       Whereas, news of the World War II Memorial is currently be \n     spread throughout the\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n     country, to every city, town, church, synagogue, mosque, \n     business, civic group, veterans' organization and every other \n     organization that comprises a part of our American culture; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, request the President \n     of the United States and the United States Congress to offer \n     support in obtaining the necessary financial resources to \n     help the World War II Memorial take its rightful place in \n     history; and be it further\n       Resolved: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable William J.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     Commonwealth of Guam relative to Federal smuggling \n     interdiction capabilities on Guam; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                           Resolution No. 85\n\n       Whereas, Guam in the last year has become a prime target \n     for a human smuggling operation run by the infamous Chinese \n     criminal organization known as the ``Snakeheads''; and\n       Whereas, as a result of concerted efforts by organized \n     criminal operations, Guam has been flooded with illegal \n     aliens of this smuggling activity; and\n       Whereas, six hundred (600) illegal immigrants have been \n     apprehended and detained at the Guam Department of \n     Corrections correctional facility, including four hundred \n     forty-five (445) illegal immigrants currently in detention, \n     to the expense of Guam taxpayers and to the danger of other \n     inmates in an already overpopulated facility; and\n       Whereas, Guam law enforcement officials estimate that more \n     than two hundred (200) other illegal immigrants have gotten \n     through Guam's borders without detection, and are already in \n     the community at-large; and\n       Whereas, Guam law enforcement officials estimate that \n     another several thousands illegal immigrants will arrive on \n     Guam in the next few months; and\n       Whereas, the humans being smuggled often cannot pay the \n     full price of transportation, estimated at Twenty Thousand \n     Dollars to Thirty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00-$30,000.00), \n     and the immigrants therefore become basically indentured \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, because of Guam's status under United States \n     immigration laws, the efforts of these criminal organizations \n     are rewarded because the illegal immigrants they transport \n     immediately claim asylum under U.S. law, and are often \n     paroled and allowed to walk free; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this human smuggling operation on \n     the government of Guam and the local community has been great \n     and is potentially devastating, with costs estimated in the \n     millions, with the mass of illegal immigrants using law \n     enforcement, corrections, hospital, public health and many \n     other local resources, which are already strained by the \n     recent economic slump; and\n       Whereas, the illegal immigrants who have likely come into \n     Guam's borders unnoticed, and the illegal immigrants who have \n     been apprehended and then paroled and let free in the \n     community are a serious public health hazard, as more than a \n     few have been diagnosed with tuberculosis and other diseases; \n     and\n       Whereas, neither the United States Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service, nor the United States Coast Guard, \n     currently have sufficient resources stationed on Guam to \n     control the influx of illegal immigrants, resulting in an \n     alarming lack of enforcement of the very laws that have \n     created this emergency situation; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     (Twenty-Fifth Guam Legislature) does hereby, on behalf of the \n     people of Guam, respectfully request the Federal Government \n     of the United States of America to permanently upgrade the \n     U.S. Coast Guard facility, vessesls and equipment, and \n     properly man these facilities and vessels on Guam to give the \n     Coast Guard the ability to patrol the seas surrounding Guam \n     and detect, intercept and redirect any vessels carrying \n     illegal immigrants; and be it further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the Federal Government of the United States of \n     America to apply Six Dollars ($6.00) of the U.S. Immigration \n     departure fee currently collected from each passenger \n     departing the Guam International Air Terminal, as a funding \n     source to support the intent of this resolution; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the President of the United States and his \n     Administration to identify and set a permanent location for \n     the diversion of vessels interdicted in the open sea in a \n     location outside of Guam so that persons shall be repatriated \n     from this alternate location; and be it further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the Federal Government of the United States of \n     America to reimburse the government of Guam for all expenses \n     associated with this illegal immigrant operation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the Congress of the United States of America to pass \n     legislation as soon as possible that would cause Guam to \n     cease to be an area where asylum can be granted under U.S. \n     law; and be it further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the United States Congress to pass legislation, if \n     simply removing Guam as an area where asylum can be granted \n     would bring the potential for any litigation, to remove Guam \n     from the Immigration and Nationality Act, from U.S. \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service jurisdiction and from \n     the immigration laws of the United States of America; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, that I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request the Guam Delegate to the United States House of \n     Representatives to fully support this Resolution in Congress;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to the restoration of redress \n     funds to compensate individuals of Japanese ancestry; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, the United States forcibly \n     removed and interned over 120,000 United States citizens and \n     legal permanent residents of Japanese ancestry from their \n     homes and relocated them to government internment camps; and\n       Whereas, in addition, the United States arranged the \n     deportation of over 2,264 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese ancestry from thirteen Latin American countries to \n     the United States to be interned and used in prisoner of war \n     exchanges with Japan; and\n       Whereas, in 1988, the United States Congress passed, and \n     President Reagan signed, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (the \n     Act), which acknowledged the fundamental injustice of that \n     evacuation, relocation, and internment, and to apologize on \n     behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs done \n     to United States citizens and legal permanent residents of \n     Japanese ancestry; and\n       Whereas, that Act further sought to make restitution to \n     those individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned by \n     authorizing a $20,000 redress payment to each citizen and \n     legal permanent resident of Japanese ancestry who was \n     deprived of liberty or property as a result of government \n     action; and\n       Whereas, the Act directed the United States Treasury to \n     distribute these payments, to which Congress appropriated\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\n     $1,650,000,000 between October 1990 and October 1993; and\n       Whereas, in a subsequent settlement of a class action suit, \n     the United States agreed to send a letter of apology and to \n     pay a $5,000 redress payment from the same fund to each \n     formerly interned Japanese Latin American; and\n       Whereas, to fulfill its educational purpose of informing \n     the public about the internment so as to prevent the \n     recurrence of similar events, the Act also created the Civil \n     Liberties Public Education Fund to make disbursements for \n     research and educational activities up to a total of \n     $50,000,000; and\n       Whereas, Congress specified in the Act that the principal \n     of $1,650,000,000 was to be invested in government \n     obligations and earn interest at an annual rate of at least \n     five per cent; and\n       Whereas, in 1998, a Japanese Peruvian former internee and \n     the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations filed a class \n     action suit alleging that the Treasury Department breached \n     its fiduciary duty by failing to invest the funds mandated by \n     Congress, and seeking to recover the lost interest which is \n     estimated to be between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000; and\n       Whereas, while the reparations fund has made payments to \n     approximately eighty-two thousand claimants, there will not \n     be sufficient money in the trust fund established by Congress \n     to pay all of the remaining claims by Japanese Americans and \n     Japanese Latin Americans or to meet the goal of $50,000,000 \n     in educational grants; and\n       Whereas, a United States Justice Department official has \n     apparently acknowledged that the funds were not invested as \n     originally mandated by Congress, and that the $1,650,000,000 \n     has all been spent, although claims are still pending; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature finds that while nothing can \n     replace the loss of civil liberties suffered by those who \n     were forced to evacuate their homes and relocate to \n     internment camps on the basis of their ancestry, a formal \n     apology and token redress payment to these individuals of \n     Japanese ancestry is the least that can be done to compensate \n     them for the loss of their rights; now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the Senate of the Twentieth Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that the United States government \n     is urged to restore redress funds to pay all outstanding \n     Japanese American and Japanese Latin American redress claims \n     and to fulfill the educational mandate of the Act; and\n       Be It Further Resolved that certified copies of this \n     Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the Governor of \n     Hawaii.\n       POM-131.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to moneys \n     earmarked for abandoned mine land reclamation; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, The biggest water pollution problem facing this \n     Commonwealth today is polluted water draining from abandoned \n     coal mines; and\n       Whereas, Over half the streams that do not meet water \n     quality standards in this Commonwealth are affected by mine \n     drainage; and\n       Whereas, This Commonwealth has over 250,000 acres of \n     abandoned mine lands, refuse banks and old mine shafts in 45 \n     of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, more than any other state in \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Environmental Protection \n     estimates it will cost more than $15 billion to reclaim and \n     restore abandoned mine lands; and\n       Whereas, The Commonwealth now receives about $20 million a \n     year from the Federal Government to do reclamation projects; \n     and\n       Whereas, There is now a $1 billion balance in the Federal \n     Abandoned Mine Reclamation Trust Fund that is set aside by \n     law to take care of pollution and safety problems caused by \n     old coal mines; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania is the fourth largest coal producing \n     state in the nation, and coal operators contribute \n     significantly to the fund by paying a special fee for each \n     ton of coal they mine; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania is not seeking to rely solely on \n     Federal moneys to address its abandoned mine reclamation \n     needs and has undertaken a comprehensive program designed to \n     maximize reclamation opportunities by increasing community \n     involvement, making better use of existing resources, \n     encouraging private and public participation in reclamation \n     activities and reducing the cost of abandoned mine \n     reclamation projects; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Environmental Protection and 39 \n     county conservation districts through the Western and Eastern \n     Pennsylvania Coalitions for Abandoned Mine Reclamation have \n     worked as partners to improve the effectiveness of mine \n     reclamation programs; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania has been working with the Interstate \n     Mining Compact Commission, the National Association of \n     Abandoned Mine Land Programs and other states to free more of \n     these funds to clean up abandoned mine lands; and\n       Whereas, Making more funds available to states for \n     abandoned mine reclamation should preserve the interest \n     revenues now being made available for the United Mine Workers \n     Combined Benefit Fund; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Office of Surface Mining, the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency and Congress have not \n     agreed to make more funds available to states for abandoned \n     mine reclamation; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the \n     President of the United States, and Congress make the $1 \n     billion of Federal moneys already earmarked for abandoned \n     mine land reclamation available to states to clean up and \n     make safe our abandoned mine lands; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress.\n       POM-133. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to military \n     activities in the municipality of Vieques and surrounding \n     waters; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                      Concurrent Resolution No. 45\n\n\n                          statement of purpose\n\n       In the course of the last one hundred years, the People of \n     Puerto Rico have shown their loyalty to the democratic values \n     of liberty, equality and respect for human rights consecrated \n     by and set forth in the Constitution of the United States of \n     America. The People of Puerto Rico have responded \n     affirmatively and participated in all of the armed conflicts \n     in which our Nation has been forced to take part, from World \n     War I to the Persian Gulf War. In these conflicts, over two \n     thousand (2,000) Puerto Rican fellowmen and women have made \n     the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives in defense of the \n     ideals of justice, liberty and the principles of democracy. \n     Furthermore, other thousands of other Puerto Ricans have been \n     wounded while participating in these conflicts.\n       The Preamble of the Constitution of the United States of \n     America provides that it was ordained to ``[...] establish \n     justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common \n     defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings \n     of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' However, despite \n     the fact that the United States Constitution was established \n     to promote for the general welfare and insure domestic \n     tranquility, the people of the island municipality of Vieques \n     have suffered the direct consequences of military practices, \n     including air, land and naval activities for the last thirty \n     (30) years. Ever since the administration of Governor Roberto \n     Sanchez-Vilella from 1965 to 1969, the Department of Defense \n     has been made aware of the grave problems and ominous \n     consequences to the quality of life, tranquility and the \n     pursuit of happiness of the United States citizens who reside \n     in\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\n     the island municipality of Vieques. The Legislature of Puerto \n     Rico believes that the time has come to ensure the people of \n     Vieques the full enjoyment of their unalienable rights to \n     life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness while ensuring \n     common defense of all United States citizens. The People of \n     Puerto Rico are grateful for, appreciate and value the \n     contribution of the armed forces of the United States of \n     America to our collective security, and recognize the vital \n     strategic importance, for our collective defense, of the Navy \n     bases located in Ceiba and Vieques. Nevertheless, and in \n     light of our modern world realities, we request that the \n     courageous men and women of the Navy ensure that the people \n     of Vieques, who have sacrificed so much throughout the years \n     for our national security, achieve full enjoyment of their \n     fundamental rights by ceasing their military exercises and \n     bombing with live ammunition in the territory and surrounding \n     waters of the island municipality of Vieques.\n       In the case of Alberto Lozada-Colon vs. U.S. Department of \n     State, docket number 98-5179, filed in the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia, the counsels for the \n     U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Justice \n     have argued before the court that the provisions for the \n     organization of a constitutional government in Puerto Rico \n     and the political status adopted as of 1952, in now way \n     altered the political relationship with the United States of \n     America, and that the Island of Puerto Rico continues to be a \n     territory, subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. \n     Congress. Despite this evident colonial status, we are United \n     States citizens and we have the right to enjoy the protection \n     and guarantees that are provided by our U.S. Constitution. \n     Because of this, the U.S. citizens residing in the island of \n     Vieques are covered and protected by the same basic rights as \n     the citizens of any of the fifty (50) states of the American \n     Nation. Upon examining the history of military activity in \n     Vieques, we have to conclude that these have dramatically \n     affected the lives of its people. The constant bombing and \n     other military practices using live ammunition have affected \n     the physical and emotional health of the residents of \n     Vieques.\n       In the light of these considerations, the Legislature of \n     Puerto Rico believes that it is imperative that the United \n     States Navy cease using live ammunition in its firing and \n     bombing military practices in Vieques. Once again, we \n     reaffirm the need for the residents of Vieques to live in an \n     environment of tranquility and to enjoy the happiness that \n     all Americans aspire; be it\n       Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico: \n       Section 1.--To request that the President, the Congress and \n     the Navy of the United States of America, on behalf and in \n     representation of the People of Puerto Rico, immediately \n     respond to the plea of our people to cease using live \n     ammunition in firing and bombing military practices in the \n     island municipality of Vieques and its surrounding waters.\n       Section 2.--To request that the President, the Congress, \n     and the Navy of the United States of America, once the firing \n     and bombing military practices mentioned in Section 1 have \n     ceased, deactivate and remove all undetonated explosive \n     artifacts used during its firing and bombing military \n     practices which might reasonably constitute a risk to the \n     inhabitants of Vieques.\n       Section 3.--This Concurrent Resolution shall be remitted to \n     the Honorable William Jefferson Clinton. President of the \n     United States of America; the Congress of the United States \n     of America, the Vice President of the United States of \n     America, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \n     Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the Secretary of \n     the Navy of the United States of America.\n       Section 4.--This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect \n     immediately after its approval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5834-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRAMS:\n       S. 1102.

Mr. President, I want to take a little time this morning \nto talk about Social Security. I know our Nation has been engaged in \nSocial Security reform discussions for about 2 years now kind of \nformally. But, informally, many have been talking about what we are \ngoing to do to ensure a safe, sound Social Security system in the \nfuture.\n  We all expected that we could work in a bipartisan manner during this \nCongress to be able to complete the immense task of saving and \nstrengthening Social Security for the American people.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has failed to take leadership on \nthis issue and has failed to present an honest plan to this Congress to \naddress Social Security's rapid approaching crisis.\n  There is widespread reluctance to move forward on reform due to \npolitical considerations. Yet, if we keep delaying essential reform \nuntil after the ``next election''--it is always after the next \nelection--we will never be able to complete our goal of ensuring \nretirement security for future generations of Americans.\n  Now, on the positive side, the debate has surely raised the public's \nawareness of their own retirement security shortcomings. It has brought \nattention to the Social Security crisis and has led to a variety of \nsolutions to fix the system.\n  I believe this is a healthy debate, one that we must continue to \nencourage. I am sure that when our elected officials muster the \npolitical will to make some of those hard choices we face, the Nation \nwill be ready to support those choices.\n  Regardless of when we actually consider Social Security reform, we \nmust continue the job of educating Americans about the importance of \nsavings and retirement planning. We must continue to debate the role of \nfuture Social Security benefits in our retirement security decisions.\n  That is why I am here. I rise today to introduce three pieces of \nlegislation as first steps to save Social Security. To outline the \nbills, my first bill, very simply, would grant every current and future \nSocial Security beneficiary a legal right to those Social Security \nbenefits.\n  The second is a comprehensive plan to move Social Security from the \ncurrent pay-as-you-go system to one that is a fully funded, \npersonalized retirement system, to ensure a safe, sound, secure \nretirement program that maximizes benefits for the retiree.\n  The third bill would provide real information about the costs and the \nbenefits under the current Social Security system.\n  Mr. President, each working American devotes his or her entire life \nto a job, or series of jobs, and pays hundreds of thousands of dollars \nin Social Security taxes into the retirement system. In fact, Social \nSecurity taxes are the largest tax that many families will ever pay, \naccounting for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime income that will \ngo into Social Security.\n  Many people, including myself, believe that Social Security benefits \nare our ``earned right.'' We think that because we have paid Social \nSecurity taxes, we are legally entitled to receive Social Security \nbenefits. But this ``earned right'' is nothing but an illusion--an \nillusion created by politicians who call Social Security taxes \n``contributions'' and make Social Security sound like it is a regular \ninsurance program.\n\n  The truth is that the American people do not have any legal right to \ntheir Social Security benefits, though they pay Social Security taxes \nall of their lives. Their benefits are always at the mercy of the \nGovernment and politicians who can adjust them and can even spend them \non unrelated Government programs. This fact--that Americans currently \nhave no legal right to Social Security--was decided by the courts when \nthe Social Security was just getting started.\n  Mr. President, it was back in 1937, less than 2 years after the \ncreation of Social Security, that the Supreme Court decided in the case \nof Helvering v. Davis that Social Security was not an insurance \nprogram.\n  The court held:\n\n       The proceeds of both the employee and employer taxes are to \n     be paid into the Treasury like any other internal revenue \n     generally, and are not earmarked in any way.\n\n  So, basically, Social Security is just a tax, not a retirement \nsystem.\n  The Court also pointed out:\n\n       Congress did not improvise a judgment when it found that \n     the award of old-age benefits would be conducive to the \n     general welfare. The President's committee on economic \n     security made an investigation and report . . . with the loss \n     of savings inevitable in periods of idleness, the fate of \n     workers over 65, when thrown out of work, is little less than \n     desperate. . . . Moreover, laws of the separate States cannot \n     deal with this effectively. . . .Only a power that is \n     national can serve the interests of all.\n\n  What it meant was that Social Security was not and is not an \ninsurance program at all, but a tax--a tax, pure and simple--that \nleaves retirement benefits to be actually determined by the political \nprocess--not the benefits of the plan, but the political process.\n  This decision was later confirmed in another important case, Fleming \nv. Nestor. In this case, the Supreme Court more expressly ruled that \nworkers have no legally binding contractual rights to their Social \nSecurity benefits, and that those benefits can be cut or even \neliminated at any time.\n  Mr. President, this is a very interesting and important case. Ephram \nNestor was a Bulgarian immigrant who paid Social Security taxes from \n1936 until he retired in 1955. He received a $55.60-per-month Social \nSecurity check during his retirement. But in 1956, Nestor was deported \nfor having been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s. His \nSocial Security checks were stopped in accordance with the law.\n  Nestor sued the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, claiming \nthat because he had paid Social Security taxes, he had a right to \nSocial Security benefits.\n  The Supreme Court rejected his claim, clearly stating:\n\n       To engraft upon the Social Security system a concept of \n     ``accrued property rights'' would deprive it of the \n     flexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever changing \n     conditions which it demands.\n\n  The Court also held:\n\n       It is apparent that the non-contractual interest of an \n     employee covered by the [Social Security] Act cannot be \n     soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose \n     right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium \n     payments.\n\n  It strikes me that these Supreme Court decisions prove that if Social \nSecurity is considered more of a welfare program, there is no assurance \nthat retirees will receive benefits now or in the future if they are \njudged unworthy, or if the IOUs owed to the Social Security Trust Funds \nare deemed unnecessary to repay. It also shows, contrary to common \nbelief, that Social Security is not backed by the full faith and credit \nof the government and is not a government-guaranteed investment. I \nbelieve these decisions--which we rarely see referenced, for obvious \nreasons--are unfair and wrong, and must be corrected.\n  In my view, workers must have a full legal right to receive \ngovernment-guaranteed Social Security benefits. The reason is simple: \ndespite these court cases, I believe most people think that the federal \ngovernment should provide benefits to the American people for their \nretirement, if those people have paid into the system. It's our moral \nand contractual duty to honor that commitment, and ensure the program \nis more of an insurance policy than a welfare program. Coming \ndemographic changes will soon create huge cracks in the Social Security \nprogram--if the government fails to make the changes necessary to \naddress the crisis ahead, it would be wrong to let current or future \nbeneficiaries bear that burden.\n  As a first step to saving Social Security, legislation I am \nintroducing today would grant every current and future Social Security \nbeneficiary an ``earned right,'' or legal right, to their Social \nSecurity benefits plus an accurate inflation adjustment. This could be \nachieved by requiring the government to issue U.S. Treasury-backed \ncertificates specifying the level of guaranteed benefits.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation, the Social Security Benefits \nGuarantee Act, is not at all complicated. All it does is to create an \n``earned right'' to Social Security, which every American deserves and \nshould be given in the first place. It shows that regardless of how we \nmay reform the system in the\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nfuture, retirees will earn a return on the investment they make in the \nform of payroll taxes.\n  By granting Americans this legal right, we are taking away \nuncertainties resulting from the growing political debate. Social \nSecurity will no longer be subject to Washington's manipulation, and \nthe IOUs will be repaid. Implementing my legislation would force \nCongress and the Administration to come up with an honest plan to save \nand strengthen the Social Security system.\n  But more importantly, it would put millions of current and future \nSocial Security beneficiaries at ease, allowing them to sleep at night \nwithout fearing the loss or reduction of their retirement benefits.\n  Mr. President, once we have secured Social Security benefits, taking \nthe difficult steps to reform the Social Security system will be \neasier. The current system has served us well until now. The changing \ndemographics of our society makes it impossible for the system to \nsurvive without reform. I believe a fully-funded, market-based, \npersonalized retirement system would give all workers full property \nrights to their retirement investment.\n  Not only could personal retirement account, or PRA, benefits be three \nto five times higher than current Social Security benefits, workers \nwould actually own the money in their account and could pass the assets \non to their children. It would be part of your estate, which today, as \nyou know, Social Security does not transfer. Congress would no longer \nspend the surplus money.\n  That's the reason I am today re-introducing my legislation, the \n``Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act.''\n  Mr. President, Americans today are living longer and retiring earlier \nthan ever before. American retirement security is supposedly built on a \nthree-legged stool: Social Security, private pensions, and personal \nsavings. These are the three cornerstones of a secure retirement.\n  Unfortunately, today these cornerstones have eroded. Without major \nrepair, the stool will collapse, causing serious financial hardship for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Most Americans rely increasingly on Social Security for their \nretirement income. Not everyone has a private pension and some are \nunable to save. Yet Social Security, upon which rests their hopes for a \nsecure retirement, is headed for bankruptcy.\n  Benefits for 76 million baby boomers and future generations of \nretirees will not be there unless something is done soon.\n  I believe the best solution to our retirement crisis is to reform \nSocial Security by moving it from a pay-as-you-go retirement system to \na fully-funded, market based system. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday will do just that.\n  The first criticism you will hear is that a market-based retirement \nsystem is too risky. However, my plan would guarantee benefits for \ncurrent and future beneficiaries, while retaining and expanding the \ncurrent safety net under Social Security.\n  At the same time, workers would have the freedom to control their \nfunds and resources for their own retirement security within certain \nsafety and soundness parameters. Workers and their employers could \ndivert 10 percent of a worker's income into personal retirement \naccounts.\n  In addition, workers could also contribute to personal retirement \naccounts they've established for their non-working children.\n  Let me focus on the proposed safety net provisions under my plan: One \nkey component of my proposal is to ensure that a safety net will be \nthere at all times for disadvantaged individuals. This can be done \nwithout government guarantees of investments or overly strict \nregulation of investment options.\n  Under this legislation, a safety net would be set up and would \ninvolve a guaranteed minimum benefit level: 150 percent of the poverty \nlevel. When a worker retires, if his or her PRA fails to provide the \nminimum retirement benefits for whatever reason the government would \nmake up the difference. So nobody would retire into poverty. They would \nretire at least with a minimum of 150 percent of the poverty level.\n\n  The same applies to survivor and disability benefits. If a worker \ndies or becomes disabled, and his or her PRA doesn't accumulate \nsufficient funds to provide minimum survivor and disability benefits, \nthe government would match the shortfalls.\n  This simple safety net is necessary, and the minimum benefit would \nguarantee that no one in our society would be left impoverished in \nretirement, while still allowing workers to enjoy the freedom and \nprosperity achievable under a market-based retirement system.\n  This would operate in a manner similar to the federal government's \nThrift Savings program, which includes safe investments and a far \nhigher return than Social Security. If the system works for us, others \nshould also be able to benefit from it.\n  Another feature of the fully funded retirement system I'm outlining \ncould provide better survivor and disability benefits than the current \nSocial Security system offers.\n  Under my plan, for instance, when a worker dies, his family would \ninherit all the funds accumulated in his PRA.\n  I use my father as an example. He died at the age of 61, and from \nSocial Security received a check for $253 as a death benefit. But that \nwas all. Under our system, all the money that you have paid in during a \nlifetime of working would be yours. And, if you happen to die early, it \nwould then be a part of your estate and transferred to your heirs. The \nsavings wouldn't disappear into the black hole of the Social Security \ntrust funds, or become tangled in a survivors' benefit bureaucratic \ndebate.\n  The system would also provide, besides the retirement savings, a \nsurvivors benefit package.\n  My plan requires the funds that manage PRAs to use part of their \nannual contribution or yield to buy life and disability insurance, \nsupplementing their accumulated funds to at least match the promised \nSocial Security survivors and disability benefits.\n  By requiring retirement funds to purchase life and disability \ninsurance for everyone, all workers in each individual fund would be \ntreated as a common pool for underwriting purposes. The insurance would \nbe purchased as a group policy not by individual workers by investment \nfirms or financial institutions, thus avoiding insurance policy \nunderwriting discrimination while providing the largest amount of \nbenefits at the lowest possible cost.\n  Mr. President, again, a major criticism of a market-based personal \nretirement account system is that it's inherently volatile, subject to \nthe whims of investors and the market, exposing a worker's retirement \nincome to unnecessary risks.\n  My plan specifically addresses this concern by requiring the approved \ninvestment firms and financial institutions that manage PRAs to have \ninsurance against investment loss.\n  By approximating the role of the FDIC, we ensure that every PRA would \ngenerate a minimum rate of return of at least 2.5 percent, which is \nmore than current Social Security benefits. In fact, Social Security is \npaying less than 1 percent today, and for future generations it would \nactually be a negative rate of return.\n\n  Regardless of the ups and downs of the markets, workers would still \ndo better under this system than under the current Social Security \nprogram.\n  This is another safety net built into my plan to give the American \npeople peace of mind when it comes to their retirement investment.\n  To further reduce risks to a worker's PRA, my legislation also \nrequires that rules, regulations, and restrictions similar to those \ngoverning IRAs would apply to personal retirement accounts.\n  PRAs must be properly structured and follow strict, sensible \nguidelines set forth by the independent federal board that will oversee \nthe system.\n  In choosing qualified investment firms and financial institutions to \nmanage the PRAs, the oversight board is responsible for examining the \ncredibility and ability of these companies, and then approving them as \nPRA managers accordingly. In other words, to put in place a very safe \nand sound retirement system, much like the FDIC is in banks. People are \nconfident their savings is protected. This would be the same with their \nretirement accounts. They would be protected. This will generate much \nbetter returns, as much as three to five times more at retirement\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\nthan today's Social Security--three to fives times more benefits when \nyou retire than under the current Social Security plan because personal \nretirement accounts, unlike Social Security, make real investments \nwhich produce new income and produce wealth.\n\n  That means improved benefits for everybody, including low-wage \nearners, without the redistribution of private income.\n  Mr. GRAMS. The third bill I am introducing today deals with the flow \nof information related to an individual's Social Security contribution.\n  Most working Americans are poorly prepared for their retirement. That \nis because of a disturbing lack of information. Congress needs to help \nthem better plan for retirement by providing useful and accurate \ninformation about the Social Security benefits they are going to \nreceive.\n  In other words, let people know exactly what the system is, how much \nis in the trust fund, how much money they can expect to receive at \nretirement, and what will be the rate of return of their investment.\n  Americans currently receive Social Security information through the \npersonal earnings and benefits estimate statements or the PEBES, \nprovided by the Social Security Administration. However, a recent GAO \nreport shows that the report, although useful, is actually incomplete \nand it is difficult for many Americans to understand exactly what is in \nthe account for them at Social Security.\n  As a result, many workers, even those near retirement, continue to \noverestimate their likely Social Security benefits, which, bottom line, \nthreatens their quality of life throughout their retirement years.\n  Social Security taxes are the largest tax that many families will \never pay. It will account for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime \nincome they will make. Few Americans know the value or the yield of \ntheir investment, because the Government never tells them the whole \ntruth about Social Security by providing them with this key \ninformation. Reliable information on Social Security is crucial to \nenable Americans to better understand the value of their Social \nSecurity investment and to help them determine exactly how much they \nshould supplement their expected Social Security benefits with other \nsavings in order to have a certain level of retirement security.\n  This is particularly important for some ethnic minorities, because \nresearch shows that African Americans have lower rates of return from \nSocial Security. They get less back from the system than others who pay \nin. Low-income, single, African American males have a negative rate of \nreturn today. As I said, overall it is about a 1 percent rate of \nreturn. For many, it will be a negative rate of return. But for low-\nincome, single, African American males today, they already have a \nnegative rate of return on the money they pay into the system.\n  My bill would improve the reports by requiring the Social Security \nAdministration to provide an estimate of the Social Security benefits a \nworker is going to receive in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, as \nwell as an estimated rate of return the worker is projected to receive \nfrom Social Security.\n  In real dollars, it means today if you are 20 years old, the report \nsays when you retire you could expect to receive about $98,000 a year \nin retirement benefits. You say, that is great, 98,000 a year; but if \nyou take in the inflation-adjusted amount throughout those 40 years in \nbuying power, it would be less than $14,000 in today's money.\n  So you need to know exactly what you are going to get at retirement \nand what the buying power of those dollars is going to be 40 years from \nnow so that you can make better plans on how you are going to plan for \nyour retirement.\n  Given the crucial role of information about Social Security in \nretirement planning and the fact that, beginning this year, the \nstatements from Social Security will be mailed annually to every \neligible individual over 25, immediate improvement of these standards \nis imperative. These numbers are already going to be sent out, so this \nisn't an added cost, this isn't asking for a new program from the \nGovernment; this is saying that the report the Social Security \nAdministration is going to send to every American over 25 needs to be \nmore accurate than the information provided today.\n  Information will not solve all the problems we have with Social \nSecurity, but I think it will surely give working Americans some useful \ntools to help them better plan for retirement.\n  In closing, American workers labor mightily to put money aside for \nretirement. They should have full property rights to their money. They \ndeserve the security of owning their retirement benefits and savings. \nMy legislation gives American workers legal protection to their \nretirement savings. It will stop politicians from cutting their \nbenefits to spend money in other unrelated programs out of our Social \nSecurity trust fund. It also allows American workers maximum freedom to \nbetter plan for their retirement by giving them more accurate \ninformation on their Social Security benefits.\n  In closing, retirement security is essential to millions of Americans \nand we must do everything we can to help them achieve that security and \nthe peace of mind that will go along with it.\n  My legislation charts a course which I believe will lead us there.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n        Daschle):\n  S. 1105. A bill to assist local governments and States in assessing \nand remediating brownfield sites, increase fairness and reduce \nlitigation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n   superfund litigation reduction and brownfield cleanup act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Lautenberg, \nLincoln, and Daschle, I am introducing legislation to reauthorize and \nreform the Superfund program, the Superfund Litigation Reduction and \nBrownfields Cleanup Act.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee has been working on \nSuperfund reauthorization legislation for more than six years. It's \ntime to finish the job. To my mind, the best way to accomplish this is \nto focus on a set of modest but important reforms about which we are \nlikely to be able to achieve a broad bipartisan consensus.\n  That is what our bill aims to do.\n  Superfund has been criticized as creating disincentives for cleaning \nup ``brownfields''--generally, sites in older neighborhoods or \nindustrial areas that are contaminated, but not to the extent that they \nare likely to be put on the National Priorities List. The main charge \nis that fear of Superfund liability makes some developers reluctant to \ninvest.\n  Title I of the bill addresses this concern. It eliminates Superfund \nliability for prospective purchasers of contaminated property who are \nnot responsible for the contamination, and thereby removes a potential \ndisincentive for brownfields cleanup. The bill also provides liability \nrelief for current owners of contaminated property who are not \nresponsible for and had no reason to know of the contamination when \nthey acquired the property, and persons whose property is contaminated \nas a result of migration from neighboring property.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes funding for three purposes:\n  $35 million per year for five years for grants to local governments, \nStates and Indian tribes to inventory and assess contamination at \nbrownfield sites;\n  $60 million per year for five years for grants to local governments, \nStates and Indian tribes to capitalize revolving loan funds and for \nsite cleanup; and\n  $15 million per year for five years to States to develop and enhance \nvoluntary cleanup programs.\n  Perhaps the most well known criticism of Superfund relates to the \ntoll it can take on small businesses that, despite their often minimal \ncontribution of waste to a site, have been forced to incur significant \nsums in attorney fees and payments toward cleanup. A significant \nportion of small businesses that sent waste to a site sent only \nmunicipal waste or very small amounts of hazardous waste. In addition, \nmany small businesses simply cannot afford to pay the costs associated \nwith retaining an attorney and cleanup.\n  To address these problems, the bill provides two liability \nexemptions.\n  The first is an exemption for parties that sent a de micromis amount \nof hazardous waste--presumed to be less than 110 gallons of liquid \nmaterial or 200 pounds of solid material. (Note that\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nthis provision is not limited to small businesses: it also would exempt \na large company that sends only de micromis amounts of waste.)\n  The second is an exemption for small business and homeowners that \nsent municipal solid waste from their home or business. There is no \nlimit on the amount of municipal waste these parties sent.\n  In addition, the bill provides relief for those who sent a relatively \nsmall amount of hazardous waste, but more than allowed under the de \nmicromis exemption, and for small businesses with a limited ability to \npay. Specifically, the bill provides expedited settlements for \ncontributors of de minimis amounts of waste and persons with a limited \nability to pay. These provisions require EPA to make settlement offers \nas expeditiously as practicable to these parties. A party who \ncontributed 1% or less of the waste to the site is presumed to be de \nminimis.\n  Together, these provisions would provide relief for virtually every \nsmall business and homeowner that should get relief. The bill also \nrequires that EPA establish a small business Superfund assistance \nsection within the small business ombudsman office of EPA.\n  Under Superfund, contributors of municipal solid waste and municipal \nsewage sludge have been sued, and in some instances, found liable, \nbased on the fact that even municipal waste contains some small amount \nof hazardous substances. At sites with municipal waste (such as \nmunicipal landfills), frequently the majority of waste by volume is \nmunicipal waste, but the conditions that result in listing the site on \nthe NPL were caused by the more toxic industrial waste. Hence, there \nhas long been controversy as to whether contributors of municipal \nwaste, and municipalities that own municipal landfills on the NPL, \nshould be treated the same as contributors of other waste.\n  Last year EPA published a policy for settlements with municipal \nowners and operators of NPL landfills, and for public and private \ncontributors of municipal waste. The policy was developed through \nnegotiations with several municipal organizations.\n  Our bill codifies EPA's policy. Under the provision, municipalities \nthat own or operate landfills that are on the NPL are entitled to \nsettle for 20% of the cleanup costs at a site, and for 10% if they have \na population below 100,000. Contributors of municipal waste, including \nmunicipalities and private parties, can settle for $5.30 a ton. This \nnumber was calculated based on the cost of cleaning up a municipal \nlandfill that does not also have hazardous waste.\n  Title IV provides exemptions for contributors of certain ``recyclable \nmaterial''--paper, plastic, glass, textiles, rubber (other than whole \ntires), metal and batteries--that meet specified conditions. It is \nvirtually identical to the Lott/Daschle bill in the 105th Congress. In \nparticular, I appreciate the work of Senator Lincoln on this issue.\n  Contributions of orphan funding from the Superfund can mitigate much \nof the perceived unfairness of the joint and several liability system. \nAllocation pilot studies conducted by EPA revealed that the most \nimportant tool for achieving settlements, and in the process reducing \ntransaction costs, is for EPA to offer some contribution of funding to \noffset costs attributable to parties that are unable to pay.\n  The bill authorizes $200 million per year for five years in mandatory \nspending to be used by EPA in cleanup settlements. It is so used to \noffset costs attributable to parties that are insolvent or defunct or \notherwise unable to pay, or for other equitable purposes. This \nmandatory spending is conditional, however, on the Superfund cleanup \nprogram being appropriated at least $1.5 billion annually, exclusive of \nthe $200 million for orphan funding. That so-called ``firewall'' is \nintended to ensure that cleanups are not sacrificed in order to pay \norphan funding. Assuming the program is funded at the required level, \nEPA would be required to contribute $200 million per year to cleanup \nsettlements. However, to maintain flexibility, EPA would have the \ndiscretion to determine how much of the $200 million to allocate to \nwhich sites.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations of $7.5 billion over five years, \nor $1.5 billion a year. At this level, EPA would be able to maintain \nthe current pace of cleanups, which is resulting in the completion of \nconstruction at 85 sites a year. Now that we finally are making good \nprogress in cleaning up sites, its important to maintain this pace.\n  On a related point, the bill continues to fund cleanups principally \nthrough the Superfund Trust Fund. In doing so, it assumes the \nreinstatement of the two Superfund taxes--the excise taxes on petroleum \nand chemical feedstocks and the corporate environmental tax of .12 \npercent of corporate alternative minimum taxable income above $2 \nmillion. By doing so, the bill would retain the current reliance on the \ntrust fund to pay for the majority of cleanup costs, with a limited \npayment from general revenues.\n  Mr. President, the chairmen of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and its Superfund Subcommittee, Senators Chafee and Smith, \nalso have introduced a Superfund reform bill, S. 1090. There are \nseveral areas of general agreement between the bill that we are \nintroducing today and S. 1090. Some examples are the exemption for bona \nfide prospective purchasers and other exemptions intended to promote \nbrownfields redevelopment; exemptions for contributors of recyclable \nmaterial; and exemptions and expedited settlements for contributors of \nmunicipal waste or small amounts of hazardous waste, to protect \nmunicipalities and small businesses.\n  There are, however, some significant differences between the \napproaches taken in the two bills, particularly with respect to \nproviding an adequate federal safety net to protect public health and \nthe environment, the allocation system, and, perhaps most \nsignificantly, providing adequate and assured funding to operate the \nprogram.\n  I hope that we can work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve \nthese differences, so that we can pass a Superfund reauthorization bill \nwith broad, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Superfund \nLitigation Reduction and Brownfield Cleanup Act along with Senators \nDaschle, Baucus, and Lincoln. This bill will strengthen and improve the \ncurrent Superfund program by cleaning up urban and rural brownfields \nand removing small, innocent parties from unnecessary superfund \nlitigation.\n  Unlike the alternative Superfund proposal offered by the Republicans \non Environment and Public Works Committee, this bill continues what is \nbest about the Superfund program and makes the minor adjustments \nnecessary to make it cost effective.\n  Mr. President, way back in the 103rd Congress, the critics of \nSuperfund raised a number of issues. They asserted that the program was \ntoo slow, that not enough cleanups were taking place, that there was \ntoo much litigation.\n  At the time, we were seeking solutions which would make the program \nfaster, streamline cleanups, treat parties more fairly and get the \nlittle guys out earlier, all while keeping those responsible for the \nproblem also responsible for cleaning it up. This was all within the \ngeneral goals of achieving more cleanups and therefore providing better \nprotection of human health and the environment.\n  I am proud of those proposals, and many of us still on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, including Chairman Chafee, who \nvoted for that bill way back in the 103rd Congress should also be \nproud. Many of those proposals, although never enacted into law, were \nadopted administratively by EPA and radically altered the Superfund \nProgram as we know it.\n  Others have been tested and been improved upon. In general, the \nthrust of this bill has resulted in many of the achievements of the \ncurrent program.\n  According to a report issued by the General Accounting Office, by the \nend of this fiscal year all cleanup remedies will have been selected \nfor 95 percent of nonfederal NPL sites (1,109 of 1,169 sites).\n  In addition, approximately 990 NPL sites have final cleanup plans \napproved, approximately 5,600 emergency removal actions have been taken \nat hazardous waste sites to stabilize dangerous situations and to \nreduce the threat to human health and the environment.\n  More than 30,900 sites have been removed from the Superfund inventory \nof\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\npotential waste sites, to help promote the economic redevelopment of \nthese properties.\n  During this same time, EPA has worked to improve the fairness and \nefficiency of the enforcement program, even while keeping up the \nparticipation of potentially responsible parties in cleaning up their \nsites.\n  EPA has negotiated more than 400 deminimis settlements with over \n18,000 small parties, which gave protection for these parties against \nexpensive contribution suits brought by other private parties. Sixty \nsix percent of these have been in the last four years alone.\n  Since fiscal year 1996, EPA has offered ``orphan share'' compensation \nof over $145 million at 72 sites to responsible parties who were \nwilling to step up and negotiate settlements of their cases. EPA is now \noffering this at every single settlement, to reward settlors and reduce \nlitigation, both with the government, and with other private parties.\n  These are just a few highlights of the improvements made in the \nprogram, many drawn from our earlier legislative proposals. Other \nimprovements, such as instituting the targeted review of complex and \nhigh-cost cleanups, prior to remedy selection, have reduced the cost of \ncleanups without delaying the pace of cleanups.\n  EPA's administrative reforms have significantly improved the program, \nby speeding up cleanups and reducing senseless litigation, and making \nthe program fairer, faster and more efficient overall.\n  But despite the fact that this is a program that has finally really \nhit its stride, we are now faced with proposals from the majority which \ncould undercut the progress in the program, and which are premised on a \ngoal of closing down the program rather than a goal of cleaning up the \nsites. Indeed, the very title of their bill, the Superfund Program \nCompletion Act, reflects this intent.\n  I am deeply troubled by many of the provisions in the Republican \nbill, which would have the effect of ramping the program down without \nregard to the amount of site work left to be done. This bill provides \nfor lowered funding levels, a cap on the NPL, waivers of the federal \nsafety net, and some broad liability exemptions.\n  At the same time, it creates a number of new, expensive obligations \nwhich would further reduce the amount of money available for cleanup. \nIt also shifts the costs of the program to the taxpayers and would not \ninclude an extension of the Superfund tax.\n  In short, while I am encouraged by the fact that the Republican bill \ndrops some troubling provisions from prior bills, it introduces a whole \nset of new issues that are cause for great concern.\n  I think it is very clear that what we need here is a better Superfund \nprogram, not a retreat from tackling our environmental problems.\n  We need a bill that continues to accelerate the pace of cleanups, \nkeeps cleanups protective, reduces litigation and transaction costs, is \naffordable and does not shift costs to the American taxpayer.\n  That is why I am introducing the Superfund Litigation Reduction and \nBrownfield Cleanup Act of 1999. I believe that this bill, is in some \nareas very close to the provisions supported by my Republican \ncolleagues, but differs in some critical areas.\n  It would protect cleanups, reduce litigation and not shift costs to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I hope that these are goals we can agree on. And I urge my colleagues \nto not throw the Superfund baby out with the bathwater.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen the \nSuperfund program in the 21st century not dismantle it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the \nLegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for qualified individuals for bone mass measurement (bone \ndensity testing) to prevent fractures associated with osteoporosis; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    early detection and prevention of osteoporosis and related bone \n                          diseases act of 1999\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early \nDetection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act \nof 1999 along with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe.\n  Osteoporosis and other related bone diseases pose a major public \nhealth threat. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are \nwomen, suffer from, or are at risk for, osteoporosis. Between three and \nfour million Americans suffer from related bone diseases like Paget's \ndisease or osteogenesis imperfecta. Today, in the United States, 10 \nmillion individuals already have osteoporosis and 18 million more have \nlow bone mass, placing them at increased risk.\n  Osteoporosis is often called the ``silent disease'' because bone loss \noccurs without symptoms. People often do not know they have \nosteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden bump or \nfall causes a fracture or a vertebra to collapse. Every year, there are \n1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Half of all women, \nand one-eighth of all men, age 50 or older, will suffer a bone fracture \ndue to osteoporosis.\n  Osteoporosis is a progressive condition that has no known cure; thus, \nprevention and treatment are key. The Early Detection and Prevention of \nOsteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1999 seeks to combat \nosteoporosis, and related bone diseases like Paget's disease by \nrequiring private health plans to cover bone mass measurement tests for \nqualified individuals who are at risk for developing osteoporosis.\n  Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of detecting \nosteoporosis in its early stages. The test is non-invasive and painless \nand is as predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high \nblood pressure is of heart disease or stroke. This provision is similar \nto a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that requires \nMedicare coverage of bone mass measurements.\n  Medical experts agree that osteoporosis is preventable. Thus, if the \ntoll of osteoporosis and other related bone diseases is to be reduced, \nthe commitment to prevention and treatment must be significantly \nincreased.\n  Last year, Congress reauthorized the Women's Health Research and \nPrevention Act. This legislation authorized $3 million for a national \nresource center to increase public knowledge and awareness of \nosteoporosis, and $40 million for osteoporosis research at the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH). This was an important first step in the \nfight against osteoporosis. Congress must now maintain its commitment \nto prevention by ensuring women have access to bone mass measurement \ntests.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Early \n     Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone \n     Diseases Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nature of osteoporosis.--\n       (A) Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone \n     mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to \n     bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of \n     the hip, spine, and wrist.\n       (B) Osteoporosis has no symptoms and typically remains \n     undiagnosed until a fracture occurs.\n       (C) Once a fracture occurs, the condition has usually \n     advanced to the stage where the likelihood is high that \n     another fracture will occur.\n       (D) There is no cure for osteoporosis, but drug therapy has \n     been shown to reduce new hip and spine fractures by 50 \n     percent and other treatments, such as nutrition therapy, have \n     also proven effective.\n       (2) Incidence of osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) 28 million Americans have (or are at risk for) \n     osteoporosis, 80 percent of which are women.\n       (B) Osteoporosis is responsible for 1.5 million bone \n     fractures annually, including more than 300,000 hip \n     fractures, 700,000 vertebral fractures and 200,000 fractures \n     of the wrists.\n       (C) Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or \n     older will have a bone fracture due to osteoporosis.\n       (D) Between 3 and 4 million Americans have Paget's disease, \n     osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, and other \n     related metabolic bone diseases.\n       (3) Impact of osteoporosis.--The cost of treating \n     osteoporosis is significant:\n       (A) The annual cost of osteoporosis in the United States is \n     $13.8 billion and is expected to increase precipitously \n     because the proportion of the population comprised of older \n     persons is expanding and each generation of older persons \n     tends to have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than \n     preceding generations.\n       (B) The average cost in the United States of repairing a \n     hip fracture due to osteoporosis is $32,000.\n       (C) Fractures due to osteoporosis frequently result in \n     disability and institutionalization of individuals.\n       (D) Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition causing \n     fractures primarily in aging individuals, preventing \n     fractures, particularly for post menopausal women before they \n     become eligible for medicare, has a significant potential of \n     reducing osteoporosis-related costs under the medicare \n     program.\n       (4) Use of bone mass measurement.--\n       (A) Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of \n     detecting osteoporosis at an early stage.\n       (B) Low bone mass is as predictive of future fractures as \n     is high cholesterol or high blood pressure of heart disease \n     or stroke.\n       (C) Bone mass measurement is a non-invasive, painless, and \n     reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis before costly fractures \n     occur.\n       (D) Under section 4106 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     Medicare provides coverage, effective July 1, 1999, for bone \n     mass measurement for qualified individuals who are at risk of \n     developing osteoporosis.\n       (5) Research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases.--\n       (A) Technology now exists, and new technology is \n     developing, that will permit the early diagnosis and \n     prevention of osteoporosis and related bone diseases as well \n     as management of these conditions once they develop.\n       (B) Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone \n     diseases is severely constrained at key research institutes, \n     including the National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute on \n     Aging, the National Institute of Diabetics and Digestive and \n     Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Dental Research, \n     and the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development.\n       (C) Further research is needed to improve medical knowledge \n     concerning--\n       (i) cellular mechanisms related to the processes of bone \n     resorption and bone formation, and the effect of different \n     agents on bone remodeling;\n       (ii) risk factors for osteoporosis, including newly \n     discovered risk factors, risk factors related to groups not \n     ordinarily studied (such as men and minorities), risk factors \n     related to genes that help to control skeletal metabolism, \n     and risk factors relating to the relationship of aging \n     processes to the development of osteoporosis;\n       (iii) bone mass measurement technology, including more \n     widespread and cost-effective techniques for making more \n     precise measurements and for interpreting measurements;\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n       (iv) calcium (including bioavailability, intake \n     requirements, and the role of calcium in building heavier and \n     denser skeletons), and vitamin D and its role as an essential \n     vitamin in adults;\n       (v) prevention and treatment, including the efficacy of \n     current therapies, alternative drug therapies for prevention \n     and treatment, and the role of exercise; and\n       (vi) rehabilitation.\n       (D) Further educational efforts are needed to increase \n     public and professional knowledge of the causes of, methods \n     for avoiding, and treatment of osteoporosis.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to reform the conduct of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n      constitutional and effective reform of campaigns act of 1999\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Constitutional and \nEffective Reform of Campaigns Act, or ``CERCA'', which I first \nintroduced during the 105th Congress. This legislation is the product \nof two years of hearings during my Chairmanship of the Rules Committee, \ndiscussions with numerous experts, party officials, and candidates, and \nnearly two decades of participating in campaigns and campaign finance \ndebates in the Senate. Many of the proposals in this bill have been \nmade in some form by several of my Senate colleagues and by Members of \nthe House, and I readily acknowledge drawing on their expertise. The \nimportant discussions last Congress during the meetings of a task force \nheaded by Senator Nickles, at the request of Majority Leader Lott, were \ninvaluable.\n  This legislation offers an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is \na good faith effort to strike middle ground between those who believe \npublic financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe \nthe solution is to remove current regulations. It offers a package of \nproposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support \nand meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our \npresent system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed \nwith any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all \nprovisions had to be consistent with the First Amendment: Congress \nwould be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a \nlikelihood of being struck down by the federal courts. Second, I oppose \npublic financing and mandating ``free'' or reduced-cost media time \nwhich in my mind is neither free nor a good policy idea. Why should \nseekers of federal office get free time, while candidates for state \noffice or local office--from governors to local sheriffs--do not \nreceive comparable free benefits? Such an inequity and imbalance will \nbreed friction between federal and state office seekers. Third, I \nbelieve we should try to increase the role of citizens and the \npolitical parties. Fourth, any framework of campaign reform legislation \nmust respect and protect the constitutional right of individuals, \ngroups, and organizations to participate in advocacy concerning \npolitical issues.\n  This bill is designed to be a ``bilateral disarmament'' on the tough \nissues of soft money and union dues: each side must give up equivalent \nground. The Republicans should give ground by placing a cap on soft \nmoney which has tended to favor our side. And Democrats should give \nground by allowing union members to decide voluntarily for themselves \nwhether to contribute the portion of dues which goes to political \ncontributions or activities.\n  Specifically, on the issue of soft money, no reform can be considered \ntrue reform without placing limits on the corporate and union donations \nto the national political parties. This bill places a $100,000 cap on \nsuch donations. While this provision addresses the public's legitimate \nconcern over the propriety of these large donations, it allows the \npolitical parties sufficient funds to maintain their headquarters and \nconduct their grassroots efforts. In addition, the current limits on \n``hard'' contributions must be updated. The ability of citizens to \ncontribute voluntarily to a wide range of candidates and to their \nparties is fundamental.\n  At the same time, the practice of mandatory union dues going to \npartisan politics without union members' consent must end: it is \ncounter to all the political freedoms that make America a true \ndemocracy. The concept of ``paycheck protection'' must be included in \nany campaign finance reform, so that these deductions are voluntary, \nwhether these dues fund direct contributions to candidates or parties, \nor pay for undisclosed spending on phone banks, get-out-the-vote \nefforts, literature, and television ads.\n  Under this legislation, unions would be required to obtain advance, \nwritten consent before deducting money for political activities from \nunion members' paychecks. The present state of the law requires most \nunion workers to give up their rights to participate in the union if \nthey seek refunds of that portion of dues going to politics. In \naddition, this section would strengthen the reporting requirements for \nunions engaged in political activities and enhance an aggrieved union \nmember's right to challenge a union's determination of the portion of \ndues going to political activities.\n  In the Senate debates thus far, there has been much discussion about \nwhether corporations should be required to obtain shareholder approval \nto make political contributions. This is an issue which warrants \nconsideration. My proposal not only limits these corporate and union \ncontributions to $100,000, it also includes a requirement that \ncompanies disclose their donations to federal political parties in \ntheir annual reports. And under current policies of the Securities and \nExchange Commission, shareholders have the same rights to make \nrecommendations to boards of directors on the propriety of political \ndonations as they do on any business issue related to the company.\n  In addition, the SEC is in the process of making it easier for \nshareholders to raise questions related to social policy matters at \nannual meetings. I am monitoring how these changes are implemented: if \nthey are insufficient to guarantee adequate rights to shareholders, I \nwill consider amending my bill to protect these rights.\n  As an aside, I reject the notion that the status of union members is \nsimilar to those who belong to groups such as the National Rifle \nAssociation or the Sierra Club. Nobody is compelled to join these types \nof organizations, and\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\nthose that do, know or should know that their dues are going in part to \npolitical causes.\n  Furthermore, I considered including in this bill a narrowly-tailored \ndisclosure requirement for individuals and groups spending large sums \non public advertising affecting the public image of candidates during \nelection seasons. However, in keeping with my first basic premise that \nreforms must pass the federal court test of constitutionality, I \nconcluded that such a provision, in view of a long line of Supreme \nCourt cases, likely would be declared unconstitutional, and thus I did \nnot include the provision.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill was thoroughly debated in the Senate, and \nany objective observer of the Senate would agree that we are genuinely \ndeadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of McCain-\nFeingold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an objective \nand pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign system. I \nencourage other Members to come forward, as I have, with proposals \nwhich objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what can be \nachieved. I do not claim to have the only solution: those with other \nideas should come forward.\n\n  In addition to the issues of soft money and union dues discussed \nabove, nine other fundamental problems--all of which can be solved in a \nconstitutional manner--are the most pressing. Here are these problems, \nin no particular order, and my proposed solutions:\n  Problem 1: Politicians spend too much time fundraising, at the \nexpense of their legislative duties for incumbents, and, for both \nincumbents and challengers, at the expense of debating the issues with \nvoters.\n  Solution: The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not \nbeen raised, or even indexed for inflation, for over 20 years. This \nfact requires that candidates must spend more and more time seeking \nmore and more donors. The limit should be doubled, as well as indexed \nfor inflation.\n  Problem 2: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished \nby the activities of political action committees and interest groups.\n  Solutions: I propose a $100 tax credit for contributions made by \ncitizens, with incomes under specified levels, to Senate and House \ncandidates in their states: this credit should spark an influx of small \ndollar contributions to balance the greater ability of citizens with \nhigher incomes to participate.\n  In addition, the increased individual contribution limit should \nbalance the activities of political action committees.\n  Problem 3: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished \nby contributions from those not eligible to vote.\n  Solution: If you are not eligible to vote, you should not contribute \nto campaigns. My bill would prohibit contributions by those ineligible \nto vote, including non-citizens, children, and persons under felony \nconvictions. It also codifies current regulations concerning political \ndonations by domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies.\n  Problem 4: Compared to incumbents, challengers face greater \ndifficulties raising funds and communicating with voters, particularly \nat the outset of a campaign.\n  Solutions: This legislation will allow candidates to receive ``seed \nmoney'' contributions of up to $10,000 from individuals and political \naction committees. This provision should help get candidacies off the \nground. The total amount of these ``seed money'' contributions could \nnot exceed $100,000 for House candidates or $300,000 for Senate \ncandidates. To meet the constitutional test, this provision would apply \nto both challengers and incumbents alike, but in the case of an \nincumbent with money carried over from a prior cycle, those funds would \ncount against the seed money limit.\n  Second, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the franking \nprivilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, rather \nthan the sixty day ban in current law.\n  Problem 5: Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage \nthrough their constitutional right to spend their own funds.\n  Solution: If a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own \nmoney, the individual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so \nthat candidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. \nAgain, to meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all \ncandidates.\n  Problem 6: Current laws prohibiting fundraising activities on federal \nproperty are weak and insufficient.\n  Solution: The current ban on fundraising on federal property was \nwritten before the law created such terms as ``hard'' and ``soft'' \nmoney. This bill updates this law to require that no fundraising take \nplace on federal property.\n  Problem 7: Reporting requirements and public access to disclosure \nstatements are weak and inadequate.\n  Solutions: Under this proposal, the FEC would be required to post \nreports on the Internet for all to see, and to require that candidates, \nand groups making independent expenditures, make faster and more \ncomplete reports. In addition, registered lobbyists would be required \nto report their campaign contributions and those of their employer on \ntheir lobbyist disclosure reports.\n  Problem 8: The Federal Election Commission is in need of procedural \nand substantive reform.\n  Solutions: This legislation contains a number of procedural and \nsubstantive reforms of the FEC, including term limits for \ncommissioners, and increases in penalties for serious violations.\n  Problem 9: The safeguards designed to protect the integrity of our \nelections are compromised by weak aspects of federal laws regulating \nvoter registration and voting.\n  Solutions: The investigations of contested elections in Louisiana and \nCalifornia have shown significant weaknesses in federal laws designed \nto safeguard the registration and voting processes. The requirement \nthat states allow registration by mail has undermined confidence that \nonly qualified voters are registering to vote and only registering \nonce: states should be allowed to decide whether to allow mail-in \nregistrations. In addition, states should be allowed to require proof \nof citizenship when registering and proof of identification when \nvoting: we require a photo ID to buy beer or cigarettes and can \ncertainly allow states to protect the voting process by requiring a \nphoto ID.\n  Lastly, this bill would allow states to purge inactive voters and to \nallow state law to govern whether voters who move without reregistering \nshould be allowed to vote.\n  These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan \nfashion. Attached to this statement is a section by section review of \nthe legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nmeaningful campaign reform, by looking at reform beyond the usual sound \nbites and addressing the real problems with our present campaign \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Constitutional and Effective Reform of Campaigns Act--Section-by-\n                                Section\n\n\n              TITLE I--ENHANCEMENT OF CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT\n\n       Section 101: Prohibits those ineligible to vote (non-\n     citizens, minors, felons) from making contributions (`hard \n     money') or donations (`soft money').

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to improve \ncrop insurance coverage and administration, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   crop insurance equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, in introducing the Crop \nInsurance Equity Act of 1999 to reform the federal crop insurance \nprogram. The other cosponsors of the bill are: Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Robb, and Mr. \nHutchinson.\n       The Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999 is based on several \n     principles. First, we do not believe that the crop insurance \n     program should be the next iteration of a farm bill. \n     Therefore, this bill maintains the current policy with regard \n     to federal subsidy for revenue insurance products.\n       We developed this bill with the intent of addressing the \n     reasons farmers in our states have found crop insurance to be \n     impractical. We believe that farmers from Washington to \n     Florida and Maine to California will find this bill worthy of \n     their support.\n       Our bill establishes a process under which the current \n     rates and rating methods and procedures will be re-evaluated \n     by USDA to examine factors not currently considered. This may \n     lower crop insurance rates for some commodities. However, \n     because all current rating methodologies are actuarially \n     sound, if the re-evaluation would result in an increased \n     rate, the current method must remain in place.\n       This bill also establishes a fixed percentage as the \n     federal contribution to a farmer's crop insurance premium. \n     Current law provides higher contributions for lower levels of \n     coverage. This bill would treat all farmers fairly.\n       We believe that one of the simplest ways to make crop \n     insurance more attractive is to make it operate more like \n     other common forms of insurance, such as homeowners or auto \n     insurance. This bill establishes a process of discounts and a \n     menu of policy options from which farmers can choose. These \n     include discounts for coverage of larger, less risky units of \n     production, employment of technologically advanced \n     agricultural management practices, and the reinstatement of \n     good experience discounts. In addition, farmers will be able \n     to choose whether to purchase specific coverages for \n     prevented planting, quality losses, and cost of production \n     coverage.\n       Mr. President, this bill raises the basic coverage level \n     for the lowest crop insurance unit--catastrophic coverage--so \n     that all farmers will benefit from this legislation. For the \n     same minimal fee as established in current law, this bill \n     will provide catastrophic coverage for sixty percent of a \n     farmer's historical production at seventy percent of the \n     market price.\n       Our bill also makes other important changes to the program. \n     It protects new farmers or those who rent new land or produce \n     new crops by ensuring they are assigned a fair yield until \n     they generate adequate actual production data.\n  The legislation improves the management and oversight of the crop \ninsurance program by establishing the Farm Service Agency as the sole \nagency for acreage and yield record keeping within USDA. It \nrestructures the board of directors of the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation to include more farmers, and establishes a new office to \nwork with private sector companies who develop new crop insurance \nproducts.\n  One of the major complaints that I have heard about crop insurance is \nthe abuse and fraud that exists in the current program. To address this \ncomplaint, our bill also improves the monitoring of agents and \nadjusters to combat fraud, and strengthens the penalties available to \nUSDA for companies, agents, and producers who engage in fraudulent \nactivities.\n  I believe that we have developed a sound proposal which Senators will \nfind good reason to support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of \nthe legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ensures that producers have \n     the ability to reduce premium cost by giving them the option \n     whether to choose prevented planting coverage for a \n     commodity. Ensures that prevented planting coverage offered \n     under the crop insurance program is equivalent among all \n     commodities. Also eliminates current ``black dirt'' \n     requirement by allowing producers who are prevented from \n     planting their insured commodity to receive the prevented \n     planting indemnity but still plant another, uninsured crop on \n     the same acreage without penalty. Amendment ensures that \n     productive crop land is not idled because of crop insurance \n     requirement.\n       Sec. 102--Alternative Rating Methodologies. The preliminary \n     conclusions from a review of current rating methodologies \n     indicates that many of FCIC's rates and rating procedures \n     need to be changed. The bill directs FCIC to develop and \n     implement alternative methodologies for rating insurance\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\n     plans by September 30, 2000, that takes into account (1) \n     producers that elect not to participate in the Federal crop \n     insurance program, and (2) producers that elect only to \n     obtain catastrophic coverage. FCIC is also directed to review \n     and make adjustments to methodologies and rates by the 2001 \n     crop year, based on expected future losses (adjusted to \n     correct for adverse selection and old data), program errors \n     and other factors that can cause errors in methodologies and \n     rates. The bill requires FCIC to implement the rating \n     methodologies in a manner that results in the lowest premium \n     payable by producers of a commodity in a particular \n     geographic area. Priority will be given to those commodities \n     with the lowest level of participation in buy-up coverage \n     plans.\n       Sec. 103--Quality Adjustment. Ensures that quality \n     adjustment coverage is offered as optional coverage.\n       Sec. 104--Low-risk producer pilot program. Establishes a \n     pilot program designed to encourage participation in crop \n     insurance by producers who rarely suffer insurable losses. \n     Participating producers would receive a reduction in their \n     payable premium if they incur a yield loss greater than 10%, \n     but not great enough to trigger an indemnity.\n       Sec. 105--Catastrophic risk protection. Increases the \n     coverage level for catastrophic coverage to 60% of APH at 70% \n     of the price. Other parts of the bill address excessive \n     underwriting gains and unearned loss adjustment expenses \n     being generated as a result of CAT coverages.\n       Sec. 106--Loss adjustment. Reduces the fees for loss \n     adjustments with respect to catastrophic coverage.\n       Sec. 107--Cost of production plans of insurance. Provides \n     permanent authority for the Federal Crop Insurance \n     Corporation to provide cost of production and revenue \n     insurance coverage.\n       Sec. 108--Discounts. The bill requires FCIC to reinstate \n     good experience discounts and to provide discounts for \n     production practices that reduce the risk of loss and for \n     insurance that is issued on larger, more cost-effective \n     insurable units.\n       Sec. 109--Adjustment to Subsidy Levels. The bill provides \n     for 50% subsidization of all levels of buy-up coverage.\n       Sec. 110--Sales Closing Dates.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, to introduce the Crop \nInsurance Equity Act of 1999. We believe this bill makes fundamental \nchanges to the existing Federal Crop Insurance Program that are \nnecessary to make crop insurance more workable and affordable for \nproducers across the country.\n  As we all know, the government's role in farm programs has changed. \nThe 1996 Farm Bill phased out traditional support for our farmers, and \ncurrent farm programs require producers to assume more risk than ever \nbefore. Due to the Ag economic crisis, there has been much discussion \nlately on the issue of the ``safety net'' for our nation's producers. \nOn that point I would like to be perfectly clear. Crop insurance is a \nrisk management tool to help producers guard against yield loss. It was \nnot created and was never intended to be the end all be all solution \nfor the income needs of our nation's producers. As the crop insurance \nreform debate proceeds, I am hopeful that my colleagues will be \ncognizant of the various needs in the agriculture community and \nrecognize that while crop insurance is an important part of the \n``safety net,'' it is not and should not be the only income guard for \nour nation's farmers.\n  Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc disaster program \nfor years because it is not the most efficient way of helping our \nfarmers who suffer yield losses. Senator Cochran and I have been \nworking over the last few months with individuals involved in crop \ninsurance delivery, major commodity organizations, and most \nimportantly, farmers, to craft a comprehensive bill that addresses the \nvarious reform needs of the crop insurance program. We feel that this \nlegislation takes a significant step toward providing a crop insurance \nprogram that is equitable, affordable, and effective.\n  In response to the outcry we have heard from producers in Arkansas, \nMississippi, and across the nation, we have attempted to make the crop \ninsurance program more cost effective for our farmers. In Arkansas, the \nlast estimates I heard indicated that 1% of our cotton producers were \nparticipating in the buy-up program this year. Buy-up coverage for all \ncommodities in Akansas historically is around 12%. That tells me that \nproducers at home don't think that crop insurance is currently \nproviding the kind of help they need. Our bill establishes a process \nfor re-evaluating crop insurance rates for all crops and for lowering \nthose rates if warranted. By making the crop insurance program more \naffordable, additional producers will be encouraged to participate in \nthe program and protect themselves against the unforeseeable factors \nthat will be working against them once they put a crop into the ground.\n  This legislation directs USDA to establish ``good experience'' \npremium discounts for producers who have not filed claims in the last \nyears. This simply makes sense. If you have car insurance and you \nhaven't had a wreck or a ticket over a significant period of time, then \nyour premium is reduced. Crop insurance should not be any different.\n  The bill also provides for a more equitable subsidy method by setting \nthe subsidy for crop insurance premiums at a flat rate, regardless of \nthe level of coverage a producer purchases. Current law provides higher \nlevels of federal subsidy to producers who purchase the lowest levels \nof coverage.\n  In an attempt to improve the record keeping process within USDA, this \nlegislation establishes the Farm Service Agency (FSA) as the central \nrepository for all acreage and yield record keeping. Current USDA \nrecord keeping, split between FSA and RMA, is redundant and \ninsufficient. By including\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\nboth crop insurance program participants and non-program participants \nin the process, we hope to enhance the agricultural data held by the \nagency and make acreage and yield reporting less of a hassle for \nalready overburdened producers.\n  In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with state \nFSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a state. The need \nfor this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice \nproducers this spring. A private insurance policy was offered to \nfarmers at one rate, only to have the company reduce the rate once the \namount of potential exposure was realized. In my discussions with \nvarious executives from the company on this issue it became apparent \nthat their knowledge of the rice industry was fairly minimal. Had they \nconsulted with local FSA committees who had a working knowledge of the \nrice industry before introduction of the policy, the train wreck that \noccurred might have been stopped in its tracks.\n  Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have \nbeen addressed in previous reform measures, however, fraud and abuses \nare still present to some degree. This bill strengthens the monitoring \nof agents and adjusters to combat fraud and enhances the penalties \navailable to USDA for companies, agents and producers who engage in \nfraudulent activities. There is simply no room for bad actors that \nrecklessly cost the taxpayers money.\n  While this bill was crafted with the input of producers from Arkansas \nand Mississippi, there is no preferential treatment toward any \ncommodity or geographic region. We have attempted to include provisions \nthat will make the crop insurance program more effective across the \nnation. We hope that we have achieved this goal and look forward to \nworking with our colleagues to address any measures that will make the \ncrop insurance reform effort more effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for \nthis bill be included in the Record from the following commodity \norganizations: The National Cotton Council, USA Rice Federation, \nAmerican Sugar Cane League, the Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, and \nthe Alabama Farmers Federation.\n  These organizations have been very helpful in the crafting of this \nbill and we certainly appreciate the input they have provided.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        American Sugar Cane League\n\n\n                                           of the U.S.A., Inc.\n\n                                      Thibodaux, La, May 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Cochran and Lincoln: On behalf of the \n     American Sugar Cane League of the U.S.A., Inc., which \n     represents the entire sugar producing and processing industry \n     in the state of Louisiana, I offer to you our full support of \n     your efforts to improve crop insurance with the introduction \n     of the Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999. Agriculture in this \n     great country has been in a crisis mode for the last several \n     years and the federal crop insurance program, as it is \n     presently structured, is of limited or no utility to our \n     growers.\n       In particular, we are pleased with the language which \n     directs the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to \n     review the rating methodologies, giving high priority to \n     those commodities with the lowest level of participation. Due \n     to the inherent problems with the program, as presently \n     structured, sugarcane growers in Louisiana have not \n     considered crop insurance an affordable or viable management \n     tool. Again, it is with great enthusiasm that we support this \n     bill which we hope will benefit the entire agricultural \n     community and our industry, and allow us the opportunity to \n     have available to us a viable risk management tool that is \n     affordable.\n       We appreciate tremendously your initiative with this bill \n     language which seeks to make crop insurance more useful for \n     southern commodities. The Louisiana sugarcane industry will \n     continue to review the reasons that crop insurance has not \n     worked thus far and would like to reserve the option to make \n     additional suggestions to you as the process moves forward. \n     Thanks again for taking on a challenge that stands to give \n     American agriculture what the rest of the manufacturing and \n     business community of this country has always had, a viable \n     and affordable risk management tool.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              Charles J. Melancon,\n     President and General Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           National Cotton Council of America,\n\n                                                     May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cochran and Lincoln: On behalf of the \n     National Cotton Council, I would like to convey our sincere \n     appreciation and strong support for your efforts to improve \n     the Federal crop insurance program. The legislation that you \n     are about to introduce, The Crop Insurance Equity Act of \n     1999, makes many needed changes to the program, improves \n     compliance, and should increase participation as well.\n       The profitability crisis we are experiencing in American \n     agriculture and the policy direction we have chosen on farm \n     programs has greatly increased the cotton industry's interest \n     in more sound risk management tools to help weather the tough \n     times. Your legislation takes a very comprehensive approach \n     towards improving the current system. We are especially \n     pleased with your provisions that will result in a reformed \n     rating process, significantly improved record keeping \n     requirements through the Farm Service Agency, equitable \n     prevented planting coverage for all crops, and a streamlined \n     private product approval process.\n       Finally, we appreciate the efforts of Hunt Shipman and Ben \n     Noble on your staffs who worked tirelessly with the cotton \n     industry to include provisions that would make the program \n     more equitable for all commodities. They are both an asset to \n     your offices.\n       Thank you again for your efforts and all you do to help the \n     cotton industry. We look forward to working with you any way \n     we can to insure passage of your bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ron Rayer,\n       President, National Cotton Council,\n     Allen Helms,\n       Chairman, American Cotton Producers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          USA Rice Federation,\n\n                                                      May 19, 1999\n     Hon. Blanche Lambert Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of the USA Rice Federation, \n     which represents producers of over 80 percent of America's \n     rice crop and virtually all U.S. rice millers, I would like \n     to express our appreciation for the leadership that you and \n     Senator Cochran have provided on the issue of reforming \n     Federal crop insurance. Specifically, we want to express our \n     strong support for the Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999 \n     which represents a positive step towards addressing the \n     concerns that U.S. rice producers have had with the existing \n     crop insurance program.\n       As you probably are aware, most rice producers have \n     traditionally not participated in the Federal crop insurance \n     program because premiums have been viewed as too high \n     relative to the minimal coverage the program offers. For \n     example, during the 1998 crop year, only 43 percent of 3 \n     million acres planted to rice was covered by catastrophic \n     policies while only another 20 percent of the acreage was \n     covered by buy-up policies. In general, the low level of \n     participation by U.S. rice farmers has occurred because: CAT \n     coverage offers farmers minimal coverage and buy-up policies \n     are too expensive; serious problems exist with the actuarial \n     data used to calculate premiums and coverage; and rice \n     farmers, who traditionally experience relatively low levels \n     of yield variability, want price/revenue protection versus \n     traditional yield coverage. We believe that the Crop \n     Insurance Equity Act begins to seriously address each of \n     these three major issues.\n       Again, Senator Lincoln, we want to thank you and your staff \n     for working so closely with the USA Rice Federation during \n     the development of this important bill. We are proud to \n     support this bill and look forward to working with you to \n     enact the legislation in 1999.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                A. Ellen Terpstra,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 The Redding Firm,\n\n\n                313 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, DC\n\n       We are very appreciative of Senators Cochran and Lincoln \n     taking the lead on reforming the Federal Crop Insurance \n     Program. Growers in the Southeast want sound product options \n     at a reasonable price. The Cochran-Lincoln bill moves crop \n     insurance in this direction. Disaster bills do not adequately \n     address the problems growers face in a bad crop year. Crop \n     insurance has to be reformed where growers can plan and \n     address difficult financial times.\n     Southern Peanut Farmers Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 ALFA FARMERS,\n\n                                                     May 18, 1999.\n     Senator Blanche Lincoln,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: On behalf of over 398,000 members of \n     the Alabama Farmers Federation, I am writing in support of \n     this bill which you and Senator Cochran are introducing \n     titled the Crop Insurance Equity Act of 1999. This crop \n     insurance reform bill goes a long way toward addressing the \n     inequities southern producers face under the current federal \n     crop insurance program. While producers do not want the \n     government to guarantee them a profit, real crop insurance \n     reform is needed to ensure farmers have\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\n     adequate risk management tools for years when a disaster does \n     occur.\n       We are pleased that the Crop Insurance Equity Act addresses \n     the so-called ``ratings'' issue in which southern producers \n     are unfairly penalized by a flawed rating system. As you \n     know, the current 20-year historical actuarial database being \n     used to determine probability of loss and establish premium \n     levels does not accurately reflect real risk (particularly in \n     the Southeast).\n       In addition, Alabama farmers want increased emphasis on \n     oversight by the federal government and private insurers to \n     prevent fraud. The Federation is pleased that the oversight \n     provisions were included in your bill by making crop \n     insurance more affordable for good farmers and eliminating \n     abuses by those who would take advantage of it, thereby \n     increasing producer participation.\n       The Federation is also pleased to note that your bill \n     restores the provision in law that enables producers with \n     good experience to receive premium discounts, as well as \n     eliminating ``black dirt'' and replant provisions which have \n     unfairly penalized cotton growers in the current federal crop \n     insurance program.\n       Furthermore, it is important to note that premium subsidies \n     are shifted to the higher levels of coverage in your bill, as \n     well as recognizing that your provision concerning the \n     multiple year disasters remedies the problem that producers \n     who experience multiple years of disaster currently face. \n     These provisions should make higher coverage more affordable, \n     as well as encourage greater producer participation.\n       Again, we thank you and Senator Cochran for your leadership \n     for southern agriculture, and we look forward to working \n     toward a reasonable crop insurance program that is truly a \n     risk management tool for producers of all areas of the \n     country.\n           Sincerely,\n                        G.

A bill to conserve global bear populations by prohibiting \nthe importance, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and \nitems, products, or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as \ncontaining, bear viscera, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                        the bear protection act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bear \nProtection Act. This legislation, which I sponsored in the 105th \nCongress, is aimed at eliminating the poaching of America's bears for \nprofit. As you may know, bear parts, such as gall bladders and bile, \nwhich are commonly referred to as ``viscera,'' have traditionally been \nused in myriad Asian medicines--for everything from diabetes to heart \ndisease to hangovers, and in luxury shampoos and cosmetics. Due to the \npopularity of these products containing bear viscera, Asian bear \npopulations have been decimated, causing poachers to run to American \nbears to meet the increasing demand.\n  Mr. President, the practice of poaching bears for viscera is both a \nnational and international problem. Asian and American bear populations \nare threatened by high demand for and low supply of bear parts and by \nthe black market trade in exotic and traditional medicine cures. The \nproblem is compounded by the fact that the poaching of bears for their \nviscera is a very profitable enterprise, and one in which at least 18 \nAsian countries are known to participate. In fact, bear gall bladders \nin South Korea, for instance, are worth more than their weight in gold, \nfetching a price of about $10,000 a piece.\n  Mr. President, each year, nearly 40,000 black bears are legally \nhunted in 36 States and Canada. Unfortunately, it has been estimated \nthat roughly the same number is illegally poached every year, according \nto a former chief law enforcement officer with the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service. While I am pleased to report that for the most part, \nU.S. bear populations have remained stable or are increasing, I \ncontinue to remain concerned about the threat posed by unchecked \npoaching.\n  Since 1981, State and Federal wildlife agents have conducted many \nsuccessful undercover operations to aimed at exposing the illegal \nslaughter of American bears. As recently as this past February, a group \nof State and Federal officers arrested 25 people in Virginia and \ncharged them with 112 wildlife violations including bear poaching as \npart of Operations SOUP, or ``Special Operation to Uncover Poaching.'' \nOperation SOUP is a major undercover investigation, which has been \nongoing for three years and is aimed at the trafficking of gall \nbladders and other bear parts from black bears in Virginia and \nShenandoah National Park.\n  Mr. President, I have with me two press releases from the Virginia \nDepartment of Game and Inland Fishing, as well as an article from the \nWashington Post which I would like to have placed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, as these and other news reports will attest, this \nproblem with poaching and trading bear parts must be addressed. \nAlthough many States and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are making \nefforts to combat this problem, these agencies have neither the funds \nnor the resources to adequately solve the problem. Moreover, there are \nloopholes created by a patchwork of State laws that allow these illegal \npractices to flourish. There are fourteen States in which the sale of \nbear gall bladders is legal--eight of those States limit the sale to \nviscera taken from bears in other States, and there are five States \nthat have no law in this regard. This patchwork of State laws enables \npoachers to ``launder'' the gall through the States that permit the \nsale of gall bladders. As long as a few States allow this action to go \non, poaching for profit will continue.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this is both a national and \ninternational problem--and it is a growing problem. The Convention on \nInternational Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which the United \nStates is a party, has recognized the issue of bear conservation as a \nglobal issue. In fact, CITES has noted that ``the continued illegal \ntrade is bear parts and derivatives of bear parts undermines the \neffectiveness of the Convention and that if CITES parties . . . do not \ntake action to eliminate such trade, poaching may cause declines of \nwild bears that could lead to the extirpation of certain populations or \neven species.'' The Convention goes on to say that in order to achieve \nthis goal, ``submitted and measurable action'' must be taken--this \nincludes adopting national legislation.\n  I would like to point out that members of the U.S. delegation to the \nCITES Convention contributed to the drafting of that resolution, and in \ndoing so, made a strong statement about the need to strengthen our \nnational commitment to eradicating the poaching of bears. Recently, the \nSecretariat pointed out that bear poaching is most likely to flourish \nin countries that have inconsistent internal trade, import, and export \ncontrols. In such instances where there are differences in national, \nFederal, and State laws, the Secretariat asserts that confusion and \nenforcement difficulties arise which will contribute to the \navailability of bear viscera that can become available for \ninternational trade.\n  Mr. President, in order to halt the poaching of America's bears, we \nneed to effectuate legislation that not only prohibits the import and \nexport of bear viscera, but we need to close the loopholes in State \nlaws that encourage poachers to evade the law. To effectively reduce \nthe laundering of bear viscera through the United States, all states \nmust have a minimum level of protection. We must also stop the import \nand export of bear viscera, so that we can shut off the international \ntrade before America's bear populations suffer the same fate as Asian \nbear populations.\n  The Bear Protection Act will do just that. It will establish national \nguidelines for trade in bear parts, but will not weaken any existing \nstate laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. The \noutright ban on the trade, sale or barter of bear viscera, including \nitems that claim to contain bear parts, will close the existing \nloopholes and will allow State and Federal wildlife officials to focus \ntheir limited resources on much needed conservation efforts.\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me underscore that my bill would in no way \ninfringe on the rights of hunters to legally hunt bears. These \nsportsmen would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears \nkilled during legal hunts.\n  The Bear Protection Act will also bolster America's efforts to \ncurtail the international bear trade by directing the Secretaries of \nthe Interior and State, as well as the United States Trade \nRepresentative to establish a dialogue with the counties that share our \ninterest in conserving bear species. This, too, is an important element \nof the legislation because I believe efforts to both reduce the demand \nfor bear parts in Asia and encourage the increased usage of synthetic \nand other natural products as an alternative to beargall should be made \na priority.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we act now to protect the \nAmerican bear population. The United States must take a stand and be an \nexample to the rest of the world by prohibiting the illegal taking and \nsmuggling of American bears. If we act now, we can stop the poaching of \nbears, which left unchecked, will lead us down a path toward these \nmagnificent creatures' extinction. That is why I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this worthwhile legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of my legislation and \nadditional material to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to the printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n     bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n     panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or \n     II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249) \n     (referred to in this section as ``CITES'');\n       (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may \n     adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for \n     trade, taking, possession, or transport of species on \n     Appendix I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a \n     resolution (Conf. 10.8) urging Parties to take immediate \n     action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts \n     and derivatives;\n       (3) the Asian bear populations have declined significantly \n     in recent years, as a result of habitat loss and poaching due \n     to a strong demand for bear viscera used in traditional \n     medicines and cosmetics;\n       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n     that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n       (5) while most American black bear populations are \n     generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n     stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n     demand for bear viscera increases; and\n       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United \n     States and exportation from the United States, as well as \n     prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera \n     and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the \n     United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear \n     population as a result of the commercial trade in bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term \n     viability of the world's 8 bear species by--\n       (1) prohibiting international trade in bear viscera and \n     products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, \n     bear viscera;\n       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to \n     eliminate such trade; and\n       (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with \n     respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products \n     containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear \n     viscera.\n\n     SEC. 4.

REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary, in cooperation with appropriate State \n     agencies, shall submit to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Resources of \n     the House of Representatives a report detailing the progress \n     of efforts to end the illegal trade in bear viscera.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [From the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Jan. 18, \n                                 1999]\n\n           Joint Effort Tackles Poachers, Illegal Bear Trade\n\n       Luray, Virginia.--Earlier today, nearly 100 state and \n     federal officers arrested almost three dozen defendants \n     charged with more than 150 state wildlife violations. \n     Officers executed approximately a dozen search warrants to \n     further the investigation into the illegal trade of bear \n     parts. The action is part of the continuing investigation \n     Operation SOUP, or Special Operation to Uncover Poaching. The \n     operation is expected to yield one of the largest \n     prosecutions in the nation's history for crimes relating to \n     bear poaching and illegal trade in bear parts. Operation SOUP \n     is a joint effort of the Virginia\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n     Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF), the National \n     Park Service, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n       Operation SOUP's three-year undercover investigation \n     involves a three-pronged approach targeting the \n     commercialization of bear parts used in the jewelry trade; \n     bear gall bladder and paw trafficking; and poaching by \n     individuals associated with specific groups suspected of \n     supplying bear parts. In addition to the arrests made today, \n     more misdemeanor and felony indictments may follow in the \n     weeks and months ahead as this joint effort identifies other \n     individuals involved in poaching and commercial trafficking \n     of bear parts. By working together, these government agencies \n     have been able to increase their manpower and resources to \n     combat the illegal sale of bear parts.\n       A major aspect of the investigation focuses on the bear \n     gall bladder trade. This worldwide market is driven by the \n     demand for its use in traditional Asian medicine. Since the \n     substantial decline of the Asian bear populations, the \n     American black bear has been targeted for this trade. One \n     bear gall bladder may sell overseas at auction for thousands \n     of dollars. Dried and ground to a fine powder it is sold by \n     the gram at a street value greater than cocaine.\n       Details of Operation SOUP will be announced at a press \n     conference to be held tomorrow, Tuesday, January 19, at 1 PM, \n     at the Shenandoah National Park administrative headquarters \n     on U.S. Route 211 east of Luray, Virginia and west of the \n     Skyline Drive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [From the Virginia Department of Game and Island Fisheries, Jan. 19, \n                                 1999]\n\n      Successful Joint Effort Tackles Poachers, Illegal Bear Trade\n\n       Luray Virginia.--On Monday, January 18, 1999, nearly 110 \n     state and federal officers arrested 25 defendants charged \n     with 112 wildlife violations, and executed 14 search warrants \n     as part of Operation SOUP, or ``Special Operation to Uncover \n     Poaching''. Operation SOUP is a major, on-going, undercover \n     investigation into illegal hunting and commercialization of \n     American black bears in Virginia and in Shenandoah National \n     Park. This three-year investigation has been a joint \n     operation of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland \n     Fisheries, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish & \n     Wildlife Service. Much of the investigation has been \n     concentrated in the Blue Ridge region of Virginia. Upon its \n     completion, Operation SOUP is expected to yield one of the \n     largest prosecutions in the nation's history for crimes \n     relating to bear poaching and illegal trade in bear parts.\n       Operation SOUP utilizes a three-pronged approach to combat \n     this criminal activity. The first has targeted the sale of \n     bear parts, mostly claws and teeth, for use in the jewelry \n     trade. Sales of intact bear paws used to make ashtrays and \n     other trinkets also fall into this category. This \n     investigation has confirmed that in Virginia there is active \n     trade in bear parts used for jewelry. Independent of \n     yesterday's arrests, over the last eight months 12 \n     individuals have been arrested and charged with 94 counts of \n     buying or selling bear parts in violation of state law.\n       The second prong of Operation SOUP has targeted trafficking \n     of gall bladders and frozen bear paws. This aspect of the \n     investigation has confirmed that significant trade in gall \n     bladders and bear paws out of Virginia exists, including from \n     bears within and around Shenandoah National Park.\n       To further this portion of the investigation, 11 federal \n     search warrants were executed in Madison and Rappanhannock \n     Counties in Virginia, and near Petersburg, West Virginia. \n     They were issued on a combination of homes, businesses and \n     vehicles. Seized were five vehicles, several freezers, and an \n     assortment of bear parts, firearms, and cash. Federal felony \n     indictments may be forthcoming in the weeks and months ahead. \n     Three arrests made on Monday have connections with \n     trafficking of bear parts. Additional details will be \n     released as they become available.\n       The third prong of Operation SOUP has targeted the poachers \n     themselves. These individuals are associated with specific \n     groups that are suspected of being a source of bear parts for \n     commercial trade. On Monday, 22 individuals were arrested and \n     charged with a total of 107 state wildlife violations. \n     Although bear may be legally taken in Virginia by legitimate \n     sportsmen, these individuals are accused of using illegal \n     hunting practices to harvest bears. Undercover investigations \n     in this portion of the operation indicated that some of these \n     individuals may also have engaged in bear poaching within \n     Shenandoah National Park where it is unlawful to hunt. This \n     is still under investigation and may result in federal \n     indictments for illegal hunting within the park being passed \n     down in the weeks or months ahead.\n       At the heart of Operation SOUP are concerns about an \n     international problem that has a toehold in Virginia. The \n     bear gall bladder trade is a worldwide industry driven by the \n     demand for its use in traditional Asian medicine. Many people \n     from Asian cultures believe bear parts, particularly the gall \n     bladder, have medicinal value for treating and preventing a \n     variety of ailments. A single gall bladder can be sold at \n     auction overseas for thousands of dollars. Dried, ground and \n     sold by the gram, bear gall bladders have a street value \n     greater than cocaine. In this operation, 300 gall bladders \n     were purchased or seized with an estimated U.S. value of \n     $75,000 and an international value of more than $3 million \n     dollars. Bear paws also have high commercial value. Bear paws \n     are purchased as an ingredient in Bear Paw Soup, considered a \n     delicacy in some ethnic Asian restaurants. A single bowl of \n     this soup can sell for hundreds of dollars overseas. The \n     serious decline in the Asian black bear population has lead \n     to the American black bear being targeted for this trade. The \n     government agencies behind Operation SOUP are deeply \n     concerned about these activities and will continue to \n     investigate illegal bear poaching and trafficking of bear \n     parts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 16, 1999]\n\n               Bear Poaching on Rise on Shenandoah Region\n\n                     (By Maria Glod and Leef Smith)\n\n       It was early January when the call came in on Jeffrey \n     Pascale's unlisted phone line: The goods were available. Was \n     he interested?\n       A date was set, and Pascale agreed to meet James Presgraves \n     at a roadside dinner in Stanley, Va. The deal was completed \n     several miles away at Presgrave's home, where he allegedly \n     removed an assortment of bear gallbladders from the freezer \n     and Pascale, an undercover U.S. Park Ranger, paid him $925 \n     for six of the golf ball-size organs.\n       The purchase of the bear organs was documented last month \n     in affidavits filed in U.S. District Court in Roanoke in \n     support of search warrants and signaled to the close of a \n     three-year state and federal investigation into what \n     authorities said was a highly profitable loosely organized \n     bear-poaching ring operating in Virginia's Blue Ridge \n     mountains. Instead of killing the bears just for their meat \n     and fur, officials said, poachers were harvesting the animals \n     for their paws and gallbladders, which can sell for hundreds \n     of dollars in this country and thousands of dollars in Asia.\n       No charges have been filed against Presgraves.\n       As bear populations dwindle in other parts of the world--\n     victims of excessive hunting and disappearing habitats--\n     poaching has become increasingly lucrative in North America, \n     where an estimated 400,000 bears live. Each year, hundreds of \n     bear carcasses turn up, intact except for missing \n     gallbladders, paws and claws, according to testimony given to \n     Congress.\n       Gallbladders and the green bile they store are prized in \n     Asia, where they are used in medicine to treat a variety of \n     ailments, including heart disease and hangovers. Bear paw \n     soup is considered a delicacy in some Asian cultures and is \n     sold--off the menu--in some restaurants for as much as $60 a \n     bowl, investigators say.\n       ``People are willing to pay any amount of money [for a bear \n     product] if they want it really bad,'' said Andrea Gaski of \n     the World Wildlife Fund, which monitors bear poaching.\n       While bear hunting is legal in Virginia, it is illegal, as \n     in most states, to sell the animal's body parts--including \n     gallbladders, heads, hides, claws or teeth. Bear hunting is \n     not permitted in Maryland. Last year, Congress considered, \n     but did not pass, legislation aimed at halting the trade in \n     bear organs.\n       In Virginia, hunters legally kill 600 to 900 bears each \n     hunting season. Officials say it is unclear how many more of \n     the population of about 4,000 bears are taken by poachers. In \n     the most recent investigation, law enforcement officials \n     seized about 300 gallbladders and arrested 25 people. They \n     have been charged with offenses ranging from illegally buying \n     wildlife parts, a felony, to misdemeanor hunting violations. \n     Authorities said that some of the charges stem from selling \n     jewelry made with bear claws or teeth, while others target \n     alleged traffickers in the bear organs. Officials say that \n     some of the parts sold in Virginia are hunted legally. The \n     federal investigation is continuing.\n       The state and federal investigation in Virginia began in \n     1996 when investigators began receiving tips from hunters \n     about poaching in and around Shenandoah National Park, \n     officials said.\n       Agents ultimately infiltrated the local ring, accompanying \n     poachers on hunts and posed as middlemen.\n       ``Some of those people were blatant enough that if you left \n     a business card saying, ``I want to buy gallbladders,' at a \n     hunting lodge, they would call you back,'' said Don \n     Patterson, a supervisor with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service who helped lead the investigation.\n       According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in \n     Roanoke, Pascale met six times during 1997 and 1998 with \n     Bonnie Sue and Danny Ray Baldwin at their home in \n     Sperryville, Va., to purchase bear gallbladders and paws.\n       During the course of his investigation, according to the \n     affidavit filed in support of a search warrant application, \n     the Baldwins told Pascale they had been in business for 13 \n     years, selling about 300 gallbladders annually to customers \n     in Maryland, New York and the District.\n       According to court records, the Baldwins said they obtained \n     their bear parts from several sources including hunt clubs, \n     farmers and orchards, as well as from the bears that Danny \n     Baldwin bagged by hunting or trapping.\n       No charges have been filed against the Baldwins.\n       Investigators compare the illegal trade in bear parts to \n     drug trafficking, saying the poachers typically work through \n     a middleman who delivers the gallbladders and paws to either \n     local or overseas Asian markets.\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\n       Nationwide, federal authorities have intercepted 70 \n     shipments of bear parts headed to Asian markets in the past \n     five years, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials.\n       ``If you don't watch this situation and keep your fingers \n     on the pulse, you can quickly look at it and say, `Where did \n     [the bears] all go?' '' said William Woodfin, director of the \n     Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. ``We have \n     an obligation to future generations to make sure the black \n     bear will be there for them to enjoy.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Conf. 10.8--Conservation of and Trade in Bears\n\n       Aware that all populations of bear species are included \n     either in Appendix I or Appendix II of the Convention;\n       Recognizing that bears are native to Asia, Europe, North \n     America and South America and, therefore, the issue of bear \n     conservation is a global one;\n       Noting that the continued illegal trade in parts and \n     derivatives of bear species undermines the effectiveness of \n     the Convention and that if CITES Parties and States not-party \n     do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may \n     cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the \n     extirpation of certain populations or even species;\n       Recognizing that long-term solutions for the protection and \n     conservation of bears require the adoption of substantive and \n     measurable actions;\n       The Conference of the Parties to the Convention urges all \n     Parties, particularly bear range and consuming countries, to \n     take immediate action in order to demonstrably reduce the \n     illegal trade in bear parts and derivatives by the 11th \n     meeting of the Conference of the Parties, by:\n       (a) confirming, adopting or improving their national \n     legislation to control the import and export of bear parts \n     and derivatives, ensuring that the penalties for violations \n     are sufficient to deter illegal trade;\n       (b) increasing CITES enforcement by providing additional \n     resources, nationally and internationally, for wildlife trade \n     controls;\n       (c) strengthening measures to control illegal export as \n     well as import of bear parts and derivatives;\n       (d) initiating or encouraging new national efforts in key \n     producers and consumer countries to identify, target and \n     eliminate illegal markets;\n       (e) developing international training programmes on \n     enforcement of wildlife laws for field personnel, with a \n     specific focus on bear parts and derivatives, and exchanging \n     field techniques and intelligence; and\n       (f) developing bilateral and regional agreements for \n     conservation and law enforcement efforts;\n       Recommends that all Parties review and strengthen measures, \n     where necessary, to enforce the provisions of the Convention \n     relating to specimens of species included in Appendices I and \n     II, where bear parts and derivatives are concerned;\n       Recommends further that Parties and States not-party, as a \n     matter of urgency, address the issues of illegal trade in \n     bear parts and derivatives by:\n       (a) strengthening dialogue between government agencies, \n     industry, consumer groups and conservation organizations to \n     ensure that legal trade does not provide a conduit for \n     illegal trade in parts and derivatives of Appendix-I bears \n     and to increase public awareness of CITES trade controls;\n       (b) encouraging bear range and consumer countries that are \n     not party to CITES to accede to the Convention as a matter of \n     urgency;\n       (c) providing funds for research on the status of \n     endangered bears, especially Asian species;\n       (d) working with traditional-medicine communities to reduce \n     demand for bear parts and derivatives, including the active \n     promotion of research on and use of alternatives and \n     substitutes that do not endanger other wild species; and\n       (e) developing programmes in co-operation with traditional-\n     medicine communities and conservation organizations to \n     increase public awareness and industry knowledge about the \n     conservation concerns associated with the trade in bear \n     specimens and the need for stronger domestic trade controls \n     and conservation measures; and\n       Calls upon all governments and intergovernmental \n     organizations, international aid agencies and non-\n     governmental organizations to provide, as a matter of \n     urgency, funds and other assistance to stop the illegal trade \n     in bear parts and derivatives and to ensure the survival of \n     all bear species.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 1110. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nthe National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nnational institute of biomedical imaging and engineering establishment \n                                  act\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the National \nInstitute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering Establishment Act. The \nbill would create a concentrated focus at the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) on biomedical imaging and bioengineering.\n  Imaging has been on the forefront of many of our advances in early \ndiagnosis and treatment of disease. Innovative technologies have \ngreatly reduced the need for invasive surgery and provided a remarkable \ntool for early detection of disease. Breakthroughs in imaging research \nhave direct application to advances in molecular biology and molecular \ngenetics, accelerating the development of new gene therapies and \ngenetic screening.\n  Despite the revolutionary influence of imaging on both research and \ntreatment, the NIH traditionally has not concentrated basic research \nefforts on the imaging sciences. The bill I am introducing today \nensures that research is not only focused in this important field, but \nthat its applications are disseminated across disease fields. The bill \nalso encourages information sharing among federal agencies. Many \nagencies, such as NASA, do basic imaging research. We should be \ncommitted to ensuring that all advances that have applications in our \nfight against disease are shared with our medical community.\n  I am proud of the commitment that this Congress has made to the \nNational Institutes of Health. We have demonstrated our determination \nto provide increased federal resources in the fight against disease. I \nbelieve that the establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical \nImaging and Engineering will compliment those efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Institute of \n     Biomedical Imaging and Engineering Establishment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer \n     science, informatics, and related fields is critical to \n     improving health care but is fundamentally different from the \n     research in molecular biology on which the current national \n     research institutes at the National Institutes of Health \n     (referred to in this section as the ``NIH'') are based. To \n     ensure the development of new techniques and technologies for \n     the 21st century, these disciplines therefore require an \n     identity and research home at the NIH that is independent of \n     the existing institute structure.\n       (2) Advances based on medical research promise new, more \n     effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases, but the \n     development of new, noninvasive imaging techniques for \n     earlier detection and diagnosis of disease is essential to \n     take full advantage of such new treatments and to promote the \n     general improvement of health care.\n       (3) The development of advanced genetic and molecular \n     imaging techniques is necessary to continue the current rapid \n     pace of discovery in molecular biology.\n       (4) Advances in telemedicine, and teleradiology in \n     particular, are increasingly important in the delivery of \n     high quality, reliable medical care to rural citizens and \n     other underserved populations. To fulfill the promise of \n     telemedicine and related technologies fully, a structure is \n     needed at the NIH to support basic research focused on the \n     acquisition, transmission, processing, and optimal display of \n     images.\n       (5) A number of Federal departments and agencies support \n     imaging and engineering research with potential medical \n     applications, but a central coordinating body, preferably \n     housed at the NIH, is needed to coordinate these disparate \n     efforts and facilitate the transfer of technologies with \n     medical applications.\n       (6) Several breakthrough imaging technologies, including \n     magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography \n     (CT), have been developed primarily abroad, in large part \n     because of the absence of a home at the NIH for basic \n     research in imaging and related fields. The establishment of \n     a central focus for imaging and bioengineering research at \n     the NIH would promote both scientific advance and U.S. \n     economic development.\n       (7) At a time when a consensus exists to add significant \n     resources to the NIH in coming years, it is appropriate to \n     modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure that research \n     dollars are expended more effectively and efficiently and \n     that the fields of medical science that have contributed the \n     most to the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease in \n     recent years receive appropriate emphasis.\n       (8) The establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical \n     Imaging and Engineering at the NIH would accelerate the \n     development of new technologies with clinical and research \n     applications, improve coordination and efficiency at the NIH \n     and throughout the Federal Government, reduce duplication and \n     waste, lay the foundation for a new medical\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\n     information age, promote economic development, and provide a \n     structure to train the young researchers who will make the \n     pathbreaking discoveries of the next century.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide continuing authorization for a National \nConference on Small Business, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Small Business.\n\n\n               national conference on small business act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I am \nintroducing the ``National Conference on Small Business Act.'' This \nbill is designed to create a permanent independent commission that will \ncarry-on the extraordinary work that has been accomplished by three \nWhite House Conferences on Small Business.\n  For the past 15 years, small businesses have been the fastest growing \nsector of the U.S. economy. When large businesses were restructuring \nand laying off significant numbers of workers, small businesses not \nonly filled the gap, but their growth actually caused a net increase in \nnew jobs. Today, small businesses employ 55% of all workers in the \nUnited States and they generate 50% of the gross domestic product. Were \nit not for small businesses, our country could not have experienced the \nsustained economic upsurge that has been ongoing since 1992.\n  Because small businesses play such a significant role in our economy, \nin both rural towns and bustling inner cities, I believe it is \nimportant that the Federal government sponsor a national conference \nevery four years to highlight the successes of small businesses and to \nfocus national attention on the problems that may be hindering the \nability of small businesses to start up and grow.\n  Small business ownership is, has been, and will continue to be the \ndream of millions of Americans. Countries from all over the world send \ndelegations to the United States to study why our system of small \nbusiness ownership is so successful, all the while looking for a way to \nduplicate our success in their countries. Because we see and experience \nthe successes of small businesses on a daily basis, it is easy to lose \nsight of the very special thing we have going for us in the United \nStates--where each of us can have the opportunity to own and run our \nown business.\n  The ``National Conference on Small Business Act'' is designed to \ncapture and focus our attention on small business every four years. In \nthis way, we\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nwill take the opportunity to study what is happening throughout the \nUnited States to small businesses. In one sense, the bill is designed \nto put small business on a pinnacle so we can appreciate what they have \naccomplished. At the same time, and just as important, every four years \nwe will have an opportunity to learn from small businesses in each \nstate what is not going well for them--such as, actions by the Federal \ngovernment that hinder small business growth or state and local \nregulations that are a deterrent to starting a business.\n  My bill creates an independent, bipartisan National Commission on \nSmall Business, which will be made up of 8 small business advocates and \nthe Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy. Every \nfour years, during the first year following a presidential election, \nthe President will name two National Commissioners. In the U.S. Senate \nand the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of each body will \nname two National Commissioners and the Minority Leaders will each name \none.\n  Widespread participation from small businesses in each state will \ncontribute to the work leading up to the National Conference. Under \nthe bill, the National Conference will take place one year after the \nNational Commissioners are appointed. The first act of the \nCommissioners will be to request that each Governor and each U.S. \nSenator name a small business delegate and alternate delegate from \ntheir respective states to the National Convention. Each U.S. \nRepresentative will name a small business delegate and alternative from \nhis or her Congressional district. And the President will name a \ndelegate and alternate from each state.\n\n  The small business delegates will play a major role leading up to the \nNational Conference on Small Business. There will be at least one \nmeeting of the delegates at their respective State Conferences. We will \nbe looking to the small business delegates to develop and highlight \nissues of critical concern to small businesses. The work at the state \nlevel by the small business delegates will need to be thorough and \nthoughtful to make the National Conference a success.\n  My goal will be for the small business delegates to think broadly, \nthat is, to think ``out of the box.'' Their attention should include \nbut not be restricted to the traditional issues associated with small \nbusiness concerns, such as access to capital, tax reform and regulatory \nreform. In my role as Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I \nwill urge the delegates to focus on a wide array of issues that impact \nsignificantly on small businesses, including the importance of a solid \neducation and the need for skilled, trained workers.\n  Once the small business delegates are selected, the National \nCommission on Small Business will serve as a resource to the delegates \nfor issue development and for planning the State Conferences. The \nNational Commission will have a modest staff, including an Executive \nDirector, that will work full time to make the State and National \nConferences successes. A major resource to the National Commission and \nits staff will be the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from SBA. The Chief \nCounsel and the Office of Advocacy will serve as a major resource to \nthe National Commission, and in turn, to the small business delegates, \nby providing them with both substantive background information and \nother administrative materials in support of the State and National \nConferences.\n  Mr. President, small businesses generally do not have the resources \nto maintain full time representatives to lobby our Federal government. \nThey are too busy running their businesses to devote much attention to \neducating government officials as to what is going well, what is going \npoorly, and what needs improvement for the small business community. \nThe National Conference on Small Business will give small businesses an \nopportunity every four years to make its mark on the Congress and the \nExecutive Branch. I urge each of my colleagues to review this proposal, \nand I hope they will agree to join me as cosponsors of the ``National \nConference on Small Business Act.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and the \nsection-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect children and other vulnerable \nsubpopulations from exposure to environmental pollutants, to protect \nchildren from exposure to pesticides in schools, and to provide parents \nwith information concerning toxic chemicals that pose risks to \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                children's environmental protection act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprotect children from the dangers posed by pollution and toxic \nchemicals in our environment. My Children's Environmental Protection \nAct (CEPA) is based on the understanding that children are more \nvulnerable to those dangers than adults, and require special \nprotection.\n  In fact, we know that the physiology of children and their exposure \npatterns to toxic and harmful substances differ from that of adults, \nand make them more susceptible to the dangers posed by those substances \nthan adults. Children face greater exposure to such substances because \nthey eat more food, drink more water, and breathe more air as a \npercentage of their body weight than adults. Children are also rapidly \ngrowing, and therefore physiologically more vulnerable to such \nsubstances than adults.\n  How is this understanding that children suffer higher risks from the \ndangers posed by toxic and harmful substances than adults taken into \naccount in our environmental and public health standards? Do we gather \nand consider data that specifically evaluates how those substances \naffect children?\n  If that data is lacking, do we apply extra caution when we determine \nthe amount of toxics that can be released into the air and water, the \nlevel of harmful contaminants that may be present in our drinking \nwater, or the amount of pesticides that may be present in our food?\n  In most cases, the answer to all of these questions is ``no.''\n  In fact, most of these standards are designed to protect adults \nrather than children. In most cases, we don't even have the data that \nwould allow us to measure how those substances specifically affect \nchildren. And, finally, in the face of that uncertainty, we generally \nassume that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful \nsubstances pose to our children won't hurt them.\n  We generally don't apply extra caution to take account of that \nuncertainty.\n  CEPA would change the answers to those questions from ``no'' to \n``yes.'' It would childproof our environmental laws. CEPA is based on \nthe premise that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful \nsubstances pose to our children may very well hurt them.\n  CEPA would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set \nenvironmental and public health standards to protect children. It would \nspecifically require EPA to explicitly consider the dangers that toxic \nand harmful substances pose to children when setting those standards. \nFinally, if EPA discovers that it does not have specific data that \nwould allow it to measure those dangers, EPA would be required to apply \nan additional safety factor--an additional measure of caution--to \naccount for that lack of information.\n  As work would move forward under CEPA to childproof our environmental \nstandards, CEPA would provide parents and teachers with a number of \ntools to immediately protect their children from toxic and harmful \nsubstances.\n  First, CEPA would require EPA to provide all schools and day care \ncenters that receive federal funding a copy of EPA's guide to help \nschools adopt a least toxic pest management policy. CEPA would also \nprohibit the use of dangerous pesticides--those containing known or \nprobable carcinogens, reproductive toxins, acute nerve toxins and \nendocrine disrupters--in those areas. Under CEPA, parents would also \nreceive advance notification before pesticides are applied on school or \nday care center grounds.\n  Second, CEPA would expand the federal Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) \nto require the reporting of toxic chemical releases that may pose \nspecial risks to children. In particular, CEPA provides that releases \nof small amounts of lead, mercury, dioxin, cadmium and chromium be \nreported under TRI. These chemicals are either highly toxic, persist in \nthe environment or can accumulate in the human body over many years--\nall features which render them particularly dangerous to children.\n  Lead, for example, will seriously affect a child's development, but \nis still released into the environment through lead smelting and waste \nincineration. CEPA would then require EPA to identify other toxic \nchemicals that may present special risks to children, and to provide \nthat releases of those chemicals be reported under TRI.\n  Finally, CEPA would direct EPA to create a list of recommended safer-\nfor-children products that minimize potential risks to children. CEPA \nwould also require EPA to create a family right-to-know information kit \nthat would include practical suggestions to help parents reduce their \nchildren's exposure to toxic and harmful substances in the environment.\n  My CEPA bill is based on the premise that what we don't know about \nthe dangers toxic and harmful substances pose to our children may very \nwell hurt them. It would require EPA to apply caution in the face of \nthat uncertainty. And, ultimately, it would childproof our \nenvironmental laws to ensure that those laws protect the most \nvulnerable among us--our children.\n  I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to \nensure the passage of my legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER \n                   VULNERABLE SUBPOPULATIONS.\n\n       The Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et. seq.) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n ``TITLE V--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER VULNERABLE \n                             SUBPOPULATIONS\n\n     ``SEC. 501. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) the protection of public health and safety depends on \n     individuals and government officials being aware of the \n     pollution dangers that exist in their homes, schools, and \n     communities, and whether those dangers present special \n     threats to the health of children and other vulnerable \n     subpopulations;\n       ``(2) children spend much of their young lives in schools \n     and day care centers, and may face significant exposure to \n     pesticides and other environmental pollutants in those \n     locations;\n       ``(3) the metabolism, physiology, and diet of children, and \n     exposure patterns of children to environmental pollutants \n     differ from those of adults and can make children more \n     susceptible than adults to the harmful effects of \n     environmental pollutants;\n       ``(4) a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences \n     that particularly considered the effects of pesticides on \n     children concluded that current approaches to assessing \n     pesticide risks typically do not consider risks to children \n     and, as a result, current standards and tolerances often fail \n     to adequately protect children;\n       ``(5) there are often insufficient data to enable the \n     Administrator, when establishing a environmental and public \n     health standard for an environmental pollutant, to evaluate \n     the special susceptibility or exposure of children to \n     environmental pollutants;\n       ``(6) when data are lacking to evaluate the special \n     susceptibility or exposure of children to an environmental \n     pollutant, the Administrator generally does not presume that \n     the environmental pollutant presents a special risk to \n     children and generally does not apply a special or additional \n     margin of safety to protect the health of children in \n     establishing an environmental or public health standard for \n     that pollutant; and\n       ``(7) safeguarding children from environmental pollutants \n     requires the systematic collection of data concerning the \n     special susceptibility and exposure of children to those \n     pollutants, and the adoption of an additional safety factor \n     of at least 10-fold in the establishment of environmental and \n     public health\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\n     standards where reliable data are not available.\n       ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n       ``(1) the public has the right to be informed about the \n     pollution dangers to which children are being exposed in \n     their homes, schools and communities, and how those dangers \n     may present special health threats to children and other \n     vulnerable subpopulations;\n       ``(2) each environmental and public health standard for an \n     environmental pollutant established by the Administrator \n     must, with an adequate margin of safety, protect children and \n     other vulnerable subpopulations;\n       ``(3) where data sufficient to evaluate the special \n     susceptibility and exposure of children (including exposure \n     in utero) to an environmental pollutant are lacking, the \n     Administrator should presume that the environmental pollutant \n     poses a special risk to children and should apply an \n     appropriate additional margin of safety of at least 10-fold \n     in establishing an environmental or public health standard \n     for that environmental pollutant;\n       ``(4) since it is difficult to identify all conceivable \n     risks and address all uncertainties associated with pesticide \n     use, the use of dangerous pesticides in schools and day care \n     centers should be eliminated; and\n       ``(5) the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department \n     of Health and Human Services (including the National \n     Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Agency for \n     Toxic Substances and Disease Registry), the National \n     Institutes of Health, and other Federal agencies should \n     support research on the short-term and long-term health \n     effects of cumulative and synergistic exposures of children \n     and other vulnerable subpopulations to environmental \n     pollutants.\n\n     ``SEC. 502.

MILOSEVIC AS A WAR CRIMINAL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Specter) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 105\n\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia (in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``International Criminal Tribunal'') has not sought \n     indictment of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for war \n     crimes committed by Yugoslav and Serbian military and \n     paramilitary forces in Bosnia;\n       Whereas Serbian military and paramilitary forces have \n     undertaken a massive ethnic cleansing campaign that has \n     displaced more than one million Kosovar Albanians;\n       Whereas Serbian military and paramilitary forces have \n     conducted a systematic effort to strip Kosovar Albanians of \n     their identity by confiscating passports, birth certificates, \n     employment records, driver's licenses, and other documents of \n     identification;\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal has collected \n     evidence of summary executions, mass detentions, torture, \n     rape, beatings, and other war crimes;\n       Whereas in 1992, the then-Secretary of State Lawrence \n     Eagleburger identified Slobodan Milosevic as a war criminal;\n       Whereas the statute governing the International Criminal \n     Tribunal requires that the office of the prosecutor need only \n     determine that a prima facie case exists in order to seek \n     indictment;\n       Whereas the House of Representatives and the Senate have \n     previously passed resolutions condemning Serbian police \n     actions in Kosovo and calling for Yugoslav leader Slobodan \n     Milosevic to be indicted for war crimes;\n       Whereas the Administration has made no public attempt to \n     urge the International Criminal Tribunal to seek an \n     indictment against Slobodan Milosevic, despite the necessity \n     of NATO air strikes to respond to his campaign of genocide: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should--\n       (1) publicly declare, as a matter of United States policy, \n     that the United States considers Slobodan Milosevic to be a \n     war criminal; and\n       (2) urge the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal \n     Tribunal to seek immediately an indictment of Slobodan \n     Milosevic for war crimes and to prosecute him to the fullest \n     extent of international law.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am today submitting a resolution that \nwill express the sense of the Senate that Slobodan Milosevic should be \ntried as a war criminal. My colleague, Senator Specter, and others, \nhave also talked about this at some length on the floor of the Senate \nin recent months.\n  It is important, given where we are with the airstrikes in Kosovo, to \nthink through this question about Slobodan Milosevic and why we are \ninvolved in an air campaign in that part of the world.\n  These are gruesome pictures, and I will only put one of these photos \non the easel. But all of these people have names and have lives and \nhave the human suffering that is visited upon them by Slobodan \nMilosevic. One million to 1.5 million people have been evicted from \ntheir homes and communities. Homes have been burned, and innocent \ncivilians have been raped and beaten. Thousands have been massacred, \nand thousands more have been packed into train cars, reminiscent of the \nJews who were hauled to the ovens by the Nazis in the 1940s.\n  This country and our allies decided we do not want history to record \nus as saying it doesn't matter. There is a moral imperative for us, \nwhere we can, when we can to take steps to stop ethnic cleansing, to \nstop the genocide, to stop someone like Slobodan Milosevic. So we \ncommenced the airstrikes.\n  The very purpose of those airstrikes is underlined by the \nunderstanding that Mr. Milosevic is committing horrible war crimes \nagainst these ethnic Albanians. They have been driven from their \nhomeland and subjected to rape, torture, and genocide at the hands of \nthe troops commanded by Mr. Milosevic.\n  The question for these children and these innocent victims is: Shall \nwe, as a country, push to have Mr. Milosevic tried in the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia?\n  The Tribunal exists for a very specific purpose. Should this country \nnot be pressing very aggressively to have this leader, Mr. Milosevic, \nindicted and convicted of war crimes?\n  We made a mistake, in my judgment, with respect to Iraq. Saddam \nHussein was never tried for war crimes. He committed many. He is one of \nthe few leaders in the world who has murdered people in his own \nhomeland with weapons of mass destruction, but we did not press for his \nconviction in an international tribunal. So now, instead of being a \nconvicted war criminal, Saddam Hussein is still in power.\n  I understand that perhaps we would not have been able to arrest him, \nbut at least in absentia evidence could be presented to say that this \nis a war criminal.\n  This monster, Slobodan Milosevic, and the despicable acts committed \nin his name by his troops, ought to persuade our country to support his \nindictment and conviction in the International Tribunal, which exists \nfor that purpose.\n  Why would we not do that? I am told that, at some point there has to \nbe a settlement to end this war, and those who are involved in the \nsettlement do not want to be negotiating with a convicted war criminal. \nThat doesn't make any sense to me. The very reason for launching the \nairstrikes was that this person and the troops under his leadership was \ncommitting unspeakable horrors against the ethnic Albanians, which, in \nmy judgment, brands him a war criminal.\n  In fact, former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who has a \nlong and distinguished career, said in 1992 that Mr. Milosevic was a \nwar criminal. And it is now 1999. Thousands have lost their lives; a \nmillion to a million and a half people have been driven from their \nhomes; and the human misery visited on innocent men, women, and \nchildren by this leader, Slobodan Milosevic, ought to persuade this \ncountry immediately to press for his indictment and conviction--\nimmediately--not tomorrow, not next week, now.\n  This country has an obligation to do that with our NATO allies.\n  I am submitting another resolution today, and the resolution is very \nsimple.\n  It says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     publicly declare as a matter of United States policy that the \n     United States considers Slobodan Milosevic to be a war \n     criminal. And we urge the chief prosecutor of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal to seek immediately an \n     indictment of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes and to \n     prosecute him to the fullest extent of international law.\n\n  We have a responsibility to do this. The failure to do this, and a \nresulting negotiated settlement at some point down the line that would \nleave Slobodan Milosevic in power, would be, in my judgment, a tragic \nmistake. In or out of power, this leader ought to be branded a war \ncriminal. Whether we apprehend him or not, he ought to be indicted and \ntried, in absentia, if necessary, with all of the evidence, including \nthe graphic pictorial evidence and all of the statements that have been \nmade by the folks who are pouring into these refugee camps.\n  I am not going to describe those statements, but last Wednesday the \nState Department released a tape verifying many of those statements. It \nbrings tears to your eyes instantly to understand the unspeakable \nhorrors that have been visited upon these people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5870-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5870-S5872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 106--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                      ENGLISH PLUS OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nSantorum, and Mr. Warner) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 106\n\n       Whereas English is the most widely used language in the \n     areas of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy, and \n     entertainment, and is the living library of the last 100 \n     years of scientific and technological advance;\n       Whereas there are more speakers of English as a second \n     language in the world\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\n     than there are native English speakers, and the large number \n     of English language schools around the world demonstrates \n     that English is as close as any language has been to becoming \n     the world's common language;\n       Whereas Spanish exploration in the New World began in 1512 \n     when Ponce de Leon explored the Florida peninsula, and \n     included the expeditions of Francisco Coronado throughout \n     California to Kansas and across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, \n     and Oklahoma from 1540 to 1542;\n       Whereas in 1998 the Nation commemorated the 400th \n     anniversary of the first Spanish Settlement of the Southwest \n     (Ohkay Yunge at San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico) with official \n     visits from Spain, parades, fiestas, masses, and other \n     celebrations to emphasize the importance of the first \n     encounters with American Indian cultures and the subsequent \n     importance of encounters with other European cultures;\n       Whereas El Paso, Texas, the first gateway for Spanish \n     explorers in the Southwest, also celebrated its \n     Quadricentennial commemorating the 400th anniversary of the \n     colonization expedition of Don Juan Onate in New Mexico and \n     Texas along the Camino Real;\n       Whereas Hispanic culture, customs, and the Spanish language \n     are a vital source of familial and individual strength;\n       Whereas the Bureau of the Census estimates that 1 in 5 \n     Americans will be of Hispanic descent by the year 2030, and \n     the future cultural, political, and economic strengths of \n     this country are clearly dependent upon our Nation's ability \n     to harness the talents and skills of this large and growing \n     segment of the American population;\n       Whereas one of the common bonds of Hispanic people is the \n     Spanish language, and promoting the use of Spanish at home \n     and in cultural affairs will benefit not only the growing \n     Hispanic population of the United States but also the \n     economic interests of the entire Nation;\n       Whereas English is the common language of the United \n     States, is important to American life and individual success, \n     and 94 percent of United States residents speak English \n     according to the 1990 decennial census;\n       Whereas immigrants to the United States have powerful \n     incentives to learn English in order to fully participate in \n     American society and the Nation's economy, and 90 percent of \n     all immigrant families become fluent in English within the \n     second generation;\n       Whereas a common language promotes unity among citizens, \n     and fosters greater communication;\n       Whereas there is a renaissance in cultural assertiveness \n     around the world, noting that the more interdependent nations \n     become economically, the more interested the nations are in \n     preserving and sharing cultural identity;\n       Whereas the reality of a global economy is an ever-present \n     international development that is fostered by international \n     trade and the creation of regional trading blocs, such as the \n     European Union, Mercosur, the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations;\n       Whereas knowledge of English, Spanish, French, Italian, \n     Russian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Korean, \n     Vietnamese, African languages, Farsi, sign language, and the \n     many other languages of the world, enhances competitiveness \n     and tremendous growth in world trade;\n       Whereas the United States is well postured for the global \n     economy and international development with the United States' \n     diverse population and rich heritage of languages from all \n     around the world;\n       Whereas many American Indian languages are indigenous to \n     the United States, and should be preserved, encouraged, and \n     utilized, as the languages were used during World War II when \n     the Navajo Code Talkers created a code that could not be \n     broken by the Japanese or the Germans;\n       Whereas it is clearly in the interest of the United States \n     to encourage educational opportunity for and the human \n     potential of all citizens, and to take steps to realize the \n     opportunity and potential;\n       Whereas a skilled labor force is crucial to the \n     competitiveness of the Nation in today's global economy, \n     foreign language skills are a tremendous resource to the \n     United States, and such foreign language skill enhances \n     American competitiveness in global markets by permitting \n     improved communication and understanding; and\n       Whereas knowledge of other languages and other cultures is \n     known to enhance the United States diplomatic efforts by \n     fostering greater communication and understanding between \n     nations, and can promote greater understanding between \n     different ethnic and racial groups within the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Government should pursue \n     policies that--\n       (1) support and encourage Americans to master the English \n     language plus other languages of the world, with special \n     emphasis on the growing importance of the Spanish language \n     for our Nation's economic and cultural relationships with \n     Mexico, Central America, and South America;\n       (2) recognize the value of the Spanish language to millions \n     of Americans of Hispanic descent, who will be the Nation's \n     largest minority by the year 2005, and will constitute one of \n     every four Americans by the year 2030;\n       (3) recognize the importance of English as the unifying \n     language of the United States, and the importance of English \n     fluency for individuals who want to succeed in American \n     society;\n       (4) recognize that command of the English language is a \n     critical component of the success and productivity of our \n     Nation's children, and should be encouraged at every age;\n       (5) recognize that a skilled labor force is crucial to \n     United States competitiveness in a global economy, and the \n     ability to speak 1 or more languages in addition to English \n     is a significant skill;\n       (6) support literacy programs, including programs designed \n     to teach English, as well as those dedicated to helping \n     Americans learn and maintain other languages in addition to \n     English; and\n       (7) develop our Nation's linguistic resources by \n     encouraging citizens of the United States to learn and \n     maintain Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, \n     Arabic, Italian, Korean, Vietnamese, Farsi, African \n     languages, sign language, and the many other languages of the \n     world, in addition to English.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kennedy, McCain, Hatch, Hutchison, DeWine, Chafee, Lugar, \nAbraham, Santorum, and Warner in submitting our Senate Resolution on \n``English-Plus.'' With this resolution, we are affirming the importance \nof mastering the English language plus other languages of the world, \nsuch as Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and \nmany, many more.\n  English is the most widely used language in the world in the areas of \nfinance, trade, technology, diplomacy, and entertainment. English is \nalso the world's living library of the last 100 years of scientific and \ntechnological advances. There is no doubt that English is as close as \nany language in history to becoming the world's dominant language.\n  As Americans, we have always valued our ``melting pot'' ideal. The \nbusiness of this country is conducted in English, and there is much \npride in the ability to speak English as well as to read and write in \none's native language. Those who know English and have mastered another \nlanguage or two have a distinct advantage in a more competitive world.\n  As the son of an Italian immigrant, I can personally testify to the \nimportance of the concept of English Plus. My father did not read or \nwrite in English, yet he insisted that I learn English first and do my \nbest at speaking and writing Italian. My parents both spoke Spanish--a \nskill which they found very useful in establishing a wholesale grocery \nbusiness in Albuquerque.\n  Tens of thousands of New Mexico families still speak Spanish at home. \nSpanish remains a strong tie to their culture, music, history, and \nfolklore. After decades of being taught to learn English first, many \nthousands of New Mexico's Hispanic families also speak Spanish \nfluently.\n  In New Mexico, 1998 marked the 400th anniversary of the first \npermanent Spanish settlement near San Juan Pueblo in the Espanola \nValley. Many celebrations and educational events marked this important \nanniversary. Hispanic culture, customs, and language received much \nattention throughout New Mexico. More than a third of New Mexico's \npopulation is Hispanic, and the Spanish language and culture have a \nspecial place in our state's distinctive blend of Spanish, Anglo, and \nIndian cultures.\n  New Mexico is the only state in the United States that has a \nconstitutional requirement to use both English and Spanish in election \nmaterials and ballots.\n  In New Mexico, 37 percent of the people are Spanish-Americans or \nMexican-Americans. The term ``Hispanic Americans'' is used in our \ncountry to describe Americans whose roots are in Spain, Mexico, Puerto \nRico, Cuba, Central America, and South America. As U.S. News reported \nin the May 11, 1998, issue, ``the label Hispanic obscures the enormous \ndiversity among people who come (or whose forebears came) from \ntwo dozen countries and whose ancestry ranges from pure Spanish to \nmixtures of Spanish blood with Native American, African, German, and \nItalian, to name a few hybrids.''\n\n  U.S. News also reported that ``The number of Hispanics is increasing \nalmost four times as fast as the rest of the population, and they are \nexpected to surpass African-Americans as the largest minority group by \n2005.'' In the October 21, 1996, issue, U.S. News reported that \n``Nearly 28 million people--1 American in 10--consider themselves\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nof Hispanic origin.'' By 2050, projections are that 1 in every 4 \nAmericans will be Hispanic.\n  An article in The Economist of April 21, 1998, stresses the value of \nthe Spanish language to America's fastest growing minority group. \n``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful \nresources.''\n  In the western hemisphere, Spanish is clearly a prominent language. \nWith established and emerging markets in Mexico, Central America, and \nSouth America, the Spanish language is a key to foreign competition in \nour own hemisphere.\n  As the world economy moves into the next century, it has become clear \nthe ``domestic-only market planning'' has been replaced by the era of \ninternational trade agreements and the creation of regional trading \nblocs. In 1996, the total volume of trade with Mexico was estimated at \n$130 billion. Our trade with the rest of Latin America that same year \nwas $101 billion.\n  Spanish is clearly a growing cultural and economic force in our \nhemisphere. It is also the common language of hundreds of millions of \npeople. Recent economic trends of this decade show Latin America as the \nmost promising future market for American goods and services.\n  With Latin America as the next great market partner of the United \nStates, those Americans who know both English and Spanish will have \nmany new grand opportunities. Mexico's recently hired and celebrated \nits one-millioneth maquiladora worker in international manufacturing \nplants along our border. This milestone event unquestionably shows the \nvalue of knowing two languages as manufacturing expands among the \nhundreds of Fortune 500 companies now manufacturing in Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I have long believed that New Mexico and other border \nstates are uniquely poised to create the focal point of North American \ntrade with South America. I agree with The Economist observation that \n``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful \nresources.'' I predict that English Plus Spanish will be one of the \nmajor marketable skills for the next century.\n  In conclusion, I would like my colleagues to see the value of \n``English Plus'' Spanish in our own hemisphere. ``English Plus'' and \nother European languages has long been a shared value, and ``English \nPlus'' African and Asian languages have become very important also. In \nevery corner of the world, foreign languages matter to us for cultural, \neconomic, and security reasons.\n  Worldwide, we see a renaissance in cultural assertiveness where \ncountries take greater interest in preserving and sharing their own \ncultural identities. As nations grow more interdependent economically, \nthere is a parallel interest in maintaining their own cultural \nintegrity, with language as a key linchpin of cultural identity.\n  Mr. President, our nation's potential markets in Mexico, Central \nAmerica, and South America alone spell a vital future for ``English \nPlus'' Spanish. If we want to continue to expand our nations's cultural \nand economic American influence in the world, then we urge the adoption \nof ``English Plus'' as our national policy. We believe this approach \nwill lead to a more prosperous and secure world.\n  We believe we should not isolate America to English only and to do \nthat would be a big mistake. The Senate resolution I am speaking of \nsupports and encourages Americans to master English first and English \nplus other languages. We believe we should add to that, but not English \nonly. We see English plus other languages as a more sensible statement \nof our national policy. Our Nation is rich in resources. We want to \nencourage American citizens to learn other prominent languages that the \nworld uses and that we must use in the world and that many in our \ncountry use as part of their cultural background.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our resolution regarding \nEnglish plus other languages be printed in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5872-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5872-S5876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 107--TO ESTABLISH A SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHINESE \n                               ESPIONAGE\n\n  Mr. SMITH (of New Hampshire) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today just as the \nCox report is about to enter the public domain. This report--a \nbipartisan report by Congressman Chris Cox of California and \nCongressman Norman Dicks of Washington--will go to an issue of great \nimportance to the United States; it is the issue of Chinese espionage \nin the United States.\n  I am rising on the Senate floor today to introduce legislation--which \nI will do at the conclusion of my remarks--establishing a bipartisan \nselect committee to examine Chinese espionage against United States \nnational security interests, responding to what is increasingly being \nviewed as the greatest security breach against the United States in our \nhistory--the loss to China of our most sensitive nuclear warhead data \nover many years from the Los Alamos National Lab, and from other \nnational security facilities and programs.\n  Through no one's fault, and with the best of intentions, \ncongressional efforts to examine this matter have been disjointed and \ninconsistent. I respect every Senator on both sides of the aisle who \nhas been working and doing their best to try to get to the bottom of \nthis, especially the chairmen of those committees with some claim to \njurisdiction over the Labs and over this whole issue of Chinese \nespionage.\n  Unfortunately, that is the problem. There are too many individuals \nconducting too many independent investigations, if you will, and too \nmany committees going down the same path. The result has been a \nduplication of witnesses, many of whom have come back and testified \nfour or five times before the Senate. I don't think this makes a lot of \nsense.\n  I think my colleagues on these respective committees--and I chair a \nsubcommittee on the Armed Services Committee with direct jurisdiction \nover this matter, so I say that as one who would be involved in such an \ninvestigation--will agree that there is too much duplication. We need \nto streamline this effort and we need to put the full weight of the \nSenate behind it. That means an investigation, a true investigation, \nthe power to call witnesses and administer oaths, and a unified focus \nof our shared bipartisan concern.\n  I have had the privilege to serve on two such bipartisan committees. \nOne, the Senate Ethics Committee, is a nonpartisan committee, really, \nof three members from each party. We look at all the matters before us \nin a truly nonpartisan way. That is exactly what needs to be done here.\n  I also served on the Senate Select Committee on POWs and MIAs a few \nyears ago, where Senator John Kerry was the chairman and I was vice \nchairman. It was a bipartisan effort. That is what it is going to take \nin the Senate, just as the House has been well-served by its committee \nchaired by Congressman Cox of California and Congressman Dicks of \nWashington. It was a bipartisan effort and it has come to a \nbipartisan--and unanimous--conclusion.\n  We need to do this in the Senate. We need to take what was in that \nreport, review it carefully, find out where it leads, and take \nappropriate action. But I do not think we are going to accomplish that \nif we are going to have all of these witnesses called in five, six, \nseven, or eight times before all these different committees, and not \nhave one consistent message. It will waste a lot of money and time. I \nthink it is better to consolidate, which is why I am calling for a \nselect committee.\n  I am not interested in scoring partisan points here. This is concerns \nthe national security of the United States of America. No partisan \npoints were scored in the classified presentation I attended the other \nday with Congressman Dicks and Congressman Cox. It was presented in a \nway that I felt was truly bipartisan. Members of both parties were \nthere. It is a lot bigger than that. The national security of the \nUnited States is a lot more important than any of the partisan attacks. \nWe all want answers. We deserve answers, and we deserve to put these \nwitnesses under oath, under threat of perjury, and to speak before the \nSenate--together, not as five or six different committees of \njurisdiction.\n  The Cox committee did heroic work in the House--much of it despite \nobstacles put in their path by the administration. They had to dig and \nclaw to get the information, and the report that will be released \ntomorrow has been blocked for several months by the administration.\n  It is time for the Senate now to do its part, to focus its collective \nconcern about these matters into a coherent and effective committee. I \nbelieve a select committee with a specific intent, with the opportunity \nto call witnesses, to put people under oath, and to have investigators \nlook into this is the correct approach. Otherwise, it is going to be \ndefused all over the Government and we are going to have all kinds of \nstories popping up from this committee and that committee, this \nsubcommittee and that subcommittee, and this Senator and that Senator, \nand it will all be disconnected.\n  So I urge colleagues to support this legislation. I urge our leaders \nto support it as well. I think it is a good idea. It has worked in the \npast when we have had serious issues like this. And our effort here is \nto gain the truth, to get the facts. I believe this select committee \nwill get the job done.\n  I want to review briefly what has happened, and why I think it is so \nimportant to have a select committee.\n  About 5 months ago, a special congressional committee investigating \nsecurity problems with China questioned whether the Department of \nEnergy had adequate safeguards to protect its nuclear secrets. On \nFebruary 1, 1999, President Clinton responded, saying safeguards were \n``adequate'' and getting better.\n  That was the statement of the President on February 1. With all due \nrespect, and being as nice about it as I can, that was not true then. \nIt is not true now.\n  One week later, on February 8, Mr. Lee failed a polygraph test. More \nthan a month later, the FBI finally searched his computer. This is not \nsomething one can take lightly. When the President says that safeguards \nwere ``adequate'' and getting better, that simply was not true.\n  Between the time the Justice Department refused the FBI's request for \na court order to search Lee's computer and Lee's firing, there were \nmore than 300 break-ins involving the computer network on which Lee had \nallegedly transferred nuclear secrets.\n  When Ho Lee was hired by Los Alamos National Laboratories in 1978, he \nfirst came under suspicion in 1982 when he made a telephone call to a \nscientist from Lawrence Livermore Lab who had been fired as a result of \nan investigation into evidence that a spy had passed neutron bomb \nsecrets to China.\n  In 1989, when Lee's 5-year security renewal was up for review, Energy \nDepartment officials learned of the FBI's inquiry into Mr. Lee. But a \nfile put together on Lee that was sent to DOE headquarters for security \nreview was ``lost.'' And it was not until 1992 that the Department \nhired an outside contractor to reconstruct the ``lost'' file.\n  In 1994, a Los Alamos employee reported to security officials that \nLee was ``embraced'' by a Chinese intelligence officer during a \ndelegation\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nvisit, and that Lee had discussed with the Chinese the nuclear weapons \ncode similar to the ones he is now suspected of stealing.\n  In 1995, the Energy Department and the CIA began to learn the record \nof China's alleged espionage.\n  In early 1995, scientists at the Los Alamos Nuclear Lab had told Mr. \nNotra Trulock, then intelligence director at the Energy Department, of \ntheir fears that China had achieved a remarkable breakthrough in its \nnuclear tests. About that same time those fears were raised, U.S. \nintelligence files showed that a Chinese agent had handed over a secret \ndocument to American officials containing evidence that China had \nstolen design data on American nuclear warheads and missiles.\n  In 1996, the CIA concluded American secrets had been stolen. Lee \nemerged in early 1996 as the FBI's ``prime suspect'' at the \nLaboratories.\n  In 1996, Mr. Trulock tried to raise warnings about espionage at the \nLaboratories but was thwarted by his superiors at the Energy \nDepartment. Trulock said he finally talked to administration officials \nas early as April of 1996. He said he met with Sandy Berger. He said \nMr. Berger had said subsequently that he briefed Mr. Clinton and took \nsteps to address the problem.\n  We are in 1996 now--3 years ago. President Clinton denied that. But I \nwill get to that in a minute.\n  Like all employees, Lee had signed a waiver permitting his e-mail and \npersonal computer to be reviewed without his knowledge. Despite the \nwaiver, the Justice Department, in 1996, decided that a court warrant \nwould be needed before his computer could be searched, and denied the \nrequest.\n  Coincidentally--or not--in 1996, President Clinton relaxed all \ncontrols on sales of advanced computers to countries like China. The \nnext year, his administration resisted congressional efforts to \nretighten those controls. The Cox committee reportedly concluded that \nsome of the computers sold to China went to organizations involved in \nmilitary activities, and they might have been used for military \npurposes--like upgrading nuclear weapons or developing more accurate \nmissiles.\n\n  When something goes to China, it does not just go to private \nindustry. It goes to the military too. Let's make sure we understand \nthat.\n  The relaxation of export controls on technology is something I have \nbeen hammering away at in my subcommittee--the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee--in the Armed Services Committee for seven years. I have \nwatched these controls relax in this administration. I have watched the \nState Department and the Defense Department and the Justice Department \nlose the fight time after time after time to the Commerce Department.\n  In 1996, President Bill Clinton shifted licensing responsibility for \nsome commercial satellite sales from the security-oriented State \nDepartment to the business-friendly Commerce Department.\n  I do not know what most Americans think about all of this, but I am \ngoing to say what I think about it. I think this is the worst breach of \nnational security in the history of the United States of America. It is \nnot just about Los Alamos, as we are going to find out tomorrow when \nthis report is declassified when we can talk about it in more detail. \nUnfortunately, I cannot talk about some of it today. But I urge \neveryone to get a copy of it and you will see what I am talking about. \nThe Rosenbergs in 1953 were executed, in my view, for less than what \nhas happened here.\n  I have seen, time after time, witness after witness from this \nadministration come before the Armed Services Committee--either taking \nthe fifth amendment, refusing to come, or fleeing the country, or lying \nunder oath, or being unable to remember. That is one thing during some \nfinancial inquiry about who gave how much money to some candidate. But \nI am going to tell you one thing. I am not going to stand for people \ncoming before the Senate--when the security of the United States of \nAmerica is at stake, when nuclear weapons have been transmitted to a \nforeign nation who is an enemy of the United States--I am not going to \nstand for people coming before this Senate and not telling the truth.\n  I will say it on the record: somebody is going to be held accountable \nfor what has happened. Somebody is going to be held accountable. Every \nnuclear weapon in the United States arsenal has been compromised--every \none of them, every warhead. I am not going to stand by and take no for \nan answer. I am not going to stand for this being obfuscated all over \nthe Senate and all over the country with defused, mixed messages. We \nwill get to the bottom of this. Nobody in this Senate should have any \nobjection to that. Whoever did this, whoever is responsible for this, \nwherever it leads, needs to be held accountable, period.\n  In 1996, the American intelligence community concluded that China had \nstolen the secret design information about the neutron bomb. In April \n1997, the FBI recommended measures to tighten security at the Labs.\n  No action was taken; no action.\n  In July 1997, Mr. Trulock, concerned about lack of progress, went \nback to the White House to ask for assistance. He gave National \nSecurity Adviser Sandy Berger a fuller briefing. Berger briefed the \nPresident of the United States as early as July 1997. Twice in 1997 the \nJustice Department rejected a request by FBI counterintelligence \nofficials to seek a search warrant authorizing more aggressive \ninvestigative techniques, including a wiretap and clandestine searches \nof homes, offices, and computers. The request for a wiretap was turned \ndown by a political appointee, Frances Townsend. A request for a \nwiretap was turned down.\n  The numbers of wiretaps authorized each year is classified, but we \nknow there are hundreds in any given year. We also know that seldom are \nmore than two or three in a given year denied. Put yourself in Frances \nTownsend's place at the Justice Department for a moment. Somebody comes \nin from the FBI and says, we have a problem. Somebody stole all the \nnuclear weapon secrets from the United States of America and sent them \nto China. We have a suspect. We need to wiretap him. And your answer \nis, no.\n  Now, I am not going to accept some feeble explanation about why that \nhappened. Somebody is going to answer that question in my presence in \nthis Senate before I leave here; I state that right now.\n  In August of 1997, FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended Mr. Lee's \naccess to classified information be cut off immediately. What happens? \nLee is still granted access to top secret warhead data despite the \nrecommendation. What is going on? This kind of thing does not happen \nunless somebody makes it happen and wants it to happen.\n  When the FBI Director says no, the answer is no. But somebody decided \nthat Mr. Freeh was not going to have the last word here. They decided \nthat Mr. Lee was going to continue to have access to top secret warhead \ndata.\n  During the 1998 congressional investigation into satellite export \ncontrols, Trulock has said, acting Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler \nordered him--I emphasize the word ``ordered,'' because I heard him say \nit in my presence--ordered him not to disclose the Chinese espionage in \ntestimony before the U.S. Congress. A political appointee in the Energy \nDepartment ordered Mr. Trulock, a subordinate, not to tell the \nCongress.\n  Now she denies it. Clearly, we need these two witnesses to come forth \nin public session before this select committee. Let the public decide \nwho is lying and who isn't.\n  Mr. Lee retained access to classified information after he came under \nsuspicion of spying, from October 1997 to October 1998.\n  On April 28, 1999, the Clinton administration finally admitted that \nsecret nuclear weapons data had been compromised. They finally admitted \nit when Bill Richardson, the new Secretary of Energy, to his \neverlasting credit pushed this issue and refused to stand for it \nanymore.\n  Wen Ho Lee was fired on March 8. His computer was not searched until \nthe following week. They found he had transferred legacy codes covering \nmany U.S. nuclear weapons from the classified to an unclassified \ncomputer system where they could be vulnerable to outsiders. In a \ncomputer search, more than 1,000 top secret weapons files had been \ndeleted after being improperly transferred from a highly secure \ncomputer system.\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\n  Those are the facts as I can outline them without going into \nclassified materials. I point out in the framework of the last 4 or 5 \nmonths, this information has been withheld from the public. Certain \nSenators and Congressmen, if they took it upon themselves, could get a \nbriefing on the Cox report, but it was not allowed to be released.\n  What happened? What did the President know and when did he know it? \nThat sounds familiar.\n  March 19, 1999, at a press conference, the President assured the \npublic, ``There has been no espionage at the Labs since I've been \nPresident.'' Let me repeat that: ``There has been no espionage at the \nLabs since I've been President.''\n  And, ``No one reported to me that they suspect that such a thing has \noccurred.''\n  The President, in March of this year, March 19, says, ``There has \nbeen no espionage at the Labs since I've been President,'' and, ``No \none reported to me that they suspect that such a thing has occurred.''\n  Mr. Berger told the Cox Committee he didn't speak with the President \nabout Chinese spying for at least a year, but he did say he did it in \nearly 1998. Berger's aides now say he remembers informing Clinton in \nJuly of 1997.\n  Mr. President, this is serious business. When atomic secrets in 1953 \nwere passed to the Russians, a man and a woman--a husband and a wife--\nwere executed. We have got to get to the bottom of this. Any Senator \nworth his or her salt, regardless of political party, ought to be ready \nto go on this with no nonsense.\n  We are not going to accept ridiculous ``I don't remember'' answers \nanymore. I do not want to hear any of this. And I do not want to be \nbound by some committee rule where I have 5 minutes to ask a question, \nand the witness answers for 4\\1/2\\ minutes, and I cannot ask any more. \nI want the time to ask my questions. I want the time for every Senator \nto ask these questions on behalf of the American people.\n  I have never in my life seen anything like the witnesses they have \nparaded before the committees of this Congress that I have been a party \nto--Government Affairs Committee investigations, the Armed Services \nCommittee--time and time and time again, saying ``I don't remember, I \ncan't recall.''\n  That is not good enough. That does not cut it. And it does not cut it \non the part of the President of the United States, either. He should \nhave been up here testifying during his impeachment trial. By golly, if \nwe have to have him come up here and testify on this, then bring him up \nhere. This is the national security of the United States we are talking \nabout. This is classified, nuclear, codeword-level information that has \nbeen passed, and the President needs to tell us what he knows, if he \nknows anything.\n\n  According to the New York Times, what counterintelligence experts \ntold senior Clinton administration officials in November of 1998 is \nthat China poses an acute intelligence threat to the weapons labs--an \nacute intelligence threat to the weapons labs. We now know the \nPresident had been briefed in November of 1998 about FBI and CIA \nsuspicions, and in January had even received the secret Cox report \ndetailing those security lapses during the Clinton watch.\n  What is going on here? All right, so he does not tell us the truth \nabout Monica Lewinsky. But this is national security. According to Mr. \nBerger, his own National Security Adviser, President Clinton was told \nabout the problems at the weapons labs in July of 1997 or February of \n1998.\n  On May 9, 1999, Tim Russert, on ``Meet The Press,'' extracted from \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson the acknowledgment that President \nClinton was ``fully, fully briefed,'' an admission for which, news \nreports say, Richardson was savaged by Clinton aides.\n  Here is the explanation. Clinton put in ``at the labs'' and ``against \nthe labs'' because we technically don't know if the stolen info came \nfrom the labs or somewhere else. Richardson also said, ``there have \nbeen damaging security leaks. The Chinese have obtained damaging \ninformation during past administrations and the current \nadministration.''\n  Perhaps this spying started in previous administrations, but this \nadministration knew it was going on and did not respond to it. That \njust does not cut it. This is not about ``what is is.'' This is about \nthe security of the United States of America.\n  On May 23, 1999, the deputy intelligence director at the Department \nof Energy suggested the White House was informed about China's theft of \nUnited States nuclear secrets much sooner than it has acknowledged.\n  The inaction from this administration did not come in a vacuum. It \ncame in the thick of a 1996 reelection effort that we now know included \ncampaign contributions from those with ties to the Chinese Government, \nties to the military, and ties to the intelligence organization. Mr. \nBerger first briefed in April of 1996, and not until 2 years later does \nthe White House move to tighten security after receiving more detailed \nevidence in 1997. NSC sought a narrowly focused CIA report to cast \ndoubt on Energy Department claims.\n  At the same time the FBI and CIA were investigating the source of the \nLos Alamos leak, Vice President Al Gore was passing the hat among \nwealthy Buddhist nuns, the President was serving coffee at the White \nHouse to PLA arms dealer Wang Jun, and the administration responded \nfavorably to a request from the man who would be the Democratic Party's \nlargest single donor in 1996, Loral chairman Bernard Schwartz, to \ntransfer authority over licensing of satellite technology from the \nState Department to the Commerce Department. Two years later, Loral \nwould be granted a Presidential waiver to export its technology to \nChina, even though it was under criminal investigation by the Justice \nDepartment for previous technology transfers.\n  Wake up, America. Wake up. What is going on here? Who knows what? \nOfficials from those two companies, I have news for you. You are coming \nin here, and you are going to answer some questions as well.\n  In April of 1996, Energy Department officials informed Mr. Berger \nthat Trulock had uncovered evidence which showed that China had learned \nhow to miniaturize nuclear bombs and it appeared the Chinese had gained \nthat knowledge through the efforts of a spy at the Los Alamos Labs. \nBerger was told the spy might still be there.\n  What action did the White House take? Absolutely nothing. But the \nwarning came at an awkward time, the verge of the 1997 Strategic \nPartnership Summit with Beijing. The administration was also facing the \ncongressional investigations into charges that the P.R.C. had illegally \nfunneled money into their 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. I do \nnot know where these dots connect or if they connect, but there were a \nlot of dots. Mr. Berger assigned an NSC staffer to look into things and \nasked the CIA to investigate. The CIA's report comes back that the \nTrulock analysis was an unsupported worst case scenario. That is not \nwhat he told us in private.\n  Finally, in February of 1998, President Clinton formally ordered the \nreforms into effect. But, curiously, Energy Secretary Federico Pena \nnever followed the order and soon after left the Cabinet.\n  Reforms were not instituted until Bill Richardson did so in October \nof 1998, 30 months after Trulock's first warning, 9 months after the \nPresident's directive. In the meantime, Assistant Secretary Moler \norders Trulock not to tell Congress because it could be used against \nPresident Clinton's China policy.\n  Do not tell Congress? If this Senate tolerates that kind of action, \nwe deserve all the criticism we get and 10 times more. We have \noversight responsibility. This area, the labs and the security of those \nlabs and those weapons, is directly under this Senator's supervision \nand oversight responsibility as the chairman of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee. I am going to tell you something; I do not accept that \nanswer. I am not going to accept that answer. Someone is going to talk, \nand whoever is accountable, in my view, if they did these things, they \nare going to go to jail, because that is where they belong. We are \ngoing to find out where this path leads, if it is the last thing I do.\n  Political contributions poured in and United States technology flowed \nout to China day after day, week after week, month after month, year \nafter year--flowed out to China, made possible by\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\nthe easing of export controls to this strategic partner of the \nPresident's.\n  We are going to hear that this is China bashing. This is not China \nbashing. This is the national security of the United States. I hope \nwhen the American people read the Cox report, they will understand that \nthe Chinese gained vital information on every nuclear warhead in our \narsenal. They now have the missile to fire it, the warhead to put on \nit, and the targeting information to direct it at any city in the \nUnited States of America--all thanks to the relaxation of export \ncontrols, and to the fact we left a spy in our labs.\n  When are we going to wake up? All through March and April of 1999, \nthe White House fought over the release and declassification of this \nreport. No wonder they do not want it released. The Cox report believes \nChina is still spying. I believe they are too. This has to be \ninvestigated.\n  In conclusion, we need a bipartisan select committee to find out \nwhere this trail leads, wherever it leads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5876-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 33--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n REGARDING THE NEED FOR VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF WAR CRIMES, GENOCIDE, \n    AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE FORMER REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.

It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States, in coordination with other United \n     Nations contributors, should provide sufficient resources for \n     an expeditious and thorough investigation of allegations of \n     the atrocities and war crimes committed in Kosovo;\n       (2) the United States, through its intelligence services, \n     should provide all possible cooperation in the gathering of \n     evidence of sufficient specificity and credibility to secure \n     the indictment of those responsible for the commission of war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in the former \n     Yugoslavia;\n       (3) where evidence warrants, indictments for war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and genocide should be issued \n     against suspects regardless of their position within the \n     Serbian leadership;\n       (4) the United States and all nations have an obligation to \n     honor arrest warrants issued by the ICTY, and the United \n     States should use all appropriate means to apprehend war \n     criminals already under indictment; and\n       (5) NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the \n     conflict in Kosovo that would bar the indictment, \n     apprehension, or prosecution of war criminals for crimes \n     conmitted during operations in Kosovo.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THOMAS (AND ENZI) AMENDMENT NO. 385\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Enzi) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the bill, S. 1059, supra; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

KIMMEL AND MAJOR GENERAL (RETIRED) \n                   WALTER C. SHORT ON RETIRED LISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel, \n     formerly serving in the grade of admiral as the Commander in \n     Chief of the United States Fleet and the Commander in Chief, \n     United States Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and \n     unassailable record throughout his career in the United \n     States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (2) The late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short, \n     formerly serving in the grade of lieutenant general as the \n     Commander of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had \n     an excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941 attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that then Admiral Kimmel and then \n     Lieutenant General Short were not provided necessary and \n     critical intelligence that was available, that foretold of \n     war with Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that \n     would have alerted them to prepare for the attack, including \n     such essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb \n     Plot message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from \n     the Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese \n     Ambassador in the United States from December 6-7, 1941, \n     known as the Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry--\n       (A) exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his \n     military decisions and the disposition of his forces at the \n     time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor were \n     proper ``by virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had \n     at hand which indicated neither the probability nor the \n     imminence of an air attack on Pearl Harbor'';\n       (B) criticized the higher command for not sharing with \n     Admiral Kimmel ``during the very critical period of 26 \n     November to 7 December 1941, important information . . . \n     regarding the Japanese situation''; and\n       (C) concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T.C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that--\n       (A) Lieutenant General Short had not been kept ``fully \n     advised of the growing tenseness of the Japanese situation \n     which indicated an increasing necessity for better \n     preparation for war'';\n       (B) detailed information and intelligence about Japanese \n     intentions and war plans were available in ``abundance'', but \n     were not shared with Lieutenant General Short's Hawaii \n     command; and\n       (C) Lieutenant General Short was not provided ``on the \n     evening of December 6th and the early morning of December \n     7th, the critical information indicating an almost immediate \n     break with Japan, though there was ample time to have \n     accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) \n     Short were denied their requests to defend themselves through \n     trial by court-martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (12) On April 27, 1954, the then Chief of Naval Personnel, \n     Admiral J.L. Holloway, Jr., recommended that Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (13) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that the late Major General \n     (retired) Short ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' \n     to advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the \n     retired list''.\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\n       (14) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel (By \n     then deceased) and recommended that the case of Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be reopened.\n       (15) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the result of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of the late \n     Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel or the late Major General \n     (retired) Short in grade, it did set forth as a conclusion of \n     the study that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster \n     should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared''.\n       (16) The Dorn Report found--\n       (A) that ``Army and Navy officials in Washington were privy \n     to intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications . . . which \n     provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war'';\n       (B) that ``the evidence of the handling of these messages \n     in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some unwarranted \n     assumptions and misestimations, limited coordination, \n     ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up \n     at higher levels''; and\n       (C) that ``together, these characteristics resulted in \n     failure . . . to appreciate fully and to convey to the \n     commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus and urgency that \n     these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (17) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation \n     and established, among other facts, that the war effort in \n     1941 was undermined by a restrictive intelligence \n     distribution policy, and the degree to which the commanders \n     of the United States forces in Hawaii were not alerted about \n     the impending attack on Hawaii was directly attributable to \n     the withholding of intelligence from then Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short.\n       (18) Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General \n     (retired) Short are the only two officers eligible for \n     advancement under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 as senior \n     World War II commanders who were excluded from the list of \n     retired officers presented for advancement on the retired \n     lists to their highest wartime ranks under that Act.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement of Rear \n     Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) Short \n     from the Navy retired list and the Army retired list, \n     respectively, serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     and is a distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor \n     toward two of the finest officers who have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (20) Major General (retired) Walter Short died on September \n     23, 1949, and Rear Admiral (retired) Husband Kimmel died on \n     May 14, 1968, without having been accorded the honor of being \n     returned to their wartime ranks as were their fellow veterans \n     of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, and \n     other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of the late Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and the late \n     Major General (retired) Short through their posthumous \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     grades.\n       (b) Request for Advancement on Retired Lists.--(1) The \n     President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. \n     Kimmel to the grade of admiral on the retired list of the \n     Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General (retired) Walter C. \n     Short to the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list \n     of the Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or otherwise modify \n     the compensation or benefits from the United States to which \n     any person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon \n     the military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel \n     performed his duties as Commander in Chief, United States \n     Pacific Fleet, competently and professionally, and, \n     therefore, the losses incurred by the United States in the \n     attacks on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other \n     targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, \n     were not a result of dereliction in the performance of those \n     duties by the then Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short \n     performed his duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian \n     Department, competently and professionally, and, therefore, \n     the losses incurred by the United States in the attacks on \n     Hickam Army Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and \n     other targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, \n     1941, were not a result of dereliction in the performance of \n     those duties by the then Lieutenant General Short.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5879-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. Billison is traveling from Window \nRock, Arizona to be the featured speaker at the May 31st Memorial Day \nobservances being conducted by VFW Post #3238 at the Ceasar Rodney High \nSchool auditorium.\n  My state--the First State, the State that started our nation--has a \nlong and proud history of celebrating the culture and accomplishments \nof Native Americans. It is only fitting, therefore, that Post Commander \nMark Newman and Memorial Day Program Director Thomas E. Weyant sought \nout Mr. Samuel Billison, once one of the select Navajo Code Talkers.\n  Each Navajo Code Talker made an invaluable personal contribution to \nthe success of our nation's effort in World War II to preserve freedom \nand democracy. What is most astonishing about this is that they were \nwilling to take on the responsibilities of democracy at a time when \nthey were not allowed to enjoy the full blessings and rights of \ndemocracy here at home.\n  Their communications contribution to World War II began in 1942 with \na small group of 29 Navajos who shared their unique and unwritten \nlanguage with the United States Marine Corps. Together they developed \nan unbreakable verbal code. By 1943, nearly 200 Navajo Code Talkers \nwere dispersed to three combat divisions of the U.S. Marine Corps. As \npart of Marine Corps signal units, they participated through 1944 in \nthe Pacific battles whose names bear witness to the honor and bravery \nof America's Marines--Bouganville, Tarawa, Cape Gloucester, the \nMarshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Peleiu.\n  As 1945 unfolded, all six divisions of the Marine Corps in the \nPacific theater were using the distinctive skills and loyal services of \napproximately 400 Navajo Code Talkers. These brave Native Americans \njoined other courageous Marines to recapture Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In \nthe first two days of the battle for Iwo Jima, Navajo Code\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nTalkers flawlessly translated over 800 messages. At the end of that \nmonth-long blood bath, it was Navajo Code Talkers who spelled out ``Mt. \nSuribachi'' as the flag was raised. By late 1945, the Navajo Code \nTalkers were serving with the occupation forces in Japan and China.\n  The historical accomplishments and story of the Navajo Code Talkers \nmust be preserved and retold for future generations. These Native \nAmerican communications experts used their native tongue to thwart the \nenemy; to expedite military operations for critical territory; and to \nsave countless lives in combat. Learning their story and repeating it \nis more than a matter of historical accuracy and completeness, or even \na matter of just recognition and gratitude. As my friend Tom Weyant \npointed out--speaking, I believe, for all Delawareans--it is also \ncritical that Americans enter the New Millennium understanding the \ncommunity ethos and deep patriotism of the Navajos who fought in World \nWar II. The Navajos saw that ``pulling together'' was a matter of \nnational survival. They gave unselfishly to defend ideals that even \ntoday, all we Americans still have not fully realized here in the \nUnited States, because the Navajos had faith that America would always \ncontinue to move toward the realization and fulfillment of those \nideals.\n  Mr. President, we in Delaware salute the Navajo Code Talkers of World \nWar II. They are unsung heroes who played a vital role in our ultimate \nsuccess in the Pacific by providing a code which the Japanese never \ncould decipher. While many knew that Native Americans faithfully served \nin the war, including Navajos, it was not until 1968 that the existence \nof this top-secret code was finally declassified and made public. Our \nentire country is indebted to Mr. Billison, to all the Navajo Code \nTalkers, and to the thousands of Native Americans from various tribes \nwho served so loyally and selflessly in both the Pacific and European \ntheaters of World War II. We must never forget the ultimate sacrifice \nthese Native Americans were willing to make at a time when they and \ntheir families were not even allowed to vote or participate in the full \nfruits of American citizenship in several states.\n  Mr. Samuel Billison, the Navajo legacy of patriotism, the Navajo \ncontribution of their unique skills, the Navajo heritage of heroism, \nand the Navajo example of love for America must be carried forward by \nus all. Your story embodies all that we Americans look for in our \nheroes today and that we revere in the rich tradition of our United \nStates Marine Corps. To you and to all who served, I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5880-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION 201 PETITION FOR THE LAMB INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to everyone's \nattention the issue of lamb imports. These imports are being sold well \nbelow the price of identical domestic products and have created a slow \nmotion, chain reaction collapse of the lamb market that continues \nthrough this day.\n  This nation's lamb industry suffers not only from the unprecedented \nsurge of imports that have flooded the domestic marketplace. It suffers \nnot only from the skyrocketing, record-setting levels that now dominate \none-third of all lamb consumed in the United States.\n  This industry also suffers from severe and consistent price \nundercutting by importers.\n  Evidence of the price disparity can be found in the report prepared \nby the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Commission made dozens \nof product-to-product comparisons. In 8 out of 10 comparisons, the \nCommission found imports undercutting domestic products by margins of \n20 percent to 40 percent.\n  Other comparisons have found disparities reaching as high as 70 \npercent. This gulf is directly related to global economic conditions. \nIn Asia, the widespread economic crash left traditional buyers unable \nto pay for new shipments of lamb meat from Australia and New Zealand--\nthose products had to go somewhere.\n  It couldn't go to the European market. The European Union has \nabsolute quotas in place to govern the amount of lamb imports into that \nmarket.\n  Instead, it came here, to the United States market. It came to a \nmarket that stands open and unprotected. To a market where the \ngovernment has done nothing, absolutely nothing, to protect its own \ndomestic industries from devastating surges of imports.\n  That surge began what amounts to a slow-motion crash of the domestic \nlamb market in the fall on 1997. Packers and processors with lamb to \nsell suddenly lost account after account to the cheaper imports. Losing \nmoney by the day, they had none to pay to their own suppliers and the \nlamb feeder level.\n  And so it went, with domestic producers hoping the surge would slow \nof its own accord. Hoping the importers would realize the devastation \nthey'd wrought. Hoping they could stay in business long enough to \nfinish upgrading equipment, or solidifying alliances--to become more \ncompetitive.\n  But the onslaught from imports was relentless. From the processors \nand packers to the feeders, the domestic market crash now reaches all \nthe way to farms and ranches that have stood for generations--an entire \nindustry teeters on the edge of financial ruin.\n  Last fall, some producers with sheep to sell couldn't find a single \nbuyer. For the second Easter/Passover season in a row, the market's \ntraditional high point and the largest holiday marketing period of the \nyear--live lambs were selling in the 60-cent per pound range. Few \nproducers in the country can remain in business at those prices.\n  Let me add my voice to those urging the President to fashion strong, \neffective import relief for the U.S. lamb industry. This relief must do \ntwo things, curb this unprecedented surge of imports and level the \nplaying field.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5880-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF EDGAR LEE NEWTON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Mr. Edgar Lee Newton. \nOn May 23, 1999, Mr. Newton will be honored upon his retirement after \n18 years as the president of the Bay City branch of the NAACP.\n  As president of the Bay City NAACP, Edgar Newton has fought many \ndifficult battles for equality and civil rights. Although his tireless \nefforts on behalf of the NAACP are worthy of recognition in their own \nright, Mr. Newton has not confined his community service to the NAACP. \nHe has also served with distinction in leadership roles with \norganizations like the American Red Cross, the United Way, Habitat for \nHumanity and the Kiwanis Club.\n  Edgar Newton's departure from the NAACP will mark a new chapter in \nhis life. I can only hope it is as successful as his civil rights \ncareer. Though I am sure he will remain active in the Bay City \ncommunity, he will enjoy spending more time with his wife Shirley and \nhis two children and grandchild. I am pleased to join his colleagues, \nfriends and family in offering my thanks for all he has done.\n  Mr. President, Edgar Newton can take pride in the many important \nachievements of his tenure with the NAACP. He has truly exhibited a \ndedication to justice and equality for all people. I know my colleagues \nwill join me in saluting his commitment to civil rights and in wishing \nhim well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5880-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5880-S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MELISSA YORK, WINNER OF JAMES MADISON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION FELLOWSHIP\n\n Mr. GORTON. Today, I would like to recognize Melissa York, a \nteacher from Tyee High School in Seatac. She has won Washington State's \n1999 James Madison Memorial Foundation Fellowship which will pay for \nher graduate school program.\n  James Madison was perhaps the hardest working and most widely \nrespected man of his day. Commonly hailed as the Father of our \nConstitution, Madison had more to do with its conception than any other \nman. He was the driving force in organizing the convention and in \nestablishing the tone and ironing out each obstacle that threatened the \nsuccess of the Constitution.\n  Because of Madison's tremendous contributions to the creation of the \nConstitution, Congress decided to establish the Memorial Foundation \nFellowship to recognize Americans who\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\nteach American history and the Constitution to our young people.\n  Each day Melissa teaches eleventh and twelfth graders about the \nConstitution and how it is used in everyday life and how it is \nreflected in our society. The future of our country depends on today's \nstudents and on their knowledge and comprehension of our Constitution \nand government.\n  She not only gives her students greater understanding of our country, \nbut she also inspires her students to achieve more through her example. \nBy continuing her own education, Melissa is showing her students that \nthe educational process should never end.\n  I applaud Melissa for her hard work and dedication to her profession \nand for her commitment to her students and to learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5881-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SALUTE TO ALEX XUE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday May 14th, MATHCOUNTS held \nits national competition in Washington, D.C.--the culmination of local \nand State competitions involving 350,000 students. It gives me great \npleasure to inform my colleagues that Alex Xue, a resident of Essex \nJunction, VT finished second in this competition and received a $6,000 \ncollege scholarship.\n  In a day and age where we are bombarded by reports of failing school \nsystems and apathetic young people, I believe it is extremely important \nto recognize Alex's tremendous accomplishment. His success is a tribute \nnot only to his own intelligence and hard work, but also to his family, \nhis teachers and his school community.\n  In addition to meeting with Alex and his MATHCOUNTS teammates on the \nSenate steps prior to the competition, by coincidence, I was on Alex's \nflight back to Vermont on the Sunday following his competition. I had a \nchance to talk with Alex and compliment him on his tremendous \nachievement. He was holding the trophy he had received and when I \nadmired it, although it was clear that he was happy with it, he was \nespecially pleased with the college scholarship. I praised him as any \nVermonter would, but I was impressed with his modesty and his pride in \nhis family and school. This is a young man who will do remarkably well \nin life and we Vermonters should be proud that he is one of us.\n  I ask that the editorial detailing Alex's achievement, which appeared \nin the Burlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 19, 1999]\n\n                            What Alex Knows\n\n       Imagine a 13-year-old boy who finished second in the nation \n     in an athletic event.\n       Vermont would know exactly how to celebrate: His parents \n     and coaches would be praised, he would be held up as a role \n     model for other kids, his community would be proud.\n       Alex Xue of Essex Junction deserves the same response, for \n     scoring second in a nationwide math contest last week.\n       This remarkable performance is a tribute to his school, \n     though schools are rarely praised these days. This success \n     requires effective instruction year upon year.\n       His award is an accolade that also belongs to his parents, \n     who support his studies. Would that more parents lavished as \n     much time on their children's academics as they do on their \n     sports.\n       The high finish is also a sign that he is a smart kid, very \n     smart, and that is worth a great deal in the life Alex and \n     his classmates have ahead of them.\n       Of course, schools cannot fix their attention solely on top \n     students, because they must serve everyone who enters their \n     doors. But they can recognize talent and reward performance, \n     because it motivates other students, and because it serves as \n     a reminder of what school is for: to learn, to strive, to \n     fail at times and gain by the experience, and to achieve.\n       For his knowledge of math, statistics, geometry and more, \n     Alex receives a $6,000 college scholarship--a fitting prize. \n     Learning offers rewards for every student, though, not just \n     the smartest, and education level is the clearest indicator \n     of a person's later wages.\n       Won't it be fun to see what becomes of Alex and his \n     abilities? Wouldn't it be something if society thought of \n     every child's potential that way?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5881-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5881-S5882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ``FRIENDS OF ROMAN LEE HRUSKA''\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask that the attached comments \nmade by the Honorable Charles Thone at the memorial service for former \nSenator Roman Lee Hruska, be printed in the Record for Monday, April \n26, 1999, immediately following my remarks entitled, ``Tribute to U.S. \nSenator Roman L. Hruska.''\n  The comments follow:\n\n                      Friends of Roman Lee Hruska\n\n       Friends all:\n       First, let me, and all of you here today, recognize two \n     special people, Millie and Carl Curtis. Sen. Curtis served \n     all 22 years with Roman, and Senator Hruska always \n     acknowledged that no U.S. Senator ever had a more caring, a \n     better and more cooperative colleague anywhere--anytime. \n     Thank you, Senator Curtis.\n\n\n                             introductions\n\n       It seems only fitting to also recognize all public \n     officials present. It is from thence, that Roman sprung. He \n     epitomized public service at its best. He lived it! He loved \n     it! He honored it!\n       He would have been pleased to know that, at the outset \n     here, all Judges, current & past, all Federal, State and \n     County officials, current and past, are asked to stand for a \n     brief silent recognition. I also want to especially recognize \n     Governor Mike Johanns; Former Governor Kay Orr and Bill; \n     Former Governor Ben Nelson, Former Governor and U.S. Senator \n     Jim Exon and Pat; former Congressman John Y. McCollister and \n     Nan; Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice John Hendry; \n     Congressman Doug Bereuter and Louise; and Congressman Lee \n     Terry. Also, a special salute to former chair of the \n     Lancaster County Board and the lifelong Douglas Theatre \n     skilled business partner of Roman, Russell Brehm of Lincoln \n     and his charming wife Louise Brehm. Also, Attorney General \n     Don Stenberg, a former Hruska staff member.\n       It was the British iconoclast, George B. Shaw who once \n     wisely opined, ``No remarks from a former Governor are all \n     that bad''--if they are short enough. Good stuff, but, in \n     remembering Roman, I'm inclined to want to cover everything, \n     filibuster a bit, if you please, and exhaust both your \n     goodwill and patience, so I'll condense best I can! He was so \n     special to me and many of you, too.\n\n\n                             his work ethic\n\n       Roman's work was always his total recreation--Oh, \n     occasionally he would superficially fish, hunt and in later \n     years, cheer the mighty Cornhuskers on to victory! Early on, \n     I must concede, he would have easily accepted the specious \n     thought that ``a quarterback was a refund on the ticket.''\n       Many here will remember genial Dean Pohlenz, the Senator's \n     long time and wonderful AA. He and I once seriously conspired \n     against Roman and another very studious and important top \n     aide to Roman, Bob Kutak. (Kutak and Harold Rock later \n     organized Kutak-Rock, a very successful national law firm \n     with which Roman proudly associated after leaving the \n     Senate.) Kutak's interest and knowledge of sports made Roman \n     look like the legendary Grantland Rice. So, Dean and I \n     decided to reserve a table for four in the Senate Dining Room \n     for Roman and Kutak, and then have two New York baseball \n     stalwarts, Casey Stengel and Yogi Berra join them for lunch, \n     ostensibly for Berra and Stengel to advise on finalizing a \n     professional sports anti-trust bill. It didn't happen, but we \n     figured that a recording of that awkward luncheon \n     conversation would have gone down in history as a sports \n     classic--of sorts.\n       Just a few Hruska vignettes:\n\n\n                            debate comrades\n\n       At Commerce High School, Roman was a star debater. His team \n     should go down as a Hall of Famer. The team was Harry Cohen, \n     a brilliant lawyer who was later President of the Nebraska \n     Bar Association; Dick Robinson, another very successful \n     lawyer, and a beloved Federal District Judge; Jerry Kutak, \n     business tycoon, President of Guarantee Life of Hammond, Ind; \n     and Roman. They stayed life-long friends and confidants and \n     what a joy it was just to see the four together visiting and \n     reminiscing.\n\n\n                              omaha roots\n\n       Roman loved Omaha, and he effectively promoted his town \n     throughout his career--he was the Senate architect of its \n     Interstate System. S.A.C. and his friend, Curtis LeMay, were \n     also tremendous beneficiaries of his Senate Appropriation \n     skills. Chuck Durham, Ed Owen, Morrie Jacobs, Art Storz, Don \n     Ross, John McCollister, Peter Kiewit, Cliff and Ann \n     Batchelder were notables as his early Omaha Betterment Co-\n     Conspirators.\n\n\n                          world-herald respect\n\n       He always thought the Omaha World-Herald was easily the \n     country's best newspaper and frequently checked in with then \n     publisher, Walt Christensen and editor, Fred Ware--and, there \n     was also a brilliant, hard working Statehouse and Douglas \n     County Court House Reporter named Harold Andersen, whom he \n     respected very much. World-Herald-wise, we wonder what ever \n     happened to Harold.\n\n\n                              family love\n\n       Family was most important to Roman. His wife and life-long \n     partner, Victoria Kuncl Hruska was simply the best. A special \n     wife and mother--and a political associate in a very \n     effective low-key way--no flim-flam, no nonsense, just \n     herself--beautiful Victoria. We last visited with able and \n     vivacious daughter, Jana at the David City Library Dedication \n     Ceremony. She has been suffering terribly with dreaded Lou \n     Gehrig's disease. Her devoted husband, Charlie Fagan, is \n     here from Maryland. Son Quentin came home several years \n     ago and carefully cared so well for\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\n     his parents. You met the ``Big Guy'', eldest son, Roman \n     Jr., earlier on this program--his wife is the former \n     MaryAnn Behlen of Columbus. Many grandchildren, nieces and \n     nephews are also here today. Ultimately, family was first \n     for Roman--as it is with all of us.\n\n\n                             the campaigner\n\n       Roman was never happier nor better showcased than when he \n     was on those early day political campaigns. Ruth and I were \n     visiting the other day about a particular stump speech he \n     once made--with a partially eaten kolache in his left hand--\n     on a Main Street corner at Schuyler during the Nebraska \n     Republican caravan. It was indeed a powerful speech, spliced \n     with Czech phrases and when he finished his remarks, the \n     audience acknowledged him as if he were truly the ``second \n     coming.'' The same result happened a couple of weeks later in \n     a Hotel Ballroom in Broken Bow where the usually very \n     reserved Sandhills crowd gave his at least a five minute \n     standing ovation on his inspiring message and brilliant \n     delivery. Oh, he could be a spell-binder deluxe, given the \n     proper occasion.\n\n\n                              a near miss\n\n       In the late 50's, a national search was on for a new leader \n     of the Republican Party. The conservative kingmakers didn't \n     publicize it, of course, but the short list came down to the \n     two U.S. Senators with safe seats, Roman Hruska and Barry M. \n     Goldwater of Arizona. Goldwater was ultimately designated \n     somewhat on geography, but mostly because they determined \n     that the TV cameras showcased Goldwater better. The rest, as \n     they say, is history.\n\n\n                           he honored the law\n\n       Most importantly, Roman Hruska's entire life revolved \n     around the law. He lived by this creed once enunciated by \n     Patrick Henry, ``Always honor the law because the law has \n     honored you.''\n       Roman spent his first two law years studying at the \n     University of Chicago Law School. Then he attended the \n     Creighton Law School from which he graduated in 1929, just \n     before the great depression hit with all its fury. He then, \n     in the next 20 or so years, built up a substantial law \n     practice, and from there was appointed to the Douglas County \n     Board. He became its energetic, successful Chairman, known \n     for his integrity and ability. He was always a prodigious \n     worker. Even his political adversaries conceded that he \n     achieved a lot the old fashioned way. He earned it.\n       Then to Congress for most of one term, then 22 years in the \n     U.S. Senate. In the Senate, he was Minority Leader Everett M. \n     Dirksen's right hand bower on the floor of the Senate. \n     Dirksen--``The billion here, and a billion there guy''--\n     called Roman his floor lawyer. Often, on major legislation, \n     Dirksen would tell his senate colleagues if they had \n     amendments, objections, or whatever--``Clear it with Roman.'' \n     Roman became a skilled practitioner of the ``art of the \n     possible'' and he closed many legislative deals for Dirksen.\n\n\n                         extraordinary service\n\n       It was as the ``Minority Leader'' of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee for almost 20 years, that Senator Hruska formally \n     and extraordinarily honored the law.\n       He worked awfully hard and most effectively, to not only \n     give fairness but structure and design to the law so it would \n     be more effective and easier to use by Federal Judges, the \n     Federal Court System and lawyers.\n       For the improvement of the rule of law, he co-sponsored the \n     Criminal Code Reform Act of 1975 and the Criminal Justice \n     Codification Revision and Reform Act of '73. For you lawyers \n     here, this was a very substantial overhaul of the entire \n     title 18 of the U.S. Code. His was the Bankruptcy Reform Act \n     of 1978.\n       He, John McClelland, John Stennis, and Jim Eastland, Senior \n     Democrat on the Committee, bonded and his working \n     relationship with the Majority Party was always just \n     something else, and highly unusual. For example, when he left \n     the Senate, he had presided or co-presided over the \n     confirmation hearings of all nine members of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court--unprecedented in history--and that was an era of \n     ``civility'' that seems to escape such modern day \n     confirmation hearings. He was the principal architect of both \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and \n     the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. In 1972 and the \n     years following, he served as Chairman of the Federal \n     Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court Appellate \n     System of the U.S. and I could go on; suffice it to say that \n     for several years, no Justice Department initiative, no \n     Federal Judgeship, no major legislation moved out of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee until it had received his careful \n     scrutiny and approval. Throughout, he honored the law, and he \n     honored the Senate as an Institution. Roman's fingerprints, \n     literally, were all over everything processed by Judiciary \n     during these years.\n\n\n                           roman was special\n\n       Let me say in closing, that we are not here for Roman, we \n     are here for us. We need this--he doesn't! Whatever comes to \n     us after the moment of our earthly death is beyond our \n     understanding.\n       So, we remain here alive, confused and disconcerted. Above \n     all, let's remember this about him:\n       Grace was in his soul, a smile and kind word were on his \n     lips and friendship was in his heart always.\n       First, last, and always, he was a gentleman.\n       These words are so true for Roman, and perhaps, just \n     perhaps, they alone might be a fitting eulogy. And, as a very \n     recent World-Herald editorial writer noted: ``The standards \n     for integrity and service that Sen. Hruska set for himself, \n     will long stand as his most fitting memorial''.\n       A quick postscript paraphrasing beautiful Ecclasiastes, \n     Chapter III, ``to everything there is a season and a time for \n     every purpose under heaven . . . A time to plant, and a time \n     to harvest, a time to be born and a time to die.''\n       Roman, you had a long and superlative life, and we're all a \n     little better because you cared and touched us.\n       In Czech--Nas Dar--Good Bye--Dear Roman . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5882-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL DAVID W.

His experience and \ndedication have helped make the Connecticut National Guard the \nexemplary organization that it is today.\n  General Gay's contributions to the state go far beyond his command of \nboth the Army and Air National Guard. His record of community service \nequals his record of military service and his participation in such \nactivities as the Nutmeg State Games and the Character Counts State \nAdvisory Board demonstrate his love for the community he calls home.\n  Even in retirement, General Gay will continue to work for the people \nof Connecticut as the state's Year 2000 Coordinator.

RES. 99\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the attached letter of \nsupport from the American Psychological Association be printed in the \nRecord in support of S. Res. 99.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                           American Psychological Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the 159,000 members and \n     affiliates of the American Psychological Association (APA), I \n     want to express support for your proposed Senate Resolution \n     that would designate November 20, 1999, as ``National \n     Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day.''\n       The APA is concerned that suicide rates among young \n     adolescents, African American males, American Indians/Alaskan \n     Natives, and the elderly have increased dramatically in \n     recent years. Since the 1950's, suicide rates among youth \n     have nearly tripled. Between 1980 and 1990, the suicide rate \n     increased by 30 percent in the 10- to 19-year-old age group. \n     Suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15- to 24-\n     year-old American Indians and Alaskan Natives. For Americans \n     age 65 and older, the suicide rate increased by nine percent \n     between 1980 and 1992 Elderly Americans comprise about 13 \n     percent of the country's population but account for about 20 \n     percent of all suicides.\n       Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United \n     States--our country is in dire need of a national effort to \n     prevent suicide. In response to that need, the Surgeon \n     General has been working with mental health advocates to \n     develop a National Strategy for the Prevention of Suicide and \n     is expected to publish a final version of the coordinated \n     strategy later this year.\n       Your proposed Senate resolution would serve to further the \n     intent of S. Res. 84, which you successfully introduced in \n     the last Congress, to recognize suicide as a national problem \n     and declare suicide prevention as a national priority. The \n     proposed resolution would acknowledge the trauma of those who \n     have suffered the loss of a loved one from suicide (suicide \n     survivors) and the support they derive from one another. \n     Their active involvement individually and through \n     organizations has been instrumental in efforts to reduce \n     suicide through research, education, and treatment programs.\n       In closing, the APA lends its support to you and other \n     members of Congress in securing passage of this resolution. \n     We also look forward to learning more about the \n     administration's initiatives at the upcoming hearing on the \n     National Strategy for the Prevention\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\n     of Suicide before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor-\n     Health and Human Services-and Education.\n           With best regards,\n\n                                     Raymond D.

GREGORY \n                                SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nstand before this body today to congratulate a truly remarkable \nMissourian, Mr. Gregory Sullivan--the Small Business Administration's \nPerson of the Year. Mr. Sullivan founded G.A. Sullivan in 1982 with \njust $300 in start-up capital. Today, it is one of the fastest growing \ntechnology companies in the nation. This custom software company has \nappeared on Inc. Magazine's 500 list of fastest growing companies for \nthe past two years. G.A. Sullivan also is leader in the St. Louis \ncommunity--ranking among the top seven fastest growing technology \ncompanies in St. Louis for the past three consecutive years.\n  In reading Greg's story, I was intrigued by his biggest challenge. To \nme it shows the remarkable risks taken by America's entrepreneurs. Ten \nyears after starting the company--after paying his dues programming \ncomputers and building the foundation of the business--he knew that \nthere would be a huge growth in information technology industry. At \nthat point, he had to decide on his business' future. In December 1992, \nhe decided to go forward with an aggressive business expansion program. \nHe engaged an advertising agency, developed a business plan, designed a \nlogo, hired a marketing consultant to build a sales staff and started \naggressively recruiting technical talent. Since that time, sales have \ngrown over 1,400 percent and he now employs nearly 175 people--his \nclear vision paid off.\n  While Greg's custom software development services company provides \nleading edge information technology in the business arena--he \npersonally is a leader in the community. He was recently appointed Vice \nChairman of Science and Technology for the St. Louis Regional Commerce \nand Growth Association. I understand that he personally conducts \nworkshops on resume writing skills, interviewing and networking to help \nstudents be competitive in the after-graduation job market. He also has \nestablished the G.A. Sullivan Scholarship fund.\n  Mr. Sullivan is the 36th recipient of this annual entrepreneurial \naward. He was selected from a field of 53 state small business persons \nof the year winners representing the 50 states, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The national entrepreneur award is the \nhighlight of the Small Business Administration's national Small \nBusiness Week celebration. Small Business Week honors contributions of \nthe nation's small business owners who are the backbone of this great \nnation. The SBA selects winners on their record of stability, growth in \nemployment and sales, sound financial status, innovation, and the \ncompany's response to adversity and community service.\n  It honors me to stand before you today to congratulate Mr. Sullivan \nas the Small Business Administration's Person of the Year. Mr. Sullivan \nexemplifies the ``American Dream,'' and is living proof that with hard \nwork and dedication any one individual can succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5883-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTE TO LOIS BODOKY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I salute a longtime Vermont \nbusinesswoman, and a fixture on Burlington's Church Street Marketplace, \nMrs. Lois Bodoky.\n  Lois is affectionately known in Burlington as the ``Hot Dog Lady'', \nfor she recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of her business \nrunning a hot dog cart in downtown Burlington.\n  Lois went into the hot dog business not long after her hair salon was \nlost in a fire, and at the same time I was running my first campaign \nfor U.S. Senator. Back then, Church Street was a typical Vermont \ndowntown, and Lois operated her cart on the sidewalk as cars and buses \npassed on the street. Now, her cart is in a prime spot on Church Street \nMarketplace, which became a pedestrian mall in the early 1980's, and is \none of Vermont's prime shopping areas.\n  Since Lois went into business, downtown Burlington has seen many \nchanges, but the ``Hot Dog Lady's'' cart has remained a fixture, even \nin some of Vermont's coldest months. She is truly a Burlington \ninstitution and is most reliable to members of the downtown crowd who \ncannot let a lunch hour pass without a lunch from Lois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5883-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WESTPORT VOLUNTEER EMERGENCY SERVICES\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to formally \ncongratulate Westport Volunteer Emergency Services on its 20th \nAnniversary. The fine men and women who founded, operate, and support \nthis organization have distinguished themselves as one the pillars on \nwhich the principles of community service rest.\n  The EMS team has truly been an asset to the town of Westport and has \nhad a profound impact on the individuals and families who have \nbenefited from its experience and training. Its quick service and \nprofessional response has made it one of the state's most well-\nrespected EMS corps. We have all been taught that we have an obligation \nto help our neighbors in need, but this organization has truly taken \nthis credo to heart and has earned commendation for the lives it has \nsaved, the families it has assisted, and the time it has contributed to \nimproving the entire community.\n  I give special congratulations to the 23 original members and staff \nof WVEMS who are still active today. They should be very proud of the \npositive impact of this organization, and I am certain that they \nappreciate more than anyone the growth and development of this \noutstanding EMS corps.\n  Westport EMS provides immediate, front-line assistance that is so \nvaluable to our neighbors in needs and does so on a volunteer basis. \nIts efforts have made a difference to children and adults alike over \nthese last two decades and done more than its part to improve the Town \nof Westport. I an confident that Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical \nServices will continue its sterling record of service far into the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/24/senate-section/article/S5883-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5883-S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SATELLITE HOME VIEWERS IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  On May 20, 1999, the Senate amended and passed H.R. 1554, the \nSatellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 1554) entitled ``An Act to amend the provisions of \n     title 17, United States Code, and the Communications Act of \n     1934, relating to copyright licensing and carriage of \n     broadcast signals by satellite.'', do pass with the following \n     amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n            TITLE I--SATELLITE HOME VIEWERS IMPROVEMENTS ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Satellite Television Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting competition in cable services and making available \n     to the public a diversity of views and information through \n     cable television and other video media.\n       (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress stated \n     its policy of securing lower prices and higher quality \n     service for American telecommunications consumers and \n     encouraging the rapid deployment of new telecommunications \n     technologies.\n       (3) In most places throughout America, cable television \n     system operators still do not face effective competition from \n     other providers of multichannel video service.\n       (4) Absent effective competition, the market power \n     exercised by cable television operators enables them to raise \n     the price of cable service to consumers, and to control the \n     price and availability of cable programming services to other \n     multichannel video service providers. Current Federal \n     Communications Commission rules have been inadequate in \n     constraining cable price increases.\n       (5) Direct-to-home satellite service has over 8 million \n     subscribers and constitutes the most significant competitive \n     alternative to cable television service.\n       (6) Direct-to-home satellite service currently suffers from \n     a number of statutory, regulatory, and technical barriers \n     that keep it from being an effective competitor to cable \n     television in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (7) The most prominent of these barriers is the inability \n     to provide subscribers with local television broadcast \n     signals by satellite.\n       (8) Permitting providers of direct-to-home satellite \n     service to retransmit local television signals to their \n     subscribers would greatly enhance the ability of direct-to-\n     home satellite service providers to compete more effectively \n     in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (9) Due to capacity limitations and in the interest of \n     providing service in as many markets as possible, providers \n     of direct-to-home satellite service, unlike cable television \n     systems, cannot at this time carry all local television \n     broadcast signals in all the local television markets they \n     seek to serve.\n       (10) It would be in the public interest for providers of \n     direct-to-home satellite service to fully comply with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules at the earliest possible \n     date. In the interim, requiring full compliance with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules would substantially limit the \n     ability of direct-to-home satellite service providers to \n     compete in the provision of multichannel video services and \n     would not serve the public interest.\n       (11) Maintaining the viability of free, local, over-the-air \n     television service is a matter of preeminent public interest.\n       (12) All subscribers to multichannel video services should \n     be able to receive the signal of at least one station \n     affiliated with each of the major broadcast television \n     networks.\n       (13) Millions of subscribers to direct-to-home satellite \n     service currently receive the signals of network-affiliated \n     stations not located in these subscribers' local television \n     markets. Where conventional rooftop antennas cannot provide \n     satisfactory reception of local stations, distant network \n     signals may be these subscribers' only source of network \n     television service.\n       (14) The widespread carriage of distant network stations in \n     local network affiliates' markets could harm the local \n     stations' ability to serve their local community.\n       (15) Abrupt termination of satellite carriers' provision of \n     distant network signals could have a negative impact on the \n     ability of direct-to-home satellite service to compete \n     effectively in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (16) The public interest would be served by permitting \n     direct-to-home satellite service providers to continue \n     existing carriage of a distant network affiliate station's \n     signal where--\n       (A) there is no local network affiliate;\n       (B) the local network affiliate cannot be adequately \n     received off-air; or\n       (C) continued carriage would not harm the local network \n     station.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to promote competition in the \n     provision of multichannel video services while protecting the \n     availability of free, local, over-the-air television, \n     particularly for the 22 percent of American television \n     households that do not subscribe to any multichannel video \n     programming service.\n\n     SEC. 204.
