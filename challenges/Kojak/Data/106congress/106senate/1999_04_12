Mr. President, as the Senate reconvenes from a 2-week \nEaster recess, I am sure a number of my colleagues will be coming to \nthe floor to discuss the challenges and the difficulties and the \ncircumstances that exist now with respect to the action being taken in \nKosovo. I am one of those who voted to support airstrikes in Kosovo. We \nvoted to give the President the authority to commit U.S. troops and \nairplanes to conduct airstrikes only, along with our NATO allies, to \nrespond to the ethnic cleansing\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nand the genocide that has been occurring in Kosovo.\n  I believe it is in our national interest to respond in these \ncircumstances when we see genocide being committed. When we see ethnic \ncleansing on the scale as has been committed in Kosovo, we have a \nresponsibility as a community of nations to respond to it, to try to \nhelp and to save the lives of those poor, innocent people who are being \nrepressed and in a good many cases murdered, and certainly in hundreds \nof thousands of cases removed from their homeland, by a tyrant, by \nsomeone who does not respect international law. Over 630,000 refugees \nhave been forced from their homes in Kosovo, 25,000 of them loaded on \ntrains in scenes that are reminiscent of the late stages in World War \nII, sending of the folks to the death camps in the Second World War. \nReports of mass executions, burned villages, rapes and robberies--all \nof this is rampant.\n  I supported the airstrikes as part of a NATO response to stop this \nethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The United States is doing this as a part \nof NATO, but the United States shoulders the bulk of the burden of the \nairstrikes in that region. There are 400 U.S. war planes, 400 U.S. \naircraft involved in this operation, and about 200 aircraft from the \nallied nations. During the first week of the war, the United States \nflew about 90 percent of the sorties. In other words, 90 percent of the \npilots and about 90 percent of the airplanes during the first week of \nthat war were U.S. planes and pilots.\n  I expect we will have briefings this week about the consequences of \nthe airstrikes that have been launched. We have seen substantial \ntelevision coverage. There has been a great deal of news analysis of \nall of this, and I think probably everyone here in the Senate is \nconcerned and nervous about what is happening. There is discussion now \nabout whether ground troops ultimately will be needed in that region in \norder to complete the mission of NATO. I do not know the answer to \nthat, but I do feel very strongly that the introduction of U.S. forces \non the ground in the Balkans could be a very, very significant mistake.\n  The NATO allies, it seems to me, the NATO countries, particularly the \nEuropean countries, have a greater responsibility, especially in their \nneighborhood, in their area of the world, to do what is necessary to \nmake the commitment if ground troops are necessary to support this \neffort. We do not know the consequences of NATO action. We know the \nconsequences of taking no action. That would be the continuation and \nperhaps the finality of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, perhaps the murder \nof tens of thousands of additional people, certainly the displacement \nof hundreds of thousands and more from Kosovo to refugee camps and to \nother places in the world.\n  That is unacceptable. None of us want 5 and 10 years from now to look \nback and say, ``What shame has been wrought upon this world with this \nethnic cleansing and this genocide that we did nothing about it.'' That \nis the reason I think this country and the NATO allies decided we will \nnot allow this to stand; we must take action. So we took action with \nairstrikes, and those airstrikes continue.\n  The next decision, I think, will be, Will there be ground troops \nneeded? I will just say, speaking for myself, I am very concerned about \nthe introduction of U.S. ground forces in the Balkans. I believe very \nstrongly that the NATO countries, particularly the European countries, \nmust bear a greater responsibility of that burden. If ground troops are \nneeded for intervention in the Balkans, then I believe that the \nEuropean countries ought to commit under NATO those ground troops. But \nI would be very concerned about a decision to commit U.S. ground troops \nin the Balkans.\n  Those of us in leadership on the Republican and Democratic side, both \nin the Senate and in the House, have been invited to meet with \nPresident Clinton tomorrow at the White House late in the morning. We \nwill be discussing this issue, I suspect, in greater detail: What have \nthe airstrikes accomplished? What is the mission? How does that mission \nnow continue toward some kind of conclusion, and what might we expect \nthat conclusion to be?\n  I do not agree with my colleagues at all who say our mission must be \nto be successful; our mission must be to win with respect to the goals \nwe have established in this area. But no one should mistake that this \nis a very difficult set of circumstances. We acted because we had to, \nbut this remains a very difficult set of circumstances for this country \nand for the NATO allies.\n  It is my hope that very soon Mr. Milosevic will understand that he \ncannot continue, that this country and many of us in this body view him \nas a war criminal. I am one who believes he should be tried as a war \ncriminal in front of an international tribunal. I know some are \nreluctant to do that because then they say you are negotiating \nultimately with a war criminal if you negotiate an end to the \nhostilities.\n  The fact is, because genocide is being committed, we are persuaded to \ngo in to stop it. By definition, when we began this process, we decided \nthis person was a war criminal at the start. Why are we reluctant now, \nat anyplace along this process, to ask an international tribunal to \nbrand him, try him in absentia, if necessary, as a war criminal?\n  There will be much more to discuss on the subject of Kosovo in the \ncoming days. I will be interested, as well, in the views of my \ncolleagues and interested in the meeting with President Clinton \ntomorrow with the joint leadership of the House and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on a different \nsubject, the subject of family farming and agriculture, for another 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3582-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3582-S3583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FARMING AND AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me, as we \nturn towards the agenda before the Senate, from now perhaps until the \nFourth of July, to understand that we face an urgent situation in rural \nAmerica. Family farmers today, in my State and your State, if you \nrepresent the farm belt, went to the bank and were told that their \ninvestments, all of their 20 or 30 years invested in their farm are \ngone. They will not be able to plant the ground and raise a crop this \nyear because they are out of money.\n  I want to read a letter I received from a woman. I talked to her by \nphone this morning. I was so struck by it, because she represents so \nwell the dilemma and the urgency that we face in family farming.\n  This is a woman named, Susan Jorgenson, who is from North Dakota. Her \nhusband died last August. She said that he had diabetes. She writes:\n\n       . . . what I really feel caused his death was trying to \n     make a living as a farmer.\n       I had an auction last week to sell the [farm] machinery, so \n     that I can pay off some of the debt that [we] incurred after \n     26 years of farming. I have a 17 yr. old son who would not \n     help me prepare for this auction and did not get out of bed \n     the day of the [auction] sale, because he is so heartbroken \n     that he can not continue [to farm] this land.\n       My husband was an excellent manager and fully educated.\n\n  He had a masters degree.\n\n       He chose to farm rather than to live in Phoenix where he \n     had a job with Motorola [early on], because he wanted to \n     raise his children in a place with clean air, no crime and \n     good schools. He worked very hard, physically and emotionally \n     to make this farm work and its failure was . . . no fault of \n     his own.\n\n  What do we say to families who live on America's farms when prices \ncollapse for the product they produce? And when they take a truckload \nof grain to the elevator, that elevator operator says, ``Well, the \ngrain market for this grain you produced has no value''? The farmer who \nworked to plant and harvest the crops, risked the money to farm to get \nthat grain to the elevator thinks, ``Gosh, that's a strange set of \ncircumstances. I'm told my crop has no value, and yet much of the world \ngoes to bed with an ache in their belly because they don't have enough \nto eat.''\n  People are starving in other parts of the world. We have images of \nold women climbing trees scavenging for leaves to eat because there is \nnothing else to eat. We had a report recently noting a country with a \nmillion to a million and a quarter people on the abyss of starvation, \nand our farmers are told their crops have no value.\n  The challenge for us in this Congress is to decide whether family \nfarmers matter in our country.\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\n  I have a chart that shows all of those counties in America, shown in \nred, where they have lost more than 15 percent of their population. \nLargely, it shows in the center part of our country, the farm belt, \nthat people have moved out. Our farm belt is being depopulated.\n  A century ago we had the Homestead Act to persuade people to come out \nand begin farming. If you moved out there, the Federal Government gave \nyou 160 acres of land. You were a homesteader; you farmed the land. And \nwe populated the farm belt.\n\n  Now look at what has happened: The farm belt is being depopulated for \na good number of reasons, the most important of which, in my judgment, \nis we have a farm program that does not work. The farm program says, \n``You're on your own. When market prices collapse, we're not going to \nprovide decent support prices.''\n  We need to reconnect with decent price supports. We need a Fair Price \nPlan for Family Farmers, and we need it soon. This Congress has a \nresponsibility, in my judgment, between now and the July 4 recess, to \naddress this urgent situation on America's family farms and to say to \nfamily farmers, ``You matter, the products you produce make a \ndifference, they have value, and this country stands behind what you \nrepresent in our country.''\n  We need to do a number of things. We need to pass a better Farm Bill, \nas I said, a Fair Price Plan. We need meat labeling that will help our \nranchers. Let people know what they are eating and where it came from. \nWe need price reporting. Let's see fair prices and full price reporting \non livestock prices. Let's break up some of the monopolies that exist \nin the slaughterhouses. Eighty-seven percent of America's fat steers go \nto four slaughterhouses to be slaughtered. What that means is, you pass \nthat monopoly pricing back on family farmers. They are the ones who are \nalready losing money.\n  Isn't it interesting that every firm in this country who touches what \na farmer produces, whether it is a steak or a bushel of wheat or a \nbushel of corn, is making money. The railroads are making record \nprofits hauling it. The cereal manufacturers are making record profits \ncrisping and puffing it, putting it into a box and selling it as \ncereal. The folks that slaughter the beef, the pork, the poultry, and \nthe sheep are making record profits. It is the farmer who rises to do \nthe chores, to plant the ground, to harvest the crops, who is going \nbroke because they are told their commodities have no value.\n  That is a bankrupt approach for this economy. The economy, if it \nrewards hard work and the production of things people in this world \nneed, will do well. But we decided that the all-star economic producers \nin America, the American family farmers, don't matter and we passed a \nfarm bill that says, you're on your own; you deal with the marketplace \nand we don't care what the marketplace looks like. The farm bill is \nstacked against you, it favors monopolistic businesses, it presses its \nheavy boot upon you and you can't do anything about it. That is tough \nluck because it says we don't need you anymore, we don't need family \nfarmers, all we need are giant agribusinesses. If that is the position \nthat is taken in this country, this country will have taken a giant \nstep backwards.\n\n  So I am saying that in the coming 2 or 3 months we must recognize the \nurgency of the situation on the family farm. Farmer after farmer after \nfarmer in State after State are going broke, through no fault of their \nown. This young boy, who could not bear to attend the auction sale at \nhis own farm, because it broke his heart not to be able to farm that \nland that his dad and his granddad and great-granddad farmed, this boy \nought to hear from this Congress that we stand ready to help, that we \ncare about preserving families on America's farms, that the \ndecentralization of food production, a network of family farms dotting \nthis country's prairies, strengthens America, that producing food that \na hungry world needs is something that is an asset in this country, not \na liability.\n  So I hope in the next 2 to 3 months those who care about family \nfarmers will join those of us who come from the farm belt to pass \naggressive, good, strong legislation dealing with concentration, \nmonopolies, price reporting, meat labeling, and a decent price \nsupport--all of those issues and more--that will finally say to family \nfarmers, you have a decent opportunity to make a living on America's \nfamily farms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto an extraordinary young man from Blandford, Massachusetts. Kyle \nMangini is a 13-year-old Boy Scout who, while on vacation with his \nfamily, saved his 16-year-old cousin, Santiago Garcia, from drowning.\n  Santiago was swimming and suddenly began to drown, sinking to the \nbottom of the pool. Kyle saw his cousin and immediately realized that \nhe was in great danger. He leaped into the pool and pulled his older, \nmuch larger cousin out of the water.\n  Kyle's quick reaction saved precious seconds and probably saved \nSantiago's life. Santiago was successfully resuscitated by an emergency \nmedical technician. It was Kyle's lifesaving training as a Boy Scout \nthat prepared him for the emergency. Had it not been for Kyle's brave \nand timely rescue, his cousin Santiago could have suffered serious \nbrain damage or death.\n  Kyle Mangini is a credit to the Boy Scouts and a true profile in \ncourage for the State of Massachusetts. It is an honor to pay tribute \nto him today, and I ask unanimous consent that an article on his action \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Country Journal, Apr. 1, 1999]\n\n         Quick-Thinking Blandford Boy Scout Saves Cousin's Life\n\n                           (By Mary Kronholm)\n\n       Not every vacation is an adventure, nor is every vacation \n     fraught with life-threatening incidents. But vacations are \n     supposed to have happy endings.\n       Kyle Mangini was enjoying the last day of his Christmas \n     vacation with his father, Dan Mangini, on Nevis, an island in \n     the West Indies. His cousin, Santiago Garcia from Manchester, \n     Conn. was with him.\n       The boys had become accustomed to visiting the beach and \n     pool at the next door resort, Nesbit Plantation, and went for \n     a final\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n     swim. As usual, the boys tested themselves to see how long \n     they could hold their breath under water. Kyle, 13 years old, \n     told Santiago he was going to get his towel and suggested a \n     breather. When Kyle returned from the family spot on the \n     beach, about five yards away, he saw that Santiago was still \n     at the game, and underwater.\n       A poolside bystander made the observation to Kyle that his \n     friend was now pretending to be an underwater crab.\n       As Kyle watched, Santiago turned over, still at the bottom \n     of the pool, in five feet of water. ``His arm was twitching \n     and his mouth was open,'' said Kyle, who realized at that \n     moment that something was terribly wrong.\n       ``I jumped in, swam to the bottom, put my arm under his and \n     pulled him to the top,'' he said.\n       As Kyle brought Santiago to the side of the pool, \n     bystanders helped pull him out. Someone went to call for an \n     ambulance, while others asked if anyone knew CPR. While Kyle \n     does know how to administer CPR, an Emergency Medical \n     Technician was staying at the resort, and stepped in to help.\n       According to Dan, the wait for the ambulance was about a \n     half-an-hour. ``The ambulance went to the wrong place and had \n     to be redirected,'' he said.\n       ``As the EMT performed CPR, Santiago was convulsing, and it \n     was necessary, to hold his body down,'' said Dan. Kyle said \nthat initially there was no pulse, but as soon as the CPR started, \nSantiago began breathing again. It was several hours later, accompanied \nby much medication, that the boy's body relaxed, and it was several \nmore hours before anyone knew what shape Santiago was in.\n\n  ``No one knows just exactly how long Santiago was under water,'' said \nDan, who said the doctors at the Nevis Hospital were most concerned \nabout possible brain damage.\n  ``We went to visit him that evening, but the next morning, he had no \nrecollection of our visit,'' said Dan.\n  On successive visits to the hospital, Kyle asked questions of \nSantiago, assuring, from his answers, that all was well.\n  Santiago was in the hospital for five days. His aunt, Maria, Kyle's \nstep-mother, stayed with him throughout the days to help with feeding \nand necessary exercises, essential to restore lung capacity and \nbreathing.\n  Kyle said that a doctor at the hospital told him that if he had gone \nto get help instead of pulling Santiago out himself, the boy would not \nhave survived, as his lungs would have been completely filled with \nwater.\n  As it was, according to Dan, it was almost 24 hours before anyone \nknew what the prognosis was going to be. Santiago has since been seen \nby his own physician and a neurologist, and been given a clean bill of \nhealth.\n  Mary Mangini, Kyle's mother, is proud of her son because just as Kyle \nwas so quick to react to the situation, he is quite a bit lighter than \nhis cousin.\n  Santiago, at 16 years old, weighs 180 pounds, and is about five feet \n9 inches. ``He's very big,'' said Kyle, who weighs 85 pounds and \nmeasures five feet tall.\n  Kyle attributes his ability to act quickly to his knowledge of \nlifesaving acquired as part of his merit badge work while taking \nlifesaving at the Moses Boy Scout Camp in Russell.\n  ``. . . and that's how I knew what to do,'' Kyle said.\n  Kyle's scout leader, David Olzewski, said that Kyle has been \nparticipating in the scouting program since he was Cub Scout age, about \nnine-years-old. ``He's a good kid, and one of the oldest scouts in the \ntroop,'' he said, adding that Kyle is the troop guide.\n  This is not Kyle's first successful rescue. A few years ago, he and \nneighbor John Mulligan came upon a Herrick Road neighbor, Harold Wyman, \nwho had fallen in his icy walkway and was not able to get up. Kyle \nreacted in the same, quick, responsive manner, by sending John to the \ntelephone and dialing 911, while he found blankets for Mr. Wyman, and \ncomforted him until help arrived.\n  Kyle is an eighth grade student at Gateway Regional Middle School and \nnext year will attend Pioneer Valley School of Performing Arts, in \nHadley, a charter school. He plays the guitar and enjoys acting and was \nmost recently seen as Will Scarlett in the middle school production of \nthe musical, Robin Hood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3584-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3584-S3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MILLENNIUM DIGITAL COMMERCE ACT--S. 761\n\n  Statements on the bill, S. 761, introduced on March 25, 1999, did not \nappear in the Record. The material follows:\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Burns):\n  S. 761. A bill to regulate interstate commerce by electronic means by \npermitting and encouraging the continued expansion of electronic \ncommerce through the operation of free market forces, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    millennium digital commerce act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Millennium \nDigital Commerce Act, a bill to promote the use of electronic \nauthentication technologies and enhance the Internet's capacity to \nserve as a business tool. I am joined in introducing this bill by \nSenator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nSenator Ron Wyden, and Senator Conrad Burns. This legislation builds on \nthe Government Paperwork Elimination Act, a bill I sponsored to promote \nthe use of electronic signatures by the Federal Government, which was \nsigned into law by the President as part of the Omnibus Appropriations \nAct.\n  The Internet has experienced almost exponential growth since its \ninception. Where once the Internet was a medium limited to the sharing \nof ideas between scientists and educators, it is now a tool which \nallows every person with a computer to access more information than is \ncontained in any single library, communicate with friends for a \nfraction of the cost of phone service, or purchase goods from retailers \nlocated all over the world. Electronic commerce is clearly booming. But \nin order to realize its full potential, we must enact Federal and State \nlegislation to enable, enhance, and protect the next generation of \nInternet usage.\n  The Internet is poised to serve as an efficient new tool for \ncompanies to transact business as never before. The development of \nelectronic signature technologies now allow organizations to enter into \ncontractual arrangements without ever having to drive across town or \nfly thousands of miles to personally meet with a client or potential \nbusiness partner. The Internet is prepared to go far beyond the ability \nto buy a book or order apparel on-line. It is ready to lead a \nrevolution in the execution of business transactions which may involve \nthousands or millions of dollars in products or services; transactions \nso important they require that both parties enter into a legally \nbinding contract.\n  This capability is provided by the development of secure electronic \nauthentication methods and technologies. These technologies permit an \nindividual to positively identify the person with whom they are \ntransacting business and to ensure that information being shared by the \nparties has not been tampered with or modified without the knowledge of \nboth parties. While such technologies are seeing limited use today, the \ngrowth of the application has out-paced government's ability to \nappropriately modify the legal framework governing the use of \nelectronic signatures and other authentication methods.\n  Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act is designed to \npromote the use of electronic signatures in business transactions and \ncontracts. At present, the greatest barrier to such transactions is the \nlack of a consistent and predictable national framework of rules \ngoverning the use of electronic signatures. Over forty States have \nenacted electronic authentication laws, and no two laws are the same. \nThis inconsistency deters businesses from fully utilizing electronic \nsignature technologies for contracts and other business transactions. \nThe differences in our State laws create uncertainty about the \neffectiveness or legality of an electronic contract signed with an \nelectronic signature. Of course, certainty is the basis for commerce, \nand contracts provide that certainty. Parties enter into contracts \nunderstanding that they will be bound by the terms of the agreement. \nHowever, the fear is that a business located in a State with different \nelectronic authentication rules may be able to escape contractual \nobligations agreed to through electronic signatures. This legal \nuncertainty limits the potential of electronic commerce, and, thus, our \nnation's economic growth.\n  The needs for uniformity in electronic authentication rules is not \nonly recognized by the business community,\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nbut by the States as well. For the past two years, the National \nConference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, an organization \ncomprised of e-commerce experts form the States, has been working to \ndevelop a uniform system for the use of electronic signatures for all \nfifty States. Their product, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, \nor UETA, is in the final stages of review and the drafters expect to \nhave the Act completed by October. Assuming the UETA is finished as \nscheduled, and I believe it will be, it will then fall on each \nState legislature to enact the legislation and establish the uniformity \nnecessary for the interstate use of electronic signatures.\n\n  But agreement on the final language of the UETA proposal is not the \nsame as enactment. Uniformity will not occur until all fifty States \nactually enact the UETA. Because some State legislatures are not in \nsession next year and other States have more pressing legislative \nitems, it could take three to four years for forty-five or fifty States \nto enact the UETA. With the rapid State of development in the high-\ntechnology sector, four years is an eternity.\n  The Digital Millennium Commerce Act is an interim measure to provide \nrelief until the States adopt the provisions of the UETA. It will \nprovide companies the baseline they need until a national baseline \ngoverning the use of electronic authentication exists at the State \nlevel.\n  First, the legislation provides that the electronic records produced \nin the execution of a digital contract shall not be denied legal effect \nsolely because they are electronic in nature. This provision assures \nthat a company will be able to rely on an electronic contract and that \nanother party will not be able to escape their contractual obligations \nsimply because the contract was entered into the Internet or any other \ncomputer network. By granting such certainty, this bill will reduce the \nlikelihood of dissatisfied parties attempting to escape electronic \ncontractual agreements and transactions.\n  Mr. President, let me stress that this Federal preemption of State \nlaw is designed to be an interim measure. It provides relief until the \nStates enact uniform standards which are consistent with those \ncontained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and this \nlegislation. Simply put, once States enact the UETA or other \nlegislation governing the use of electronic signatures which is \nconsistent to the UETA, the Federal preemption is lifted.\n  I consider myself a Federalist. I believe strongly in States rights \nand view with great caution proposals which call for the preemption of \nState law. After considerable study, it is my option that the need for \na national baseline for the use of electronic signatures justifies a \ntemporary, Federal action until such time as the States can enact a \nuniform standard.\n  Second, the bill grants parties to a transaction the freedom to \ndetermine the technologies and business methods to be used in the \nexecution of an electronic contract. In essence, this assures that the \nFederal baseline will extend to the various aspects of State law \ngoverning authentication including such matters as registration and \ncertification requirements, liability allocations, maintenance of \nrevocation lists, payment of fees and other legal and regulatory \nconcerns.\n  Third, this legislation sets forth the principles for the \ninternational use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. \nnegotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to \ndiscuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these \nnegotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the States Department \nhave worked in support of an open system governing the use of \nauthentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept. \nFor example, Germany insists that electronic transactions involving a \nGerman company must utilize a German electronic signature application. \nI applaud the Administration for their steadfast opposition to that \napproach. In an effort to bolster and strengthen the U.S. position in \nthese international negotiations, this legislation lays out a serious \nof principles to govern the use of electronic signatures in \ninternational transactions. These principles included the following:\n  One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be \neliminated.\n  Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the \nelectronic authentication technology.\n  Third, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove \nin court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid.\n  Fourth, the international approach to electronic signatures should \ntake a nondiscriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will \nallow the free market--not a government--to determine the type of \nauthentication technologies used in international commerce.\n\n  Mr. President, these principles will bolster the U.S. convention that \nthe Departments of State and Commerce are advocating abroad, and, \nhopefully, increase the likelihood of an open, market-based \ninternational framework to electronic commerce.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of \nManagement and Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that \nmight pose barriers to e-commerce and report back to Congress on the \nimpact of such provisions and provide suggestions for reform.\n  Mr. President, as with any legislation seeking to affect both Federal \nand State law, drafting this bill has been a challenging balancing act. \nDuring the drafting process, my office has received invaluable support \nfrom the Technology Division of the State of Massachusetts. Governor \nPaul Cellucci's staff have provided indispensable counsel on existing \nState law governing the use of electronic signatures and the manner in \nwhich Federal law can bolster or hamstring State contract law. Of \ncourse, the business and technology sectors have also been crucial in \nhelping to craft this bill. Representatives from the Information \nTechnology Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nMicrosoft, Hewlett-Packard and the National Association of \nManufacturers have each lent their time and expertise to this effort. I \nappreciate their contributions and look forward to continuing this \neffort to ensure that we develop the best approach possible to promote \nuse of electronic signatures in business transactions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. \nMr. President, I ask that the text of this legislation be placed in the \nRecord.\n  The fill follows:\n\n                                 S. 761\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Millennium Digital Commerce \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     government transactions represent a powerful force for \n     economic growth, consumer choice, improved civic \n     participation and wealth creation.\n       (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n     commerce through federal legislation is in the national \n     interest because that market is globally important to the \n     United States.\n       (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n     jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the \n     growth of such transaction, and that such a foundation should \n     be based upon a simple, technology neutral, non-regulatory, \n     and market-based approach.\n       (4) The nation and the worked stand at the beginning of a \n     large scale transition to an information society which will \n     require innovative legal and policy approaches, and \n     therefore, States can serve the national interest by \n     continuing their proven role as laboratories of innovation \n     for quickly evolving areas of public policy, provided that \n     States also adopt a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as \n     undue paper and pen requirements, and further, that any such \n     innovation should not unduly burden inter-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n       (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not \n     currently provide a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     or in fact create an undue burden to interstate commerce in \n     the important burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the \n     national interest is best served by Federal preemption to the \n     extent necessary to provide such consistent national baseline \n     and eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of a \n     consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue \n     burdens, the best legal system for electronic commerce will \n     result from continuing experimentation by individual \n     jurisdictions.\n       (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n     consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n     such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n     exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n     existing related bodies of law within a particular \n     jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\n       (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n     technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the \n     public policies of the United States should serve to promote \n     a dynamic marketplace within which these technologies can \n     compete. Consistent with this Act, States should permit the \n     use and development of any authentication technologies that \n     are appropriate as practicable as between private parties and \n     in use with State agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to permit and encourage the continued exepansion of \n     electronic commerce through the operation of free market \n     forces rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and \n     regulations;\n       (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n     and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n     under Federal law;\n       (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n     clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures in the context of writing and signing \n     requirements imposed by law;\n       (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n     interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n     terms and conditions on which they use and accept electronic \n     signatures and electronic records; and\n       (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n     legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n     commerce at the Federal and state levels within existing \n     areas of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STUDY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO ELECTRONIC \n                   COMMERCE.\n\n       (a) Barriers.--Each Federal agency shall, not later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, provide a \n     report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     and the Secretary of Commerce identifying any provision of \n     law administered by such agency, or any regulations issued by \n     such agency and in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that may impose a barrier to electronic transactions, or \n     otherwise to the conduct of commerce online or be electronic \n     means. Such barriers include, but are not limited to, \n     barriers imposed by a law or regulation directly or \n     indirectly requiring that signatures, or records of \n     transactions, be accomplished or retained in other than \n     electronic form. In its report, each agency shall identify \n     the barriers among those identified whose removal would \n     require legislative action, and shall indicate agency to \n     plans to undertake regulatory action to remove such barriers \n     among those identified as are caused by regulations issued by \n     the agency.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, shall, within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and after the consultation required by \n     subsection (c) of this section, report to the Congress \n     concerning--\n       (1) legislation needed to remove any existing barriers to \n     electronic transactions or otherwise to the conduct of \n     commerce online or by electronic means; and\n       (2) actions being taken by the Executive Branch and \n     individual Federal agencies to remove such barriers as are \n     caused by agency regulations or policies.\n       (c) Consultation.--In preparing the report required by this \n     section, the Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the \n     General Services Administration, the National Archives and \n     Records Administration, and the Attorney General concerning \n     matters involving the authenticity of records, their storage \n     and retention, and their usability for law enforcement \n     purposes.\n       (d) Include Findings If No Recommendations.--If the report \n     required by this section omits recommendations for actions \n     needed to fully remove identified barriers to electronic \n     transactions or to online or electronic commerce, it shall \n     include a finding or findings, including substantial reasons \n     therefor, that such removal is impracticable or would be \n     inconsistent with the implementation or enforcement of \n     applicable laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3586-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3586-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 31, 1999, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 193.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase the \nminimum Survivor Benefit Plan basic annuity for surviving spouses age \n62 and older, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                  SBP BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, as our Armed Forces are engaged \nin operations over Yugoslavia, I am introducing legislation that \ncorrects a long-standing injustice to the widows of our military \nretirees. My bill would immediately increase for survivors over the age \n62 the minimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 \npercent of the Survivor Benefit Plan-covered uniform services retired \npay. The bill would provide a further increase to 45 percent of covered \nretired pay as of October 1, 2004.\n\n  Mr. President, I expect every member of the Senate has received mail \nfrom military spouses expressing dismay that they would not be \nreceiving the 55 percent of their husband's retirement pay as \nadvertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature provided by the \nmilitary. The reason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired \npay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced \neither by the amount of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 \npercent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees \nwho joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service \nmembers were never informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made \nan irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their \nspouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium \npayments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the \nsurvivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial \ndisadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in \ntroubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the \nannuity reduction.\n  Mr. President, uniformed services retirees pay too much for the \navailable SBP benefit both, compared to what we promised and what we \noffer other federal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was \nenacted in 1972, the Congress intended that the government would pay 40 \npercent of the cost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal \ncivilian survivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \ngovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 \npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal \ncivilian retiree.\n\n  Mr. President, two years ago, with the significant support from the \nMembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was successful in \ngaining approval from the Congress in enacting the Survivor Benefit \nPlan benefits for the so-called Forgotten Widows. This is the second \nstep toward correcting the Survivors Benefit Plan and providing the \nsurviving spouses of our military personnel earned and paid for \nbenefits.

A bill to amend section 1951 of title 18, United States Code \n(commonly known as the Hobbs Act), and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      THE FREEDOM FROM UNION VIOLENCE ACT, MONDAY, APRIL 12, 1999\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nclose a long-standing loophole in our Nation's labor laws. The purpose \nof the bill is to make clear that violence conducted in the course of a \nstrike is illegal under the Federal extortion law, the Hobbs Act. I am \npleased to have Senator Hatch, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \njoin me once again in introducing this important measure.\n  Violence has no place in our society. As I have said many times \nbefore, I would, if it were in my power to do so, put an absolute stop, \nwithout any compromise, to the disruption of commerce in this country \nby intimidation and violence, whatever its source.\n  Unfortunately, corrupt union officials have often been the source of \nsuch violence. Encouraged by their special Federal exemption from \nprosecution, corrupt union officials have routinely used intimidation \nand violence over the years to achieve their goals. Since 1975, the \nInstitute for Labor Relations Research has documented over 9,000 \nreported incidents of union violence in America.\n  Let me make clear that I agree that the Federal government should not \nget involved in minor, isolated physical altercations and vandalism \nthat are bound to occur during a labor dispute when emotions are \ncharged and tempers flare. Action such as this is not significant to \ncommerce. However, when union violence moves beyond this and becomes a \npattern of violent conduct or of coordinated violent activity,\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nthe Federal government should be empowered to act. State and local \ngovernments sometimes fail to provide an effective remedy, whether \nbecause of a lack of will, a lack of resources, or an inability to \nfocus on the interstate nature of the conduct. It is during these times \nthat Federal involvement is needed to help control and stop the \nviolence.\n  Let me also note that this legislation has never been an effort to \ninvolve the Federal government in a matter that traditionally has been \nreserved for the states. Labor relations are regulated on a national \nbasis, and labor management policies are national policies. There is no \nreason to keep the Federal Government out of serious labor violence \nthat is intended to achieve labor objectives. Indeed, the Congress \nintended for the Hobbs Act to apply to the conduct we are addressing in \nthis legislation today. The decision to keep the Federal government out \nwas not made by the Congress. Rather, it was made by the Supreme Court \nin the United States versus Enmons decision in 1973, when the Supreme \nCourt found that the Hobbs Act did not apply to a lawful strike, as \nlong as the purpose of the strike was to achieve ``legitimate labor \nobjectives,'' such as higher wages. Such an exception does not exist in \nthe words of the statute. The Court could only create this loophole \nthrough a strained interpretation of the statute and a selective \nreading of its legislative history. In his dissent, Justice Douglas \naptly criticized the majority for, ``achieving by interpretation what \nthose who were opposed to the Hobbs Act were unable to get Congress to \ndo.''\n\n  More specifically, the Enmons decision involved the Hobbs Anti-\nRacketeering Act which is intended to prohibit extortion by labor \nunions. It provides that: ``Whoever in any way . . . obstructs, delays, \nor affects commerce in the movement of any article or commodity in \ncommerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires to do so or \ncommits or threatens physical violence to any person or property . . \n.'' commits a criminal act. This language clearly outlaws extortion by \nlabor unions. It outlaws violence by labor unions.\n  Although this language is very clear, the Supreme Court in Enmons \ncreated an exemption to the law which says that as long as a labor \nunion commits extortion and violence in furtherance of legitimate \ncollective-bargaining objectives, no violation of the act will be \nfound. Simply put, the Court held that if the ends are permissible, the \nmeans to that end, no matter how horrible or reprehensible, will not \nresult in violation of the act.\n  Let me discuss the Enmons case. In that case, the defendants were \nindicted for firing high-powered rifles at property, causing extensive \ndamage to the property owned by a utility company--all done in an \neffort to obtain higher wages and other benefits from the company for \nstriking employees. The indictment was, however, dismissed by the \ndistrict court on the theory that the Hobbs Act did not prohibit the \nuse of violence in obtaining legitimate union objectives. On appeal, \nthe Supreme Court affirmed.\n  The Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe violence \ncommitted during a lawful strike for the purpose of achieving \nlegitimate collective-bargaining objectives, like higher wages. By its \nfocus upon the motives and objectives of the property claimant who uses \nviolence or force to achieve his or her goals, the Enmons decision has \nhad several unfortunate results. It has deprived the Federal Government \nof the ability to punish significant acts of extortionate violence when \nthey occur in a labor management context. Although other Federal \nstatutes prohibit the use of specific devices or the use of channels of \ncommerce in accomplishing the underlying act of extortionate violence, \nonly the Hobbs Act proscribes a localized act of extortionate violence \nwhose economic effect is to disrupt the channels of commerce. Other \nFederal statutes are not adequate to address the full effect of the \nEnmons decision.\n\n  The Enmons decision affords parties to labor-management disputes an \nexemption from the statute's broad proscription against violence which \nis not available to any other group in society. This bill would make it \nclear that the Hobbs Act punishes the actual or threatened use of force \nand violence which is calculated to obtain property without regard to \nwhether the extortionist has a colorable claim to such property, and \nwithout regard to his or her status as a labor representative, \nbusinessman, or private citizen.\n  In short, the Enmons decision is an unfortunate example of judicial \nactivism, of a court interpreting a statute to reach the policy result \nthe court favors rather than the one the legislature intended. This is \na problem that has concerned many of us in the Senate for many years. \nWe have held numerous hearings on this matter in the Judiciary \nCommittee since the Enmons decision. Our most recent hearing was in the \nlast Congress after the UPS strike.\n  It is time we closed the loophole on union violence in America. It is \nmy hope that this year we will be successful.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 765. A bill to ensure the efficient allocation of telephone \nnumbers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       area code conservation act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Torricelli and \nmyself, I am pleased to introduce today the Area Code Conservation Act. \nThis legislation is designed to spare American businesses and \nhouseholds the expense and inconvenience of unnecessary changes in \ntheir area codes.\n  Mr. President, our current system for allocating numbers to local \ntelephone companies is woefully inefficient. It leads to the exhaustion \nof an area code long before all the telephone numbers covered by that \ncode are actually in use. My legislation will take steps to stop this \nwasteful practice and to bring some measure of sanity to our system of \nallocating telephone numbers.\n  When area codes were first introduced in 1947, 86 area codes covered \nall of North America. During the three-year period beginning on January \n1, 1998, it is estimated that we will add 90 new area codes in the \nUnited States alone. In short, Mr. President, in only three years, we \nwill add more codes than were originally required to cover the entire \ncontinent. And there does not seem to be an end in sight.\n  To the extent that additional area codes are needed to bring new \ntelecommunications services to existing users or existing services to \nnew users, they are a price we must pay. To the extent they are the \nresult of inefficient practices, however, they are a price we must \navoid. Unfortunately, the latter is far too frequently the case, as I \nshall explain.\n  The problem addressed by my legislation stems from a very simple \nfact. When a new carrier wishes to provide competitive telephone \nservice in a community, it must obtain at least one central office \ncode. Because it contains its own unique three-digit prefix within an \narea code, each central office code--and herein lies the crux of the \nproblem--includes 10,000 telephone numbers. Thus, even if a telephone \ncarrier expects to serve only five hundred customers in the community, \nit will exhaust 10,000 phone numbers in the process. And the ultimate \neffect of this occurring on a repeated basis is to exhaust all of the \nnumbers in the area code, thereby requiring that a new area code be \ncreated.\n  Let me illustrate this further. Let's assume that a town of 12,000 \nhouseholds, each with one telephone line, is served by a single \ntelephone carrier. The carrier will be able to meet the demand with \nonly two central office codes and still have about 8,000 numbers for \nnew customers. Assume further that three new competitors enter the \nmarket, which would be a welcome development and one that the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act was enacted to promote. Since central office \ncodes are not shared by carriers, each new competitor would need its \nown code consisting of 10,000 telephone numbers. As you can see when \nyou do the math, we would go from exhausting 20,000 numbers to \nexhausting 50,000 numbers to serve our town of just 12,000 households.\n  My own home state of Maine dramatically reflects the problem inherent \nin the current system. With a population of about 1.2 million people, \nwe have 5.7 million unused telephone numbers out of the roughly 8 \nmillion usable\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\nnumbers in our area code 207. However, more than 3 million of the \nunused numbers are within central office codes that have already been \nassigned, making them unavailable for other carriers. Thus, despite the \nfact that more than 70% of the telephone numbers in the 207 area code \nare not in use, Maine has been notified by the North American Numbering \nPlan Administrator that it will be forced to create a new area code by \nthe Spring of the year 2000.\n\n  As one Maine commentator noted, even if every moose in Maine had a \ntelephone number, we would still have plenty of numbers left over. Yet, \nwe are told we will soon need another area code, something that \nprobably make as much sense to our moose as to our people.\n  Mr. President, this paradigm of inefficiency in the midst of \nAmerica's telecommunications revolution might almost be amusing were it \nnot for the fact that it causes real hardships for many small \nbusinesses. With its great beauty, the Maine coast relies heavily on \ntourism for its economic health. We have heard from businesspeople \nthroughout our coastal communities--a gallery owner in Rockport, an \ninnkeeper in Bar Harbor, and a schooner captain in Rockland--who are \namong those who are rightly concerned about the cost of updating \nbrochures, business cards, and other promotional literature, all of \nwhich will be necessitated by having a new area code. And as the \ninnkeeper also told my office, it takes as long as 2 years to revise \nsome guide books, the biggest source of information for many of his \nguests. Changing the area code could therefore lead to a significant \nloss of business and unneeded expenses for these small businesses.\n  Along with the economic cost, new area codes create tremendous \ndisruption and confusion for consumers. With geographically split area \ncodes, States, counties, and cities are split apart, creating new \nterritorial boundaries that only serve to divide citizens. With overlay \narea codes, even more confusion can result. Just imagine having to dial \nup a different area code in order to order a pizza from a delivery \nservice just down the street.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will resolve these problems \nand bring common sense to the process of allocating telephone numbers. \nThe Area Code Conservation Act will set a date certain by which the \nFederal Communications Commission must develop a plan for the efficient \nallocation of telephone numbers. Consistent with the provisions of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, the plan must include measures to \nensure that telephone numbers will be portable when customers change \ncarriers and that unassigned numbers in a central office code will not \nbe the exclusive property of a single carrier.\n  The Area Code Conservation Act would also give decision-making \nauthority to the States, where officials know the best policies to \npromote competition while minimizing costs and confusion to businesses \nand consumers. Specifically, the Act would authorize State public \nutility commissions to implement area code conservation measures while \nthe FCC is developing its plan and, I would hope, before a new area \ncode is needlessly forced on the State. These conservation measures \ncould include minimum fill rates for central office codes, mandatory \n1,000-block pooling, individual number pooling, and interim unassigned \nnumber porting.\n  The legislation would also allow State commissions to require the \nreturn of unused or underused central office codes to the numbering \nadministrator.\n  In developing this legislation, I received valuable assistance and \ntechnical advice from the Maine Public Utilities Commission. I have \nevery confidence in the ability of the Maine PUC and, indeed, State \ncommissions throughout this country to develop the best policy in this \narea.\n  The people of Maine welcome technological change and accept that it \nmay come with a price. They are prepared to pay for innovation and \nprogress, but they object--indeed, they should object--when they are \nasked to pay for inefficiency. When one looks behind its technical \nsubject matter, this bill is about nothing more complicated than \nstopping a form of government waste. Such waste should not be tolerated \nby Members of this body, whether they come from States like Maine with \na single area code or from States with cities already divided into \ndifferent area codes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my efforts to bring an end to this \ninefficiency and the unnecessary cost and inconvenience it will impose \non our citizens, particularly our small businesses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Robb, Mr. Helms, and \n        Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 766. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to revise the \nrequirements for procurement of products of Federal Prison Industries \nto meet needs of Federal agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      the federal prison industries competition in contracting act\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with Senators \nAbraham, Robb, Helms, and Feingold, the Federal Prison Industries \nCompetition in Contracting Act. This bill, if enacted, would eliminate \nthe requirement for Federal agencies to purchase products made by \nFederal Prison Industries and require FPI to compete commercially for \nFederal contracts. It would implement a key recommendation of the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review, which concluded that we should \n``Take away the Federal Prison Industries' status as a mandatory source \nof federal supplies and require it to compete commercially for Federal \nagencies' business.'' Most importantly, it would ensure that the \ntaxpayers get the best possible value for their federal procurement \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that \nit provides a quality product at a price that is competitive with \ncurrent market prices. Indeed, the Federal Prison Industries statute \nrequires them to do so. That statute states, and I quote, that FPI may \nprovide to Federal agencies products that ``meet their requirements'' \nat prices that do not ``exceed current market prices.''\n  Indeed, FPI would appear to have a significant advantage in any head-\nto-head competition, since FPI pays inmates less than $2 an hour, far \nbelow the minimum wage and a small fraction of the wage paid to most \nprivate sector workers in competing industries.\n  The taxpayers also provide a direct subsidy to Federal Prison \nIndustries products by picking up the cost of feeding, clothing, and \nhousing the inmates who provide the labor. There is no reason why we \nshould provide an indirect subsidy as well, by requiring Federal \nagencies to purchase products from FPI even when they are more \nexpensive and of a lower quality than competing commercial items.\n  Yet, FPI remains unwilling to compete with the private sector, or \neven to permit Federal agencies to compare their products and prices \nwith those available in the private sector. Indeed, FPI recently \npublished a proposed rule which would expressly prohibit Federal \nagencies from conducting market research, as they would ordinarily do, \nto determine whether the price and quality of FPI products is \ncomparable to what is available in the commercial marketplace. Instead, \nfederal agencies are required to contact FPI, which will act as the \nsole arbiter of whether the product meets the agency's requirements. \nThe proposed rule states:\n\n       A contracting activity should not solicit bids, proposals, \n     quotations, or otherwise test the market for the purpose of \n     seeking alternative sources to FPI. . . . the contracting \n     officer or activity should contact FPI, and FPI will \n     determine . . . whether an agency's requirement can be met by \n     FPI.\n\n  The reason for FPI's position is obvious: it is much easier to gain \nmarket share by fiat than it is to compete for business. Under FPI's \ncurrent interpretation of the law, it need not offer the best product \nat the best price; it is sufficient for it to offer an adequate product \nat an adequate price, and insist upon its right to make the sale. \nIndeed, FPI currently advertises that it offers federal agencies ``ease \nin purchasing'' through ``a procurement with no bidding necessary.''\n  The result of the FPI's status as a mandatory source is not unlike \nthe result of other sole-source contracting: the taxpayers frequently \npay too much\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nand receive an inferior product for their money. When FPI sets its \nprices, it does not even attempt to match the best price available in \nthe commercial sector; instead, it claims to have charged a ``market \nprice'' whenever it can show that at least some vendors in the private \nsector charges as high a price. As GAO reported in August 1998, ``The \nonly limit the law imposes on FPI's price is that it may not exceed the \nupper end of the current market price range.''\n  Yet, FPI appears to have had difficulty providing even this minimal \nprotection for the taxpayer. GAO compared FPI prices for 20 \nrepresentative products to private vendors' catalog or actual prices \nfor the same or comparable products and found that for 4 of these \nproducts, FPI's price was higher than the price offered by any private \nvendor. Moreover, for five of the remaining products, FPI's price was \nat the ``high end of the range'' of prices offered by private vendors--\nranking sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth of the ten vendors reviewed, \nrespectively. In other words, for almost half of the FPI products \nreviewed, the FPI approach appeared to be to charge the highest price \npossible, rather than the lowest price possible, to the Federal \ncustomer.\n  One example of FPI overpricing was presented in a December 19, 1997 \nletter that I received from a frustrated vendor. The vendor stated:\n\n       If the Air Force would purchase a completed unit as \n     described in UNICOR's solicitation directly from a . . . . \n     manufacturer we estimate the cost will be approximately \n     $6,500.00. UNICOR is going to purchase a kit for $9,259.00 \n     and add their assembly and administrative costs to the unit. \n     If UNICOR only adds $1500.00 to the total cost of the unit, \n     it will cost the Air Force $10,759.00. This is 66 percent \n     higher than the current market price. If the Air Force \n     purchases 8,000 units over the next five years it will cost \n     the taxpayers an additional $34,072,000.00 over what it would \n     cost if they dealt directly with a manufacturer.\n\nA second frustrated vendor reported a similar experience to me. The \nvendor's letter stated:\n\n       [FPI] bid on this item and simply because [FPI] did, I was \n     told that the award had to be given to [FPI]. [FPI] won the \n     bid at $45 per unit. My company bid $22 per unit. The way I \n     see it, the government just overspent my tax dollars to the \n     tune of $1,978. The total amount of my bid was less than \n     that. Do you seriously believe that this type of procurement \n     is cost-effective?\n       I lost business, and my tax dollars were misused because of \n     unfair procurement practices mandated by federal regulations. \n     This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, \n     of how the procurement system is being misused and small \n     businesses in this country are being excluded from \n     competition, with the full support of federal regulations and \n     the seeming approval of Congress. It is far past the time to \n     curtail this `company' known as Federal prison Industries and \n     require them to be competitive for the benefit of all \n     taxpayers.\n\n  This kind of overpricing has a real and dramatic impact on the \nability of the Department of Defense to purchase the products that they \nneed to provide for the national defense and for the welfare of our men \nand women in uniform. For example, the Master Chief Petty Officer of \nthe Navy testified before the House National Security Committee on July \n30, 1996, and the FPI monopoly on government furniture contracts has \nundermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its \nsailors. Master Chief Petty Officer John Hagan stated, and I quote:\n\n       Speaking frankly, the [FPI] product is inferior, costs \n     more, and takes longer to procure. [FPI] has, in my opinion, \n     exploited their special status instead of making changes \n     which would make them more efficient and competitive. The \n     Navy and other Services need your support to change the law \n     and have FPI compete with [private sector] furniture \n     manufacturers [under GSA contracts]. Without this change, we \n     will not be serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most \n     effective and efficient way.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not consider my self to be an enemy of Federal \nPrison Industries. I am a strong supporter of the idea of putting \nfederal inmates to work. I understand that a strong prison work program \nnot only reduces inmate idleness and prison disruption, but can also \nhelp build a work ethic, provide job skills, and enable prisoners to \nreturn to product society upon their release.\n  However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a \nmanner that is sensitive to the need not to unfairly eliminate the jobs \nof hard-working citizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be \nable to achieve this result only if it diversifies its product lines \nand avoids the temptation to build its workforce by continuing to \ndisplace private sector jobs in its traditional lines of work. For this \nreason, I have been working since 1990 to try to help Federal Prison \nIndustries to identify new markets that it can expand into without \ndisplacing private sector jobs.\n  Mr. President, avoiding competition is the easy way out, but it isn't \nthe right way for FPI, it isn't the right way for the private sector \nworkers whose jobs FPI is taking, and it isn't the right way for the \ntaxpayer, who will continue to pay more and get less as a result of the \nmandatory preference for FPI goods. We need to have jobs for prisoners, \nbut can no longer afford to allow FPI to designate whose jobs it will \ntake, and when it will take them. Competition will be better for FPI, \nbetter for the taxpayer, and better for working men and women around \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"},

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REAUTHORIZING STATE AND LOCAL \n                   LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) as of December, 1998, the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services (COPS) Program had awarded grants for the hiring or \n     redeployment to the Nation's streets of more than 92,000 \n     police officers and sheriffs' deputies;\n       (2) according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the \n     United States Department of Justice, the Nation's violent \n     crime rate declined almost 7 percent during 1997, and has \n     fallen more than 21 percent since 1993;\n       (3) enhanced community policing, state enactment of truth \n     in sentencing laws requiring violent criminals to serve at \n     least 85 percent of their sentences, and increased reliance \n     on new crime detection and crime solving technology have \n     significantly contributed to this decline in the violent \n     crime rate;\n       (4) the policies and priorities of recent Congresses and \n     the Nation's governors have provided significant increases in \n     law enforcement funding and have enacted legislative \n     initiatives that have given federal and state prosecutors and \n     judges the tools to detect, prosecute, and punish violent \n     criminals;\n       (5) foremost among these federal funding initiatives have \n     been the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, the Violent \n     Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing Incentive \n     Grant program, and the Juvenile Offender Accountability \n     Incentive Block Grant program, which have distributed nearly \n     $5.7 billion in funding to State and local governments since \n     fiscal year 1996; and\n       (6) The President's FY 2000 budget provides zero funding \n     for each of the three crucial programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, the \n     Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant Program, the \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, the \n     Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing \n     Incentive Grants Program, the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n     Program, and the Byrne Memorial Grant program should be \n     reauthorized; and\n       (2) the COPS Program should be reauthorized and improved in \n     order to provide continued federal funding for the hiring, \n     deployment, and retention of community law enforcement \n     officers, to provide greater flexibility to state and local \n     authorities to purchase capital equipment, and to provide \n     greater incentives to state and local law enforcement to \n     invest in zero tolerance and crime tracking strategies used \n     successfully in New York City and elsewhere.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COLLINS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 247\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Ms. Collins for herself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Lieberman) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NEED-BASED STUDENT FINANCIAL \n                   AID PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested;\n       (2) higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals, as recipients of bachelor's degrees earn an \n     average of 75 percent per year more than those with high \n     school diplomas and experience half as much unemployment as \n     high school graduates;\n       (3) higher education promotes social opportunity, as \n     increased education is correlated with reduced criminal \n     activity, lessened reliance on public assistance, and \n     increased civic participation;\n       (4) a more educated workforce will be essential for \n     continued economic competitiveness in an age where the amount \n     of information available to society will double in a matter \n     of days rather than months or years;\n       (5) access to a college education has become a hallmark of \n     American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in \n     equality of opportunity;\n       (6) for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an established and effective means of providing access to \n     higher education for students with financial need;\n       (7) over the past decade, Pell Grant awards have failed to \n     keep pace with inflation, eroding their value and threatening \n     access to higher education for the nation's neediest \n     students;\n       (8) grant aid as a portion of all students financial aid \n     has fallen significantly over the past 5 years;\n       (9) the nation's neediest students are now borrowing \n     approximately as much as its wealthiest students to finance \n     higher education; and\n       (10) the percentage of freshmen attending public and \n     private 4-year institutions from families below national \n     median income has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that within the discretionary allocation provided to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate for function 500--\n       (1) the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grants should be \n     increased by $400;\n       (2) funding for the Federal Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grants Program should be increased by \n     $65,000,000;\n       (3) funding for the Federal capital contributions under the \n     Federal Perkins Loan Program should be increased by \n     $35,000,000;\n       (4) funding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance \n     Partnership Program should be increased by $50,000,000;\n       (5) funding for the Federal Work-Study Program should be \n     increased by $64,000,000;\n       (6) funding for the Federal TRIO Programs should be \n     increased by $100,000,000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3600-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MICROLOAN PROGRAM TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        KERRY AMENDMENT NO. 248\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for Mr. Kerry) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 440) \nto make technical corrections to the Microloan Program;

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRalph Boling for his service to the state of Kentucky and the people of \nHancock County. Ralph recently completed a special five-year term as \nHancock County's Judge/Executive, during which he led the county \nthrough a remarkable period of growth and progress.\n  Before beginning his political career, Ralph was a farmer and \nbusinessman in Hancock County, working as an oil field driller, farmer, \nHancock County Road Foreman and as the Hawesville Water Superintendent. \nHis work outside of public service gave him the advantage of having \nfirst-hand knowledge of the struggles of working families, and shaped \nhis desire to make a difference in the Hawesville community.\n  Following in his father's footsteps, Ralph's first endeavor in \npolitics was a run for Hancock County Sheriff. He ran successfully in \n1969, and again in 1977, serving two terms as Sheriff. In the final \nmonths of his second term, President Ronald Reagan appointed Ralph as a \nUnited States Marshal for the Western district of Kentucky. He excelled \nas a U.S. Marshal and received a second appointment under President \nReagan and a third appointment under President George Bush. During his \n12 years of service, Ralph received two of the highly distinguished \n``Awards for Excellent Performance.''\n  While Ralph was honored to work in the Marshal's service, and loved \nhis work under both President Reagan and President Bush's \nadministrations, after his third term he decided it was time to \nexclusively serve the people of Hancock County. Ralph ran for Hancock \nCounty Judge/Executive and was elected to serve a special five-year \nterm. Ralph always had the best interest of the county at heart, and \nencouraged the fiscal court to work together as a team despite \npolitical differences.\n  During his term as Judge/Executive, Ralph made great strides for \nHancock County. He successfully led the effort to close the county \nlandfill and was instrumental in assuring the construction of a new \nEmergency Services Building. The county also built a new fire station, \nand purchased additional fire trucks and police cruisers for increased \npublic safety.\n  One of Ralph's achievements as Judge/Executive was his successful \neffort to build and repair many county roads. During Ralph's last two \nyears as Judge, the fiscal court spent $2 million on Hancock roads, and \nobtained state funding to pave roads to Commonwealth Aluminum and \nWillamette and build bridges on Indian Hill and Goernig Road. He also \nhelped establish the Hancock County Career Center. Ralph envisioned a \nbright future for Hancock County's workers and businesses, and he \nbelieved this center would be to the long-term benefit of the county.\n  Ralph's term as Judge/Executive has ended, but Hancock County will \nfeel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. His motto \nwas ``Together we can make a difference,'' and he has certainly proven \nthis to be true. Ralph worked together with local law enforcement, \nstate government, the U.S. Marshal's service and the Fiscal Court to \nmake tremendous differences in people's lives. My colleagues and I \nthank you, Ralph, for your many years of service to Hancock County, the \nState of Kentucky and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3602-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3602-S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RUBY COHEN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto a unique and wonderful person who graced the State of Connecticut \nand who recently passed away at the age of 87, Mr. Rubin H. ``Ruby'' \nCohen.\n  Ruby hailed from Colchester, Connecticut. He accomplished a great \nmany things during his exceptional life. The son of Jewish immigrants, \nRuby made his mark at an early age. At 15 years old, after quitting \nschool, Ruby went to work at a local hot dog stand called Harry's Place \nin Colchester. Then at the age of 18, with $300 borrowed from \nrelatives, Ruby Cohen purchased Harry's Place, which eventually became \na popular stopping point for travelers making their way between \nConnecticut and the Rhode Island beaches in the summer.\n  Soon, Governors, State Legislators, and politicians were stopping in \nfor a bite to eat. It is at Harry's Place that my father, Thomas Dodd, \ncame to meet and befriend Ruby Cohen. My father deeply valued this very \nspecial man who was always honest with his opinions and supportive \nthroughout their many years of friendship.\n  However, politicians did not go to Harry's Place simply to enjoy a \nhot dog, but to rub elbows with one of Connecticut's most influential \nlawmakers. Unassuming in his presence, Ruby Cohen was, in fact, \nconsidered a powerful political insider. He began his political career \nin 1942 when he was first elected to the state House of \nRepresentatives. His popularity with the voters of Colchester earned \nhim 14 more terms in office during which he became the first Democrat \nin 85 years to become the House Chairman of the Appropriations \ncommittee, a position he held for 12 years.\n  It was during his tenure as Chairman that Ruby Cohen distinguished \nhimself as a legislator and also aided a cultural renaissance in my \nhometown of East Haddam. Back in 1959, The Goodspeed Opera House, which \nsits quietly on the Connecticut River just a short distance from my \nhome, was a dilapidated state-operated garage in dire need of repairs. \nWhen Ruby Cohen was approached by one of his colleagues in the House \nwho expressed a desire to renovate the structure, Ruby seized an \nopportunity to enhance a community. He drafted a bill appropriating \n$10,000 for the repair of the building's roof, successfully beginning \nthe creation of the Opera House. Today, the Goodspeed Opera House is a \nnationally renowned theater with a reputation for excellence in the \narts. We have Ruby Cohen to thank for recognizing the value and \nimportance of the arts within a community and for providing this quiet \nConnecticut town with an artistic outlet.\n  Ruby will also be remembered for his commitment to preserving \nConnecticut's open spaces well before it became an issue of national \nimportance. He played an integral role in the establishment of one of \nConnecticut's better-known refuges, Gay City State Park in Hebron. He \nspearheaded the restoration of the Comstock Bridge in East Hampton. \nAlso on his list of accomplishments is the preservation of the Gelston \nHouse, a historic hotel which stands next to the Goodspeed Opera House.\n  Mr. President, Ruby Cohen was an honest man from meager beginnings\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nwho went on to establish a reputation in Connecticut as a respected \nlawmaker and friend. His death is a difficult loss for those who relied \non his political wisdom and personal support. Even with his passing, we \nall may be comforted in the thought that his spirit and memory may be \nfound in so many ways throughout a state he held so dear. He is \nsurvived by his two sons, David and Max, three daughters, Susan, \nMargaret, and Mary Ann, nine grandchildren, and one great-\ngranddaughter. I offer my heartfelt condolences to each of \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO PAUL SLATER OF LONDONDERRY, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

His unwavering commitment to the organization, its \nmission, and its activism within the community propelled hi to the \nclub's Board of Directors during the summer of 1996. Today, Paul serves \nas both the Treasurer and Secretary of the Londonderry Lions Club.\n  Dedicated to social and humanitarian causes, Lions Club International \nis the world's largest service organization. With its primary focus on \nthe needs of the blind and visually impaired, the mission of Lions Club \nInternational also extends to the needs of each chapter's respective \ncommunities. In addition to advancing the club's mission by organizing \nyearly yard sales and fund-raising dinners, Paul continuously works \ntowards the betterment of his community and state.\n  Every year since his induction as a member of the Londonderry Lions \nClub, Paul has helped organize and distribute Christmas and \nThanksgiving baskets to those who are less fortunate in the Town of \nLondonderry. His biggest contribution to the organization and the \npeople of New Hampshire, however, has been through his tireless effort \ntowards improving Lions Camp Pride. Camp Pride, located in New Durham, \nNew Hampshire, is a summer camp for children and adults with mild \nthrough profound special needs.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nLoyola University, New Orleans Law School's Moot Court team for their \nperformance in the American University Burton D. Wechsler First \nAmendment Competition. The competition is designed to showcase the \ndedication and talent of law school students from across the country, \nand the Loyola students displayed a great deal of both in their \nvictorious efforts.\n  Moot Court Competitions are an opportunity for law school students to \ndemonstrate their talents as advocates in an appellate court setting. \nThey tackle a difficult legal problem in a written brief and then are \nsubject to the grueling ordeal of probing and questioning by a panel of \nappellate court judges. The Burton Wechsler First Amendment Competition \nasked competitors to argue the complex question of the use of languages \nother than English while conducting government business. I am proud to \nsay that our team from Loyola University took this challenge and used \nit as an opportunity to excel.\n  The team of Steven Griffith, Gaven Dall Kammer, Christopher Alfieri, \nElisia Shofstahl, and faculty advisor, Prof, Mitch Crusto, took overall \nfirst place honors in the competition. Loyola defeated five highly-\nregarded opponents on their way to the title. Other honors garnered by \nthe Loyola team included first place ``Best Brief'' and the ``Runner-Up \nBest Oralist'' award, won by Elisia Shofstahl. Loyola's fine \nperformance in this prestigious national competition represents the \nvery best in effort and education.\n  The team's impressive victory is a testament to the hard work and \ninherent skill of Loyola's fine law students. Such effort and success \nis worthy of our admiration and praise. Again, I congratulate the \nmembers of Loyola's Moot Court Team on their victory at American \nUniversity's First Amendment Competition, and wish them the best of \nluck in their future competitions and careers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3603-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA BARR\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Vermonter, Patricia Barr, of North Bennington, Vermont. \nPat's commitment to improving the health status of Vermonters and all \nAmericans, serves as a model to us all. She is a stunning example of \nhow one person can have a positive effect on many others.\n  Over the course of her life, she has been an advocate and strategic \nplanner for breast cancer research and ethical issues. Pat has \ntirelessly championed these causes and for that, we are forever \ngrateful.\n  Pat has served on the national Breast Cancer Coalition Board, and \ncurrently serves as President of the Breast Cancer Network, which she \nfounded in 1993. Her devotion to health, medical and ethical issues has \nlanded her numerous other roles and responsibilities, including \npositions on the Center for Disease Control's Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection and Control Advisory Committee, the Human Genome \nProject's Task Force on Genetic Testing, and the National Cancer \nInstitute's (NCI) Breast Cancer Progress Review Group. She has also \nserved on NCI's Cancer Genetics Working Group, and the National Action \nPlan on Breast Cancer's Biological Resources Working Group Subcommittee \non Ethical Issues. In these and in other capacities, Pat has made \nnumerous presentations in Vermont, throughout the Nation, and even \noutside of the country, regarding ethical and cancer issues.\n  Through word and action, Pat has touched, and improved, the lives of \nmany individuals. Of all those who have crossed my path over the years, \nfew individuals have such a distinguished and proven track record of \ncommitment to breast cancer and related issues. By helping to educate, \npromote and advocate for change through newsletters, grant programs, \nsupport groups, projects such as the Ladies First Program, and lobbying \npublic officials, Pat's involvement helped blaze the trail for success.\n  We have been well served by Pat and look forward to her continued \nleadership. Vermonters, and all Americans, owe her a debt of gratitude \nfor her passionate, steadfast work on these vitally important \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3603-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3603-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 767\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Con. Res. 172\n\n       Whereas April 10, 1999, will mark the 20th anniversary of \n     the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in \n     public law the basis for continued commercial, cultural, and \n     other relations between the United States and democratic \n     Republic of China on Taiwan;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act was advanced by Congress \n     and supported by the executive branch as a critical tool to \n     preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly \n     commercial, cultural, and other relations between the United \n     States and Taiwan;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act has been instrumental in \n     maintaining peace, security, and stability in the Taiwan \n     Strait since its enactment in 1979;\n       Whereas, when the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted, it \n     reaffirmed that the United States decision to establish \n     diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China is \n     based upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be \n     determined by peaceful means;\n       Whereas officials of the People's Republic of China refuse \n     to renounce the use of force against Taiwan;\n       Whereas the defense modernization and weapons procurement \n     efforts by the People's Republic of China, as documented in \n     the February 1, 1999, report by the Secretary of Defense on \n     ``The Security Situation in the Taiwan Strait'', could \n     threaten cross-strait and East Asian stability and United \n     States interests in the East Asia region;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act provides explicit \n     guarantees that the United States will make available defense \n     articles and defense services in such quantities as may be \n     necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act requires timely reviews by \n     United States military authorities of Taiwan's defense needs \n     in connection with recommendations to the President and \n     Congress;\n       Whereas Congress and the President are committed by section \n     3(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3302(b)) to \n     determine the nature and quantity of what Taiwan's legitimate \n     needs are for its self-defense;\n       Whereas Taiwan routinely makes informal requests for \n     defense articles and defense services to United States \n     Government officials, which are discouraged or declined \n     informally by United States Government personnel;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to reject any \n     attempt to curb the provision by the United States of defense \n     articles and defense services legitimately needed for \n     Taiwan's self-defense;\n       Whereas it is the current executive branch policy to limit \n     most high-level dialog regarding regional stability with \n     Taiwan senior military officials;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act sets forth the policy to \n     promote extensive commercial relations between the people of \n     the United States and the people on Taiwan, and that policy \n     is advanced by membership in the World Trade Organization;\n       Whereas Taiwan completed its bilateral market access \n     negotiations with the United States on February 20, 1998, and \n     all countries which asked to negotiate bilateral agreements \n     with Taiwan have concluded those agreements, although Canada \n     has reopened negotiations on certain products;\n       Whereas the human rights provisions in the Taiwan Relations \n     Act helped stimulate the democratization of Taiwan;\n       Whereas Taiwan today is a full-fledged, multiparty \n     democracy that fully respects human rights and civil \n     liberties and, as such, serves as a successful model of \n     democratic reform for the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas it is the policy of the United States to promote \n     extensive cultural relations between the United States and \n     Taiwan, ties that should be further encouraged and expanded;\n       Whereas any attempt to determine Taiwan's future by other \n     than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, would \n     be considered as a threat to the peace and security of the \n     Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States;\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act established the American \n     Institute in Taiwan to carry out the programs, transactions, \n     and other relations of the United States with respect to \n     Taiwan;

RECONCILIATION.\n\n       Not later than September 30, 1999, the House Committee on \n     Ways and Means shall report to the House a reconciliation \n     bill that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     such that the total level of revenues is not less than: \n     $1,408,500,000,000 in revenues for fiscal year 2000, \n     $7,416,800,000,000 in revenues for fiscal years 2000 through \n     2004, and $16,155,700,000,000 in revenues for fiscal years \n     2000 through 2009.\n\n     SEC. 5. SAFE DEPOSIT BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the social \n     security trust funds are off-budget for purposes of the \n     President's budget submission and the concurrent resolution \n     on the budget;\n       (2) the social security trust funds have been running \n     surpluses for 17 years;\n       (3) these surpluses have been used to implicitly finance \n     the general operations of the Federal Government;\n       (4) in fiscal year 2000, the social security surplus will \n     exceed $137 billion;\n       (5) for the first time, a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget balances the Federal budget without counting social \n     security surpluses; and\n       (6) the only way to ensure that social security surpluses \n     are not diverted for other purposes is to balance the budget \n     exclusive of such surpluses.\n       (b) Point of Order.--(1) It shall not be in order in the \n     House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget, or any amendment thereto \n     or conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for \n     any fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, a deficit \n     shall be the level (if any) set forth in the most recently \n     agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal \n     year pursuant to section 301(a)(3) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974. In setting forth the deficit level \n     pursuant to such section, that level shall not include any \n     adjustments in aggregates that would be made pursuant to any \n     reserve fund that provides for adjustments in allocations and \n     aggregates for legislation that enhances retirement security \n     or extends the solvency of the Medicare trust funds or makes \n     such changes in the Medicare payment or benefit structure as \n     are necessary.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) may be waived in the Senate only by the \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members voting.\n       (c) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) beginning with fiscal year 2000, legislation should be \n     enacted to require any official statement issued by the \n     Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, or any other agency or instrumentality of the \n     Government of surplus or deficit totals of the budget of the \n     Government as submitted by the President or of the surplus or \n     deficit totals of the congressional budget, and any \n     description of, or reference to, such totals in any official \n     publication or material issued by either of such offices or \n     any other such agency or instrumentality, should exclude the \n     outlays and receipts of the old-age, survivors, and \n     disability insurance program under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (including the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund) and the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (2) legislation should be considered to augment subsection \n     (b) by--\n       (A) taking such steps as may be required to safeguard the \n     social security surpluses, such as statutory changes \n     equivalent to the reserve fund for retirement security and \n     Medicare set forth in section 6; or\n       (B) otherwise establishing a statutory limit on debt held \n     by the public and reducing such limit by the amounts of the \n     social security surpluses.\n\n     SEC. 6. RESERVE FUND FOR RETIREMENT SECURITY AND, AS NEEDED, \n                   MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Retirement Security.--Whenever the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House reports a bill, or an amendment \n     thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon is \n     submitted that enhances retirement security, the chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may--\n       (1) increase the appropriate allocations for each of fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2004 and aggregates for each of fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2009 of new budget authority and outlays \n     by the amount of new budget authority provided by such \n     measure (and outlays flowing therefrom) for such fiscal year \n     for that purpose; and\n       (2) reduce the revenue aggregates for each of fiscal years \n     2000 through 2009 by the amount of the revenue loss resulting \n     from that measure for such fiscal year for that purpose.\n       (b) Medicare Program.--Whenever the Committee on Ways and \n     Means or the Committee on Commerce of the House reports a \n     bill, or an amendment thereto is offered, or a conference \n     report thereon is submitted that extends the solvency or \n     reforms the benefit or payment structure of the Medicare \n     Program, including any measure in response to the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, the chairman \n     of the Committee on the Budget may increase the appropriate \n     allocations and aggregates of new budget authority and \n     outlays by the amounts provided in that bill for that \n     purpose.\n       (c) Limitation.--(1) The chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget may only make adjustments under subsection (a) or (b) \n     if the\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\n     net outlay increase plus revenue reduction resulting from any \n     measure referred to in those subsections (including any prior \n     adjustments made for any other such measure) for fiscal year \n     2000, the period of fiscal years 2000 through 2004, or the \n     period of fiscal years 2000 through 2009 is not greater than \n     an amount equal to the projected social security surplus for \n     such period, as set forth in the joint explanatory statement \n     of managers accompanying this concurrent resolution or, if \n     published, the midsession review for fiscal year 2000 of the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office. For purposes of \n     the preceding sentence, revenue reductions shall be treated \n     as a positive number.\n       (2) In the midsession review for fiscal year 2000, the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation \n     with the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund, shall make an up-to-date estimate of \n     the projected surpluses in the social security trust funds \n     for fiscal year 2000, for the period of fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2004, and for the period of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2009.\n       (3) As used in this subsection, the term ``social security \n     trust funds'' means the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 7. RESERVE FUND FOR PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED UNDER THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the House, when the Committee on \n     Appropriations reports a bill or joint resolution, or an \n     amendment thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that provides new budget authority for fiscal \n     year 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 for programs authorized \n     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), \n     the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may increase the \n     appropriate allocations and aggregates of new budget \n     authority and outlays by an amount not to exceed the amount \n     of new budget authority provided by that measure (and outlays \n     flowing therefrom) for that purpose up to the maximum amount \n     consistent with section 611(a) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(2)).\n       (b) Adjustments.--The adjustments in outlays (and the \n     corresponding amount of new budget authority) made under \n     subsection (a) for any fiscal year may not exceed the amount \n     by which an up-to-date projection of the on-budget surplus \n     made by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office for \n     that fiscal year exceeds the on-budget surplus for that \n     fiscal year set forth in section 2(4) of this resolution.\n       (c) CBO Projections.--Upon the request of the chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget of the House, the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office shall make an up-to-date estimate \n     of the projected on-budget surplus for the applicable fiscal \n     year.\n\n     SEC. 8. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS AND \n                   AGGREGATES.\n\n       (a) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and \n     aggregates made pursuant to this resolution for any measure \n     shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 9. UPDATED CBO PROJECTIONS.\n\n       Each calendar quarter the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office shall make an up-to-date estimate of receipts, \n     outlays and surplus (on-budget and off-budget) for the \n     current fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 10. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE COMMISSION ON \n                   INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) persecution of individuals on the sole ground of their \n     religious beliefs and practices occurs in countries around \n     the world and affects millions of lives;\n       (2) such persecution violates international norms of human \n     rights, including those established in the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, and the \n     Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance \n     and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief;\n       (3) such persecution is abhorrent to all Americans, and our \n     very Nation was founded on the principle of the freedom to \n     worship according to the dictates of our conscience; and\n       (4) in 1998 Congress unanimously passed, and President \n     Clinton signed into law, the International Religious Freedom \n     Act of 1998, which established the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom to monitor facts and \n     circumstances of violations of religious freedom and \n     authorized $3,000,000 to carry out the functions of the \n     Commission for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution assumes that $3,000,000 will be \n     appropriated within function 150 for fiscal year 2000 for the \n     United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \n     to carry out its duties; and\n       (2) the House Committee on Appropriations is strongly urged \n     to appropriate such amount for the Commission.\n\n     SEC. 11.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   AND PRESERVING HOME HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL \n                   MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) Access to Health Insurance.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) 43.4 million Americans are currently without health \n     insurance, and that this number is expected to rise to nearly \n     60 million people in the next 10 years;\n       (B) the cost of health insurance continues to rise, a key \n     factor in increasing the number of uninsured; and\n       (C) there is a consensus that working Americans and their \n     families and children will suffer from reduced access to \n     health insurance.\n       (2) Sense of the Congress on Improving Access to Health \n     Care Insurance.--It is the sense of the Congress that access \n     to affordable health care coverage for all Americans is a \n     priority of the 106th Congress.\n       (b) Preserving Home Health Service For All Medicare \n     Beneficiaries.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reformed Medicare home \n     health care spending by instructing the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to implement a prospective payment system and \n     instituted an interim payment system to achieve savings;\n       (B) the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, reformed the interim payment system \n     to increase reimbursements to low-cost providers, added $900 \n     million in funding, and delayed the automatic 15 percent \n     payment reduction for one year, to October 1, 2000; and\n       (C) patients whose care is more extensive and expensive \n     than the typical Medicare patient do not receive supplemental \n     payments in the interim payment system but will receive \n     special protection in the home health care prospective \n     payment system.\n       (2) Sense of the congress on access to home health care.--\n     It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) Congress recognizes the importance of home health care \n     for seniors and disabled citizens;\n       (B) Congress and the Administration should work together to \n     maintain quality care for patients whose care is more \n     extensive and expensive than the typical Medicare patient, \n     including the sickest and frailest Medicare beneficiaries, \n     while home health care agencies operate in the interim \n     payment system; and\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n       (C) Congress and the Administration should work together to \n     avoid the implementation of the 15 percent reduction in the \n     interim payment system and ensure timely implementation of \n     the prospective payment system.\n\n     SEC. 14. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON MEDICARE PAYMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds that--\n       (1) a goal of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was to expand \n     options for Medicare beneficiaries under the new \n     Medicare+Choice program;\n       (2) Medicare+Choice was intended to make these choices \n     available to all Medicare beneficiaries; and unfortunately, \n     during the first two years of the Medicare+Choice program the \n     blended payment was not implemented, stifling health care \n     options and continuing regional disparity among many counties \n     across the United States; and\n       (3) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 also established the \n     National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to \n     develop legislative recommendations to address the long-term \n     funding challenges facing Medicare.\n       (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that \n     this resolution assumes that funding of the Medicare+Choice \n     program is a priority for the House Committee on the Budget \n     before financing new programs and benefits that may \n     potentially add to the imbalance of payments and benefits in \n     Fee-for-Service Medicare and Medicare+Choice.\n\n     SEC. 15. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON ASSESSMENT OF WELFARE-TO-WORK \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the sense of the House that, \n     recognizing the need to maximize the benefit of the Welfare-\n     to-Work Program, the Secretary of Labor should prepare a \n     report on Welfare-to-Work Programs pursuant to section \n     403(a)(5) of the Social Security Act. This report should \n     include information on the following--\n       (1) the extent to which the funds available under such \n     section have been used (including the number of States that \n     have not used any of such funds), the types of programs that \n     have received such funds, the number of and characteristics \n     of the recipients of assistance under such programs, the \n     goals of such programs, the duration of such programs, the \n     costs of such programs, any evidence of the effects of such \n     programs on such recipients, and accounting of the total \n     amount expended by the States from such funds, and the rate \n     at which the Secretary expects such funds to be expended for \n     each of the fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002;\n       (2) with regard to the unused funds allocated for Welfare-\n     to-Work for each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999, identify \n     areas of the Nation that have unmet needs for Welfare-to-Work \n     initiatives; and\n       (3) identify possible Congressional action that may be \n     taken to reprogram Welfare-to-Work funds from States that \n     have not utilized previously allocated funds to places of \n     unmet need, including those States that have rejected or \n     otherwise not utilized prior funding.\n       (b) Report.--It is the sense of the House that, not later \n     than January 1, 2000, the Secretary of Labor should submit to \n     the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Ways and \n     Means of the House and the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate, in writing, the report described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 16. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON PROVIDING HONOR GUARD \n                   SERVICES FOR VETERANS' FUNERALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that all relevant \n     congressional committees should make every effort to provide \n     sufficient resources so that an Honor Guard, if requested, is \n     available for veterans' funerals.\n\n     SEC. 17. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON CHILD NUTRITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) both Republicans and Democrats understand that an \n     adequate diet and proper nutrition are essential to a child's \n     general well-being;\n       (2) the lack of an adequate diet and proper nutrition may \n     adversely affect a child's ability to perform up to his or \n     her ability in school;\n       (3) the Government currently plays a role in funding school \n     nutrition programs; and\n       (4) there is a bipartisan commitment to helping children \n     learn.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the \n     Committee on Agriculture should examine our Nation's \n     nutrition programs to determine if they can be improved, \n     particularly with respect to services to low-income children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/12/senate-section/article/S3610-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n  The text of H.
