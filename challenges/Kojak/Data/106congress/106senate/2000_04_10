Mr. President, we were able to work our way through the \nbudget this past week. It took a lot of time and cooperation, but I \nthink we were able to make a lot of headway. We are disappointed that a \nnumber of our amendments were not adopted.\n  The good news--and I think we should focus on this a little bit this \nmorning--is the fact that gas prices are actually declining, on an \naverage of almost 3 cents a gallon this past week. There is a long way \nto go to decline to where they first started picking up, but progress \nhas been made.\n  With the vote on the gas tax bill coming up this week, I think we \nshould recognize that the crisis we did see is certainly being \ndiminished, if not alleviated. No one is happy about the cost of a \ngallon of gasoline. I stopped over the weekend with my daughter, and \nshe filled up their vehicle's gas tank and commented about the price of \ngasoline. That is the way it is. Gas is too high. However, what we are \nattempting to do this week is something we should reexamine. We should \nrecognize that if this bill is passed by the Senate, it will either be \nheld at the desk indefinitely or would be what we call blue slipped, if \nit is sent to the House of Representatives.\n  We should focus on things other than this legislation. For example, \nif the majority is serious about this matter, we could call up H.R. \n3081, the House-passed tax bill which concerns the minimum wage. That \nis on the Senate Calendar. We could work on that. That would allow \nother amendments to be offered that are meaningful.\n  There isn't anyone in this body who does not want to see a decrease \nin the cost of fuel prices. Simply stated, this is not the way to go \nabout it. OPEC has signaled its willingness to produce more oil. Non-\nOPEC nations have agreed to contribute some 700,000 barrels a day to \nalleviate this crisis.\n  We would be better off focusing on doing things so we are not as \ndependent on foreign oil. We have to import 55 percent of the oil we \nconsume in this country. For example, we need to do something to make \nsure that the oil that is produced in Alaska is used in the United \nStates and not shipped to Asia. We have to do something to make sure we \ndevelop a long-term energy policy and do something with alternative \nfuels. Solar, wind, and geothermal are areas we need to explore. We \nhave spent very small amounts of money each year on hydrogen fuel \ndevelopment; this, some day, will overtake the fossil fuels that we \nuse.\n  There are a lot of things we need to do. One of the things we need \nnot do is try to explain to the American public that we are doing \nsomething by reducing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for part of this year. \nNo. 1, in a number of States, if the Federal tax is knocked off, the \nStates are obligated by law to pick up that extra 4.3 cents, or \nwhatever it is, that the Federal Government knocks off.\n  In short, I think we could be using this time in a much more \nproductive fashion than debating the 4.3-cent-per gallon tax reduction \nwhich is cosmetic in nature only and is certainly not even a short-term \nfix.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came to the floor today as we begin \nbusiness this week to talk about two issues. First, let me describe \nwhat happened Saturday evening on the east coast. There was a hockey \nteam from the University of North Dakota that went to the east coast to \nplay in the NCAA Division I hockey championship. When they finished \nthat competition, the North Dakota Sioux were Division I national \nchampions once again. In fact, it is the seventh Division I national \nchampionship for the University of North Dakota hockey team.\n  I am an alumnus of that great school, and it was with great pride I \nwatched the game on television last Saturday evening and saw the North \nDakota Fighting Sioux win that contest. We are the home of great \nskaters, great hockey players, and great tradition. This year, once \nagain, we demonstrated that you don't have to have a 40,000-student \npopulation to be a Division I national champion.\n  I called the White House this morning and asked if they would invite \nthat team to the White House, as is often the custom for championship \nteams--college football, basketball, and other teams, including \nprofessional teams who have been invited to the White House by the \nPresident to say congratulations to them. I hope he will do the same \nfor this wonderful group of young men from North Dakota who are now \nthis Nation's champions in Division I hockey.\n  So my hat is off to the University of North Dakota. It is a wonderful \nschool. I am proud to have gotten my undergraduate degree there. I am \nincreasingly proud year after year as I watch that school. Not only are \nthey great athletes and hockey players, these are also great students \nand good young men. This is an athletic program without parallel around \nthe country, in my judgment. Again, I congratulate those young men. I \nam very proud of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2450-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2450-S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will discuss for a moment the issues \nthat face the Congress, where we are and why we are here, and suggest \nperhaps a slightly more robust agenda for the next couple of months.\n  It is now a Monday in April, and it is not quite clear to me what the \nagenda will be on the floor of the Senate this week. I guess it is not \nquite clear yet to anyone. We know that in the coming weeks we will do \nour work as appropriators. I am on the Appropriations Committee, and we \nwill do our work as appropriators and bring appropriations bills to the \nfloor of the Senate, and there are some authorization bills that must \nget done. But beyond that, it is not quite clear what the agenda is.\n  Recognizing that my political party, the one I represent in this \nChamber, did not win the election, it is also clear we don't set the \nagenda in the Senate. The political system has a unique way of \ndescribing who controls institutions such as this. And those who have \nthe most members, who get the most votes in a general election, have \nthe opportunity to control and create an agenda. That is as it should \nbe. But it is perhaps frustrating for me and others that our agenda is \nnot nearly as robust as it could or should be.\n\n  Let me describe some of the things I think we ought to be doing and \nthat I hope the majority leader and others will agree at some point in \nthe coming weeks that we will do.\n  First, we passed some long time ago a Patients' Bill of Rights. I \ndidn't support the Senate version of it because I didn't think it was a \ngood bill. But the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan piece \nof legislation coauthored by a Democrat and a Republican in the House \nof Representatives. It was a very vigorous battle in the House. They \npassed a real Patients' Bill of Rights bill.\n  It says in this contest of wills between patients, doctors, the \ninsurance companies, and HMOs, that there are certain rights that \npatients ought to have.\n  Every patient in this country who seeks medical treatment ought to \nhave the right to understand all of their options for medical \ntreatment--not just what's the least expensive.\n  Those who need emergency room treatment ought to be able to expect to \nhave emergency room treatment when needed.\n  When a woman falls off a 40-foot cliff and is hauled into an \nemergency room comatose, and then the HMO later says: We will not \napprove your emergency room cost because you didn't get preapproval for \nemergency room treatment--there is something wrong with the system.\n  Are there certain rights that patients ought to have in this health \ncare system? The answer yes. Among those are the rights embodied in the \nbill in the House of Representatives called the Patients' Bill of \nRights. It is now in conference. It is not likely to produce 67 votes, \nunfortunately, under current circumstances because the House-appointed \nconferees, who in most cases didn't vote for the bill, sent it to \nconference.\n  The Senate, of course, has a piece of legislation that does not do \nthe job. But those of us who support a strong Patients' Bill of Rights \nremain hopeful that between now and the end of this legislative session \nwe will pass a bipartisan piece of legislation called a Patients' Bill \nof Rights that really provides the rights and the assistance to \npatients in dealing with their insurance companies with respect to \ntheir health care treatment.\n  Juvenile justice: We passed a juvenile justice bill in the Senate. \nThat bill was passed in Senate legislation that many do not like.\n  Among the two pieces of legislation that people do not like on that \nbill--and the reason I guess it is stalled--is some legislation dealing \nwith guns. We provided two simple components to that piece of \nlegislation.\n  I come from North Dakota. I grew up hunting. I had a gun when I was a \nteenager. I pheasant hunted, I deer hunted, and practiced target \nshooting. I know about guns. I am not somebody running into this \nChamber saying let's have gun control. That is not my orientation at \nall.\n  But the two pieces dealing with guns that we added to the Juvenile \nJustice Act are so sensible. One is mandatory trigger locks for \nhandguns. When 6-year-olds go to school and shoot another 6-year-old, \nought we not to understand the need for trigger locks on handguns? It \nseems to me that is eminently sensible.\n  Second, the issue of gun shows, and the question of whether at gun \nshows that people set up around this country on Saturdays or Sundays \nthere ought to be an instant check when guns are sold to find out \nwhether you are selling a gun to a convicted felon.\n  Go to a gun store anywhere in this country and try to buy a gun. They \nare going to run your name through an instant check to find out if you \nare a convicted felon because if you are, you cannot buy a gun. But we \nhave a loophole at gun shows which are big, and getting bigger. There \nare more of them. Many feel--including the Senate, incidentally, by a \nrather close vote--that we ought to have the opportunity to close that \nloophole and say if you are\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\ngoing to buy a gun, it does not matter whether it is in a gun store or \nat a gun show, you ought to have to have your name run through an \ninstant check so we can make sure we are not selling a gun to a felon.\n\n  Those two issues--trigger locks for handguns for the safety of \nchildren in this country, and closing the gun show loophole--have meant \nthat the juvenile justice bill, which is so important, is now in \nconference, and apparently we can't get it out. I hope we can be more \nsensible about this and get that bill out of conference, bring it to \nthe floor of the Senate and the House, and get it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  There are other items we continue to struggle with, such as the issue \nof school construction.\n  I have spoken at great length about walking into the Cannon Ball \nSchool and seeing little Rosie Two Bears, a third grader, who says: Mr. \nSenator, are you going to build me a new school?\n  I said: No, I don't have the money to build you a new school, Rosie.\n  This is a school with 150 kids, one water fountain, two toilets, and \nclosings of the school building which is not fit for classes, where \nsewer gas comes up and they have to evacuate the rooms. Rosie isn't \ngetting the kind of education we want for her as an American.\n  When we say let's help rebuild, renovate, and construct some of \nAmerica's schools to bring them back up to standard, we are told, no. \nYou can't do that. That is not the Federal Government's job.\n  It is interesting. There was a piece in Newsweek by Jonathan Alter, a \nrather interesting columnist. He said about 4 or 5 years ago the \nCongress decided they were going to spend $8 billion to upgrade jails \nand prisons. The State and local governments absolutely spent the money \nfor jails and prisons. The Federal Government can upgrade the jails and \nprisons but not the schools. Is it less important to bring schools up \nto standard than a jail or a prison somewhere?\n  If we can spend $8 billion to improve places to incarcerate \ncriminals, we ought to be able to spend a few billion dollars to help \nkids go into a classroom door in a school that we as parents could be \nproud of. That ought to be done in this session of the Congress as \nwell.\n  Judicial nominations, we want to get through. We don't have a \ncommittee in this Congress for lost and found. Almost everywhere else--\nhotels, airports, every other institution--when you lose something and \nask where the lost and found is, they send you there. There is a lost \nand found over there. In Congress there is no place you can go to the \nlost and found. Maybe we need a committee on the lost and found. When \nthese policy issues leave here, you never hear from them again.\n  I hope that in the coming days Republicans and Democrats together can \ndecide that there are certain common elements to an agenda that will \nstrengthen this country and make this a better place in which to live. \nI don't believe that we have a circumstance where one side of the \npolitical aisle is all right, and the other side all wrong. That is not \nthe case. We have good men and women serving in this Chamber on both \nsides of the political aisle. But it remains a frustration that in some \nareas where we have passed legislation, it gets sent to a conference \nsomewhere never to be seen again because a small minority refuses to \naccept sensible judgments of the majority in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  I think that is the case with the Patients' Bill of Rights with \nrespect to the vote in the House, and certainly is the case with \njuvenile justice and decisions in the Senate on things such as trigger \nlocks and also closing the gun show loophole.\n  I hope we can find a way to address some of these important issues in \nthe coming weeks and months.\n  I hope we can demonstrate to the American people that we care about \neducation and health care, address the crime issue in a thoughtful way, \nget nominations through this Chamber, and appoint Federal judges to \nfill vacancies, which are things that represent part of the agenda that \nneeds to be completed as soon as possible in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will talk a few minutes about the schedule \nfor the week and then comment specifically on some of the issues we \nwill be addressing during the schedule for Tuesday, Wednesday, and \nThursday.\n  We have several important issues before the Senate to take up and \nhopefully complete action on. One of them is the question of our \nnational energy policy. That will be brought to the Senate during the \nday on Tuesday with a vote on the gas tax issue.\n  Following that, we will be discussing the marriage penalty tax. This \npast Saturday, I had occasion to be in a store and one of the other \ncustomers asked me: Are we finally going to get rid of the unfair \nmarriage penalty tax? I said we would try to and hoped to do it this \nweek.\n  I went on about my business and the customer went on about his. The \ncustomer came back later and said: Do you think you actually will begin \nto eliminate the very unfair tax? I said: That is what we are trying to \ndo.\n  Then he came back a third time and said: You are going to have a vote \nnext week? I said: Yes, we are. He asked if he could get the names of \nthose voting against getting rid of the unfair tax. I said: Yes, it \nwill be in the Record. Call my office; we will be glad to get it to \nyou.\n  That is what we hear in the real world, off of Capitol Hill. People \nsay this is a real problem.\n  We have been talking about eliminating the marriage penalty tax for \nyears. It is time we get it done. We will have that debate on Wednesday \nand, I presume, a vote Wednesday or Thursday to see exactly where the \nSenate is: Do we want to eliminate the marriage penalty tax or not? I \nthink we should. I certainly will vote that way.\n\n  Before the week is out, we hope to take up a number of Executive \nCalendar nominations. We have a number of nominations that we should be \nable to clear. We will work with interested Senators and committees \ninvolved on both sides of the aisle to see if we can clear a number of \nthese nominations.\n  Last and certainly not least is the fact we will also want to \ncomplete action on the conference on the budget. We completed action on \nthe budget resolution of the Senate on Friday. I understand the \nconferees will be working together during the next 2 days, hopefully, \nto file the necessary report by Tuesday night. Then we will have the \nnecessary debate, whatever time that might be. It could be up to as \nmuch as 10 hours. Then we will have a vote on that conference report \nThursday evening or Friday morning.\n  That leads me to another point I want to be sure to make early in the \nweek. As I have notified Senators in the past, during these weeks right \nbefore a recess--in this case the Easter recess--we will go home and be \nwith our constituents and families. Senators should anticipate the \npossibility or even the likelihood of votes on Friday. If we can \ncomplete the work I have outlined by Thursday night then we will not be \nin session on Friday. But if for some reason we have not been able to \ncomplete at least the vote on the conference report on the budget, then \nwe will be in session on Friday. We certainly hope to finish it by noon \non Friday, but that will depend on how much time is needed and when the \nSenate wishes to get to a final vote.\n  I wanted to go over the schedule for the week so Senators know what \nto anticipate on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the possibility even \nof Friday votes on the budget resolution conference report.\n  Now let me go back and talk about some of these issues, to try to \nmake clear what I am trying to do by moving\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\nthese bills, and explain what the situation is with regard to the gas \ntax, for instance.\n  There have been those who said the Senate voted last week during the \ndebate on the budget resolution on a sense of the Senate that basically \nthe Senate would not temporarily suspend or in any way remove the gas \ntax.\n  The Federal gasoline tax is 4.3 cents a gallon. That was added back \nin 1993. But the total amount of the Federal tax is 18.4 cents a \ngallon. I remind my colleagues, that does not count the State taxes and \nin many cases local taxes on gasoline. Where I am from, we even have, \nin addition to the State and Federal taxes, what is known as the \nseawall tax.\n  That is quite curious because quite often we do not see anything \nhappening on the seawall, but the tax is being collected and spent on \ngeneral improvement of roads. Most people do not gripe because we have \na developing area and we want to have good roads. I think that is a \nvery important thing.\n  But, as a matter of fact, the total tax on gasoline in most States is \nas much as a quarter or a third or more of the total cost of a gallon \nof gasoline. So the taxes on gasoline are significant.\n  With regard to this vote last week, the so-called Byrd sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution said it is the sense of the Senate that the \nfunctional totals in this budget resolution do not assume the reduction \nof any Federal gasoline taxes on either a temporary or permanent basis. \nWhat we will be considering today and tomorrow morning in our gas tax \nbill is specifically designed to make certain that highway spending, \nand thus the functional totals, are not changed by our gas tax \nsuspension.\n  Therefore, the spending assumptions in the budget resolution do not \nassume the reduction of any Federal gas taxes on either a temporary or \npermanent basis. The revenue levels in the budget resolution, however, \ndo assume a temporary suspension of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon so-called \nGore tax increase.\n  If the Byrd amendment had been drafted to read, ``it is the sense of \nthe Senate that the functional totals and the revenue levels in this \nbudget resolution do not assume . . .'' then it would have had a very \ndifferent impact. So I am trying to clarify the difference in what some \npeople thought the resolution did last week and what we are actually \ndoing.\n  Under the budget resolution, there is no question we could have this \ndebate and have this vote on gas tax because this is what it would do. \nIt says we would temporarily suspend, just for the remainder of this \nyear, 4.3 cents a gallon--I will come back to that in a moment--and, if \ngasoline prices go to $2 a gallon national average, then the entire \n18.4 cents a gallon would be suspended in a gas tax holiday just to the \nend of the year.\n  So when people say, How much would this cost? The first answer is it \nwould depend on whether or not gasoline reached the national average of \n$2 a gallon and when that would occur, when that would take effect.\n  The amendment language is drafted so this will not affect the highway \ntrust fund. I want to emphasize that: It will not reduce the funds in \nthe highway trust fund. It would hold harmless the highway trust fund. \nIf there is this gas tax holiday, it would come out of the surplus.\n  I remind my colleagues, we do at this point have a $23 billion on-\nbudget surplus now; that is, surplus in addition to what we have as a \nresult of the FICA, Social Security tax. So there is a surplus there. \nWhile we would like to protect that surplus as much as possible and not \nuse it, or see it used to pay down the national debt, this is what I \nthink to be a reasonable way to use some of it, if gasoline prices \nshould actually go up to $2 a gallon.\n  What I am saying is, there is no difference between what we are \ntrying to do and what the Byrd sense-of-the-Senate resolution said. He \nwas trying, I believe, to make sure it did not come out of the highway \ntrust fund. As a matter of fact, this amendment is drafted in such a \nway it does not.\n  Let me remind my colleagues how we got to this additional 4.3-cent-a-\ngallon gas tax. It was added in 1993. In the Senate, it passed on a tie \nvote with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, breaking that tie. \nThere was a big debate about whether or not we should be increasing the \nprice of gasoline by raising this tax in the first place.\n  But there was an even more important, very telling point, and that \nwas, in this case the gas tax would not go into the highway trust fund \nbut it was going to go into the General Treasury to be used for any \nnumber of purposes by the Federal Government, not to build highways and \nbridges and to improve urban mass transportation and rail service or \nanything of that nature, just to go into the big, deep, dark hole of \nthe Federal Treasury.\n  By the way, I think about $21 billion of gas tax revenue went into \nthe General Treasury. But then in 1997 Congress changed that and said \nno, this is a gasoline tax and it should go, like other gasoline taxes, \ninto the highway trust fund. So it started going into the highway trust \nfund.\n  With regard to what we are trying to do here, the elite Washington \nposition is: Oh, what difference does 4.3 cents a gallon make? We can \nafford that.\n  Yes, maybe, if you live and work on Capitol Hill or for the Federal \nGovernment. But if you are out there in the real world, and you are a \nworking family, and you are driving 100 miles a day round trip to get \nto an industrial job, or to get to where your employment is, while it \nstill will not add up to a lot of money, when you are a blue-collar \nworker, when you are a union worker, working at a shipyard or \nInternational Paper mill, a few dollars more a week in the price of \ngasoline does make a difference. It comes right out of that family \nbudget.\n  So it is typically what you get here in Washington, the elite \nattitude: Well, it will not make that much difference. But it is not \nonly the individual who is paying those higher gas taxes, it also \naffects smaller business men and women. It affects barge operators on \nour rivers and inland lakes across America. It affects the truck driver \nwho, by the way, if he is an independent driver--he owns his own rig, \nhe drives not a few hundred miles a week, he drives many hundreds of \nmiles a week up and down this country and back and forth across this \ncountry--it is hitting him or her very hard because he is paying this \nextra cost to run those trucks.\n  Or, if you are in a business that involves a lot of trucks, a lot of \nheavy equipment, such as road construction or sand and gravel work, you \nhave seen the cost of doing business go up considerably. It is not a \nfew dollars, it is not hundreds of dollars, it is thousands of dollars \nin cases such as that.\n\n  By the way, that comes right out of the bottom line because quite \noften you are carrying out a contract for which you have already \nsubmitted a bid, you have a price agreement, and now you see you are \nhaving to take this extra cost right out of getting this job done. So \nit is having a real impact.\n  The next argument against reducing the gasoline tax, or having a gas \ntax holiday, is that: Look, this is temporary. It was just a spike up \nin the price of gasoline. We did not see it coming. We were caught \nnapping--according to the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson--\nand the OPEC countries will open the spigot up a little bit and \neverything will be fine, prices will go back down.\n  Maybe they will. They have ticked down some in some areas, although I \nbought gasoline on Saturday and it cost $1.63 a gallon, and that was \nnot the premium; premium was more than that. In some places it is more \nthan that, in some places it is probably less than that. So maybe it \nwill come down and maybe it will stay down, but I think maybe it might, \nas a matter of fact, tick back up because world demand is going to \nexceed supply. We are going to be drawing down reserves around the \nworld. So I am concerned it could go back up, in addition to the fact \nit is still very high.\n  So this is an issue we should think about. We should be careful how \nwe proceed. But we should have this debate. It is bigger than just \ngasoline price and the Federal gas tax, although, I repeat, to a lot of \nworking people it has had an impact and it will continue to do so.\n  There is a broader question involved, and that is: What is our \nnational energy plan? What are we going to do about the price of fuel, \nalternative fuels, conservation, environmental impact? All these \nquestions are looming.\n  I do not think we have a true national energy plan for the future. \nOur dependence on foreign oil has gone\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nfrom 45 percent of our needs 10 years ago to around 55 or 56 percent \nnow. I think it is going to go over 60.\n  What are we going to do? Are we comfortable with that? Are the \nAmerican people comfortable with that? I do not think so.\n  In the early seventies, we had the higher prices. We had the gas \nlines. Nobody liked it. People really got mad. We put forth a lot of \neffort in Congress to develop a national energy plan and to make \nourselves less dependent on oil. It has not worked. It has gone the \nother way.\n  We need to ask ourselves what we are going to do about this. What if \nthe OPEC countries and other countries from whom we get our oil decide \nto cut the spigot down or cut it off? Economically, we would be in a \nreal mess quickly.\n  We have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is something we did in \nthe aftermath of the last price increase and the long lines. We have \nSPR filled up so if we have a national emergency, we can use it for \nabout a month.\n  Is that enough? Should we do more? What are we going to do in the \nbroader sense? I view this current upward spike as another knock on the \ndoor, another tap on the shoulder: Hey, America, you have a problem. \nYou are dependent on Libya and Qadhafi; you are dependent on Iraq for \nabout 700,000 barrels of oil a day. Are you comfortable with that?\n\n  When I go home, I have people come up to me and say: Aren't these the \nsame people we went to war for a few years ago? And now they are \nturning the spigot on and off, and the prices go way low or high. Is \nthis what we want? I do not think so. It is very dangerous.\n  Then one may ask: What is going to be done? What can be done? We do \nneed to look for more oil reserves of our own. We need to give \nincentives for our men and women, our independents, our wildcats, the \nsmall operators, and the big ones, to find more reserves, to make use \nof these oil wells that are capped right now. There are a few in my own \nState and certainly other places around the country. We ought to see if \nthere are other places we can open up.\n  The Senate voted last week against an amendment that would have \nprevented using the reserves in ANWR in Alaska. I believe we can get at \nthose oil reserves without causing environmental damage, and we should \ndo that.\n  It is not just about more oil. The President said we should look at \nalternatives. I agree. What are the alternatives about which we are \ntalking? One is natural gas. When I sit on my front porch in my \nhometown of Pascagoula, MS, looking off to the south and the east, I \nsee a natural gas well. I believe natural gas is a good alternative. It \nis clean, and we can make a lot more use of it if we provide some \nincentives for making greater use of natural gas. We have tremendous \nreserves of natural gas. So much of it is in the ground; so much has \nbeen capped because it has not been worthwhile to get it out. That is \nan alternative that is environmentally safe, and we have lots of it. \nThat is one option.\n  Also, in my part of the country we use coal to provide electricity to \nour people. It is cheap, and it also is clean-burning coal. Our \ncompanies have taken actions to deal with the emissions problems. Yet \nEPA today is putting genuine hard pressure on five companies in \nAmerica, including Southern Company in our part of the United States, \nthat will drive up the cost and will cause real problems using coal as \ntheir fuel supply in the future.\n  That is one alternative we ought to keep. We ought to find more oil; \nwe ought to make use of natural gas; we ought to continue to find ways \nto burn coal with clean technology, with modern technology, but also \nthat it is clean coal being burned.\n  The next thing is nuclear power. Nuclear power is clean. There is \nnuclear power already in Europe, China, and Japan. Yet we have been \ntrying for years and have spent billions of dollars finding a \nrepository for nuclear waste. The Senate passed a bill, I believe, two \nor three times, and the President is threatening to veto a very \ncarefully thought out procedure of a repository for nuclear waste.\n  Sooner or later, if we cannot deal with that problem, our nuclear \nplants will be faced with the threat of shutting down. If we do not \nexplore for more oil, if we do not make greater use of natural gas, if \nwe put limits and make it difficult to use coal, if, as a matter of \nfact, we cannot use nuclear power because we cannot come up with a \nproper way with which to deal with nuclear waste disposal--talk about \nan environmental problem. Deciding how to deal with nuclear waste is \nthe biggest environmental problem in America today. We have been \nbatting that ball back and forth for 10 years or more, and we still \nhave not resolved it.\n\n  If not oil, not natural gas, not coal, and not nuclear, what? Solar \nand wind? That will help some, but the statistics I have seen show that \nwill provide a very small percentage of our needs. Ethanol--I have \nsupported ethanol. I just do not believe wind and solar, ethanol, and \nalternative sources beyond the ones I have been talking about will \nsolve this problem.\n  I hope, as a result of the debate today and tomorrow, we will admit \nthat we do not have a national energy policy, that we are dependent on \nforeign oil and are going to be for the foreseeable future unless we \nsit down, think this through, and come up with some ideas on how to \nproceed.\n  I have urged the committees of jurisdiction--the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and other \ncommittees--to have joint hearings or have hearings and ask questions \nabout these long-term problems of how we are going to deal with these \nissues. I hope after we have this debate and votes tomorrow, we will \nhave a broader, general energy package that will begin to address these \nlong-term problems. I am concerned about it. I hope the Senate will \nstep up to this issue and make a difference beyond what we have done in \nthe past.\n  The second issue on which the Senate will be working this week is the \nmarriage penalty tax. I believe most Americans have some idea by now of \nwhat it is. There have been different proposals on how to deal with it. \nSome of the arguments are: Yes, but if you are married, you get certain \nbonuses. I do not think that applies to what we are trying to deal with \nhere.\n  The fact of the matter is, if you are a young couple or, as we \nrealized last week, an older couple--couples married 25 years get hit \nwith a marriage penalty tax, but for young couples it is particularly \nstartling.\n  I found that to be the case with my own family. Our daughter got \nmarried last May. She has been hearing talk about the marriage penalty \ntax, so she decided to find out what that would mean for her. She and \nher husband both work. Together, they have a pretty good income, \nalthough they are certainly not wealthy, but they are in that middle \nbracket. She figured it would cost them about $500 more this year in \ntaxes because they got married.\n  By the way, it is going to escalate over the next few years to about \n$1,400 a year. This is just basically wrong. We should encourage people \nto get married. We should not in any way discourage them by saying: Oh, \nby the way, if you do get married, you will pay more in taxes.\n  Some people will complain the package that came out of the Finance \nCommittee is too big; that, as a matter of fact, not only did we deal \nwith the low-income people by increasing what was in the House bill for \nthe so-called earned-income tax credit, EITC, we also said we will \ndouble the 15-percent bracket and the 28-percent bracket because we do \nthink if a marriage penalty tax is wrong, it should be wrong for \neverybody. It should not be wrong just for the entry-level, lower \nincome people; it ought to be also unfair for the upper lower income \nbracket and the middle-income bracket; as a matter of fact, right \nacross the board.\n\n  But we at least broadened its application to the middle bracket to \nmake sure, if you have a young couple who are both working--whether \nthey are in blue-color jobs or whether they are in entry-level \nprofessional jobs--they should have this penalty eliminated.\n  Senator Moynihan of New York, and others, have an alternative \nproposal. I think it is worth considering. In fact, if we could afford \nit, I would like to have what we are doing and what Senator Moynihan is \nproposing in terms of--I guess it is the income splitting option. But I \nthink we ought to have that offered and debated.\n  I think we can come up with a way that we can have a full debate \nwhere\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nthere could be amendments with regard to the marriage penalty \nlegislation. I hope we can reach an agreement on how that would come \nup. Then on Wednesday and Thursday, we would debate the alternatives \nand we would have a vote. But it is long overdue.\n  I hope we can do as we did on the Social Security earnings \nlimitation. We passed it unanimously in the Senate. A lot of people \nsaid: Oh, gee, that was so easy. Why didn't you do it before? We have \nbeen talking about it for 20 years. We couldn't get it done.\n  They said it cost too much or that senior citizens didn't really need \nit or it was a part of a package. But for some reason or another--for \nyears and years--it did not happen. Finally, we isolated it, passed it \nclean, and passed it overwhelmingly.\n  The President had a big signing ceremony last week saying: Finally, \nwe have eliminated the Social Security earnings test. Good. The main \nthing is our seniors who are between 65 and 69, who want to continue \nworking without being penalized in their Social Security benefits, are \ngoing to have that opportunity.\n  But I think the same is true here. It is clear now we have isolated \nit. The marriage penalty tax is not connected to incentives for people \nto adopt children. It is not connected to the death tax or the estate \ntax. It is not connected to anything else. We are just going to have a \ndebate about the marriage penalty tax. Senator Hutchison of Texas and \nSenator Ashcroft of Missouri, and a number of other Senators on both \nsides, are going to say: We ought to do this. This is the way to do it.\n  But in the end, this is the point: We are going to see this week if \nthe Senate is for eliminating the marriage penalty tax or not.\n  The guy in the store where I was shopping is going to have a list of \nthe names of those who vote against it. I hope the Senate will step up \nto this and that we will begin the process of totally eliminating the \nmarriage penalty tax.\n  Then, finally, on the budget resolution, I hope we can get a final \nagreement on the conference report and that we will pass it before the \nend of the week so we can go forward with our appropriations bills. \nThat is a very important part of what we need to do this year; that is, \npass the 13 appropriations bills for Agriculture, for defense, for the \nInterior, and for all the various Agencies and Departments of the \nGovernment, and more importantly for the American people.\n  We ought to do it earlier than usual. There is no reason why we \nshould wait until June or July to do the appropriations bills. Let's \nget started in May. Let's move them earlier. That is where we can \ninclude things that we think should be done.\n  For instance, on the foreign relations bill, I think we should \nprovide aid for Colombia to fight the narcoguerrillas and try to get \ncontrol of that drug war there. I think we ought to do it, and do it on \nthe foreign relations bill.\n  With regard to Kosovo and defense, the first bill that comes along, \nwhether it is MilCon--military construction--or the defense bill, I \nhope we will add that additional funding. This budget resolution \nconference report will get all of that started.\n  Then I think important, once again, is, we should give credit to the \nBudget Committee and to what we are doing in the Congress as a result \nof this budget resolution. No. 1, for the third year in a row, we have \nthe ability to have a balanced budget--3 years running now. Before \nthat, we had not had one since 1969. Yet this year we have the ability \nto do that for a third time, and to protect every cent of the Social \nSecurity trust fund income. Every cent that comes in from FICA taxes \nwill be preserved and set aside and will not be spent on other Federal \nGovernment spending programs.\n  I do not know exactly what that amount would be for the coming year, \nbut it would be significant. I think maybe the figure is approximately \n$160 billion, or something close to that. But over a 10-year period, it \nwill be $1 trillion. By not spending it, that is good for the program, \nit is good for technology, and we can pay down the national debt.\n  Over a 3-year period now, I understand we may have reduced the \nnational debt by somewhere more than $300 billion. A lot of people \nnever thought they would see the day come when we would actually begin \nto pay down the national debt.\n  If we stay on the path we are on, if we stay on the trajectory we now \nsee with technology--and a lot has to happen; we have to have good \nfiscal responsibility, monetary policy, stable energy prices, right \nacross the board--but if those things will stay within the ranges we \nare looking for, we could reduce completely the national debt by the \nyear 2013 or 2015. That has not been done since Andrew Jackson was \nPresident of the United States. That is really an amazing thing.\n  If we can continue to keep in place policies by congressional \nactions, and by monetary policy, and by the administration, and see \neconomic growth year after year of around 4.5 percent--and in recent \nyears it has been more than that; but just 4.5 percent--it would have a \ntremendous impact on the economy and the explosion of revenue coming \ninto the Social Security trust fund.\n  When we come to the point, over the next 2 or 3 years, where we are \ngoing to have fundamental reform of Social Security, to make sure it is \npreserved, protected, and, as a matter of fact, it is there for our \nchildren and our grandchildren in a way that will be meaningful to \nthem, just that growth in the economy of 4.5 percent will give us the \noptions we need to have a very strong program that will go not just \ninto the year 2040 but go throughout this century.\n  I think these are very important issues. This is going to be an \ninteresting week to have debate. When we complete that budget \nresolution, it will be a very positive action and will set the course \nfor not only this year but well into the rest of this decade.\n  Mr. President, I have been looking forward to this opportunity to \nhave this debate and have these votes this week. I look forward to that \nprocess as we go forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to restore the \nremaining, I believe, 15 minutes of the hour that was reserved on the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2454-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2454-S2455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I enjoyed listening to the majority leader. \nI have always worked well with him, although we have different \nperspectives and a different philosophy and opinion on some issues. I \nhave worked with him both in the House of Representatives and here in \nthe Senate. When I listen to him I am always reminded why I have always \nliked him personally. He is a good person. I appreciate his public \nservice.\n  There are some things on the agenda, however, that we might not agree \nabout. I want to comment about a couple of those issues, especially \nwith respect to an agenda item this week dealing with the repeal of the \n4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax, which is set for a cloture vote tomorrow \nafternoon here in the Senate Chamber.\n  My expectation is that the cloture vote will fail. I am not certain \nof that, but that is my expectation. Just hearing some of the comments \nand some of the statements that have been made previously, I expect \nthat cloture vote will fail, and I think justifiably so.\n  Let me describe why.\n  I think the price of fuel in this country is a pretty tough pill for \nthe American people to swallow. What has happened is the price of \ngasoline has spiked up. It is not because the free market has caused \nthat. It is because we have a cartel called the OPEC countries that are \nlimiting production and increasing the international price for their \nproduct.\n  That is not the free market. That is monopoly pricing. They have the \nstrength and, I guess, the opportunity to do that. What they have done \nis, of course, impose a significant new charge on American families, on \nfamily farmers, producers, manufacturers, drivers, and others.\n  There was no vote on that. That was something the OPEC countries did. \nWe\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\ndidn't have a chance to discuss that or vote on it in the Congress.\n  The question I ask with respect to the repeal of the 4.3-cent gas \ntax--which is, after all, rather small in the scheme of what has \nhappened to the price of gasoline--is who would get the benefit of \nthat? Is there a guarantee of any kind that the American people would \nactually get the benefit of the gas tax reduction? The gasoline tax is \nnot imposed at the pump. The gasoline tax is imposed up the line. There \nis no guarantee at all that if the Congress would repeal the 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax, that that savings wouldn't simply be blended into the \nprofits of the large oil companies. There is no guarantee that the \nAmerican driver is going to pull up to a gas pump and find that \ngasoline prices are 4.3 cents a gallon less.\n  The other question is, What is going to happen to make sure we \ncontinue the building of the transportation infrastructure, roads and \nbridges, the programs we have already approved in the highway program \nthat are done with this money? I am told by some: This money will be \nmade up from the general fund. Where from the general fund? Where do we \nget that money? How do we know that will be the case?\n  Someone once said you should never buy anything from somebody who is \nout of breath. There is a kind of breathless quality about bringing \nthis bill to the floor of the Senate to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon \ngas tax.\n  One of the reasons we heard Members stand up last week and ask some \nvery tough questions about this is, most of them understand, this is \nkind of an immediate, quick reaction that hasn't been thought through \nvery well. It will not necessarily provide any relief to drivers. There \nis no guarantee this 4.3-cent-a-gallon reduction is going to show up at \nthe pumps.\n  Secondly, where is the money? Where are we going to make up the \nmoney? Which roads aren't we going to fix or which bridges are not \ngoing to be repaired? Those are questions that need answering this \nweek. Because they cannot be answered, I think the cloture vote will \nfail.\n  I think this is a pretty good discussion we are having with respect \nto energy policy. The majority leader indicated this country doesn't \nhave much of an energy policy. I don't quarrel with that. We haven't \nhad much under any administration, as a matter of fact. We are far too \ndependent on foreign sources of energy. There is no question about \nthat. But in many ways this is a helpful discussion because we have had \nthe discussion in recent years about the globalization of our economy. \nHow can one stand in the way of the global economy? We are told this \neconomy is a global economy. Understand it, they say.\n  Well, where are people going to produce energy in this world? In a \nglobal economy, they will produce energy where it is least expensive to \nproduce. You can bring up oil under the sands in the Persian Gulf for a \nfraction of the cost of bringing up oil in the United States. That is \nthe global economy, I guess. That is a decision the global economy \nhelps make.\n  The majority leader asked the question--I think a very important \nquestion--do we have a national policy with respect to energy and our \ndesire to be somewhat independent of foreign sources? That is a good \nquestion not just for oil. It is a good question for steel and for a \nwhole series of things we know are important to the American economy.\n  We have been told until this time there is nothing that is more \nimportant than globalization of our economy; if steel moves and is \nproduced elsewhere, so be it. Do the people who say that feel the same \nway about oil? Because that is where we are. The oil we consume is \nproduced elsewhere. We now discover that when a cartel manipulates \nartificially the price of oil by restricting supply, Americans get \novercharged. That is part of a monopoly in the global economy that we \ndo not control.\n\n  We need to do a lot of things. This administration is proposing \nsomething I hope the majority leader and others will support in the \narea of domestic renewable energy. They are proposing significant new \ninitiatives in wind energy, which I think make a lot of sense. We have \nnew technology on wind-generation devices that is remarkable. If we put \nsome in this Chamber on the right days, we could electrify New York.\n  In my State, North Dakota, I grew up walking outdoors in the morning \nwith the wind and the breeze. If you take a map and evaluate what is \nthe Saudi Arabia of wind energy, it is North Dakota, and a lot of other \nnorthern border States are right behind. Some will say, listening to me \nspeak, they would have known we ranked high on wind energy. But \nseriously, we have an opportunity, with new technology, to capture wind \nenergy in many parts of this country and extend our energy supply.\n  The same is true with biomass. The same is true with geothermal, and \nnatural gas, which the majority leader suggested. Absolutely, we have \nwonderful new discoveries in natural gas and deep well finds. We are \ndoing a lot of that.\n  We do need to pay attention to the development of oil and the \ndevelopment of coal, which are important in this country. We also need \nto get behind the proposals coming from the Department of Energy and \nthis President's budget that call for the development of renewable \nenergy resources and what is called green power--environmentally \nfriendly sources of power. I mentioned one: wind energy. We need to \nfully fund these initiatives.\n  I hope no one comes to the floor later and says, ``We really care \nabout our energy supply,'' if before that time they voted against these \ninitiatives to extend our energy supply by investing in renewable \nenergy sources. We need to do that.\n  This, in many ways, is a wonderful discussion. What does the global \neconomy mean? Does it mean we don't have to worry about dependence on \nanything? We are now discovering it means we have to worry about \ndependence with respect to oil. What about steel? What about a range of \nother economic activities without which a country such as ours will not \nlong remain a world economic power? This is a great discussion to have. \nIt is right on point and right on time.\n  Yes, it is about oil and gas, but it is about much more than that. \nWhen we have this vote on cloture on the 4.3-cent gasoline tax repeal, \nI hope it will be preceded by a rather lengthy discussion of a whole \nrange of these issues. I appreciate the majority leader raising them \ntoday.\n  I don't intend to support cloture. As I said, there is kind of a \nbreathless quality of coming to the floor with a 4.3-cent gas tax \nrepeal that consumers will probably never see, even if we take the 4.3 \ncents off. I expect it is going into other pockets long before it gets \nto the consumer. If it gets done, dye the dollars green and then look \naround for green pockets someplace. You won't find green at the gas \npumps. You will find it somewhere upstream. Some bigger enterprise will \npocket that money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2455-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2455-S2456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is no disagreement in the Senate about the marriage \ntax penalty, that it ought not exist. We should change it. There are \nseveral different proposals to change it. We ought to come together \nwith respect to one of those proposals.\n  I will describe one approach to address the marriage tax penalty. I \nam going to be introducing a piece of legislation at some point in the \ndays ahead with my colleagues, Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican, and \nSenator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and perhaps others, that would \ndramatically change the income tax system in this country. This \napproach would eliminate for a large number of Americans the marriage \ntax penalty. I have been working on this a couple of years and \nappreciate the work of Senator Gregg and others.\n  Over 30 countries that have an income tax system allow people to \ncomply with their income tax without having to file a tax return. How \ndo they do it? They just manipulate their W-4 that is filed with the \nemployer to provide a little more information, and their actual \nwithholding becomes their exact tax liability--no questions. That is \nyour liability, no return filed, no searching for records, no long line \nat the post office on April 15.\n  Our country can do that. Our country can do it in a way that will \nallow 70 million Americans to comply with their income tax \nresponsibilities on April 15 without having to file an income tax \nreturn. How do we do it? You\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\ntake the W-4 form when you sign in with your employer and you say: I \nhave four children. I own a home--check that box. Check about three or \nfour boxes. From that, you provide opportunities for the deduction for, \non average, a mortgage interest deduction, and a couple of other \nthings. A table is then provided by the Internal Revenue Service that \nsets forth the exact amount of taxes that the employer will withhold \nand send the IRS, and that is the end of the transaction. You are not \ngoing to be hassled or forced to search for receipts; you are not going \nto wait in a long line at the post office to get your income tax return \npostmarked by April 15.\n\n  Now, in doing that, this plan will also eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty. But the plan only applies to people making $50,000 a year or \nless in wages, if they are single, or $100,000 a year or less, if they \nare married filing jointly. If they have less than $2,500 in other \nincome such as interest, dividends or capital gains if they are single, \nor $5,000 or less in such other income if they are married and filed \njointly, they are eligible to check the box that says, yes, I want to \nuse the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan, the FASST plan, which means \nI don't have to file a tax return. My withholding will be adjusted at \nmy place of work, and the withholding will be sent to the IRS and there \nis no tax return.\n  Simple, yes. It is the only plan I know of that discusses simplicity. \nEverybody who talks about simplifying the tax program, in most cases, \nends up proposing things that will make it horribly complicated. This \nwill simplify it--but not for everybody.\n  Some people have unusual income characteristics, with four different \njobs, and investments, and capital gains of $20,000 or $40,000 a year. \nIt won't work for them. For the majority of the American people whose \nonly income is their wage at work and they have a de minimis amount of \nother income in capital gains or interest--$5,000 a year if they are \nmarried and filing jointly--all that other income will be tax free. So \nthat is the incentive for savings and investment; that is the right \nincentive. All of the wage income--after several major deductions--up \nto $50,000 single and $100,000 married filing jointly--will be taxed at \nthe single lowest rate. This plan extends the bottom rate and provides \na de minimis amount of income tax free and you don't have to file a tax \nreturn anymore.\n  That makes a lot of sense to me and a fellow named Bill Gale at the \nBrookings Institution, who has done a lot of work on this issue of \nreturn-free filing. We are going to introduce legislation, which has \nbeen underway for a year and a half, I hope within the next week. As I \nindicated, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire has agreed to cosponsor, \nand Senator Durbin and, I hope, others, so we can begin discussing real \nsimplification for tens of millions of Americans who always do the \nright thing. They always file a tax return, they always fill it out \ncorrectly, and they believe as an American it is their responsibility \nbecause we do things, as a country, to provide for a common defense, to \nbuild roads and schools, and to provide for a whole series of things. \nThey understand their obligation to pay for the cost of a civilized \nsociety, to pay for the cost of democracy. But they ought to be able to \ndo it in a way that is far simpler than the current system, and that is \nwhat we intend to accomplish with this legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I am very pleased today to join with \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, Senator Craig, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, and a number of Senators on a very important piece of \nlegislation that is before this body, entitled ``The Federal Fuels Tax \nHoliday of the Year 2000.''\n  This legislation is necessary because it will put a brake on the \never-rising gasoline prices that American families face every day. \nUnlike the airlines, the American family can't pass on the increased \nprice in gasoline. Recently, the truckers came to Washington to express \ntheir concerns about the gas tax.\n  Energy and the cost of energy affects all of us in our lives in \nvarying ways. So the idea of putting the brake on the ever-increasing \ngasoline prices that American families pay each day is very important.\n\n  It is my hope that we invoke cloture tomorrow to ensure that the \nAmerican motorist and workers get a break.\n  Our legislation provides a tax holiday for all Americans, from the \ngas tax, that Democrats, with Vice President Gore casting the deciding \nvote, adopted in 1993. That 30 percent gas tax hike was the centerpiece \nof one of the largest tax increases in American history and we believe \nwith gas prices approaching $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, \nthe American motorist should not have to continue paying the Gore tax.\n  I don't know if all my colleagues on the other side would agree with \nthat nomenclature, but I think it is appropriate since the Vice \nPresident broke the tie which added a 30-percent gas hike.\n  In addition to temporarily ending the Clinton/Gore gas tax, our \nlegislation guarantees that if the failed Clinton/Gore energy policies \nresult in the price of gasoline rising over $2 a gallon, all fuel taxes \nwill be lifted until the end of the year.\n  That means the American motorist will be relieved of the 18.4-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax. The trucking industry will not have to pay the \n24.4-cent-per-gallon diesel tax. Barge operators will be relieved of \nthe 4.4-cent-per-gallon inland waterway tax, and commercial and \nnoncommercial aircraft operators will be relieved of the aviation tax.\n  It is certainly my hope that average gasoline prices do not rise \nabove $2. But it is clear to me that $2 gasoline is well within the \nprobability of becoming a reality because despite the administration's \nclaims of victory about last week's OPEC meeting, Americans should not \nexpect much, if any, of a price decline at the gas pump. Why? Let's \nlook at it.\n  OPEC's decision to increase production by 1.7 million barrels per day \nis not, in my opinion, even a hollow victory for the Administration's, \nwhich lobbied for a minimum increase of 2.5 million barrels. The \nreality is that there isn't a real 1.7-million-barrel increase by OPEC.\n  Why do I say that? Let's look at the arithmetic.\n  OPEC agreed last year to 23 million barrels as their quota of \nproduction. They cheated by an additional 1.2 barrels, moving it up to \n24.2. As a consequence, the difference between 1.2 and what they said \nwe got as an increase of 1.7 is only 500,000 barrels of real increase. \nOPEC makes up 15.8 percent of American imports. As a result, we will be \nlucky to see another 78,000 barrels of oil in our market.\n  Will 78,000 barrels make a dent in gasoline prices? Not likely. \nConsider that motorists in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area use \nmore than 121,000 barrels of oil in a single day.\n  With no relief in sight for the American motorist, we believe that \nthe Gore fuel tax should be temporarily lifted. That would save \nAmerican motorists about 4.4 barrels over the next 8 months.\n  If gasoline goes above $2, our bill suspends all fuel taxes resulting \nin a $19 billion saving to American motorists, truckers, barge \noperators, and airlines at the same time that fuel prices are near an \nall-time high. I believe the Government should suspend those taxes and \nease the financial burden OPEC has placed on the American motorist and \nthe industries that rely on fuel to move goods throughout this country.\n  I know some are concerned, if we suspend these taxes, that the \nhighway trust fund, which finances roads, bridges, and mass transit, \ncould be in danger. Again, I would like to put that fear to rest.\n  Our legislation ensures that the Highway Trust Fund will not lose a \nsingle penny during this tax holiday. We require that all monies that \nwould have gone into the fund had the taxes not been suspended be \nreplaced by other Federal revenue. That could come from the on-budget \nsurplus, as I have indicated, or from what I would like to see, which \nis a reduction of wasteful Federal spending.\n  I can assure the American motorist that highway construction projects\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\nthis year and next year will be unaffected by the tax holiday that we \nare proposing. And when the trust fund is fully restored, all projects \nscheduled for beyond 2002 will be completed.\n  Some of the colleagues believe it is a mistake to establish a \nprecedent wherein general revenues are used to finance highway \nconstruction. Ordinarily, I might agree with them, but not in this \ncase.\n  All of my colleagues should remember that when the Clinton/Gore 4.3-\ncent gasoline tax was adopted in 1993, not a single penny of that tax \nwas dedicated to highway or bridge construction. All the money was \nearmarked for Federal spending.\n  As I stated earlier, it was not until the Republicans adopted the \n1997 highway bill that we shifted the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax back to \nthe highway trust fund.\n  Further, as I have indicated, Americans have paid $42 billion since \nthe Gore tax went into effect. Of that $42 billion, $28 billion was \nspent not on highways but on general government and went into the \ngeneral fund.\n  Let me repeat that. Of the $42 billion Americans paid under the Gore \ntax, $28 billion was spent not on highways but on general government.\n  I believe under these circumstances that it is perfectly reasonable \nfor general revenues to be used to repay the trust fund money that \nshould have been spent on highways.\n  The question before the Senate today is very simple. Do Senators want \nto give American motorists a break at the gas pump when gas prices are \nat near record highs?\n  I think it is important for everybody to understand that we are the \nelected representatives of the people. What is their choice? Do the \npeople want to have relief from the gas tax? Is that their priority?\n  We have polling information that I will submit for the Record that \nindicates overwhelming support for relief at the gas pump. I think the \npolling clearly shows that the American public, when offered an \nopportunity to reduce taxes, would much rather take it and run.\n  A Gallup Poll released last week found that although Americans think \nhigh prices are only temporary, they believe several things should be \ndone to reduce taxes.\n  Eighty percent of the American people--I hope my colleagues and staff \nare listening and will take notes--favor lowering gas taxes. Seventy-\nfour percent--nearly three out of every four Americans--think that a \ntemporary reduction of the gas tax is a worthy solution. That is three \nout of four.\n  Think about that. Seventy-four percent of Americans think a temporary \nreduction in the gas tax is a worthy solution.\n  Think about where we are and what the administration is telling us.\n  First of all, since I have been speaking about policies of the \nadministration and the position of our Vice President, I want to refer \nto an article that appeared on October 23, 1999, in the State Times \nMorning Advocate at Baton Rouge, LA. The Vice President says he would \nbe more antidrilling than other Presidents. More anti-drilling? Let me \nread the quote.\n  ``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect our \noceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' he said in a \npress release. ``I will make sure that there will be no new oil leasing \noff the Keys of California and Florida, and then I will go much \nfurther. I will do everything in my power to make sure that there is no \nnew drilling off these sensitive areas, even in areas leased by \nprevious administrations.''\n  He would cancel contracts and leases out there that were made by \nprevious administrations.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. He further states: Existing leases and what oil and \nnatural gas companies could do with them already are the objects of \nlong-running legal disputes.\n  He says he would cancel leases in areas already leased by previous \nadministrations.\n  These are existing leases; where is the sanctity of a contractual \ncommitment? I believe if Florida and California don't want OCS \nactivities off their coast, that is fine; that should prevail if that \nis what people want. In Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and my \nState of Alaska, where we produce roughly 22 percent of the total crude \noil produced in the United States, these States should go ahead because \nthey want this. They recognize the alternative is not very pleasant--\nand that is to import more oil.\n  I leave Members with the very ambiguous reference this administration \nhas given, suggesting things will get better. There is a certain \npsychology in reassuring citizens that the price will come down. \nHowever, in reality, the consumption is up, production is down, we are \n56-percent dependent on imports, and the forecast is we will be 65 \npercent in the year 2015 or thereabouts. These are hardly reassuring \nnotes, taken verbatim from this administration, to suggest things will \nget better.\n  In conclusion, from the CBS ``Early Show'' on March 29, 2000, from \nSecretary Richards, the Secretary was being questioned on his view of \nwhether we could likely see some relief. He states as follows: This \nmeans for the American consumer, gasoline prices will gradually and \nsteadily decline, according to the Energy Information Administration \nand my Department, by as much as 11 cents by the end of September or \nthe end of summer.\n  That is quite a while. What do we do in the meantime?\n  Then he says: The bottom line is, I am just quoting our investigators \nand our official people who are saying 11 cents by the end of summer, \npossibly 15, 16 cents by the end of the year.\n  That is an indefinite forecast, in my opinion.\n  I appeal to the Chair to recognize that we can't believe the \nSecretary that the price is coming down. Every Member should support \nthis legislation because it will keep the pressure on the \nadministration to ensure it stays below $2 and this tax holiday won't \nbe a reality. It will give the American consumer a safety net. Think \nabout that.\n  The administration says: Don't worry, prices are on the decline. OK, \nif prices are on the decline--which I don't believe they are in the \nshort term or the long term, but we will see who is right or wrong--we \ngo ahead and pass the elimination of the 18.4-cent-gallon Federal tax, \nsuspend it for the balance of the year, if the price goes to $2 a \ngallon for regular. That is a balance that puts the administration on \nnotice to practice what they preach. If they preach the prices are \ncoming down, this will never happen anyway. We are giving the American \nconsumer a safety net. That safety net is real and it says if the price \ngoes up to $2 the 18.4 comes off. I think that is a fair balance.\n  I will show this chart one more time. I find it outrageous. Who do we \nlook to for imports? We look to Saddam Hussein and Iraq: Last year \n300,000; now it is 700,000 barrels a day.\n  Where does the money go? It is going to Saddam Hussein. We fought a \nwar over there--remember--in 1991. We lost the lives of 147 U.S. men \nand women. We fought a war to keep Saddam out of Kuwait. What did \nSaddam do when he lost the war?\n  Talk about environmental degradation. This is a picture of Kuwait \nwith the oil fields on fire. We see the fires in the background. Here \nis an American with the firefighters helping put that fire out. That is \nthe kind of guy we are dealing with to depend on imports. We had 23 \nsoldiers taken prisoner over there. It has cost the American taxpayer \n$10 billion since the war in 1991 to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in \nenforcing the no-fly zones. Within the last week, we did two bombing \nruns in Iraq because he was in violation of the no-fly zone, and we had \nantiaircraft action.\n\n  Isn't it incredible? We talk about foreign policy or energy policy of \nthis administration, and we are feeding Saddam Hussein millions and \nmillions of dollars so he can take that cash-flow and pay his \nRepublican Guards who keep him alive. He doesn't funnel that into his \neconomic system for the benefit of his people. He is in cahoots with \nthe North Koreans, developing missile technology and our bombing \nairplanes are carrying his fuel. How inconsistent, how ironic. Talk \nabout a full circle. We are importing 700,000 barrels a day, we are \nbombing him, we are using his oil that we refine to fill up our \nairplanes.\n  I may be reaching a little bit, but this is reality. We are importing \n700,000 barrels a day.\n  It is my understanding this matter will come up tomorrow and we will\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nhave a number of Senators active in the debate on the merits of the \nbasic presentation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last number of minutes I have \nlistened with great interest to the comments of my good friend from \nAlaska describing the energy crisis in which our Nation now finds \nitself. I use the word ``crisis'' with some reservation because my \nguess is most Americans don't think we are in a crisis. They have good \njobs, they probably got raises this year, they feel their jobs are \nsecure, they have plenty of spendable income, and while they may be \npaying 30 or 40 cents or even 50 cents a gallon more for gas this year \nthan last year, at least the gas is still there and the pump does not \nsay ``no fuel available,'' they don't sense a crisis.\n  I traveled home to my State of Idaho this weekend. I drove in out to \nDulles Airport. I got on a Boeing 777 that burns tens of thousands of \ngallons of fuel in the course of a day and I paid $70 or $80 more for \neach one of my tickets because of the cost of jet fuel. As I traveled \nacross the country I found the airports full, of Americans and foreign \ntravelers. Yet no sense of urgency or crisis did they appear to feel.\n\n  When I got home to my home State of Idaho and began to travel across \nthe northern end of the State, I saw that spring is breaking out very \nquickly in the marvelous wheat belt of northern Idaho that spreads into \nWashington and Oregon over to Pendleton and Wala Wala. It is a highly \nproductive area that oftentimes yields 100 to 110 bushels of wheat per \nacre annually without benefit of irrigation.\n  What was out on those rolling wheat fields this weekend? Large 4-\nwheel-drive tractors, oftentimes pulling 40- and 50-foot spreads of \nharrows and springtooths, beginning to till the soil, all of them with \na 250- or 400-horse diesel engine under the hood of that tractor, \nburning hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel each day.\n  This year those farmers will be paying another 50 or 60 cents a \ngallon for that fuel. Yet this is just the beginning of the growing \nseason in our Nation. We are now tilling and planting. We will spend \nthe summer cultivating and spraying to protect our crops from weeds and \ninsects. Then in the fall, huge combines will roll out on the fields, \nonce again driven by diesel fuel--a source of energy that has \nhistorically been so abundant in our country and so relatively \ninexpensive.\n  Today, a river conservation group announced that some rivers in our \ncountry are endangered because they have been dammed. In the past \nAmerica has placed large dams across some rivers and put large turbines \nin the dams to generate electricity. In a relatively cavalier way, this \ngroup said that my river, my Snake River of Idaho, is the most \nendangered. Why? Because of dams. They want the dams removed. Yet those \ndams produce hundreds of thousands of kilowatts a year to light the \ncities of Portland and Seattle, Boise and many other cities and towns. \nAnd somehow, all in the name of the environment, they cavalierly \nsuggest we start taking down relatively modern structures that produce \nlarge amounts of inexpensive electricity without burning fossil fuels.\n  The reason I draw these verbal pictures today is that no one senses a \ncrisis. This administration, for the last 8 years, has not proposed a \nsingle policy initiative that would produce 1 gallon more domestic \ncrude oil for our Nation. In fact, the Clinton/Gore administration has \ndone quite the opposite. They, through punitive environmental policies, \nhave suggested continually that we close more and more federal land to \nany further oil and gas exploration and production. They have even \nproposed to take down some of the hydro dams I have talked about, once \nagain all in the name of the environment.\n  Now, the Clinton/Gore administration has an energy policy of sorts. \nThey have talked a lot about solar and biomass which is not a bad idea \nas long as we don't kid ourselves into believing they will solve all of \nour problems. They have also talked about developing more powerful wind \nenergy technology to produce more power--not a bad idea either.\n  But the myth of that kind of technology is that to replace the dams \non the lower Snake River with photovoltaic cells or windmills, the \nentire State of Idaho would have to be covered with solar cells just to \noffset the difference. My guess is there would be a Vice President who \nwould reject such an idea because the result would be unsightly. It \nwould destroy the vistas that are so beautiful in my State right now. \nIt would be uncomely to the American environmental eye. And I would \nagree with him.\n  But I would not agree with this Vice President, when he stands and \nsays that he will not tolerate drilling offshore California, offshore \nFlorida, offshore our East coast, or in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. The Clinton/Gore administration has an energy policy of sorts \nand the Vice President's desire to take down dams, prevent new oil and \ngas exploration, and instead cover my State of Idaho, or Arizona, or \nCalifornia, with solar cells and wind farms is its hallmark.\n\n  The reason I mention these frustrations I have, and I think some \nAmericans share, is that for a good long while now we have not had a \nconsistent energy policy for our country that is a combination of all \nthese things: Research for new technology, conservation so we use less \nand gain more from it, while at the same time producing as much of our \nown fossil fuel resources as possible.\n  In just a decade or so, we have increased our electrical generation \nby some 200 percent by the use of coal, but we have reduced the sulfur \noxide emissions from coal during that same time by over 20 percent. \nThrough technology, we are using more fossil fuels more efficiently and \nmore cleanly and more of our electricity is generated with such fuels. \nThat is the way you do it. You do not take those kinds of sources off \nline; you say those are the sources that can generate the abundance of \npower that drives our industries and heats and cools our homes.\n  So let's be wiser and smarter with our technology than just saying to \na certain political interest, I am with you, we will just take that all \nout of production and off line, because it does not fit somebody's \nenvironmental agenda.\n  Among all the things the rivers conservation group said today, about \ntaking dams out on the Snake River, there is something they did not \nsay. They did not say the removal of those dams would destroy the barge \ntraffic on the Snake-Columbia River system. All of the grain and timber \nand paper and coal that now travels the river in barges would have to \nmove in 18-wheel trucks over the highways of the Pacific Northwest. \nTens of thousands more trucks would have to be employed to haul the \nfreight and replace the slack water transportation system that would be \ndestroyed were the dams removed.\n  Is that an environmentally sound thing to do, to employ thousands and \nthousands more trucks, burning hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel a \nday? I think not. But, of course, that is not a headline. That does not \nmake the kind of press they thought they could make by their release \ntoday, all in the name of the environment, all in the name of saving \nfish.\n  We will probably debate, on this floor in the next decade, the \nremoval of dams, whether in my State or somewhere else, as it relates \nto energy policy and protection of the environment and valuable fish. I \nhope at that time the American people can be given all the facts. I \nthink, when given all the facts and when allowed to view all the \nalternatives of technology and retrofitting dams, Americans will \nunderstand that abundant, inexpensive hydro power energy, can be had \nalong with a clean environment and strong salmon runs.\n  They will also understand the extent to which farmers and ranchers \nneed abundant, relatively inexpensive supplies of energy to produce the \nfood and fiber our Nation needs. Those commodities were being planted \nin the soils of north Idaho this weekend by the large\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\n4-wheel-drive diesel tractors pulling 50-foot spreads of equipment I \ntalked about at the beginning of my statement. They had to use energy \nto accomplish it.\n  I will also discuss legislation, with which we will deal in the near \nfuture, to alleviate some of the concerns about energy policy in the \nshort term and the cost to the consumer while Congress struggles to \ndevelop a long-term policy to increase energy production in our \ncountry.\n  I do support legislation that will give us a temporary Federal tax \nholiday from energy taxes of the kind thrust upon this country by the \nClinton-Gore administration several years ago when they argued it was \nnecessary to tax fuel consumption to reduce the deficit structure and \nthe debt structure of our country.\n  I did not support the tax then, and several years later I was one of \nthose who changed the tax from going into the general fund to reduce \nthe deficit to going into the trust funds of transportation, because up \nuntil this President came to town, we had never taxed the American \npeople at the gas pump to fund the general fund expenditures of our \nGovernment. We had taxed them only to put it in the transportation \ntrust funds that build the roads, bridges, and infrastructure all of us \nexpect and enjoy and the infrastructure on which our economy runs--\ngoods and services that traffic across America on a daily basis.\n  One way to give some short-term relief to the American consumer, as \nthese energy prices have gone up, is to reduce for a short term the \n4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax; take it off the pump; take it away from the \nconsumer and allow that tax to stay in the consumer's pocket. The \nreason is, what does it mean with the current runup in fuel prices? \nMatt Lauer said the other day on the ``Today'' show: The energy crisis \nmay be over in the short term. Meaning the Secretary had been to the \nMiddle East, he begged and cajoled the producers in the Middle East to \nturn the valve on a little bit. Then as the spokesperson for energy \npolicy in this country, the Secretary announced to the American people \nthat gas prices were going to come down some maybe. The ``some maybe'' \nis that maybe they will come down a little bit, but they are still \ngoing to be 40 to 50 cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago. \nThere is some belief in the marketplace, depending on whom you study \nand whom you believe and who has the right information, that the supply \nthe OPEC nations promised may not be as large as promised and, \ntherefore, by late summer we could see an average of $2 prices across \nthis country.\n  We are going to have to wait and watch for that one. None of us know \nwhat the price of gas will be in July or August, but it is going to be \na lot higher than it was a year ago. It will, in many ways, determine \nhow the American consumer utilizes his or her free time this year as \nthey think about a vacation, whether it is in the family car, the van, \nor the SUV, or whether it is booking airline tickets to travel across \nthis country. In all instances, the cost of that leisure time Americans \nso enjoy will be substantially more expensive than it was a year ago.\n  I am talking about leisure time. I am not talking about the weekly \ncommute, the daily commute. I am not talking about the goods and \nservices that traffic on America's trucks across our Nation on a daily \nbasis or the food we buy at the local supermarket, all having been \ntransported by trucks that are paying substantially more for fuel.\n  How much more are truckers now paying and how much will they have to \npass through to the consumer as these prices go up?\n  Diesel fuel costs exceeded $2.10 a gallon in the Northeast this \nspring. That is a doubling of cost in about a year. The average \nnationwide was about $1.50 a gallon. To the driver of an 18-wheeler \nfreight truck that traffics America's highways hauling our goods and \nservices, it will mean an additional $150 to $200 to fill his or her \ntank on a daily basis or a 24-hour transportation period. If they are \nto stay alive as a business, they have to pass that cost directly \nthrough to the consumer: a little here on food prices; a little there \non the cost of a piece of carpet; a little somewhere else on any of the \ngoods and services that ultimately the American consumer buys.\n\n  Of course, that is the same cost the American farmer is experiencing \nwhen he or she cannot pass it on, because they cannot set the price of \nthe commodity they will be selling this fall by an extra 10 cents or 15 \ncents a hundredweight to offset the cost of the diesel fuel and all of \nthe petrochemicals they will use this year in the production of \nAmerica's food sources.\n  To the consumer--that is you and me--who is commuting to work or \nconsidering a family vacation, another 60, 70, or 80 cents a gallon \ncould well mean another $10.50 a tankful every time we pull into the \nservice station. Did they put that in the family budget in January? Did \nthey really plan to pay $300 or $400 more this year, including their \ntrips and all of their other expenses? I do not think so. I do not \nthink anyone considered that. Yet that is what one ought to have \nconsidered if they have a true and honest budget.\n  That is why, when recently polled, the American people are beginning \nto figure out that maybe a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax reduction for the \nshort term is a good idea to offset at least some of these new costs in \nenergy. Eighty percent of them said the Congress of the United States \nought to reduce that tax, at least for the short term, to help \ncompensate for this runup in energy prices we have seen.\n  I am talking about short-term policy. It does not produce a gallon \nmore of domestic crude oil. It does not in any way provide the reliable \nsources our country has grown to expect over time in a nation that has \nexperienced relatively inexpensive energy.\n  Many of our conservation and environmental friends are saying we \nought to be paying as much as Europe pays or as much as the rest of the \nworld pays. That is another $1, $2 a gallon, in some instances, and, \ntherefore, we would rely less upon our vehicles and change our \nlifestyles. Some day we might have to do that, but all of those costs \nwould have to be spread across an economy, and the general cost of \nliving in this country will go up dramatically.\n  Mr. President, you and I, as consumers in this economy, will have to \nmake choices about how we spend our disposable income and how we spend \nour income for goods and services. We will have to live a different \nlifestyle than the one we currently have, if our attitude is only to \ndrive up the cost of energy instead of finding conservation sources and \nalternative sources and maintaining at least a substantial level of \nproduction of crude oil from our own domestic sources.\n  Last week, this Senate, by 1 vote, recognized the importance of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge as a potential producer of 16 billion \nbarrels of crude oil, production that will be done in a fragile area of \nour country but can be done in an environmentally sound way based on \nnew technologies.\n  We listen to a Department of Energy that says energy dependence on \nforeign sources will go up to 65 percent by the year 2010 if we \ncontinue the same policy, so says Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson. \nWhat he did not say is that to be 65-percent dependent upon foreign \nsources will require an estimated 12,000 more huge oil tanker dockings \neach year in the United States. Will that be done safely? In most \ninstances, it will. Will there be a risk with thousands and thousands \nof more of these supertankers on our open oceans? Will there be some \nkind of environmental problem? You bet there will. In fact, that is the \nweak link in the whole process. We have a Vice President who says no \ndrilling offshore because of environmental fragility, and yet by saying \nthat, he is advocating thousands of more supertankers on the open \nocean.\n  Go back and look at the record over the last decade. We have not had \nenvironmental problems with offshore drilling. But every so often, one \nof these big tankers runs ashore and spills crude into very fragile \nenvironmental areas.\n  So, Mr. Vice President, get honest with the American people. Look at \na total package of energy policy that produces onshore in safe \nenvironmental ways, and that looks at some of the alternatives you are \nproposing for wind and solar. I do not deny that any of those has \ncertain value.\n  I suggest that our energy basket, as a nation, be full of all kinds \nof alternatives but at the same time recognize the base: the \nconventional forms of energy that drives our agriculture, that\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\ndrives our industry, and that provides us with the kind of lifestyle \nAmericans expect, and ought to expect, from a free, powerful nation \nsuch as ours.\n  Let me close with these thoughts because we do not often talk about \nnational security. We talk about ourselves, our personal security, our \nfamily's security, our food security. Those are the things I have been \ntalking about for the last 10 or 15 minutes. Those are the things that \ncome to our minds immediately when we think we have to spend more of \nour income on them. Is the food going to be there? Can we live the \nlifestyle we have had if energy reasonably available?\n  Here is what Commerce Secretary Daley recently reported to our \nPresident. In all honesty, this report was on the President's desk, but \nhe wasn't saying anything about it until Senator Frank Murkowski, the \nchairman of the Senate Energy Committee, stood up and said: Mr. \nPresident, you have a report on your desk. You ought to talk about it a \nlittle bit. You ought to tell the American people what your own \nCommerce Secretary is telling you.\n  The President wrote to the Secretary that he concurred with the \nSecretary's findings and that current policies should aid in dealing \nwith our dependence on imported oil. Secretary Daley said in his report \nthat ``. . . imports of crude oil threaten to impair the national \nsecurity of this country.''\n  What does the Secretary mean? He means we are not as stable as we \nwere, as strong as we were. We are dependent upon foreign sources for a \nlot of our energy. We did not send Secretary Richardson to Houston to \ntalk to the oil producers of Texas or to Anchorage to talk to the oil \nproducers of Alaska. We sent him to the most unstable political area in \nthe world, the Middle East. We begged the sheiks, the producers: \nPlease, please, give us just a little oil. We fought a war for you. We \nsaved you. We saved your palaces. We saved your airplanes and your \nlifestyles and your limousines. Oh, it cost us 140 American lives, but \nwe saved you. So would you please give us a little oil? Because you are \nreally cramping our lifestyle. What you are doing may damage our \neconomy and put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work.\n  I do not think Mr. Richardson said it quite like that, but that is \nwhat he, in essence, was saying. He was admitting that we are \nvulnerable. That is why Secretary Daley told the President we are \nbecoming more dependent on foreign sources, our national security is at \nrisk.\n  What did the President say? He said: I accept your recommendation \nthat existing policies to enhance conservation and limit dependency on \nforeign oil ought to be continued. But not one energy proposal has come \nforth from this administration, except the current budget which has \nlarge increases in solar cell and wind technology budgets and hardly \nany increases for nuclear or hydro technology, hardly any increase in \nclean coal technology research that could help the large, coal-fired, \nelectrical-energy-producing plants of our Nation.\n  The President was warned this year by the Secretary of Commerce. In \n1995, the President was also warned by the Secretary of Commerce that \n``. . . The Nation's growing reliance on imports of crude oil and \nrefined petroleum products threatens the Nation's security because they \nincrease U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruption.'' That was in \n1995.\n\n  In late 1998, the OPEC nations were scratching their heads. They \nweren't making any mont with oil prices at $10-a-barrel. So, t decided \nto reduce production and drive up prices.\n  They did just that. We saw crude oil prices, in less than a year, go \nfrom $10 a barrel to $34 a barrel. That is why I am on the floor today. \nThat is why House Members and Senate Members have been talking about \nenergy policy in the last several months.\n  We have known it was coming. We have warned the administration for \nyears. Six months ago, our colleagues from the Northeast warned of a \nrunup in home heating fuel prices and what that would do to their \nconstituents. But has this administration done anything about it? No, \nnot anything of consequence.\n  The Vice President has been outspoken about no new offshore drilling.\n  He has been outspoken about needing higher taxes for fossil fuels so \nwe would become less reliant upon the internal combustion engine. But \nnowhere has he suggested increased domestic oil and gas production.\n  We will debate this week, and I hope we will pass, a temporary \nFederal tax holiday that will allow the American consumer just a little \nrelief in a time when our Nation's energy policy has failed the \nAmerican consume. At the same time Congress will look at both short-\nterm and long-term policy in an attempt to create more stability in \nprice and supply.\n  This is an important issue. We will hear a great deal more about it \nin days to come if prices at the pump average $2 a gallon at the height \nof the summer driving season.\n  When I began these comments, I talked about an energy crisis. The \nscenario I tried to describe over the last several minutes is that \nthere is, in fact, a crisis going on in our country. It is relatively \nquiet at the moment. But it is a crisis. We aren't producing enough oil \nand gas. The White House has no will to build an effective energy \npolicy and will not tell the American people truth about its failures \nin this regard. We need to find ways to increase oil and gas \nproduction, to deal boldly with our neighbors in the Middle East on \nmatters of their physical security and our energy security. The \nadministration has not been very firm with our allies. We are there \nproviding security today, yet we have to beg for our energy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Madam President, during last week's consideration of S. \nCon. Res. 101, the congressional budget resolution, the Senate by voice \nvote agreed to a modified amendment (amendment 3028) offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire (Senator Smith) that:\n\n       Assume(s) that no American will be prosecuted, fined or in \n     anyway harassed by the Federal government or its agents for \n     failure to respond to any census questions which refer to an \n     individual's race, national origin, living conditions, \n     personal habits or mental and/or physical condition, but that \n     all Americans are encouraged to send in their census forms.\n\n  There are serious consequences for state, local, and Federal \nGovernment when people are missed by the census. There are \napproximately 1,327 federal domestic assistance programs that use \npopulation information in some way. The breadth of the programs \naffected that touch families and businesses throughout the nation \nclearly spells out the need to ensure that all Americans are counted. \nThe questions asked by the census represent a balance between the needs \nof our nation's communities and the need to keep the time and effort \nrequired to complete the form to a minimum. Federal and state funds for \nschools, employment services, housing assistance, road construction, \nday care facilities, hospitals, emergency services, programs for \nseniors, and much more are distributed based on census figures.\n  The percentage of people undercounted in Hawaii--1.9 percent--was \nhigher than the national average, and the largest component of the \nundercount by race was projected to be Asians and Pacific Islanders. I \nwas so concerned that Hawaii would once more have a higher than average \nundercount that on March 14, 2000, I held a forum in Hawaii on the \nCensus 2000. At that forum, I urge Native Hawaiians and other Pacific \nIslanders to take advantage of the 2000 Census as an opportunity to be \naccurately represented in data and statistics that will impact our \nlives for the next 10 years. During the forum, which was attended by \nCongressman Eni Faleomavaega from American Samoa, Hawaii's Lieutenant \nGovernor Mazie Hirono, representatives from the Census Bureau, U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, U.S. Department of Interior, and various Native \nHawaiian and Other\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nPacific Islander organizations, I strongly urged everyone to answer \ntheir questionnaires.\n  The Senate agreed to the Smith amendment, as modified, on April 7, \n2000. However, if there is no objection, I am submitting to the Record \na statement by Census Director Kenneth Prewitt, regarding the Sense of \nthe Senate amendment, Number 3028 to the concurrent resolution, S. Con. \nRes. 101:\n\n       The Census Bureau is required by law to collect a complete \n     response from every resident in America to both the census \n     short and long forms. Today's sense of the Senate amendment \n     would undermine the quality of information from both forms. \n     Census 2000 is not designed by law as a pick and choose \n     exercise. Serious degradation of census information will \n     negatively affect economic policy-making, public sector \n     expenditures and private sector investment for a decade.\n       The census procedures require enumerators in the non-\n     response follow up phase to make six attempts to collect \n     information. Congress would have to advise the Census Bureau \n     whether six attempts (or even a single attempt) would \n     constitute harassment.\n\n     Kenneth Prewitt,\n     Director, U.S. Census Bureau,\n     April 7, 2000.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence after quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Galileo understood the importance \nof mathematics when he said, ``Mathematics is the alphabet with which \nGod has created the universe.'' I proudly rise today in recognition of \nMathematics Education Month. Additionally, I take this opportunity to \napplaud the tireless efforts of our nation's math teachers.\n  The importance of a strong mathematical education is indisputable. \nOur math skills prove invaluable on a daily basis. Without them we \ncould not perform simple tasks such as buying groceries, following a \nrecipe, or balancing our checkbooks, much less plan for our retirement \nor buy a home. Here in Congress, mathematical skills are essential to \ncomprehending the incredibly complex issues of Social Security reform, \ntaxes, and the federal budget process.\n  My home state of Minnesota boasts some of the best math educators in \nthe country, dedicated men and women who have inspired a lifetime of \nlearning in countless students. This has been proven time and again by \nMinnesota's status as a national leader in ACT and SAT math scores. \nNevertheless, we should continue to make improvements and not be \nsatisfied with our success.\n  One organization in my state deserves special accolades for its \nongoing efforts to initiate those improvements. The Minnesota Council \nof Teachers of Mathematics is dedicated to the constant betterment of \nmathematical education at the elementary, secondary, and college \nlevels. The Council's advocacy results in an ongoing effort to raise \nthe bar for better education. I commend its members for their devotion \nto creating an awareness and interest in mathematics among young \npeople.\n  As classrooms across America labor over long division, tangents and \nderivatives this month, it is my hope that students, parents, and \nteachers alike will reflect on the significance of mathematics in our \nsociety and join me in celebrating Mathematics Education Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2461-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2461-S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this week from April 9-15 we \nare celebrating the 42nd anniversary of ``National Library Week.'' As a \nstrong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and \nprotect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few \nmoments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of \nideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are \nthe only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended \nfor, and available to, every segment of our society.\n  It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable \nrole in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th \ncentury, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and \nwide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further \nsupplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. \nLibraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and \nchildren and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to \nobtain reliable information on a vast array of topics.\n  Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid \ntechnological advancement where they are called upon to provide not \nonly books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. \nIn today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer \nservices, internet access terminals, facilities for community lectures \nand performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for \nexhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities \nlibraries provide services for older Americans, people with \ndisabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of \nmaterials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is \noften struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have \nnot had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the \ngreatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library \ncommunity and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities \ncontinue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library \nsystem.\n  As we celebrate National Library Week, it should be noted that the \nLibrary of Congress will be 200 years old on April 24, 2000. The \nLibrary of Congress represents the oldest federal cultural institution \nin America. As we approach this birthday celebration, we should \nrecognize that all libraries represent the cornerstone of knowledge in \nour local communities.\n  My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy \nhas been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides \ninterlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries \nand school library media centers. The Network receives strong support \nfrom the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nthe Regional Library Resource Centers in Western, Southern, and Eastern \nShore counties, and a Statewide database of holdings totalling 178 \nlibraries.\n  The State Library Resource Center alone gives Marylanders free access \nto approximately 2 million books and bound magazines, over 1 million \nU.S. Government documents, 600,000 documents in microform, 11,000 \nperiodicals, 90,000 maps, 20,000 Maryland State documents, and over \n19,000 videos and films.\n  The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an \nextraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of \nMaryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by \nborrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of \nalmost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population \nregistered as library patrons.\n  I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association and others involved in the library community \nthroughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and \ncitizens throughout the nation in this week's celebration of ``National \nLibrary Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nwith those who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital \nservices available to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2462-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MR. DONALD T. STORCK HONORED AS LUTHERAN LAYMAN OF THE YEAR 2000\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nDonald T. Storck, who on Tuesday, April 11, 2000, will be honored by \nthe Lutheran Luncheon Club of Metropolitan Detroit as its Lutheran \nLayman of the Year 2000. This is the 46th year the Luncheon Club has \nnamed a Layman of the Year, and I cannot imagine that any have been \nmore deserving than Mr. Storck. For over thirty-five years, he has \ndisplayed a dedication to both his community and his church that are \nrepresentative of an incredible desire to help others.\n  Mr. Storck was born in raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. He began \nworking for General Motors in their St. Louis Chevrolet Plant in 1957. \nIn 1964, after graduating from Washington University, he was \ntransferred to the G.M. Building in Detroit, where he worked as an \nengineer. He and his wife, Ethel Steinmann, settled down in Royal Oak, \nMichigan, and they have lived there, and been members of the St. Paul \nLutheran Church, ever since.\n  In his thirty-six years in Royal Oak, Mr. Storck has contributed to \nthe community in many ways. Before recycling had become popular, he was \npart of a paper drive activity that raised over $60,000 for building \nprojects. He has been very active in supporting the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, involving himself in a program at the G.M. Willow Run \nTransmission Plant. He sits on the Board of Directors of the Royal Oak \nPenguins, a youth swimming club. As a volunteer for Focus: HOPE, he has \nspent one Saturday per month delivering food to elderly and shut-in \nindividuals. He has worked on many Habitat for Humanity projects, is a \nteacher of an after-school elementary woodworking class for 1st and 2nd \ngrade youth at the Huntington Woods Community Center, and a regular \ndonor of blood and blood platelets.\n  His devotion to the religious community has been equally impressive. \nHe currently serves on the Board of Elders and the Board of Trustees of \nSt. Paul Lutheran Church, and sings in the Men's Chorus and Chancel \nChoir. This is in addition to serving as chief chef of the men's \nbreakfast, a tradition which he founded. He is the current president of \nthe Lutheran Choralaires, a popular male chorus which performs \nregularly throughout the metropolitan Detroit area. He has been a \nmember of the Lutheran Laymen's League Retreat Committee, and \nvolunteers time at the group's annual retreat. He has also been very \nactive in the Lutheran Luncheon Club, serving as its president in 1984-\n85, its secretary from 1986-1995, and has sat on the Board of Directors \nfor the last five years.\n  Recently, he has donated much of his time to helping Grace Lutheran \nChurch in Durham, North Carolina. This ministry provides for the \ntransport of children to and from Belaruse and places these children \nwith host families while they receive needed surgical and medical care \nat the Duke University Hospital. Mr. Storck discovered the ministry \nwhen he was at the Duke University Hospital visiting his youngest \ngrandchild, Mollie, who died at the age of two after a battle with \nleukemia. At a time when Mr. Storck's faith was put to the test, it \nnever wavered; he remained committed to the church and to helping \nothers in the name of God.\n  Madam President, I applaud Mr. Storck on his many contributions to \nboth his church and his community. He is truly a role model, and I \napplaud the Lutheran Luncheon Club for taking the opportunity to \nrecognize him as such. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \ncongratulate Mr. Donald R. Storck on being named the 46th Lutheran \nLayman of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2462-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2462-S2463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, it has been over 30 years since \nI set off on my hunger tour of South Carolina, where I observed first-\nhand the shocking condition of health care and nutritional habits in \nrural parts of my state. The good news is, we have come a long way \nsince then. The bad news is, there is still much work to be done. Like \nthe ``hunger myopia'' I described in my book ``The Case Against \nHunger,'' we suffer today from a sort of ``health care myopia,'' a \ncondition in which a booming economy and low unemployment rates mask a \nreality--that many Americans eke out a living in society's margins, and \nmost of them lack health insurance. Ironically, as the stock market \nsoars, so do the numbers of uninsured in our country, at a rate of more \nthan 100,000 each month; 53 million Americans are expected to be \nuninsured by 2007.\n  The health care debate swirls around us, reaching fever pitch in \nCongress, where I have faith that we will soon reach an agreement on \nexpanding coverage and other important issues. However, I see a need to \nimmediately address the health care concerns of these left-behind and \nsometimes forgotten citizens. They cannot and should not have to wait \nfor Congress to hammer out health care reform in order to receive the \nmedical care so many of us take for granted. That's why I sponsored, \nalong with Senator Bond, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to double the \nfunding for health centers over the next five years. The Bond-Hollings \nResolution to Expand Access to Community Health Centers (REACH) \nrecommends that we start the process with a $150 million increase in FY \n2001. Let me emphasize that this measure is a cost-saving investment, \nnot an increase in spending.\n  While ideas about health care have changed dramatically, community \nhealth centers have remained steadfast in their mission, quietly \nserving their communities and doing a tremendous job. Last year, \ncommunity health centers served 11 million Americans in decrepit inner-\ncity neighborhoods as well as remote rural areas, 4.5 million of which \nwere uninsured. It's no wonder these centers have won across-the-board, \nbipartisan support. They have a proven track record of providing no-\nnonsense, preventive and primary medical services at rock-bottom costs. \nThey're the value retailers of the health care industry, if you will, \ntreating a patient at a cost of less than $1.00 per day, or about $350 \nannually.\n  Not only are these centers providing care at low costs, but they are \nsaving precious health care dollars. An increased investment in health \ncenters will mean fewer uninsured patients are forced to make costly \nemergency room visits to receive basic care and fewer will utilize \nhospitals' specialty and inpatient care resources. As a consequence, a \nmajor financial burden is lifted from traditional hospitals and \ngovernment and private health plans. Every federal grant dollar \ninvested in health centers saves $7 for Medicare, Medicaid and private \ninsurance: $6 from lower use of specialty and inpatient care and $1 \nfrom reduced emergency room visits.\n  The value of community health centers can be measured in two other \nsignificant ways. First of all, the centers' focus on wellness and \nprevention, services largely unavailable to uninsured people, will lead \nto savings in treatment down the road. And secondly, health centers \nfoster growth and development in their communities, shoring up the very \npeople they serve. They generate over $14 billion in annual economic \nactivity in some of the nation's most economically depressed areas, \nemploying 50,000 people and training thousands of health professionals \nand volunteers.\n  It should also be noted that community health centers are just that--\ncommunity-based. They are not cookie cutter programs spun from the \nfederal government wheel, but area-specific, locally-managed centers \ntailored to the unique needs of a community. They are governed by \nconsumer boards composed of patients who utilize the center's services, \nas well as local business, civic and community leaders. In fact, it is \nstipulated that center clients make up at least 51 percent of board \nmembership. This set-up not only ensures accountability to the local \ncommunity and taxpayers, but keeps a constant check on each center's \neffectiveness in addressing community needs.\n  In South Carolina, community health centers have a long history of \nmeeting the care requirements of the areas they serve. The Beaufort-\nJasper Comprehensive Health Center in Ridgeland, the Franklin C. Fetter \nFamily Health Center in Charleston, and Family Health\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\nCenters, Inc. in Orangeburg were among the first community health \ncenters established in the nation. The Beaufort-Jasper Center was very \ninnovative for its day, in the late 1960s, tackling not only health \ncare needs, but related needs for clean water, indoor toilets and other \nsanitary services. Today, the number of South Carolina health centers \nhas grown to 15. They currently provide more than 167,000 people, 10 \npercent of which are uninsured, with a wide range of primary car \nservices. Yet despite the success story, a need to throw a wider net is \nobvious. Of the 3.8 million South Carolinians, nearly 600,000 have no \nform of health insurance. That means roughly 15% of the state \npopulation is uninsured. Another 600,000 residents are \n``underinsured,'' meaning that they do not receive comprehensive health \ncare coverage from their insurance plans and must pay out-of-pocket for \na number of specialty services, procedures, tests and medications.\n  South Carolina's statistics are mirrored nationwide. The swelling \nranks of the uninsured are outgrowing our present network of community \nhealth centers. Adopting this sense of the Senate amendment will ensure \nthe reach of community health centers expands to meet increasing \ndemand. It is our responsibility to continue providing our neediest \ncitizens with a basic health care safety net. What better way to do \nthat than by building on a program with a record of positive, fiscally \nresponsible results? Everyone can benefit and take pride in such a \nworthwhile investment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2463-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2463-S2464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE U.S.T.T.I.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to \na recent New York Times article, ``India's Unwired Villages Mired in \nthe Distant Past.'' It is because of the struggles developing nations \nface, as illustrated in the article, that I support the United States \nTelecommunications Training Institute (USTTI) and their work to \nincrease access to telecommunications.\n  The USTTI is a nonprofit joint venture connecting the public and \nprivate sectors, providing tuition-free communications and broadcast \ntraining to professionals from around the world. USTTI is geared toward \nmeeting the common training needs of the women and men who are bringing \nmodern communications to the developing world.\n  The development of the telecommunications industry may be seen as a \nsolution to economic troubles in developing nations. The New York Times \narticle I referred to earlier states, ``. . . the wonders of \ntelecommunications technology--distance learning, telemedicine, the \nInternet--offer a way out of the `old India','' where illiteracy, \ndisease, and poverty punctuate the countryside. This scenario is not \nisolated to India, but may be applied to many developing nations \nthroughout the world. In each instance, a big part of the solution is \nthe deployment of modern telecommunications technology.\n  The USTTI has been working to bring modern telecommunication services \nto the developing world for 18 years. The USTTI has offered 935 \ntuition-free courses and has graduated 5,574 men and women who are now \nhelping to make modern telecommunications a reality in their 161 \nrespective countries. The program participants are government officials \nresponsible for developing and implementing telecommunications policies \nin their countries.\n  By allowing developing countries to capitalize fully on the increased \neducational opportunities provided through the USTTI, countries prosper \neconomically and connect themselves to the modern world.\n  Madam President, I ask that the full text of the New York Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 2000]\n\n           India's Unwired Villages Mired in the Distant Past\n\n                          (By Celia W. Dugger)\n\n       Hyderabad, India, March 15.--Cyber Towers rises from the \n     campus of a software technology park here, a sleek Internet-\n     connected symbol of the new India that is feverishly courting \n     foreign investment, selling its wares in the global \n     marketplace and creating wealth at an astonishing rate.\n       But less than 50 miles away, in the poverty-stricken \n     village of Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, the old India is alive and \n     unwell. Illiteracy, sickness and hunger are the villagers' \n     constant companions. Women and children work in the fields \n     for less than 50 cents a day. The sole telephone--an antique \n     contraption of batteries and antennae--almost never works.\n       Like most of the villagers, Muhammad Hussain, an unlettered \n     field hand in a ragged loin cloth, has never seen a computer, \n     but offered that he did once watch an office worker at a \n     typewriter. ``I saw the fingers moving, but I did not know \n     what was being written,'' he said.\n       The chasm between India's educated elite and its \n     impoverished multitudes worries economists, politicians and \n     some software entrepreneurs.\n       Because of the extraordinary success of Indian engineers in \n     Silicon Valley and the Indian software industry's sales to \n     American companies, India and the United States have forged \n     strong economic ties in high technology. President Clinton \n     will acknowledge those links next Friday with a visit to \n     Hitec City, where Microsoft, Oracle and Metamor are ensconced \n     in the air conditioned comfort of Cyber Towers.\n       But during his five-day whirlwind tour of five Indian \n     cities, the president will spend little time in the villages, \n     where almost three-quarters of this country's billion people \n     still live and struggle for the basic necessities.\n       At a time when India's software industry is creating a \n     glamorous digerati and driving a dizzying escalation in stock \n     values on the Bombay exchange, the boom has stirred a debate \n     about the country's social and economic priorities, as \n     well as the potential of high technology to transform the \n     lives of the poor.\n       Some, like Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of the \n     southern state of Andhra Pradesh, whose capital is this \n     bustling city, have an almost messianic faith in technology. \n     Though fewer than one-half of 1 percent of Indian households \n     now have Internet access compared with more than a third in \n     America, the optimists believe that technology is coming that \n     will make connecting to the New cheap enough for a broader \n     spectrum of Indians to afford.\n       ``If a television in a school is connected to the Internet, \n     you can hold literacy classes in the evenings,'' said Randeep \n     Sudan, who oversees information technology for Mr. Naidu. \n     ``You can deliver the best of content to the worst of \n     schools. Imagine the potential to revolutionize the \n     educational process.''\n       But others worry that the boom may be distracting the \n     country from its chronic problems and fear that the last \n     decade's more rapid economic growth--spawned by India's \n     loosening of restrictions on trade and investment--is leaving \n     the poor, and the poorer states, further behind, even as the \n     size of India's middle class has doubled.\n       This is still a country where half the women and a quarter \n     of the men cannot read or write; where more than half the \n     children 4 and under are stunted by malnutrition; where one-\n     third of the population, or more than 300 million people, \n     live in absolute poverty, unable to afford enough to eat; \n     where more than 30 million children 6 to 10 are not in \n     school.\n       K.R. Narayanan, India's first president from an untouchable \n     caste, sounded this alarm in a recent speech.\n       ``We have one of the world's largest reservoirs of \n     technical personnel, but also the world's largest number of \n     illiterates,'' he said, ``the world's largest middle class, \n     but also the largest number of people below the poverty line, \n     and the largest number of children suffering from \n     malnutrition. Our giant factories rise from out of squalor. \n     Our satellites shoot up from the midst of hovels of the \n     poor.''\n       Even those who believe that the importance of the $5 \n     billion software industry is overblown acknowledge its \n     contributions. It has generated 280,000 jobs for the educated \n     and highly skilled. Those workers, in turn, are creating \n     demand for housing, refrigerators and other goods that help \n     the economy grow.\n       And there is potential for greater growth. A study by \n     McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, forecasts \n     that India's software industry could earn $87 billion and \n     employ 2.2 million people before the decade is done.\n       The success of the industry has also stirred optimism about \n     India's ability to compete in a global economy. It has \n     offered capitalist, free market models in a country where \n     government still plays a central role and has hastened the \n     tendency of the country's best and brightest young people to \n     choose careers in business rather than the civil service.\n       ``Every country needs a major success story to lift the \n     psyche and to be seen as a powerhouse in something,'' said \n     Krishna G. Palepu, a Harvard Business School professor who is \n     bullish on the industry. ``This is India's chance. \n     Suddenly, there's a sense of self-confidence and \n     visibility internationally.''\n       But there are also limitations on what high technology can \n     do to increase the productivity of the entire Indian economy, \n     at least for now. The industry itself still generates only \n     about 1 percent of India's gross domestic product and about 1 \n     percent of worldwide software exports.\n       The country desperately needs to attend to the \n     fundamentals, most economists say, and some state leaders \n     like Mr. Naidu concur. It must invest more in primary \n     education and\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\n     health care, build a working system of roads and power grids, \n     reduce subsidies for power and fertilizer that go mostly to \n     the better-off and generate higher rates of growth in \n     agriculture and industry, which employ 8 in 10 Indians.\n       India has lagged behind China, for instance, in educating \n     its children and increasing its exports of textiles, shoes \n     and toys--industries that employ huge numbers of less \n     educated workers in China. By law, India has required those \n     industries to remain small, typically employing fewer than \n     100 people per workplace--putting them at a tremendous \n     disadvantage with China, where such factories employ \n     thousands.\n       In the garment trade, India and China started out in 1980 \n     with about the same level of exports, but by 1996, India was \n     selling $4.6 billion of its goods abroad, compared with \n     China's $25 billion.\n       The Indian government is in dire need of revenues to tackle \n     its daunting ills, but so far the software industry is \n     contributing relatively little to the country's public \n     coffers.\n       Income from software exports is generally exempted from the \n     38.5 percent corporate income tax. And unlike companies in \n     other industries, high technology companies do not have to \n     pay the 40 percent to 60 percent customs duties on computers \n     and other technology items they import to operate their \n     businesses.\n       ``The software industry is making gobs and gobs of \n     profits,'' said Anil Garg, an Indian and a Silicon Valley \n     entrepreneur who is setting up an office for Aristasoft, the \n     new company he helped found, in Cyber Towers. ``And yet there \n     is this huge debate about whether it should pay taxes. I \n     don't understand. Having taxes is a good problem. The roads \n     here are broken, for God's sake. The schools are so bad. We \n     have been the privileged class for so long. It's time for us \n     to pay back.''\n       The software technology park of Hitec City and the village \n     of Sheri Ram Reddy Guda are separated by only a short \n     distance, yet seem to come from different centuries, and to \n     stand at opposite poles, emblems of the new and the old \n     India.\n       Hitec City is a temple to modernity, with a soaring atrium, \n     gargling fountains, an on-site A.T.M., basement car parking \n     and Internet connections for all. The government has created \n     an island where everything works. There are three separate \n     power systems, ensuring that the lights will never go out. \n     And the businesses do not need decent roads; they can deliver \n     their products via satellite links or fiber-optic cables.\n       Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, population 400, seems ancient by \n     comparison. No one here owns a car or even a scooter. The ox \n     cart is still the primary means of transportation and word \n     of mouth the main grapevine. There is no health clinic, no \n     cable television. Raggedy children who should be in school \n     play in the dirt with toys made from twisted wire.\n       The village is connected to the main blacktop highway by a \n     narrow, mile-and-a-half-long dirt road, deeply gouged with \n     ruts, that is nearly impassable in the rainy season.\n       Most of the villages are from the formerly untouchable \n     castes now known as Dalits, and they are grateful to Mr. \n     Naidu's government for building 23 houses for them. But they \n     say they desperately need a better road, reliable electricity \n     and jobs.\n       The village gets only about eight hours of power a day, and \n     that is often of such low voltage that it does not operate \n     the irrigation pumps. When rain is scare, as it is now, the \n     fields lie parched and work is scarce.\n       ``Chandrababu has not given us the current,'' said an old \n     man, Baswapuram Yelleah, referring to the chief minister and \n     waving his handmade hatchet as he gestured angrily with his \n     hands. ``Our eyes are filled with tears when we see our \n     fields.''\n       Yarrea Balamani is a widowed mother of five children, 7 to \n     18. She and her older children do farm work but lately there \n     have been no more than 10 days of work in a month. ``If there \n     was some industry around, we could get work every day,'' she \n     said. ``That would be better for us. It's a very difficult \n     life we are living.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2464-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2464-S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SANDIA LABORATORY INTERNATIONAL ARMS CONTROL CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this week marks the tenth \nanniversary of the International Arms Control Conference hosted by \nSandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I extend my \ncongratulations to Dr. Paul Robinson, Director of Sandia Laboratory for \nhis support for this unique international conference that draws \nhundreds of technical and policy experts from all over the world each \nyear.\n  It is particularly important at this time in history to recognize \nthis Conference here in the Senate. The conclusion of the Cold War has \noffered the United States and the nations of the world an historic \nopportunity to increase security in the international system through \nseeking cooperative measures that would establish international \nstandards of behavior useful for improving global security. When the \nSenate voted to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, I am \npleased to say, this nation acted in a committed and positive way to \ncapitalize on the opportunity we have been afforded.\n  Events in the past two years, however, have brought America to a \ncrossroads with respect to the future of arms control. The Senate \nrecently voted to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty \nsigned by 155 countries, that would have established an international \nstandard permanently banning the testing of nuclear weapons in order to \ncombat the spread of nuclear weapons. I deeply regret that vote by the \nSenate, Mr. President, and am committed to find a way to achieve the \ngoal for which that treaty was negotiated.\n  Meanwhile, the Russian Duma continues its on again off again \nconsideration of the START II Treaty to reduce the number of strategic \nweapons in our respective arsenals of nuclear weapons. To date, they \nhave taken no action. Each time a vote in the Duma approaches, an event \noccurs that postpones its consideration of this important treaty that \nwould reduce the nuclear threat between Russia and the United States \nand, indeed, to the world as a whole.\n  Many Russian officials have observed that no further progress in \nreducing nuclear arsenals is possible if the United States chooses to \nabrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which restricts the \nability of the United States and Russia to deploy national missile \ndefense systems. Many experts and public officials in the U.S., \nhowever, have concluded that the missile threat from rogue governments \nis sufficiently real that the U.S. should move forward on deploying a \nmissile defense regardless of its impact on strategic relations between \nRussia and the United States. The President, however, in signing the \nNational Missile Defense Act, indicated that before deciding to deploy \na national missile defense system, he would assess the potential impact \nof such a decision on arms control regimes that support our national \nsecurity. The nation awaits a decision that could occur this summer.\n  While this critical decision lies ahead, U.S. negotiators have been \nmeeting with their Russian counterparts to explore a potential \nagreement that could permit the U.S. to modify the ABM Treaty in a way \nthat would not threaten the strategic balance between the two \ncountries. The outcome of those negotiations is far from certain. The \nissues that are involved are complex, and extend beyond the dyadic \nrelations between the United States and Russia. Other nuclear powers, \nnotably China, are watching those negotiations very closely to \ndetermine appropriate policy directions regarding their own nuclear \nstrategy and arsenal.\n  As the U.S. and Russia examine the thorny, complex issues involving \nthe relationship between offensive and defensive strategic arms, and \nnations of the world consider the Senate's vote against the CTBT, the \nworld nevertheless remains committed to preventing the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons through the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT). That Treaty, ratified by 187 countries, recently \ncelebrated its 30th anniversary. In 1995, the states parties to that \ntreaty voted to extend its provisions indefinitely. Later this month, \nthe Sixth Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference will take place in \nNew York. Given the events in South Asia during the past year, and the \nvote on CTBT in the Senate this winter, the Review Conference will be a \nvery important convocation at which all states parties, including the \nU.S., will be called on to reaffirm their commitment to the provisions \nof the NPT.\n  Given these current conditions in the international environment, it \nis indeed timely and vital that efforts such as the International Arms \nControl Conference hosted by Sandia Laboratory take place. The meetings \nand dialogues that occur at this Conference have provided important \nunderstanding among the international community on major arms control \nissues and I am confident will continue to do so as long as the world \nseeks to improve security through cooperation.\n  I salute Sandia, and in particular, Dr. Jim Brown, who founded the \nConference ten years ago and has faithfully served as its organizer and \ndriving force during the past decade. If the nations of the world will \nbe able to build upon cooperative understandings\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\nreached through arms control agreements, it will be because of the \nefforts of people such as Dr. Brown, who has devoted a career toward \nthat goal. I extend my best wishes to conference participants and urge \nthem to work hard to build a safer tomorrow for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2465-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ALLAN LAW\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

He also is \nthe founder of Minneapolis Recreation Development, Inc., a non-profit \norganization, which has been providing constructive recreational \nactivities for our urban youth. This after-school and weekend program \nwas developed more than 30 years ago and has been reaching yearly, on \naverage, 400 of our hardest to reach young people.\n  During that period, Allan has spent untold hours meeting the needs of \nour inner-city youth. Day-in, day-out Allan Law wakes up and works to \nmake the Twin Cities a better place and the young people living there \nstronger and healthier. He provides us with a model of what an \nindividual, committed to improving a community, can do.\n  Allan is an inspiration who has been inspiring people for more than a \ngeneration. It is my hope and prayer that he will continue his good \nwork for another 30 years.\n  I rise, as schools begin adjourning for the year, to pay tribute to \nAllan and his incredible work in making Minneapolis a better place--one \nyoung person at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2465-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NORTH EAST WISCONSIN FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL\n\n Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to recognize the \ncontribution of the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council, which \nprovides fair housing enforcement services in the Fox Valley in \nNortheastern Wisconsin. I applaud the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing \nCouncil's fight to end housing discrimination. It is not only wrong, \nintolerable and unjust, it's illegal. While we would like to think that \nhousing discrimination is a thing of the past, it still happens. And \nwhile we would like to think that in this day and age, equal housing \nopportunities are available to everyone, too many people are still shut \nout of the right to live in a home of their choosing. The more \nfrequently citizens are reminded of their rights, the more likely they \nare to seek justice.\n  The North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council's greatest \naccomplishment has been an ongoing enforcement program. As of March 1, \nthere have been 906 fair housing complaints filed with the North East \nWisconsin Fair Housing Council. Every year since 1992 there has been a \nmajor pattern and practice study conducted by the North East Wisconsin \nFair Housing Council. Through national competition, the North East \nWisconsin Fair Housing Council has been the primary contractor on three \nFair Housing Initiative Program grants.\n  The North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council has been at the \nforefront of innovative ways to combat illegal housing discrimination. \nIn 1997 the North East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council received a Fair \nHousing Initiative Program Grant which provided the financial resources \nto increase attention to complaints from four targeted populations: \nHmong, Native Americans, Hispanics and persons with disabilities. The \nNorth East Wisconsin Fair Housing Council developed an Enforcement \nNetwork Program with eight advocacy agencies representing those groups. \nThe goals were to develop better communication with the agencies so \nthey would understand how fair housing issues impacted their agencies \nand clients. Relationships with the agencies were enhanced and more \nefficient services were provided to the clients.\n  Fair Housing is a right for all Americans, and I commend the North \nEast Wisconsin Fair Housing Council for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2465-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, without amendment:\n       H.R. 3090.

CONGRESSIONAL LOCK BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the Social \n     Security trust funds are off-budget for purposes of the \n     President's budget submission and the concurrent resolution \n     on the budget;\n       (2) the Social Security trust funds have been running \n     surpluses for 18 years;\n       (3) these surpluses have been used to implicitly finance \n     the general operations of the Federal Government;\n       (4) in fiscal year 2001, the Social Security surplus will \n     reach $166,000,000,000;\n       (5) in fiscal year 1999, the Federal budget was balanced \n     without using Social Security;\n       (6) the only way to ensure that Social Security surpluses \n     are not diverted for other purposes is to balance the budget \n     exclusive of such surpluses; and\n       (7) Congress and the President should take such steps as \n     are necessary to ensure that future budgets continue to be \n     balanced excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds.\n       (b) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate to consider any revision to \n     this concurrent resolution, or any other concurrent \n     resolution on the budget, or any amendment thereto or \n     conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for any \n     fiscal year.\n       (2) Deficit levels.--For purposes of this subsection, a \n     deficit shall be the level (if any) set forth in the most \n     recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     that fiscal year pursuant to section 301(a)(3) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (c) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct \n     spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and \n     surpluses for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House \n     of Representatives or the Senate, as applicable.\n       (d) Exception.--Subsection (b) shall not apply if--\n       (1) the most recent of the Department of Commerce's \n     advance, preliminary, or final reports of actual real \n     economic growth indicate that the rate of real economic \n     growth for each of the most recently reported quarter and the \n     immediately preceding quarter is less than 1 percent; or\n       (2) a declaration of war is in effect.\n       (e) Social Security Look-Back.--If in any fiscal year the \n     Social Security surplus is used to finance general operations \n     of the Federal Government, an amount equal to the amount used \n     shall be deducted from the available amount of discretionary \n     spending for the following fiscal year for purposes of any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (f) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (b) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 202.

An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (d) Definition of an Emergency Requirement.--A provision \n     shall be considered an emergency designation if it designates \n     any item an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (e) Form of the Point of Order.--A point of order under \n     this section may be raised by a Senator as provided in \n     section 313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (f) Conference Reports.--If a point of order is sustained \n     under this section against a conference report the report \n     shall be disposed of as provided in section 313(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (g) Exception for Defense Spending.--Subsection (b) shall \n     not apply against an emergency designation for a provision \n     making discretionary appropriations in the defense category.\n\n     SEC. 208. RESERVE FUND PENDING INCREASE OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 \n                   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The functional totals with respect to discretionary \n     spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if \n     implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the \n     limit on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 set out \n     in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985. Nonetheless, the allocation \n     pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to the Committee on \n     Appropriations is in compliance with current law spending \n     limits.\n       (2) Consequently unless and until the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 is increased, aggregate \n     appropriations which exceed the current law limits would \n     still be out of order in the Senate and subject to a \n     supermajority vote.\n       (3) The functional totals contained in this concurrent \n     resolution envision a level of discretionary spending for \n     fiscal year 2001 as follows:\n       (A) For the discretionary category: $602,179,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $593,926,000,000 in outlays.\n       (B) For the highway category: $26,920,000,000 in outlays.\n       (C) For the mass transit category: $4,639,000,000 in \n     outlays.\n       (4) To facilitate the Senate completing its legislative \n     responsibilities for the 106th Congress in a timely fashion, \n     it is imperative that the Senate consider legislation which \n     increases the discretionary spending limit for fiscal year \n     2001 as soon as possible.\n       (b) Adjustment to Allocations.--Whenever a bill or joint \n     resolution becomes law that increases the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 set out in section 251(c) \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     shall increase the allocation called for in section 302(a) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the appropriate \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n       (c) Limitation on Adjustment.--An adjustment made pursuant \n     to subsection (b) shall not result in an allocation under \n     section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that \n     exceeds the total budget authority and outlays set forth in \n     subsection (a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 209.

An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 210.

RESERVE FUND FOR EARLY LEARNING AND PARENT SUPPORT \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Adjustment.--When the Committee on Education and \n     Workforce of the House of Representatives or the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate reports \n     a bill, an amendment is offered in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, or a conference report is \n     filed that improves opportunities at the local level for \n     early learning, brain development, and school readiness for \n     young children from birth to age 6 and offers support \n     programs for such families, particularly those with special \n     needs such as mental health issues and behavioral disorders, \n     the relevant chairman of the Committee on the Budget may \n     increase the allocation aggregates, functions, totals, and \n     other budgetary totals in the resolution by the amount of \n     budget authority (and the outlays resulting therefrom) \n     provided by the legislation for such purpose in accordance \n     with subsection (b) if the legislation does not cause an on-\n     budget deficit.\n       (b) Limitations.--The adjustments to the aggregates and \n     totals pursuant to subsection (a) shall not exceed \n     $8,500,000,000 on-budget authority (and the outlays resulting \n     therefrom) for the period fiscal year 2001 through 2005.\n\n               TITLE III--SENSE OF THE SENATE PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CONTROLLING AND ELIMINATING \n                   THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM OF \n                   TUBERCULOSIS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) nearly 2,000,000 people worldwide die each year of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15- and 44-years old and is a leading cause of \n     children becoming orphans.\n       (2) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     those nations that had previously largely controlled the \n     disease. This is complicated in the United States by the \n     growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, \n     international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS.\n       (3) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (4) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assumes that additional \n     resources should be provided to fund international \n     tuberculosis control efforts at $60,000,000 in fiscal year \n     2001, consistent with authorizing legislation approved by the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in 1998, 33.2 percent of women in the labor force have \n     children under 14;\n       (2) in 1998, 65.2 percent of women with children younger \n     than age 6, and 78.4 percent of women with children ages 6 \n     through 17 were in the labor force, and 41.6 percent of women \n     with children younger than 3 were employed full-time;\n       (3) 1,920,000 couples both working and with children under \n     18 had family incomes of under $30,000 (10.3 percent);\n       (4)(A) in 1998, 11,700,000 children out of 21,300,000 (55.1 \n     percent) under the age of 5 have employed mothers;\n       (B) 18.4 percent of children under 6 are cared for by their \n     fathers at home;\n       (C) another 5.5 percent (562,000) are looked after by their \n     mother either at home or away from home; and\n       (D) in other words, less than a quarter (23.9 percent) of \n     these children are taken care of by 1 parent;\n       (5) a 1997 General Accounting Office study found that the \n     increased work participation requirement of the welfare \n     reform law will cause the need for child care to exceed the \n     known supply;\n       (6) a 1995 study by the Urban Institute of child care \n     prices in 6 cities found that the average cost of daycare for \n     a 2-year-old in a child care center ranged from $3,100 to \n     $8,100;\n       (7) for an entry-level worker, the family's child care \n     costs at the average price of care for an infant in a child \n     care center would be at least 50 percent of family income in \n     5 of the 6 cities examined;\n       (8) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a parent may be \n     at home with the child;\n       (9) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income (a family with children, wife does not work) is \n     $13,566 less than the average income of 2-parent families \n     with 2 incomes;\n       (10) a recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families''; and\n       (11) increased tax relief directed at making child care \n     more affordable, and increased funding for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant, would take significant steps toward \n     bringing quality child care within the reach of many parents, \n     and would increase the options available to parents in \n     deciding how best to care for their children.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume--\n       (1) that tax relief should be directed to parents who are \n     struggling to afford quality child care, including those who \n     wish to stay home to care for a child, and should be included \n     in any tax cut package; and\n       (2) a total of $4,567,000,000 in funding for the Child Care \n     and Development Block Grant in fiscal year 2001.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX RELIEF FOR COLLEGE \n                   TUITION PAID AND FOR INTEREST PAID ON STUDENT \n                   LOANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in our increasingly competitive global economy, the \n     attainment of a higher education is critical to the economic \n     success of an individual, as evidenced by the fact that, in \n     1975, college graduates earned an average of 57 percent more \n     than those who just finished high school, compared to 76 \n     percent more today;\n       (2) the cost of attaining a higher education has outpaced \n     both inflation and median family incomes;\n       (3) specifically, over the past 20 years, the cost of \n     college tuition has quadrupled (growing faster than any \n     consumer item, including health care and nearly twice as fast \n     as inflation) and 8 times as fast as median household \n     incomes;\n       (4) despite recent increases passed by Congress, the value \n     of the maximum Pell Grant has declined 23 percent since 1975 \n     in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing more students to rely on \n     student loans to finance the cost of a higher education;\n       (5) from 1992 to 1998, the demand for student loans soared \n     82 percent and the average student loan increased 367 \n     percent;\n       (6) according to the Department of Education, there is \n     approximately $150,000,000,000 in outstanding student loan \n     debt, and students borrowed more during the 1990's than \n     during the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's combined; and\n       (7) in Congress, proposals have been made to address the \n     rising cost of tuition and mounting student debt, including a \n     bipartisan proposal to provide a deduction for tuition paid \n     and a credit for interest paid on student loans.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that any tax cut package \n     reported by the Finance Committee and passed by Congress \n     during the fiscal year 2001 budget reconciliation process \n     include tax relief for college tuition paid and for interest \n     paid on student loans.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the Nation's \n     foremost research center;\n       (2) the Nation's commitment to and investment in biomedical \n     research has resulted in better health and an improved \n     quality of life for all Americans;\n       (3) continued biomedical research funding must be ensured \n     so that medical doctors and scientists have the security to \n     commit to conducting long-term research studies;\n       (4) funding for the National Institutes of Health should \n     continue to increase in order to prevent the cessation of \n     biomedical research studies and the loss of medical doctors \n     and research scientists to private research organizations; \n     and\n       (5) the National Institutes of Health conducts research \n     protocols without proprietary interests, thereby ensuring \n     that the best health care is researched and made available to \n     the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume increased funding \n     in function 550 (Health) for the National Institutes of \n     Health of $2,700,000,000, reflecting the commitment made in \n     the fiscal year 1998 Senate Budget Resolution to double the \n     National Institute of Health budget by 2003.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING LEVELS IN \n                   EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that of the amounts provided for elementary \n     and secondary education within the Budget Function 500 of \n     this resolution for fiscal years 2001 through 2005, such \n     funds shall be appropriated in proportion to and in \n     accordance with the levels authorized in the Educational \n     Opportunities Act, S. 2.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY \n                   RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In its review of government operations, the General \n     Accounting Office noted that it was unable to determine the \n     extent of improper government payments, due to the poor \n     quality of agency accounting practices. In particular, the \n     General Accounting Office cited the Government's inability \n     to--\n       (A) ``properly account for and report billions of dollars \n     of property, equipment, materials, and supplies and certain \n     stewardship assets''; and\n       (B) ``properly prepare the Federal Government's financial \n     statements, including balancing the statements, accounting \n     for billions of dollars of transactions between governmental \n     entities, and properly and consistently compiling the \n     information in the financial statements.''.\n       (2) Private economic forecasters are currently more \n     optimistic than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Blue \n     Chip expects 2000 real GDP growth of 4.1 percent, whereas the \n     Congressional Budget Office expects 3.3 percent growth. From \n     1999 through 2005, Blue Chip expects real GDP to grow more \n     than 0.3 percentage points faster per year than the \n     Congressional Budget Office does. Using budgetary rules of \n     thumb, this latter difference translates into more than \n     $150,000,000,000 over the 5-year budget window.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels contained in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) there are billions of dollars in wasted expenditures in \n     the Federal Government that should be eliminated; and\n       (2) higher projected budget surpluses arising from \n     reductions in government waste and stronger revenue inflows \n     could be used in the future for additional tax relief or debt \n     reduction.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REGARDING THE INADEQUACY OF \n                   THE PAYMENTS FOR SKILLED NURSING CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Congress confronted and addressed the funding crisis \n     for medicare beneficiaries requiring skilled nursing care \n     through the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999;\n       (2) Congress recognized the need to address the inadequacy \n     of the prospective payment system for certain levels of care, \n     as well as the need to end arbitrary limits on rehabilitative \n     therapies. Congress restored $2,700,000,000 to reduce access \n     threats to skilled care for medicare beneficiaries; and\n       (3) Currently, more than 1,600 skilled nursing facilities \n     caring for more than 175,000 frail and elderly Americans have \n     filed for bankruptcy protection.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Administration should identify areas where they \n     have the authority to make changes to improve quality, \n     including analyzing and fixing the labor component of the \n     skilled nursing facility market basket update factor; and\n       (2) while Congress deliberates funding structural medicare \n     reform and the addition of a prescription drug benefit, it \n     must maintain the continued viability of the current skilled \n     nursing benefit. Therefore, the committees of jurisdiction \n     should ensure that medicare beneficiaries requiring skilled \n     nursing care have access to that care and that those \n     providers have the resources to meet the expectation for high \n     quality care.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CARA PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that, if the Congress and\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\n     the President so choose, the following programs can be fully \n     funded as discretionary programs in fiscal year 2001, \n     including--\n       (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund programs;\n       (2) the Federal aid to Wildlife Fund;\n       (3) the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Grants;\n       (4) the National Historic Preservation Fund;\n       (5) the Payment in Lieu of Taxes; and\n       (6) the North American Wetlands Conservation Act.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON VETERANS' MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) this budget addresses concerns about veterans' medical \n     care;\n       (2) we successfully increased the appropriation for \n     veterans' medical care by $1,700,000,000 last year, although \n     the President had proposed no increase in funding in his \n     budget; and\n       (3) this year's budget proposes to increase the veterans' \n     medical care appropriation by $1,400,000,000, the level of \n     funding in the President's budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume an increase of \n     $1,400,000,000 in veterans' medical care appropriations in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPACT AID.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Impact Aid, as created by Congress in 1950, \n     fulfills a Federal obligation to local educational agencies \n     impacted by a Federal presence;\n       (2) the Impact Aid provides funds to these local \n     educational agencies to help them meet the basic educational \n     needs of all their children, particularly the needs of \n     transient military dependent students, Native American \n     children, and students from low-income housing projects; and\n       (3) the Impact Aid is funded at a level less than what is \n     required to fully fund ``all'' federally connected local \n     educational agencies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Impact Aid \n     Program strive to reach the goal that all local educational \n     agencies eligible for Impact Aid receive at a minimum, 40 \n     percent of their maximum payment under sections 8002 and \n     8003.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR INCREASED \n                   ACREAGE UNDER THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM \n                   AND THE WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands \n     Reserve Program (WRP) have been successful, voluntary, \n     incentive-based endeavors that over the last decade and a \n     half have turned millions of acres of marginal cropland into \n     reserves that protect wildlife in the United States, provide \n     meaningful income to farmers and ranchers (especially in \n     periods of collapsed commodity prices), and combat soil and \n     water erosion. CRP and WRP also provide increased \n     opportunities for hunting, fishing, and other recreational \n     activities.\n       (2) CRP provides landowners with technical and financial \n     assistance, including annual rental payments, in exchange for \n     removing environmentally sensitive farmland from production \n     and implementing conservation practices. Currently, CRP \n     includes around 31,300,000 acres in the United States.\n       (3) Similarly, WRP offers technical and financial \n     assistance to landowners who select to restore wetlands. \n     Currently, WRP includes 785,000 acres nationwide.\n       (4) Furthermore, bipartisan legislation has been introduced \n     in the 106th Congress to increase the acreage permitted under \n     both CRP and WRP. The Administration also supports raising \n     the acreage limitations in both programs.\n       (5) Unfortunately, both CRP and WRP may soon become victims \n     of their own success and their respective statutory acreage \n     limitations unless Congress acts. Given the popularity and \n     demand for these conservation programs, the statutory acreage \n     limitations will likely exhaust resources available to \n     producers who want to participate in CRP or WRP. As currently \n     authorized, CRP has an enrollment cap of 36,400,000 acres and \n     WRP is limited at 975,000 acres. As of October 1, 1999, \n     enrollment in CRP stood at approximately 31,300,000 acres and \n     enrollment in WRP at just over 785,000 acres.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress and \n     the Administration should take steps to raise the acreage \n     limits of the CRP and WRP in order to make these programs \n     available to aid the preservation and conservation of \n     sensitive natural soil and water resources without negatively \n     effecting rural communities. Further, such actions should \n     help improve farm income for agricultural producers and \n     restore prosperity and growth to rural sectors of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tax code has become increasingly complex, \n     undermining confidence in the system, and often undermining \n     the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and equity;\n       (2) some have estimated that the resources required to keep \n     records and file returns already cost American families an \n     additional 10 percent to 20 percent over what they actually \n     pay in income taxes; and\n       (3) if it is to enact a greatly simplified tax code, \n     Congress should have a thorough understanding of the problem \n     as well as specific proposals to consider.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation shall develop a report and alternative \n     proposals on tax simplification by the end of the year, and \n     the Department of the Treasury is requested to develop a \n     report and alternative proposals on tax simplification by the \n     end of the year.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT BY THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FEDERAL TRADE \n                   COMMISSION REGARDING AGRICULTURE MERGERS AND \n                   ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTIVITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is \n     charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws, including the review of corporate mergers \n     likely to reduce competition in particular markets, with a \n     goal of protecting the competitive process;\n       (2) the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade \n     Commission is also charged with enforcement of the antitrust \n     laws, including the review of corporate mergers likely to \n     reduce competition;\n       (3) the Antitrust Division and the Bureau of Competition \n     are also responsible for the prosecution of companies and \n     individuals who engage in anti-competitive behavior and \n     unfair trade practices;\n       (4) the number of merger filings under the Hart-Scott-\n     Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which the \n     Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Federal Trade \n     Commission, is required to review, has increased \n     significantly in fiscal years 1998 and 1999;\n       (5) large agri-businesses have constituted part of this \n     trend in mergers and acquisitions;\n       (6) farmers and small agricultural producers are \n     experiencing one of the worst periods of economic downturn in \n     years;\n       (7) farmers currently get less than a quarter of every \n     retail food dollar, down from nearly half of every retail \n     food dollar in 1952;\n       (8) the top 4 beef packers presently control 80 percent of \n     the market, the top 4 pork producers control 57 percent of \n     the market, and the largest sheep processors and poultry \n     processors control 73 percent and 55 percent of the market, \n     respectively;\n       (9) the 4 largest grain processing companies presently \n     account for approximately 62 percent of the Nation's flour \n     milling, and the 4 largest firms control approximately 75 \n     percent of the wet corn milling and soybean crushing \n     industry;\n       (10) farmers and small, independent producers are concerned \n     about the substantial increase in concentration in the \n     agriculture industry and significantly diminished \n     opportunities in the marketplace; and\n       (11) farmers and small, independent producers are also \n     concerned about possible anticompetitive behavior and unfair \n     business practices in the agriculture industry.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Antitrust Division and the Bureau of Competition \n     will have adequate resources to enable them to meet their \n     statutory requirements, including those related to reviewing \n     increasingly numerous and complex mergers and investigating \n     and prosecuting anticompetitive business activity; and\n       (2) these departments will--\n       (A) dedicate considerable resources to matters and \n     transactions dealing with agri-business antitrust and \n     competition; and\n       (B) ensure that all vertical and horizontal mergers \n     implicating agriculture and all complaints regarding possible \n     anticompetitive business practices in the agriculture \n     industry will receive extraordinary scrutiny.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FAIR MARKETS FOR \n                   AMERICAN FARMERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States agricultural producers are the most \n     efficient and competitive in the world;\n       (2) United States agricultural producers are at a \n     competitive disadvantage in the world market because the \n     European Union outspends the United States (on a dollar/acre \n     basis) by a ratio of 10:1 on domestic support and by a ratio \n     of 60:1 on export subsidies;\n       (3) the support the European Union gives their producers \n     results in more prosperous rural communities in Europe than \n     in the United States;\n       (4) the European Union blocked consensus at the World Trade \n     Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle because Europe \n     does not want to surrender its current advantage in world \n     markets;\n       (5) despite the competitiveness of American farmers, the \n     European advantage has led to a declining United States share \n     of the world market for agricultural products;\n       (6) the United States Department of Agriculture reports \n     that United States export growth has lagged behind that of \n     our major competitors, resulting in a loss of United States \n     market share, from 24 percent in 1981 to its current level of \n     18 percent;\n       (7) the United States Department of Agriculture also \n     reports that United States market share of global \n     agricultural trade has eroded steadily over the past 2 \n     decades, which could culminate in the United States losing \n     out to the European Union as the world's top agricultural \n     exporter sometime in 2000;\n       (8) prices of agricultural commodities in the United States \n     are at 50-year lows in real terms, creating a serious \n     economic crisis in rural America; and\n       (9) fundamental fairness requires that the playing field be \n     leveled so that United States farmers are no longer at a \n     competitive disadvantage.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the United States should take steps to increase support \n     for American farmers in order to level the playing field for \n     United States agricultural producers and increase the \n     leverage of the\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n     United States in World Trade Organization negotiations on \n     agriculture as long as such support is not trade distorting, \n     and does not otherwise exceed or impair existing Uruguay \n     Round obligations; and\n       (2) such actions should improve United States farm income \n     and restore the prosperity of rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN AND SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty \n     rate among women would have been 52.2 percent, and among \n     widows would have been 60.6 percent;\n       (2) women tend to live longer and tend to have lower \n     lifetime earnings than men do;\n       (3) during their working years, women earn an average of 70 \n     cents for every dollar men earn; and\n       (4) women spend an average of 11.5 years out of their \n     careers to care for their families, and are more likely to \n     work part-time than full-time.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) women face unique obstacles in ensuring retirement \n     security and survivor and disability stability;\n       (2) Social Security plays an essential role in guaranteeing \n     inflation-protected financial stability for women throughout \n     their old age;\n       (3) the Congress and the Administration should act, as part \n     of Social Security reform, to ensure that widows and other \n     poor elderly women receive more adequate benefits that reduce \n     their poverty rates and that women, under whatever approach \n     is taken to reform Social Security, should receive no lesser \n     a share of overall federally funded retirement benefits than \n     they receive today; and\n       (4) the sacrifice that women make to care for their family \n     should be recognized during reform of Social Security and \n     that women should not be penalized by taking an average of \n     11.5 years out of their careers to care for their family.\n\n     SEC. 316. PROTECTION OF BATTERED WOMEN AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year an estimated 1,000,000 women suffer nonfatal \n     violence by an intimate partner.\n       (2) Nearly 1 out of 3 adult women can expect to experience \n     at least 1 physical assault by a partner during adulthood.\n       (3) Domestic violence is statistically consistent across \n     racial and ethnic lines. It does not discriminate based on \n     race or economic status.\n       (4) The chance of being victimized by an intimate partner \n     is 10 times greater for a woman than a man.\n       (5) Past and current victims of domestic violence are over-\n     represented in the welfare population. It is estimated that \n     at least 60 percent of current welfare beneficiaries have \n     experienced some form of domestic violence.\n       (6) Abused women who do seek employment face barriers as a \n     result of domestic violence. Welfare studies show that 15 to \n     50 percent of abused women report interference from their \n     partner with education, training, or employment.\n       (7) The programs established by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 have empowered communities to address the threat \n     caused by domestic violence.\n       (8) Since 1995, Congress has appropriated close to \n     $1,800,000,000 to fund programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994, including the STOP program, \n     shelters for battered women and children, the domestic \n     violence hotline, and Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention injury control programs.\n       (9) The programs established by the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 have been and continue to comprise a successful \n     national strategy for addressing the needs of battered women \n     and the public health threat caused by this violence.\n       (10) The Supreme Court could act during this session to \n     overturn a major protection and course of action provided for \n     in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. In United States \n     v. Morrison/Brzonkala, the Supreme Court will address the \n     issue of the constitutionality of the Federal civil rights \n     remedy under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and may \n     overturn congressional intent to elevate violence against \n     women to a category protected under Federal civil rights law.\n       (11) The actions taken by the courts and the failure to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 has \n     generated a great deal of concern in communities nationwide.\n       (12) Funding for the programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 is the only lifeline for battered \n     women and Congress has a moral obligation to continue funding \n     and to strengthen key components of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994.\n       (13) Congress and the Administration should work to ensure \n     the continued funding of programs established by the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that, in light of \n     the pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of \n     the Federal civil rights remedy in the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 and the lack of action on legislation \n     reauthorizing and strengthening the provisions of that Act--\n       (1) Congress, through reauthorization of the programs \n     established by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, should \n     work to eliminate economic barriers that trap women and \n     children in violent homes and relationships; and\n       (2) full funding for the programs established by the \n     Violence Against Women Act of 1994 will be provided from the \n     Violent Crime Reduction Fund.\n\n     SEC. 317. USE OF FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN COMBATTING MEDICARE \n                   FRAUD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the solvency of the medicare trust funds is of vital \n     importance to the well-being of the Nation's seniors and \n     other vulnerable people in need of quality health care;\n       (2) fraud against the medicare trust funds is a major \n     problem resulting in the depletion of the trust funds; and\n       (3) chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code (commonly \n     referred to as the False Claims Act) and the qui tam \n     provisions of that chapter are vital tools in combatting \n     fraud against the medicare program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that chapter 37 of \n     title 31, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     False Claims Act) and the qui tam provisions of that chapter \n     are essential tools in combatting medicare fraud and should \n     not be weakened in any way.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Army National Guard relies heavily upon thousands \n     of full-time employees, Military Technicians and Active \n     Guard/Reserves, to ensure unit readiness throughout the Army \n     National Guard;\n       (2) these employees perform vital day-to-day functions, \n     ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \n     roles, that allow the drill weekends and annual active duty \n     training of the traditional Guardsmen to be dedicated to \n     preparation for the National Guard's warfighting and \n     peacetime missions;\n       (3) when the ability to provide sufficient Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Technicians end strength is reduced, unit \n     readiness, as well as quality of life for soldiers and \n     families is degraded;\n       (4) the Army National Guard, with agreement from the \n     Department of Defense, requires a minimum essential \n     requirement of 23,500 Active Guard/Reserves and 25,500 \n     Technicians; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2001 budget request for the Army \n     National Guard provides resources sufficient for \n     approximately 22,430 Active Guard/Reserves and 23,957 \n     Technicians, end strength shortfalls of 1,052 and 1,543, \n     respectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.-- It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that the Department \n     of Defense will give priority to funding the Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Military Technicians at levels authorized by \n     Congress in the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense \n     authorization bill.\n\n     SEC. 319. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MILITARY READINESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Air Force stated that the United \n     States Air Force's top unfunded readiness priority for fiscal \n     year 2000 was its aircraft spares and repair parts account \n     and top Air Force officers have said that getting more spares \n     is a top priority to improve readiness rates;\n       (2) the Chief of Naval Operations stated that the aircraft \n     spares and repair parts account for a top readiness priority \n     important to the long-term health of the Navy;\n       (3) the General Accounting Office's study of personnel \n     retention problems in the armed services cited shortages of \n     spares and repair parts as a major reason why people are \n     leaving the services;\n       (4) the fiscal year 2001 budget request decreases the Air \n     Force's spares and repair parts account by 13 percent from \n     fiscal year 2000 expected levels; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2001 budget request decreases the \n     Navy's spares and repair parts account by 6 percent from the \n     fiscal year 2000 expected levels.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in the budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will protect the Department of Defense's \n     readiness accounts, including spares and repair parts, and \n     operations and maintenance, and use the requested levels as \n     the minimum baseline for fiscal year 2001 authorization and \n     appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPENSATION FOR THE CHINESE \n                   EMBASSY BOMBING IN BELGRADE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume funds designated to compensate the People's \n     Republic of China for the damage inadvertently done to their \n     embassy in Belgrade by NATO forces in May 1999, should not be \n     appropriated from the international affairs budget.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING FUNDING OF DIGITAL \n                   OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) computers, the Internet, and information networks are \n     not luxury items but basic tools largely responsible for \n     driving the current economic expansions;\n       (2) information technology utility relies on software \n     applications and online content;\n       (3) access to computers and the Internet and the ability to \n     use this technology effectively is becoming increasingly \n     important for full participation in America's economic, \n     political, and social life; and\n       (4) unequal access to technology and high-tech skills by \n     income, educational level, race, and geography could deepen \n     and reinforce the divisions that exist within American \n     society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Committees \n     on Appropriations and Finance should support efforts that \n     address the digital divide, including tax incentives and \n     funding to--\n       (1) broaden access to information technologies;\n       (2) provide workers and teachers with information \n     technology training;\n       (3) promote innovative online content and software \n     applications that will improve commerce, education, and \n     quality of life; and\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\n       (4) help provide information and communications technology \n     to underserved communities.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING IMMUNIZATION FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) vaccines protect children and adults against serious \n     and potentially fatal diseases;\n       (2) society saves up to $24 in medical and societal costs \n     for every dollar spent on vaccines;\n       (3) every day, 11,000 babies are born--4,000,000 each \n     year--and each child needs up to 19 doses of vaccine by age \n     2;\n       (4) approximately 1,000,000 2-year-olds have not received \n     all of the recommended vaccine doses;\n       (5) the immunization program under section 317(j)(1) under \n     the Public Health Service Act, administered by the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, provides grants to States \n     and localities for critical activities including immunization \n     registries, outbreak control, provider education, outreach \n     efforts, and linkages with other public health and welfare \n     services;\n       (6) Federal grants to States and localities for these \n     activities have declined from $271,000,000 in 1995 to \n     $139,000,000 in 2000;\n       (7) because of these funding reductions States are \n     struggling to maintain immunization rates and have \n     implemented severe cuts to immunization delivery activities;\n       (8) even with significant gains in national immunization \n     rates, underimmunized children still exist and there are a \n     number of subpopulations where coverage rates remain low and \n     are actually declining;\n       (9) rates in many of the Nation's urban areas, including \n     Chicago and Houston, are unacceptably low; and\n       (10) these pockets of need create pools of susceptible \n     children and increase the risk of dangerous disease \n     outbreaks.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that Congress should \n     enact legislation that provides $214,000,000 in funding for \n     immunization grants under section 317 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b) for infrastructure and delivery \n     activities, including targeted support for immunization \n     project areas with low or declining immunization rates or who \n     have subpopulations with special needs.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL \n                   BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE TO LOW-\n                   INCOME EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 25,000,000 workers in the United States were uninsured \n     in 1997 and more than two-thirds of the uninsured workers \n     earn less than $20,000 annually, according to a Henry J. \n     Kaiser Family Foundation report;\n       (2) the percentage of employees of small businesses who \n     have employer-sponsored health insurance coverage decreased \n     from 52 percent in 1996 to 47 percent in 1998; for the \n     smallest employers, those with 3 to 9 workers, the percentage \n     of employees covered by employer-sponsored health insurance \n     fell from 36 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in 1998;\n       (3) between 1996 and 1998, health premiums for small \n     businesses increased 5.2 percent; premiums increased by 8 \n     percent for the smallest employers, the highest increase \n     among all small businesses;\n       (4) monthly family coverage for workers at firms with 3 to \n     9 employees cost $520 in 1998, compared to $462 for family \n     coverage for workers at large firms; and\n       (5) only 39 percent of small businesses with a significant \n     percentage of low-income employees offer employer-provided \n     health insurance and such companies are half as likely to \n     offer health benefits to such employees as are companies that \n     have only a small percentage of low-income employees.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should enact legislation that allows small businesses to \n     claim a tax credit when they provide health insurance to low-\n     income employees.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL \n                   JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our success in the fight against crime and improvements \n     in the administration of justice are the result of a \n     bipartisan effort; and\n       (2) since 1993 the Congress and the President have \n     increased justice funding by 92 percent, and a strong \n     commitment to law enforcement and the administration of \n     justice remains appropriate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that funds to \n     improve the justice system will be available as follows:\n       (1) $665,000,000 for the expanded support of direct Federal \n     enforcement, adjudicative, and correctional-detention \n     activities.\n       (2) $50,000,000 in additional funds to combat terrorism, \n     including cyber crime.\n       (3) $41,000,000 in additional funds for construction costs \n     for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center.\n       (4) $200,000,000 in support of Customs and Immigration and \n     Nationalization Service port of entry officers for the \n     development and implementation of the ACE computer system \n     designed to meet critical trade and border security needs.\n       (5) Funding is available for the continuation of such \n     programs as: the Byrne Grant Program, Violence Against Women, \n     Juvenile Accountability Block Grants, First Responder \n     Training, Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, Weed and Seed, \n     Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing, State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Drug Courts, Residential \n     Substance Abuse Treatment, Crime Identification Technologies, \n     Bulletproof Vests, Counterterrorism, Interagency Law \n     Enforcement Coordination.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PELL GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested;\n       (2) higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals; for example recipients of bachelor's degrees \n     earn an average of 75 percent per year more than those with \n     high school diplomas and experience half as much unemployment \n     as high school graduates;\n       (3) access to a college education has become a hallmark of \n     American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in \n     equality of opportunity;\n       (4) for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an established and effective means of providing access to \n     higher education;\n       (5) over the past decade, Pell Grant has failed to keep up \n     with inflation. Over the past 25 years, the value of the \n     average Pell Grant has decreased by 23 percent--it is now \n     worth only 77 percent of what Pell Grants were worth in 1975;\n       (6) grant aid as a portion of student aid has fallen \n     significantly over the past 5 years. Grant aid used to \n     comprise 55 percent of total aid awarded and loans comprised \n     just over 40 percent. Now that trend has been reversed so \n     that loans comprise nearly 60 percent of total aid awarded \n     and grants only comprise 40 percent of total aid awarded;\n       (7) the percentage of freshmen attending public and private \n     4-year institutions from families whose income is below the \n     national median has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that within the \n     discretionary allocation provided to the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the funding for the maximum Pell Grant award \n     should be at or above the level requested by the President.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC \n                   EDUCATION REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Recent scientific evidence demonstrates that enhancing \n     children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual \n     development before the age of 6 results in tremendous \n     benefits throughout life.\n       (2) Successful schools are led by well-trained, highly \n     qualified principals, but many principals do not get the \n     training in management skills that the principals need to \n     ensure their school provides an excellent education for every \n     child.\n       (3) Good teachers are a crucial catalyst to quality \n     education, but 1 in 4 new teachers do not meet State \n     certification requirements; each year more than 50,000 \n     underprepared teachers enter the classroom; and 12 percent of \n     new teachers have had no teacher training at all.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Federal \n     Government should support State and local educational \n     agencies engaged in comprehensive reform of their public \n     education system and that any public education reform should \n     include at least the following principles:\n       (1) Every child should begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) Training and development for principals and teachers \n     should be a priority.\n\n     SEC. 327. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING \n                   FOR UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States international leadership is essential to \n     maintaining security and peace for all Americans;\n       (2) such leadership depends on effective diplomacy as well \n     as a strong military;\n       (3) effective diplomacy requires adequate resources both \n     for operations and security of United States embassies and \n     for international programs;\n       (4) in addition to building peace, prosperity, and \n     democracy around the world, programs in the International \n     Affairs (150) budget serve United States interests by \n     ensuring better jobs and a higher standard of living, \n     promoting the health of our citizens and preserving our \n     natural environment, and protecting the rights and safety of \n     those who travel or do business overseas;\n       (5) real spending for International Affairs has declined \n     more than 40 percent since the mid-1980's, at the same time \n     that major new challenges and opportunities have arisen from \n     the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the worldwide \n     trends toward democracy and free markets;\n       (6) current ceilings on discretionary spending will impose \n     severe additional cuts in funding for International Affairs;\n       (7) improved security for United States diplomatic missions \n     and personnel will place further strain on the International \n     Affairs budget absent significant additional resources;\n       (8) the United States cannot reduce efforts to safeguard \n     nuclear materials in the former Soviet States or shortchange \n     initiatives aimed at maintaining stability on the Korean \n     peninsula, where 37,000 United States forces are deployed. We \n     cannot reduce support for peace in the Middle East or in \n     Northern Ireland or in the Balkans. We cannot stop fighting \n     terror or simply surrender to the spread of HIV/AIDS. We must \n     continue to support all of these things, which are difficult \n     to achieve without adequate and realistic funding levels; and\n       (9) the President's request for funds for fiscal year 2001 \n     would adequately finance our International Affairs programs \n     without detracting from our defense and domestic needs. It \n     would help keep America prosperous and secure. It would \n     enable us to leverage the contributions of allies and friends \n     on behalf of democracy and peace. It would allow us to \n     protect the interests of Americans who travel, study, or do \n     business overseas. It would do all these things and more for \n     about 1 penny of every dollar the Federal Government spends.\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that additional \n     budgetary resources should be identified for function 150 to \n     enable successful United States international leadership.\n\n     SEC. 328. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE HIV/AIDS CRISIS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) More than 16,000,000 people have been killed by \n     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) since the epidemic \n     began.\n       (2) 14,000,000 Africans have died as a result of the AIDS \n     epidemic. Eighty-four percent of the worldwide deaths from \n     AIDS have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Each day, AIDS kills 5,500 Africans, and infects 11,000 \n     more.\n       (4) By the end of 2000, 10,400,000 children in sub-Saharan \n     Africa will have lost one or both parents, to AIDS.\n       (5) Over 85 percent of the world's HIV-positive children \n     live in Africa.\n       (6) Fewer than 5 percent of those living with AIDS in \n     Africa have access to even the most basic care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that Congress has recognized the catastrophic \n     effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and seeks to maximize the effectiveness of the United \n     States' efforts to combat the disease through any necessary \n     authorization or appropriations;\n       (2) Congress should strengthen ongoing programs which \n     address education and prevention, testing, the care of AIDS \n     orphans, and improving home and community-based care options \n     for those living with AIDS; and\n       (3) Congress should seek additional or new tools to combat \n     the epidemic, including initiatives to encourage vaccine \n     development and programs aimed at preventing mother-to-child \n     transmission of the disease.\n\n     SEC. 329. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) More than 26,500 students from 250 tribes nationwide \n     attend tribal colleges. The colleges serve students of all \n     ages, many of whom are moving from welfare to work. The vast \n     majority of tribal college students are first-generation \n     college students.\n       (2) While annual appropriations for tribal colleges have \n     increased modestly in recent years, core operation funding \n     levels are still about half of the $6,000 per Indian student \n     level authorized by the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Act.\n       (3) Although tribal colleges received a $3,000,000 increase \n     in funding in fiscal year 2000, because of rising student \n     populations and other factors, these institutions may face an \n     actual per-student decrease in funding over fiscal year 1999.\n       (4) Per-student funding for tribal colleges is roughly half \n     the amount given to mainstream community colleges.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes the funding difficulties faced by \n     tribal colleges and assumes that priority consideration will \n     be provided to them through funding for the Tribally \n     Controlled College and University Act, the 1994 Land Grant \n     Institutions, and title III of the Higher Education Act; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects Congress' intent \n     to continue work toward current statutory Federal funding \n     goals for the tribal colleges.\n\n     SEC. 330. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM THE \n                   MARRIAGE PENALTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) marriage is the foundation of the American society and \n     a key institution for preserving our values;\n       (2) the tax code should not penalize those who choose to \n     marry;\n       (3) a report to the Treasury Department's Office of Tax \n     Analysis estimates that in 1999, 48 percent of married \n     couples will pay a marriage penalty under the present tax \n     system;\n       (4) the Congressional Budget Office found that the average \n     penalty amounts to $1,400 a year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the level in this budget resolution assume that the \n     Congress shall--\n       (1) pass marriage penalty tax relief legislation that \n     begins a phasedown of this penalty in 2001;\n       (2) consider such legislation prior to April 15, 2000.\n\n     SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONTINUED USE OF FEDERAL \n                   FUEL TAXES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND \n                   REHABILITATION OF OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS, \n                   BRIDGES, AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) current law, as stipulated in the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), requires all Federal \n     gasoline taxes be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund;\n       (2) current law, as stipulated in TEA-21, guarantees that \n     all such deposits to the Highway Trust Fund are spent in full \n     on the construction and rehabilitation of our Nation's \n     highways, bridges, and transit systems;\n       (3) the funding guarantees contained in TEA-21 are \n     essential to the ability of the Nation's Governors, highway \n     commissioners, and transit providers to address the growing \n     backlog of critical transportation investments in order to \n     stem the deterioration of our road and transit systems, \n     improve the safety of our highways, and reduce the growth of \n     congestion that is choking off economic growth in communities \n     across the Nation;\n       (4) any effort to reduce the Federal gasoline tax or de-\n     link the relationship between highway user fees and highway \n     spending pose a great danger to the integrity of the Highway \n     Trust Fund and the ability of the States to invest adequately \n     in our transportation infrastructure; and\n       (5) proposals to reduce the Federal gasoline tax threaten \n     to endanger the spending levels guaranteed in TEA-21 while \n     providing no guarantee that consumers will experience any \n     reduction in price at the gas pump.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this budget resolution do not \n     assume the reduction of any Federal gasoline taxes on either \n     a temporary or permanent basis.\n\n     SEC. 332. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION \n                   ENGINE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that the Senate will not, on behalf of Vice \n     President Al Gore, increase gasoline and diesel fuel taxes by \n     $1.50 per gallon effective July 1, 2000, and by an additional \n     $1.50 per gallon effective fiscal year 2005, as part of ``a \n     coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal \n     of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine \n     over, say, a twenty-five year period'' since ``their \n     cumulative impact on the global environment is posing a \n     mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more \n     deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again \n     likely to confront''.\n\n     SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   A NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-\n                   TERM CARE WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-\n     term care and it is incumbent on Congress and the President \n     to ensure that medicare and medicaid patients are protected \n     from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n       (2) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do \n     an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, \n     incidents of abuse and neglect and mistreatment do occur at \n     an unacceptable rate and are not limited to nursing homes \n     alone.\n       (3) Current Federal and State safeguards are inadequate \n     because there is little or no information sharing between \n     States about known abusers and no common State procedures for \n     tracking abusers from State to State and facility to \n     facility.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that a national \n     registry of abusive long-term care workers should be \n     established by building upon existing infrastructures at the \n     Federal and State levels that would enable long-term care \n     providers who participate in the medicare and medicaid \n     programs to conduct background checks on prospective \n     employees.\n\n     SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE PRICE OF \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today, two-thirds of senior citizens in the United \n     States have access to prescription drugs through health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) However, it is difficult for many Americans, including \n     senior citizens, to afford the prescription drugs that they \n     need to stay healthy.\n       (3) Many senior citizens in the United States leave the \n     country and go to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription drugs \n     that are developed, manufactured, and approved in the United \n     States in order to buy such drugs at lower prices than such \n     drugs are sold for in the United States.\n       (4) According to the General Accounting Office, a consumer \n     in the United States pays on average \\1/3\\ more for a \n     prescription drug than a consumer pays for the same drug in \n     another country.\n       (5) The United States has made a strong commitment to \n     supporting the research and development of new drugs through \n     taxpayer-supported funding of the National Institutes of \n     Health, through the research and development tax credit, and \n     through other means.\n       (6) The development of new drugs is important because the \n     use of such drugs enables people to live longer and lead \n     healthier, more productive lives.\n       (7) Citizens of other countries should pay a portion of the \n     research and development costs for new drugs, or their fair \n     share of such costs, rather than just reap the benefits of \n     such drugs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the \n     cost disparity between identical prescription drugs sold in \n     the United States, Canada, and Mexico should be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n\n     SEC. 335. SENSE OF THE SENATE AGAINST FEDERAL FUNDING OF \n                   SMOKE SHOPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Smoking begun by children during their teen years and \n     even earlier turns the lives of far too many Americans into \n     nightmares decades later, plagued by disease and premature \n     death.\n       (2) The Federal Government should leave a legacy of more \n     healthy Americans and fewer victims of tobacco-related \n     illness.\n       (3) Efforts by the Federal Government should seek to \n     protect young people from the dangers of smoking.\n       (4) Discount tobacco stores, sometimes known as smoke \n     shops, operate to sell high volumes of cigarettes and other \n     tobacco products, often at significantly reduced prices, with \n     each tobacco outlet often selling millions of discount \n     cigarettes each year.\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\n       (5) Studies by the Surgeon General and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention demonstrate that children are \n     particularly susceptible to price differentials in \n     cigarettes, such as those available through smoke shop \n     discounts.\n       (6) The Department of Housing and Urban Development is \n     using Federal funds for grants to construct not less than 6 \n     smoke shops or facilities that contain a smoke shop.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget levels in this resolution assume that no \n     Federal funds may be used by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development to provide any grant or other assistance to \n     construct, operate, or otherwise benefit a smoke shop or \n     other tobacco outlet.\n\n     SEC. 336. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO REDUCE \n                   GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) On average, 12 children die from gun fire everyday in \n     America.\n       (2) On May 20, 1999, the Senate passed the Violent and \n     Repeat Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, by a \n     vote of 73 to 25, in part, to stem gun-related violence in \n     the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in function 750 of this resolution assume \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) pass the conference report to accompany H.R. 1501, the \n     Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \n     Rehabilitation Act, including Senate-passed provisions, with \n     the purpose of limiting access to firearms by juveniles, \n     convicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from \n     purchasing or possessing firearms; and\n       (2) consider H.R. 1501 not later than April 20, 2000.\n\n     SEC. 337. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING \n                   FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 FOR MEDICAL CARE FOR OUR \n                   NATION'S VETERANS.\n\n       (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions in \n     this resolution assume that if the Congressional Budget \n     Office determines there is an on-budget surplus for fiscal \n     year 2001, $500,000,000 of that surplus will be restored to \n     the programs cut in this amendment.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that none of these \n     offsets will come from defense or veterans, and to the extent \n     possible should come from administrative functions.\n\n     SEC. 338. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAL CARE FOR \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the provisions of this resolution assume that if the \n     Congressional Budget Office determines there is an on-budget \n     surplus for fiscal year 2001, $500,000,000 of that surplus \n     will be restored to the programs cut by this amendment; and\n       (2) the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     none of the offsets made by this amendment will come from \n     defense or veterans and should, to the extent possible, come \n     from administrative functions.\n\n     SEC. 339. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Government investment of the Social Security trust \n     funds in the stock market is a gamble Congress should be \n     unwilling to make on behalf of the millions who receive and \n     depend on Social Security to meet their retirement needs;\n       (2) in 1999, the Senate voted 99-0 to oppose Government \n     investment of the Social Security trust funds in private \n     financial markets;\n       (3) in addition to the unanimous opposition of the United \n     States Senate, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and \n     Securities and Exchange Commissioner Arthur Levitt also \n     oppose the idea; and\n       (4) despite this opposition, and despite the dangers \n     inherent in having the Government invest Social Security \n     trust funds in private financial markets, President Clinton \n     has once again suggested, on page 37 of the Administration's \n     proposed fiscal year 2001 Federal budget, that the Government \n     invest part of the Social Security trust funds in corporate \n     equities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government should not \n     directly invest contributions made to the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund established under section 201 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401), or any interest derived \n     from those contributions, in private financial markets.\n\n     SEC. 340. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A digital divide exists in America. Low-income, urban \n     and rural families are less likely to have access to the \n     Internet and computers. African American and Hispanic \n     families are only \\2/5\\ as likely to have Internet access as \n     white families. Access by Native Americans to the Internet \n     and to computers is statistically negligible.\n       (2) Regardless of income level, Americans living in rural \n     areas lag behind in Internet access. Individuals with lower \n     incomes who live in rural areas are half as likely to have \n     Internet access as individuals who live in urban areas.\n       (3) The digital divide for the poorest Americans has grown \n     by 29 percent since 1997.\n       (4) Access to computers and the Internet and the ability to \n     use this technology effectively is becoming increasingly \n     important for full participation in America's economic, \n     political and social life.\n       (5) Unequal access to technology and high-tech skills by \n     income, educational level, race and geography could deepen \n     and reinforce the divisions that exist within American \n     society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) to ensure that all children are computer literate by \n     the time they finish the eighth grade, regardless of race, \n     ethnicity, gender, income, geography or disability, to \n     broaden access to information technologies, to provide \n     workers, teachers and students with information technology \n     training, and to promote innovative online content and \n     software applications that will improve commerce, education \n     and quality of life, initiatives that increase digital \n     opportunity should be provided for as follows:\n       (A) $200,000,000 in tax incentives should be provided to \n     encourage private sector donation of high-quality computers, \n     sponsorship of community technology centers, training, \n     technical services and computer repair;\n       (B) $450,000,000 should be provided for teacher training;\n       (C) $150,000,000 for new teacher training;\n       (D) $400,000,000 should be provided for school technology \n     and school libraries;\n       (E) $20,000,000 should be provided to place computers and \n     trained personnel in Boys & Girls Clubs;\n       (F) $25,000,000 should be provided to create an E-Corps \n     within Americorps;\n       (G) $100,000,000 should be provided to create 1,000 \n     Community Technology Centers in low-income urban and rural \n     communities;\n       (H) $50,000,000 should be provided for public/private \n     partnerships to expand home access to computers and the \n     Internet for low-income families;\n       (I) $45,000,000 should be provided to promote innovative \n     applications of information and communications technology for \n     underserved communities;\n       (J) $10,000,000 should be provided to prepare Native \n     Americans for careers in Information Technology and other \n     technical fields; and\n       (2) all Americans should have access to broadband \n     telecommunications capability as soon as possible and as \n     such, initiatives that increase broadband deployment should \n     be funded, including $25,000,000 to accelerate private sector \n     deployment of broadband and networks in underserved urban and \n     rural communities.\n\n     SEC. 341. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     budget resolution assume that among its reform options, \n     Congress should explore a medicare prescription drug proposal \n     that--\n       (1) is voluntary;\n       (2) increases access for all medicare beneficiaries;\n       (3) is designed to provide meaningful protection and \n     bargaining power for medicare beneficiaries in obtaining \n     prescription drugs;\n       (4) is affordable for all medicare beneficiaries and for \n     the medicare program;\n       (5) is administered using private sector entities and \n     competitive purchasing techniques;\n       (6) is consistent with broader medicare reform;\n       (7) preserves and protects the financial integrity of the \n     medicare trust funds;\n       (8) does not increase medicare beneficiary premiums; and\n       (9) provides a prescription drug benefit as soon as \n     possible.\n\n     SEC. 342. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR NEW \n                   EDUCATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in \n     this resolution assume that Congress' first priority should \n     be to fully fund the programs described under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.) at the originally promised level of 40 percent \n     before Federal funds are appropriated for new education \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 343. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF \n                   FEDERAL FIREARMS LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Clinton Administration has failed to adequately \n     enforce Federal firearms laws. Between 1992 and 1998, \n     Triggerlock gun prosecutions--prosecutions of defendants who \n     use a firearm in the commission of a felony--dropped nearly \n     50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n       (2) The decline in Federal firearms prosecutions was not \n     due to a lack of adequate resources. During the period when \n     Federal firearms prosecutions decreased nearly 50 percent, \n     the overall budget of the Department of Justice increased 54 \n     percent.\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997.\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997.\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997.\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm \n     under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite \n     this Federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed \n     on the national instant criminal background system \n     established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note).\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm \n     under section\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n     922(a)(6) of title 18, United States Code. It is also a \n     Federal crime for convicted felons to possess or purchase a \n     firearm under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code.\n       (8) More than 500,000 convicted felons and other prohibited \n     purchasers have been prevented from buying firearms from \n     licensed dealers since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \n     Act was enacted. When these felons attempted to purchase a \n     firearm, they violated section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United \n     States Code, by making a false statement under oath that they \n     were not disqualified from purchasing a firearm. Nonetheless, \n     of the more than 500,000 violations, only approximately 200 \n     of the felons have been referred to the Department of Justice \n     for prosecution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that Federal funds \n     will be used for an effective law enforcement strategy \n     requiring a commitment to enforcing existing Federal firearms \n     laws by--\n       (1) designating not less than 1 Assistant United States \n     Attorney in each district to prosecute Federal firearms \n     violations and thereby expand Project Exile nationally;\n       (2) upgrading the national instant criminal background \n     system established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note) by encouraging \n     States to place mental health adjudications on that system \n     and by improving the overall speed and efficiency of that \n     system; and\n       (3) providing incentive grants to States to encourage \n     States to impose mandatory minimum sentences for firearm \n     offenses based on section 924(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, and to prosecute those offenses in State court.\n\n     SEC. 344. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE CENSUS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution and legislation enacted pursuant to this \n     resolution assume that no American will be prosecuted, fined \n     or in anyway harassed by the Federal Government or its agents \n     for failure to respond to any census questions which refer to \n     an individual's race, national origin, living conditions, \n     personal habits or mental and/or physical condition, but that \n     all Americans are encouraged to send in their census forms.\n\n     SEC. 345. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ANY INCREASE IN THE \n                   MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY TAX \n                   RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution on the budget assume that the \n     minimum wage should be increased as provided for in amendment \n     number 2547, the Domenici and others amendment to S. 625, the \n     Bankruptcy Reform legislation.\n\n     SEC. 346. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that Congress should enact legislation to \n     amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.) to increase the Federal minimum wage by $1.00 over 1 \n     year with a $0.50 increase effective May 2, 2000 and another \n     $0.50 increase effective on May 2, 2001.\n\n     SEC. 347. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED \n                   SERVICES IN THE THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the levels of funding for \n     the defense category in this resolution--\n       (1) assume that members of the Armed Forces are to be \n     authorized to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan; and\n       (2) provide the $980,000,000 necessary to offset the \n     reduced tax revenue resulting from that participation through \n     fiscal year 2009.\n\n     SEC. 348. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PROTECTING THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that the Congress shall pass legislation \n     which provides for sequestration to reduce Federal spending \n     by the amount necessary to ensure that, in any fiscal year, \n     the Social Security surpluses are used only for the payment \n     of Social Security benefits, retirement security, Social \n     Security reform, or to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public.\n\n     SEC. 349. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING REGULATION OF \n                   TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use is the single most \n     preventable cause of death and disability in the United \n     States.\n       (2) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately \n     400,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n       (3) Health care costs associated with treating tobacco-\n     related diseases are $80,000,000,000 per year, and almost \n     half of such costs are paid for by taxpayer-financed \n     government health care programs.\n       (4) In spite of the well established dangers of cigarette \n     smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has \n     authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, \n     and use of tobacco products.\n       (5) Major tobacco companies spend over $5,600,000,000 each \n     year ($15,000,000 each day) to promote the use of tobacco \n     products.\n       (6) Ninety percent of adult smokers first started smoking \n     before the age of 18.\n       (7) Each day 3,000 children become regular smokers and \\1/\n     3\\ of such children will die of diseases associated with the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (8) The Food and Drug Administration regulates the \n     manufacture, sale, distribution, and use of nicotine-\n     containing products used as substitutes for cigarette smoking \n     and tobacco use and should be granted the authority to \n     regulate tobacco products.\n       (9) Congress should restrict youth access to tobacco \n     products and ensure that tobacco products meet minimum safety \n     standards.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified \n     Federal agency to regulate tobacco products; and\n       (2) Congress should enact legislation in the year 2000 that \n     grants the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \n     regulate tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 350. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AFTER SCHOOL \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The demand for after school education is very high, \n     with more than 1,000,000 students waiting to get into such \n     programs.\n       (2) After school programs improve educational achievement \n     and have widespread support, with over 90 percent of the \n     American people supporting such programs.\n       (3) 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs, \n     and prosecutors, along with the presidents of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, and the International Union of Police \n     Associations, support government funding of after school \n     programs.\n       (4) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal and State \n     partnership.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that the President's level of \n     funding for after school programs in fiscal year 2001 will be \n     provided, which will accommodate the current need for after \n     school programs.\n\n     SEC. 351. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CASH BALANCE PENSION PLAN \n                   CONVERSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Defined benefit pension plans are guaranteed by the \n     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and provide a lifetime \n     benefit for a beneficiary and spouse.\n       (2) Defined benefit pension plans provide meaningful \n     retirement benefits to rank and file workers, since such \n     plans are generally funded by employer contributions.\n       (3) Employers should be encouraged to establish and \n     maintain defined benefit pension plans.\n       (4) An increasing number of major employers have been \n     converting their traditional defined benefit plans to ``cash \n     balance'' or other hybrid defined benefit plans.\n       (5) Under current law, employers are not required to \n     provide plan participants with meaningful disclosure of the \n     impact of converting a traditional defined benefit plan to a \n     ``cash balance'' or other hybrid formula.\n       (6) For a number of years after a conversion, the cash \n     balance or other hybrid benefit formula may result in a \n     period of ``wear away'' during which older and longer service \n     participants earn no additional benefits.\n       (7) Federal law should continue to prohibit pension plan \n     participants from being discriminated against on the basis of \n     age in the provision of pension benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that pension plan \n     participants whose plans are changed to cause older or longer \n     service workers to earn less retirement income, including \n     conversions to ``cash balance plans,'' should receive \n     additional protection than what is currently provided, and \n     Congress should act this year to address this important \n     issue. In particular, at a minimum--\n       (1) all pension plan participants should receive adequate, \n     accurate, and timely notice of any change to a plan that will \n     cause participants to earn less retirement income in the \n     future; and\n       (2) pension plans that are changed to a cash balance or \n     other hybrid formula should not be permitted to ``wear away'' \n     participants' benefits in such a manner that older and longer \n     service participants earn no additional pension benefits for \n     a period of time after the change.\n\n     SEC. 352. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING UNINSURED AND LOW-\n                   INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED \n                   COMMUNITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the uninsured population in the United States continues \n     to grow at over 100,000 individuals per month, and is \n     estimated to reach over 53,000,000 people by 2007;\n       (2) the growth in the uninsured population continues \n     despite public and private efforts to increase health \n     insurance coverage;\n       (3) nearly 80 percent of the uninsured population are \n     members of working families who cannot afford health \n     insurance or cannot access employer-provided health insurance \n     plans;\n       (4) minority populations, rural residents, and single-\n     parent families represent a disproportionate number of the \n     uninsured population;\n       (5) the problem of health care access for the uninsured \n     population is compounded in many urban and rural communities \n     by a lack of providers who are available to serve both \n     insured and uninsured populations;\n       (6) community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health \n     centers have proven uniquely qualified to address the lack of \n     adequate health care services for uninsured populations, \n     serving over 4,500,000 uninsured patients in 1999, including \n     over 1,000,000 new uninsured patients who have sought care \n     from such centers in the last 3 years;\n       (7) health centers care for nearly 7,000,000 minorities, \n     nearly 600,000 farmworkers, and more than 500,000 homeless \n     individuals each year;\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\n       (8) health centers provide cost-effective comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care to uninsured individuals for less \n     than $1.00 per day, or $350 annually, and help to reduce the \n     inappropriate use of costly emergency rooms and inpatient \n     hospital care;\n       (9) current resources only allow health centers to serve 10 \n     percent of the Nation's 44,000,000 uninsured individuals;\n       (10) past investments to increase health center access have \n     resulted in better health, an improved quality of life for \n     all Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures; and\n       (11) Congress can act now to increase access to health care \n     services for uninsured and low-income people together with or \n     in advance of health care coverage proposals by expanding the \n     availability of services at community, migrant, homeless, and \n     public housing health centers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) appropriations for consolidated health centers under \n     section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years in order to double the number of individuals who \n     receive health care services at community, migrant, homeless, \n     and public housing health centers; and\n       (2) appropriations for consolidated health centers should \n     be increased by $150,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 over the \n     amount appropriated for such centers in fiscal year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 353. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FISCAL YEAR 2001 \n                   FUNDING FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW is nearing an end. The Coast \n     Guard has committed to keeping the vessel in service until \n     2006 when a replacement vessel is projected to be in service, \n     but to meet that deadline, funds must be provided for the \n     Coast Guard in fiscal year 2001 to provide for the \n     procurement of a multipurpose-design heavy icebreaker.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (b) Adjustment in Budget Levels.--\n       (1) Increase in funding for transportation.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the \n     amounts specified in section 103(8) of this resolution for \n     budget authority and outlays for Transportation (budget \n     function 400) for fiscal year 2001 shall be increased as \n     follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (2) Offsetting decrease in funding for allowances.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the \n     amounts specified in section 103(19) of this resolution for \n     budget authority and outlays for Allowances (budget function \n     920) for fiscal year 2001 shall be decreased as follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the provisions of this resolution, as modified by \n     subsection (b), should provide additional budget authority \n     and outlay authority for the United States Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2001 such that the amount of such authority in \n     fiscal year 2001 exceeds the amount of such authority for \n     fiscal year 2000 by $300,000,000; and\n       (2) any level of such authority in fiscal year 2001 below \n     the level described in paragraph (1) would require the Coast \n     Guard to--\n       (A) close numerous stations and utilize remaining assets \n     only for emergency situations;\n       (B) reduce the number of personnel of an already \n     streamlined workforce;\n       (C) curtail its capacity to carry out emergency search and \n     rescue; and\n       (D) reduce operations in a manner that would have a \n     detrimental impact on the sustainability of valuable fish \n     stocks in the North Atlantic and Pacific Northwest and its \n     capacity to stem the flow of illicit drugs and illegal \n     immigration into the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/10/senate-section/article/S2481-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.
