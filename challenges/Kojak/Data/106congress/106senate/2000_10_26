I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of H.R. 782, regarding the Older Americans Act, and \nit be considered under the following terms: 30 minutes for debate on \nthe bill equally divided in the usual form; that the only amendments in \norder be the following: One amendment offered by Senator Gregg relating \nto title V, which would be 2 hours equally divided for that particular \namendment, and an additional amendment offered by Senator Gregg \nrelating to title V, and that would be 2 hours equally divided as well, \nwith no other amendments or motions in order to the bill.\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time on each amendment, the Senate proceed to a vote on each \namendment. Further, I ask that, following the disposition of the above \namendments, the bill be read the third time and the Senate then proceed \nto passage of H.R. 782, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from Ohio \nwho read the unanimous consent request, the substance of the agreement \nis fine with the minority. We would only hope that there could be a \ndefinite time locked in for a vote. During the last couple of weeks, \nthere have been a lot of Members who simply have not known when they \nwere going to be called upon to vote. They have other business they are \nconducting. We, again, have no disagreement with the substance of the \nunanimous consent agreement. However, we object unless we can get a \ndefinite time as to when we can vote.\n  I also say, through the Chair to my friend from Ohio, it is not as if \nthere are a number of votes being anticipated here so that we are going \nto slow things up if you set, for example, 5 o'clock, which we would \nsuggest, as a definite time for voting on these amendments. So until we \ncan get a definite time locked in for voting on the amendments, at or \nabout 5 o'clock, we would object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if I could, let me thank my colleague from \nNevada. I understand there is no objection, actually, to the substance, \nthen, of the agreement and what we are waiting for is some agreement \nwith regard to the actual time the votes will actually take place. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend, we believe it is a very important \npiece of legislation. We are glad it is here. We think the time \narrangement on the amendments offered by the Senator from New Hampshire \nis fair. We simply believe we need a time certain to vote. That should \nbe easy to get. I hope the majority leader will agree to that as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, as the lead sponsor of the Older Americans \nAct, along with my friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator \nJeffords, I thought I would take a few moments, even though we are not \ntechnically on the bill at this point, to begin a discussion of this \nbill. I make note to my colleagues in the Chamber that I will be a few \nminutes in doing this, so if any of my colleagues do want to proceed in \nmorning business on other matters, I will be more than happy to yield \nwhen they come to the floor.\n  We will begin today a debate about a bill that has been long in \ncoming. Previous Congresses have had difficulty reaching agreement on \nreauthorizing the Older Americans Act for any number of reasons, and \nprevious Congresses have failed to do that. But I think anyone who \nworks in this field, anyone who understands what is going on with the \nOlder Americans Act, knows it is past time for Congress to reauthorize \nthe bill.\n  This is a bipartisan program. It is a program that dates over 35 \nyears. It is a program that delivers great services to the senior \ncitizens of this country. What we have done in this bill in a very \nbipartisan fashion is to bring it up to date to meet the needs of \nsenior citizens entering this new century.\n  This bill is going to help ensure the continuation of valuable \nsupportive services for lower income older Americans. It will establish \nnew and reliable services from which every older American can benefit \nand provide support for those caring for older adults.\n  This reauthorization would not be a reality if it were not for the \npersistent, bipartisan efforts and dedication of the Senate Aging \nSubcommittee ranking member, Senator Mikulski; Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee chairman, Senator Jeffords and the \nranking member, Senator Kennedy; the House Education and the Workforce \nCommittee chairman, Congressman Goodling, and the ranking member, \nCongressman Clay; as well as the House Postsecondary Education, \nTraining, and Life-Long Learning Subcommittee Chairman McKeon and \nCongressman Martinez. Each has worked tirelessly on this legislation, \nalong with the members and staff of the Senate Aging Subcommittee, the \nfull Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Aging.\n  I also thank additional colleagues, such as Senator Hagel, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Wyden, for their insights and contributions to \nreaching a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I will mention later the \ngreat work that Senator Grassley has also done to offer a new provision \nin this bill which, again, meets the needs of seniors in this century. \nBecause of this support and help, we are going to see the Older \nAmericans Act finally reauthorized.\n  Reauthorization attempts in both the 104th and 105th Congresses \nfailed for many reasons. So as chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, I \nintroduced S. 1536, with the hope we could get a reauthorization passed \nin this Congress. At the end of this past July, our committee marked up \nthat bill and developed a solid piece of legislation that reflects \nmonths of hard work and deliberation. I am very pleased that yesterday \nthe House of Representatives passed this bill overwhelmingly by a vote \nof 405-2. They passed their reauthorization bill which represents the \ncombined legislative efforts of both the House and the Senate.\n  I point out to my colleagues that one of the things we did as we \nworked through this bill for the last 2 years was to work with the \nHouse Members on both sides of the aisle so we would finally emerge \nwith a consensus bill and a bill we would be able to pass in both the \nSenate and the House.\n  This reauthorization bill we have before us today represents a \nmodernized and streamlined Older Americans Act and one that maintains \nsome of the most important and successful programs the Federal \nGovernment provides for our senior citizens.\n  As an editorial in a newspaper in my home State of Ohio, the \nCincinnati Post, on September 20, 1999, stated:\n\n       The Older Americans Act has been the closest thing on \n     record to a national policy on aging.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement, but it is true. It is true because \nthe\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nOlder Americans Act created and is responsible for programs that do the \nfollowing: Provide nutrition both at home and at senior community \ncenters; protect the elderly from abuse, neglect, and unhealthy nursing \nhomes; offer valuable jobs to seniors; furnish transportation which is \nso vital for the way seniors live today; and render valuable in-home \nservices such as homemaker and home health aides, chore services, \nrespite care, and personal care services.\n  To be sure, as our senior population grows larger and larger, these \nservices and many others become more and more important--not just \nimportant but, in many cases, essential to maintain the quality of life \nof our senior citizens, central to the continued well being and \nprosperity of our aging senior community. That is why it is fundamental \nto the security of our seniors that we reauthorize, protect, and \nimprove the Older Americans Act. Our reauthorization bill does just \nthat.\n\n  First, it will permit States to implement cost sharing for some of \nthe services provided under the Older Americans Act. This means that \nStates will be able to obtain payments from wealthier seniors for \nservices. Doing so enables States to expand services to additional \nolder individuals.\n  This is something that was asked for by the people who testified in \nour committee. They told us the current rules and regulations were \ncomplicated, very difficult to understand, and were being interpreted \ndifferently from county to county within a State, such as my State of \nOhio.\n  Working in a bipartisan fashion, we put together the language that \nwill make it much easier for these laws to be administered.\n  Second, our authorization will increase flexibility for States by \nauthorizing the Assistant Secretary on Aging to issue waivers to States \nwith certain provisions of the Older Americans Act. This flexibility \nwill help eliminate obsolete, duplicative, and burdensome requirements \nof a State plan and the area plan.\n  Third, our bill includes the first major changes to the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program, title V. It begins to change the \nallocation of funds between the States and the organizations that \nprovide jobs. It allocates 75 percent of the first $35 million in \nadditional funding for the program to the States and 25 percent to \norganizations. Any increase in funding over $35 million will be split \n50-50 between the States and the national organizations. Historically, \nthe funding split has been practically the reverse, with 78 percent \nallocated to national sponsors and 22 percent to the States. This is an \nimprovement that has received bipartisan support of the Governors \nacross the country.\n  Let me stop for a moment and say how much we have relied on the \nGovernors as we have fashioned this bill and how much they support this \nbill. This bill is supported by the NGA; it is supported by the \nsouthern Governors. It has received a great deal of support and help \nfrom them. We thank them for that support.\n  Additionally, our bill provides Governors greater responsibility and \ninfluence over the allocation of title V job slots within their States, \nand it includes performance measures that all organizations and States \nmust meet. Failure to meet such standards will result in the loss of \njob slots. Those slots then will be redistributed through open \ncompetition and will help eliminate poorly performing grantees in the \nprogram--one more way the Governors will have more say in title V and \nmore say in how these slots are allocated and, not only a say in how \nthey are allocated, but a say in what happens with them, and they will \nhave the ability to measure the success or failure of these programs.\n  These improvements are the result of our efforts to make sure our \nreauthorization bill addresses the most important concerns facing older \nAmericans. That is why even before drafting the reauthorization bill, \nas chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, we held six subcommittee \nhearings covering titles of the existing law.\n  I see on the floor my colleague, Senator Mikulski, who played such a \nmajor role in those committee hearings. In fact, those six hearings \nwere very helpful in eliciting information to make this a better bill.\n\n  At one of those hearings, for example, we heard from Reeve Lindbergh, \nthe daughter of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Her mom was \nsubjected, according to her testimony, to 10 years of financial and \nother abuse and, as Reeve pointed out: ``It''--referring to that type \nof elder abuse--``can happen to anyone.''\n  Because of similar testimony, we included language in the \nreauthorization to protect elders not only from physical abuse and \nneglect but also from financial abuse and exploitation. We also added \nlanguage to coordinate State and local advocacy and protection services \ndirectly to State and local law enforcement agencies, as well as \nlinking them to the court system.\n  I will now turn to a provision that has bipartisan support and whose \nlead sponsor is my friend, Senator Chuck Grassley. This is the National \nCaregiver Support Act which is an integral part of this bill.\n  Another one of our Aging Subcommittee hearings focused on the bill I \njust referenced, the National Family Caregiver Support Act, which \nSenator Grassley sponsored, along with Senators Breaux, Bryan, Dodd, \nHutchinson, Kohl, Lincoln, Mikulski, Reed from Rhode Island, Reid from \nNevada, Santorum, and Wyden.\n  Following moving testimony from people such as Carolyn Erwin-Johnson \nfrom Baltimore, MD, we included this important act as a provision in \nour reauthorization bill. At our subcommittee hearing, Carolyn spoke \nmovingly of one of the most important aspects of the Caregiver Support \nAct--the need for respite care. Let me explain.\n  When her elderly mother became unable to care for herself anymore, \nCarolyn decided against placing her in a nursing home. She chose, \ninstead, to care for her mom at home. When her mother first moved in \nwith her, Carolyn said she had to discontinue her doctorate program. \nShe had to find a job and more accommodating hours. Unfortunately, and \nnot surprisingly, that job also paid less money.\n  Carolyn continued in her testimony that she needed advice about \nlifting her mother, feeding her mom, medications, and many other \nchallenges, things she had not faced before in her life, and most of us \nhave not.\n  Most of all, however, because of her mother's constant care needs, \nCarolyn testified that she just needed some rest, she just needed a \nbreak. With the National Family Caregiver Support Act provision \nincluded in our reauthorization, Carolyn will get that break in the \nform of respite care--someone to take over for her for maybe a weekend, \nmaybe a day, maybe just a few hours, so she can shop for herself and \ncomplete some overtime work or just rest. Again, this is an attempt to \nbring this bill up to date and to authorize the type of services that \nare so very important today.\n\n  In addition to respite care, the Caregiver Support Act brings an \nintergenerational element to the reauthorization of the Older Americans \nAct.\n  During an Aging Subcommittee field hearing we held in Cleveland, we \nheard from grandparents who, for any number of reasons, were caring for \ntheir grandchildren, raising their grandkids. In some cases their own \nchildren were addicted to drugs or were in prison or died. There are \nany number of reasons why these folks were doing something that we did \nnot see done that much 20 or 30 or 40 years ago but something that is, \nfrankly, very common today. Rather than relinquishing their \ngrandchildren to foster care, these grandparents took on the \nresponsibility of raising them and keeping the family together. That is \nsomething that we in Congress should support when people make that \nchoice.\n  The grandparents who testified in front of our committee in Cleveland \nare not alone. The number of grandparents raising children is growing \nand growing. In fact, a Census Bureau report released last year \nindicated that 3.9 million children in the United States were living in \nhomes maintained by their grandparents. That is up an astounding 75 \npercent since 1970.\n  A 1998 study by the University of Cincinnati found that grandparents \nare caring for their grandchildren in 10 percent of Ohio households \nwith children, and of that 10 percent, approximately 32,000 \ngrandparents statewide are the sole providers for their grandchildren. \nAmazing figures.\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\n  Let's look at the example of a Cleveland woman in her early seventies \nnamed Bertha. At our hearing last year, she told us her story. She told \nus about the difficulties she faced in taking on the responsibility of \nraising her three great-nephews--Clarence, age 12; Joseph, age 11; and \nChristopher, age 10.\n  The boys' father--a horribly sad story--died from AIDS. Their drug-\naddicted mother was simply in no shape to take care of them at all. \nSomeone needed to take care of those boys, so Bertha took them in.\n  When the three boys first moved into Bertha's home, she had no way to \nsupport them financially. To be eligible for assistance, she became a \nlicensed foster mother. But despite doing so, a full year went by \nbefore the county gave her any financial assistance at all. \nAdditionally, she testified it has been very difficult getting \ninformation about available services. In the process, she has \nencountered mounds of bureaucratic redtape.\n  New information and assistance services in the Older Americans \nReauthorization Act, as well as the respite care and support groups \nprovided in the Caregiver Support Program, will provide much needed \nassistance to people, relatives, great-aunts, grandparents--people such \nas Bertha, people who have taken on a tremendous responsibility many \nyears after raising their own children, many years, I am sure, after \nthey thought they would ever be doing this.\n  Many older Americans who are now raising children for the second time \nneed information, and they need respite care. Our bill would provide \nthose kinds of services.\n  I see my colleagues on the floor, Senator Mikulski and Senator \nKennedy. And Senator Jeffords will be here in a moment. Let me conclude \nfor now by saying that this is a long time in coming. It is a good \nreauthorization bill. It is the product of a great deal of work by many \nMembers of this Chamber. It is a bill we can all be proud of, a bill we \ncan be proud today to pass and send to the President. Our \nreauthorization bill makes the most substantial reforms in the Older \nAmericans Act since its creation.\n  Our bill is a key step toward preparing for the demographic tidal \nwave of aging baby boomers in the next few decades. The fact is that we \nare an aging nation. Today, 12.7 percent of the U.S. population is over \nthe age of 65. By the year 2030, that number will grow to 20 percent. \nThere is no indication that this trend will slow anytime soon.\n  Americans, thank heavens, are living longer, making it all the more \npressing we ensure that supportive services exist for every older \nAmerican now and in the future. By working together, on a bipartisan \nand bicameral basis--both sides of the aisle; both the House and the \nSenate--we have crafted a bill that will make a lasting contribution to \nall older Americans; and that is something we can all be proud of as a \nmajor accomplishment as this 106th Congress ends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator DeWine and \nSenator Jeffords for their leadership. As Senator DeWine has pointed \nout, this has been a long, continuing struggle for the last 2 years. \nThis has been a bipartisan struggle. We are grateful for the efforts of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I wish to say on our side, the real champion for this program is on \nmy left, Senator Mikulski, from the State of Maryland, who over the \nperiod of these last 2 years has been an absolutely tireless advocate \non this particular issue, as she has been on so many others. We would \nnot be here this morning in the final hours of this session if not for \nher strength and determination to see this measure move ahead.\n  I think what she and others have understood is that it has been 5 \nyears since we have seen this important legislation expire. As a \nresult, we have seen even funding on the Older Americans Act. In that \nrespect, there has been a falling behind in the attention to the \nservices for our senior citizens.\n\n  This is a much better bill than the last authorization; and it will \nbenefit our senior population in a much more sensitive and extensive \nway. Hopefully, it will gain acceptance and support from our colleagues \nin the Senate and the House and will be sent to the President so we can \nstrengthen the outreach programs that are lifelines to our senior \ncitizens.\n  So I pay particular tribute to my colleague, Senator Mikulski, for \nher leadership. I thank the administration and President Clinton for \nthe strong priority that he has placed on this and the attention that \nthe Secretary has given to getting this action.\n  I think most of us know we are operating in a very highly charged \npolitical atmosphere as we are coming to the last 2 weeks of a \npolitical campaign for election to the House and the Senate. But the \nHouse of Representatives yesterday passed this bill 405-2. We are very \nhopeful that we will have a similar outcome. It does indicate that when \npeople of good will want to move a process forward, it can be done. I \ncommend all of those who have worked over a very considerable period of \ntime and have really tried to find common ground on some very difficult \nand complex issues.\n  Finally, I wish to highlight the very important aspects of this \nlegislation. I think the most powerful and obviously important parts \nare the nutrition programs, which have been the largest and the longest \nstanding of the programs--this traces back to 1965. Meals on Wheels and \ncongregate meals have been an incredibly important program in \npermitting so many of our seniors to live at home, and also to benefit \nfrom nutritious meals in these congregate sites. It is an important \nnutritional aspect for many of our seniors who are hard pressed.\n  This bills value in terms of our elderly population cannot really be \nmeasured in terms of dollars and cents. It includes important \npreventive health programs, absolutely essential transportation \nprograms, and important employment opportunities as well. These \nopportunities enable many of our seniors continue to be useful, \nconstructive, and productive workers, primarily focused on serving \ncommunities.\n  There are extraordinary workers under this program. I have met so \nmany of them in travels around my own State of Massachusetts. What they \ndo in terms of adding an additional dimension of services in local \ncommunities is really extraordinary. Many people believe, with regard \nto programs in which they are particularly interested, that they get a \ngreat bang for the buck. This Nation, with this program, gets enormous \nadvantages in terms of permitting our seniors to live in the kind of \npeace and dignity and with a degree of security in these areas which \nthey would be hard pressed to have if this legislation were not on the \nbooks.\n  The Older Americans Act was enacted in 1965, three years after I was \nfirst elected to the Senate. I am proud to have been one of its \noriginal supporters. Over the years since then, we have repeatedly \nexpanded the act to meet more of the needs facing older citizens.\n  Today, the Senate is about to approve a reauthorization of the act \nwhich keeps faith with the nation's senior citizens. Current law \nsupports a broad array of home-based and community-based support \nservices to enhance the health and well-being of persons over sixty \nyears of age. This legislation preserves and strengthens these \nprograms, which provide vital links between senior citizens and their \ncommunities.\n  For seniors who are healthy and active, the act offers community \nservice employment opportunities, preventive health services, and \ntransportation services. It also supports a range of social activities, \nincluding congregate meals. The act supports more than 6,400 \nmultipurpose senior citizen centers across the country.\n  For those frail seniors who lack mobility, it helps to maintain a \nlifeline to the outside world. It provides daily home-delivered meals, \nin-home care services, home-maker services, and transportation to \ndoctors and other caregivers, and it supports programs to protect \nvulnerable seniors from abuse and exploitation. The long-term care \nombudsman program investigates and resolves complaints of elderly \nresidents of nursing home facilities and other adult care homes.\n  These programs make a significant difference for those they were \ndesigned\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nto help. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that \nolder Americans continue to receive the services which are so essential \nto their quality of life. This reauthorization means increased federal \nfinancial support of these very worthwhile programs.\n  Of all the Older American Act programs, nutrition assistance is the \nlargest and longest running. It was created as a response to disturbing \nevidence that, due to poverty and isolation, many senior citizens were \nsuffering from serious nutrition deficiencies, and that the lack of \ngood nutrition was contributing to their poor health.\n  Today, under the act, we are providing over 240 million meals a year \nto over 3 million senior citizens. Approximately half of these meals \nare provided in congregate social settings and the other half are \ndelivered daily through the Meals on Wheels program to seniors in their \nhomes. This program has broad-based community support. The many \nvolunteers who deliver meals to the home-bound have greatly expanded \nthe reach of the act. Unfortunately, we have not had sufficient \nresources to fully meet the need. Passage of this legislation will mean \na substantial increase in the level of funding for these vital \nnutrition programs.\n  The Senior Community Service Employment Program, authorized by title \nV of the act, is the nation's only employment and training program \naimed exclusively at low-income older persons--and it will have an \nincreasingly important role as the Baby Boom generation ages. The \nnation will have 1.4 million more low-income persons over the age of 55 \nin the year 2005 than there were in 1995, and many of them will want to \ncontinue working.\n  Title V serves over 90,000 low-income elderly persons every year. \nEighty percent of these participants are age 60 or over, and 16 percent \nare above 75 years of age. The jobs obtained through this program \nprovide these men and women with needed economic support. But it does \nmuch more than that. It keeps them active and involved in their \ncommunities, not isolated at home. It provides opportunities to make \nimportant contributions to their communities and to learn new skills--\nand it enhances their sense of dignity and self-esteem. In this \nlegislation, we have significantly strengthened the Community Service \nEmployment Program and provided for its much-needed expansion.\n  As part of this legislation, we have also created a National Family \nCaregiver Support Program to help families who care for ill or disabled \nparents or elderly relatives at home. We know how difficult it can \nbecome for a family when an elderly person needs a high degree of \ncontinuous care. We know the importance of keeping a frail senior at \nhome in a loving environment whenever it is medically possible. This \nnew program will provide essential support services to help these \nseniors remain with their loved ones. These families deserve our \nassistance, and this new program will ensure that they receive it.\n  Family caregivers will be able to obtain a broad range of support \nservices, including respite care, in-home assistance, training in \ncaregiver skills, and family counseling, all of which will make a major \ndifference for these vulnerable seniors and their families. The federal \ngovernment will fund 75 percent of the cost of these services, and the \nstates will fund the remainder. We have authorized $125 million for the \nfirst year of this new effort, and we anticipate the program will grow \nin succeeding years.\n  This reauthorization of the Older Americans Act is the product of a \ntwo-year bipartisan effort. Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Milulski, and I \nshare a common commitment to preserving and strengthening these \nprograms, which have done so much to improve the lives of millions of \nsenior citizens. We also shared a common determination to break through \nthe barriers which prevented reauthorization in the last two \nCongresses. I commend my three colleagues for their leadership in \nfashioning this legislation. Because of the bipartisan spirit in which \nthey approached this task, they made the difficult possible.\n  I also commend the important role of the Clinton administration. The \nDepartments of Labor and Health and Human Services have been extremely \nhelpful throughout the reauthorization effort. President Clinton \ndeserves particular credit for proposing creation of the National \nFamily Caregiver Support Program.\n  The legislation before us is supported by the National Governors' \nAssn. and by nearly fifty organizations, which represent senior \ncitizens, including: The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations; \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons; National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare; National Association of Area Agencies on \nAging; National Association of State Units on Aging; Meals on Wheels \nAssociation of America; Generations United; Green Thumb; National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens; National Urban League; National Council on \nAging; National Caucus and Center on Black Aged; National Association \nfor Hispanic Elderly; National Asian Pacific Center on Aging; National \nIndian Council on Aging; Alzheimer's Association; American Society on \nAging; Gerontological Society of America; Association of Jewish Aging \nServices; National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys; Older Women's \nLeague; National Association of State Long Term Care Ombudsman \nPrograms; and National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services \nPrograms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from a number of \nthese organizations may be placed in the Record. Their strong support \ndemonstrates that this bill will truly benefit the older Americans it \nis designed to serve, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott and Minority Leader Daschle: As \n     the end of the 106th Congress approaches, the nation's \n     Governors urge you to help the states provide critical \n     support and services for the nation's seniors by \n     reauthorizing the Older Americans Act (OAA).\n       This law has established the primary framework in the \n     states for the delivery of vital support and nutritional \n     services to seniors. Reauthorization of this important \n     program will demonstrate a federal commitment to these \n     critical issues, and will be crucial for ensuring that \n     seniors continue to receive key OAA services.\n       The authorization for the OAA expired in 1995, and the law \n     has not been reauthorized in the past five years. This lack \n     of legal authority puts OAA programs and funding at risk. \n     After considerable negotiation and compromise, we now \n     understand that the current proposal enjoys broad bipartisan \n     support. We therefore ask that you move quickly to ensure the \n     reauthorization of the Older Americans Act this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Jim Hodges,\n       Chair, Human Resources Committee, State of South Carolina.\n     Governor Bob Taft,\n       Vice-Chair, Human Resources Committee, State of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Leadership Council of Aging\n\n\n                                                Organizations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned members of the \n     Leadership Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO), applaud the \n     leadership of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions for developing a bipartisan bill to \n     reauthorize the Older Americans Act which will modernize and \n     strengthen the programs and services provided to millions of \n     older Americans. We are especially appreciative of the open \n     and productive process used by Committee staff to obtain \n     input from all interested parties on the future of the Act.\n       We believe the Committee has crafted a compromise bill, \n     which moves the Act in a number of critical new program \n     directions, while maintaining the integrity of all of the \n     current Titles. We are especially pleased that the bill \n     authorizes a new Family Caregiver Support Program that will \n     provide essential services to thousands of people caring for \n     older individuals in the home.\n       We urge you to support this bill when the full Committee \n     considers it this week.\n           Sincerely,\n         AARP; AFL-CIO Department of Public Policy; Alliance for \n           Aging Research; Alzheimer's Association; American \n           Association for International Aging; American \n           Association of Homes and\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\n           Services for the Aging; American Society of Consultant \n           Pharmacists; American Society on Aging; Association for \n           Gerontology and Human development in Historically Black \n           Colleges and Universities; Association of Jewish Aging \n           Services; B'nai B'rith International; Gerontological \n           Society of America; Green Thumb; Meals on Wheels \n           Association of America; National Academy of Elder Law \n           Attorneys; National Association of Area Agencies on \n           Aging; National Association of Foster Grandparent \n           Program Directors; National Association of Nutrition \n           and Aging Services Programs; National Association of \n           Retired and Senior Volunteer Program Directors; \n           National Association of Senior Companion Project \n           Directors; National Association of State Long Term Care \n           Ombudsman Programs; National Association of State Units \n           on Aging; National Caucus and Center on Black Aged; \n           National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare; National Council on the Aging; National \n           Hispanic Council on Aging; National Osteoporosis \n           Foundation; National Senior Service Corps Directors \n           Association; OWL; United Jewish Communities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 14, 2000.\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy: The undersigned \n     Title V private sector grantees thank you, Senator DeWine and \n     Senator Mikulski for your leadership in constructing an Older \n     Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization bill that all interested \n     parties can support. We believe you have succeeded in that \n     endeavor. While some elements of the July 12 draft bill can \n     be improved, we believe that, on balance, the overall package \n     will put the OAA on solid footing for the next five years.\n       We are pleased that the Committee has incorporated many \n     improvements recommended by our organizations. With respect \n     to Title V, we particularly appreciate provisions that:\n       hold States and private sector grantees harmless at the FY \n     2000 level of activity;\n       ensure that a unit cost adjustment due to an increase in \n     the minimum wage or cost of living increases will have first \n     priority in new Title V appropriations;\n       establish clear administrative cost definitions;\n       set strong but reasonable placement standards and provide \n     for the establishment of performance standards reflecting the \n     multiple goals of the program; and,\n       establish procedures to ensure greater accountability and \n     that introduce constructive competition into the program.\n       The allocation of the first $35 million available after \n     unit cost and minimum wage increases remains troubling. We \n     hope, however, that the new performance and accountability \n     measures in the legislation will produce better results.\n       Regarding Title III, we commend the Committee for \n     addressing a number of issues of concern to most of our \n     organizations and others in the aging network. Among \n     improvements are measures that buttress legal assistance \n     services, restore consumer grievance procedures and \n     strengthen public hearing provisions. It is our understanding \n     that the targeting language in the law has not been changed \n     in the draft bill. On the other hand, while we welcome \n     enhanced consumer protections related to financial \n     contributions, we remain concerned about the impact on \n     vulnerable individuals of expanded cost sharing by the \n     States. We urge you to narrow the scope of this activity as \n     the legislation moves forward.\n       All in all, we believe the Committee has met the \n     considerable challenge of updating the Older Americans Act \n     and strengthening the infrastructure needed to serve a \n     rapidly expanding aging population. We look forward to \n     working with you to see this legislation enacted before the \n     end of the 106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                Horace B.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pensions, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I would like to thank you for your \n     strong efforts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act this \n     Congress. We have reviewed the draft legislation for next \n     week's scheduled mark-up and I am delighted to say that we \n     support its favorable consideration.\n       This legislation would protect and preserve the many key \n     components of the Older Americans Act, which include the \n     meals programs, in-home service, Title IV research, and jobs \n     programs. It also preserves the vital provisions of Title VII \n     Vulnerable Elder Rights programs, including Legal Services, \n     Elder Abuse Prevention, and the Long-Term Care Ombudsman. We \n     are also pleased that your bill would add important new \n     provisions to the Older Americans Act for pension counseling \n     and family caregiver support.\n       I know this bill is the product of considerable bi-partisan \n     negotiation and effort, and we appreciate your strong \n     leadership in this process. It would be a tremendous 35th \n     birthday present to the Older Americans Act if it were signed \n     into law this year.\n       This reauthorization effort and any changes it brings will \n     set the stage for aging policy as we enter the new \n     millennium--an era in which meeting the needs of our more \n     isolated seniors within their communities must dominate an \n     increasing share of our national attention. We look forward \n     to the enactment of Older Americans Act legislation before \n     the close of the 106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A.

Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Association of Area \n     Agencies of Aging (N4A) commends you and your staff for your \n     leadership on the Older Americans Act Reauthorization. We are \n     extremely pleased that a compromise measure has been \n     developed that resolves a majority of the issues that delayed \n     reauthorization in the past. We are hopeful that the \n     consensus growing around this compromise measure will provide \n     the impetus necessary to see this law reauthorized during the \n     106th Congress.\n       For over thirty years, the Older Americans Act (OAA) \n     programs and services have improved the quality of life for \n     millions of older adults and their families. Services \n     provided through the OAA include a wide range of home and \n     community based services, such as information and assistance \n     to older adults and their caregivers, home delivered meals, \n     transportation, home care, respite care, adults day care, \n     elder rights and legal assistance, employment assistance and \n     direct funding for tribal elders. The time is long overdue \n     for Congress to reconfirm the federal commitment to the \n     nation's older citizens by reauthorizing the legislation that \n     facilitates the ability of these individuals to remain in the \n     settings where they want and deserve to be, in their homes \n     and communities.\n       The bill contains many provisions that have long been \n     priorities of N4A. Our membership particularly appreciate the \n     bill's inclusion of a $125 million authorization for a Family \n     Caregiver Support Program which builds upon existing \n     infrastructures at the local level.\n       The 655 Area Agencies on Aging and 230 Title VI Native \n     American Indian grantees that N4A represents are anxious to \n     see the Older Americans Act reauthorized this year. We \n     support movement of the Chairman's mark out of committee and \n     to the floor for consideration by the full Senate. We stand \n     ready to assist you in your efforts to make 2000 the year \n     that we realize the long-overdue Older Americans Act \n     Reauthorization.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janice Jackson,\n       Executive Director.\n     Barry Donenfeld,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                      of State Units on Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Association of State \n     Units on Aging (NASUA) urges you to support the Senate \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's leadership \n     bill to modernize and reauthorize the Older Americans Act \n     (OAA). As you know, the bill will be considered by the \n     Committee on July 19.\n       Since its enactment in 1965, the OAA has provided the \n     elderly with home and community-based services so they may \n     remain in their homes and live with independence and dignity. \n     Such services include home-delivered and congregate meals, \n     in-home care, respite care, adult day care, and case \n     management. OAA programs and services complement other state \n     and federal programs, such as the Social Services Block \n     Grant, the Medicaid waiver program, and state-funded home and \n     community-based service programs.\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\n       The leadership bill will reauthorize the Older Americans \n     Act for 5 years. It maintains the focus and integrity of all \n     the current titles in the Act, including those programs that \n     authorize the long-term care ombudsman program and state \n     legal assistance development.\n       Most importantly, the bill authorizes a new national family \n     caregiver support program to provide supportive services to \n     family and friends who care for older people in the home. The \n     bill will also revitalize the Title V employment program. In \n     addition, it will give states the option to institute cost \n     sharing for certain services in order to expand services \n     available to those now on waiting lists.\n       The leadership bill is the product of many months of hard \n     work on the part of committee staff, members, and aging \n     organizations that serve older people. It is a compromise we \n     believe will advance the interests of older people in the new \n     millennium.\n       If you have any questions, please call Kathy Konka at 202/\n     898-2578.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Daniel A.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As President of the Meals On Wheels \n     Association of America (MOWAA), the oldest and largest \n     national organization representing those providing meals to \n     seniors, I am writing to request your support of ``The Older \n     Americans Act Amendments of 2000'' (the DeWine/Jeffords \n     substitute to S. 1536), proposed legislation to reauthorize \n     the Older Americans Act. Reauthorization of the Older \n     Americans Act during this Congress is a priority for MOWAA, \n     and we are delighted that you and your colleagues have an \n     opportunity to approve a bill that addresses the concerns \n     expressed to you by MOWAA, other service providers and groups \n     serving Older Americans, and the elderly themselves.\n       When I presented testimony to the Subcommittee last year, I \n     stated that MOWAA was committed to reauthorization, because \n     we believe that the Act is a lifeline for many of this \n     country's seniors. It is the foundation on which a large and \n     vital national, yet distinctly local, system of home and \n     community-based services has been built. In other words, it \n     has worked well. But as we move into this new millennium, and \n     the needs and profiles of those who rely on the Act's \n     services continue to change, parts of the Act need to be \n     modified and fine-tuned to meet the new challenges. MOWAA's \n     testimony outlined some of the changes that this Association \n     believed would be important for the future health and growth \n     of senior meal programs and the elderly whom they serve. We \n     are delighted that our recommendations were carefully \n     examined, and that changes consistent with our suggestions \n     have been included in the draft bill.\n       Specifically, we are pleased that the DeWine/Jeffords \n     substitute to S. 1526 includes a section relating to \n     ``Voluntary Contributions.'' The proposed language makes \n     clear that meal programs can accept and solicit voluntary \n     contributions. Under the proposed legislation, as we \n     understand it, area agencies on aging will consult with meal \n     providers and others to determine the best method for \n     soliciting and collecting contributions. Contributions would \n     be used for the provision of services. While encouraging \n     client financial participation in a noncoercive way, and by \n     ensuring that no client can be denied a service, the current \n     draft proposal also affords strong protection for clients who \n     are unable or unwilling to pay. MOWAA strongly supports all \n     of these provisions.\n       This Association has also been on record as supporting \n     giving increased flexibility to States and localities to move \n     nutrition services monies where they are most needed. The \n     legislation accomplishes this by increasing to fifty percent \n     the amount of funds that can be transferred between \n     congregate and home-delivered meals. Additionally, we have \n     also advocated for simplification of the so-called ``USDA per \n     meal reimbursement,'' and the bill achieves that goal by \n     essentially eliminating a reimbursement ``rate'' and basing \n     allocations on the actual number of meals served in the \n     previous fiscal year. We support both these provisions.\n       Again, the Meals On Wheels Association of America supports \n     the draft legislation, a reauthorization bill that we believe \n     is forward-looking at the same time that it preserves the \n     fundamental principles on which the Act was created. \n     Committee approval would be a strong and important step \n     forward in the legislative process, and we sincerely hope \n     that you will vote to report a bipartisan bill to the full \n     Senate on July 19. Additionally, we hope all your colleagues \n     in the Senate, and those in the House as well, will recognize \n     the significance of what the Committee has done and commit \n     themselves to continuing to work on a bipartisan basis to \n     enact an Older Americans Act reauthorization in the 106th \n     Congress. Our Nation's seniors deserve no less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Lipner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Generations United,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Generations United (GU) supports the \n     draft version of the Older Americans Act that will be marked-\n     up on July 19, 2000. Generations United believes that it is \n     important that the Older Americans Act be re-authorized this \n     year. We applaud the efforts of Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, \n     DeWine, and Mikulski to reach a compromise.\n       This version includes the National Family Caregiver Support \n     Program, which Generations United has long supported. The \n     Program provides valuable assistance to caregivers, including \n     older adult caregivers and grandparents who are raising \n     grandchildren. The number of grandparents raising their \n     grandchildren has steadily increased in recent years. These \n     caregivers face an emotional and financial toll that is often \n     unforeseen. We believe that they merit support under the \n     Older Americans Act.\n       Generations United is the national membership organization \n     focused solely on promoting intergenerational strategies, \n     programs, and public policies. GU represents more than 185 \n     national, state, and local organizations and individuals \n     representing more than 70 million Americans and is the only \n     national organization advocating for the mutual well-being of \n     children, youth, and the elderly. Since 1986, Generations \n     United has served as a resource for educating policymakers \n     and the public about the economic, social, and personal \n     imperatives of intergenerational cooperation. GU acts as a \n     catalyst for stimulating collaboration between aging, \n     children, and youth organizations providing a forum to \n     explore areas of common ground while celebrating the richness \n     of each generation.\n       We urge you to support the draft Older Americans Act that \n     is being presented on Wednesday.\n           Sincerely,\n     Generations United.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                     Wasington, DC, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I wanted to take this opportunity to \n     commend you for your outstanding leadership that you and \n     Senators Jeffords, DeWine and Mikulski have provided in \n     seeking to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). The \n     Administration strongly supports the OAA bipartisan \n     compromise developed by you and your staff, and urges quick \n     and unanimous Committee approval of this vital legislation.\n       We are extremely grateful that your compromise includes the \n     National Family Caregiver Support Program. This is a key \n     Administration priority that will help hundreds of thousands \n     of family members who are struggling to care for their older \n     loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. The National \n     Family Caregiver Support Program has gained the strong \n     support of older persons and their family members all across \n     the country.\n       We are also especially pleased that your bipartisan \n     compromise includes many other provisions that will \n     strengthen and improve OAA services provided to America's \n     older persons. We support provisions to protect the targeting \n     of service to low-income minority elders, acknowledge \n     culturally appropriate services for Native Americans, \n     maintain the priority for legal services, and allow cost-\n     sharing where appropriate. The bipartisan compromise will \n     also usher the OAA into the 21st century by providing new \n     flexibility throughout the Act, and authorizing a White House \n     Conference on Aging in 2005.\n       The reauthorization of the Older Americans Act is \n     critically important for millions of older Americans and \n     their families. We are most appreciative of your commitment \n     to the OAA and look forward to working with you to secure \n     final enactment of this legislation in the weeks ahead.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the transmittal of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n       An identical letter is being sent to Senator Jeffords.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Department of Labor,\n\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Jeffords: I wanted to take this opportunity \n     to commend the efforts of the Committee in working to address \n     and strengthen vital legislation that enhances services to \n     millions of older Americans. The Department of Labor \n     appreciates the leadership of the Committee in developing \n     this legislation and supports Committee approval of S. 1536, \n     the ``Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000.''\n       Among a number of other things, this legislation would \n     reauthorize and amend the Senior Community Service Employment \n     Program (SCSEP) that is authorized under Title V of the Older \n     Americans Act and administered by the Department of Labor. \n     SCSEP provides part-time community service employment to low-\n     income individuals\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\n     age 55 and older. This important program provides much needed \n     employment and income to participants, enhances the provision \n     of community services, and promotes economic self-sufficiency \n     by facilitating the reentry of participants into the labor \n     force and helping them to obtain unsubsidized employment.\n       The amendments to SCSEP contained in this bill incorporate \n     the key features of the Administration's proposal for \n     reauthorization of the program that were included in S. 1203, \n     sponsored by Senator Mikulski. While retaining the unique and \n     complementary structure of the program under which national \n     nonprofit agencies and organizations as well as States \n     receive grants to operate projects, the bill also contains a \n     number of enhancements to SCSEP.\n       These enhancements include the establishment of a \n     performance accountability system that would hold each \n     grantee accountable for attaining quality levels of \n     performance with respect to core performance measures. These \n     performance measures include the placement and retention of \n     participants in unsubsidized employment, customer \n     satisfaction of employers and participants, the number of \n     persons served, and the community services provided. The \n     performance measures would be designed to promote the \n     continuous improvement of SCSEP. Failure to attain \n     appropriate levels of performance by a grantee would lead to \n     significant consequences, including the potential loss of \n     part or all of the grant. The Department believes these \n     provisions would strengthen accountability and performance \n     under the program and make a good program even better.\n       The amendments would also strengthen the linkages of SCSEP \n     with the broader workforce investment system established \n     under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). SCSEP is a \n     required partner in the One-Stop delivery system under WIA, \n     and these amendments enhance the connections between SCSEP \n     and WIA through provisions that would allow older individuals \n     easier access to appropriate services under both programs and \n     avoid duplication of services.\n       In addition, the amendments would improve States' ability \n     to coordinate services to participants by enhancing the \n     planning process relating to SCSEP programs. The bill \n     provides for broad participation of stakeholders in the \n     development of a plan in each State to ensure the equitable \n     distribution of projects within the State. Other enhancements \n     include the incorporation of fiscal accountability provisions \n     similar to those contained in WIA, including definitions of \n     administrative and programmatic costs and the application of \n     uniform cost principles and administrative requirements.\n       The Department of Labor believes it is essential that the \n     older Americans Act be reauthorized and enhanced. This \n     legislation advances those objectives while authorizing \n     important improvements to the program. We urge the Committee \n     to approve this legislation and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you to ensure enactment of this important \n     reauthorization.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the transmittal of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Alexis M. Herman.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise with great enthusiasm to \nsupport passage of the bipartisan Older Americans Act and its \namendments for the year 2000.\n  This bill enjoys very strong bipartisan support in this institution \nand in the House and, I believe, among the American people. Yesterday \nthe House passed this legislation overwhelmingly, 405-2. The Senate \ncompanion bill that we are bringing to the attention of our colleagues \ntoday already has 72 cosponsors. There is strong bipartisan, bicameral \nagreement to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. It is built on the \nstrong foundation of S. 1536 and the bipartisan compromises reached by \nthe HELP Committee in that bill.\n  This legislation also has the strong support of the executive branch. \nPresident Bill Clinton's team from HHS was enormously helpful in \nenabling us to shape not only the reauthorization of the bill as we \nknew it but help create a framework for the future. The gifted \nAdministrator on Aging, Jeanette Takamura, was tremendously helpful.\n  This bill is long overdue in its reauthorization. The reauthorization \nexpired in 1995. It became bogged down for almost 5 years in prickly \npolitics, most of which had nothing to do with how we could make sure \nwe were effectively serving the senior population.\n  This year, as we moved into the 106th Congress, Senator Mike DeWine \nof Ohio and I pledged that we would do everything we could to come up \nwith an excellent framework to meet the needs of the seniors, to not \nonly reauthorize and rubberstamp but to look at it, to be both fiscally \nprudent but also to be effective with taxpayers' money. He worked very \nhard in doing that and worked very hard with my staff. I thank him and \nhis staff for their collegial, cordial work on this legislation.\n  Of course, Senator Jeffords has been tremendously helpful. He enabled \nus to hold our hearings, to move the process forward. I personally \nthank him. Of course, my champ, the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, \nwith his very able staff, enabled us to work with the constituency \ngroups, and so on.\n  So we did all the right process things. Now it is time to move the \nprocess to closure. We have had debate. We have had hearings. We have \nhad consultations. We have consensus. Now it is time we have \nreauthorization. I hope today we can move expeditiously, entertain any \namendments that Members would like to offer, and dispose of them in a \ntimely way. The seniors are looking for it.\n  When I visit the senior centers in my own community, they say: How \nare you doing on the Older Americans Act? I say: We are doing fine, but \nthe Older Americans Act is being stalled in a variety of procedural \nmatters.\n  Let's remove the procedural barriers. Let's also deal with the \namendments.\n  What I like about this legislation is that it keeps our promises to \nolder Americans to retain and strengthen the current Older Americans \nAct programs, but it also provides new innovations and accountability \nto improve it. It will ensure that the Older Americans Act continues to \nmeet the day-to-day needs of our country's older Americans and yet the \nlong-range needs of an ever increasing aging population.\n  One of the highlights of this bill is the creation of a program \ncalled the National Family Caregiver Support Program. This recognizes \nthe tremendous aging population, many who are left at home, many of \nwhom rely on the primary caregiver as the American family. The American \nfamily is stepping forward to take care of older parents and at the \nsame time being able to raise their own children.\n\n  This places tremendous stress on the family in terms of time, energy, \nand even finances, but, as always, the American family is up to it. The \nAmerican family is ready to step forward. Often the caregiving is \nprimarily done by women, some who have taken temp jobs, some who have \ntaken flextime jobs, some who are juggling so many others, often to the \ntune of at least 20 or 40 hours a week either in their own home or \ngoing to the home of a parent.\n  The American family is up to it, but we have to be up to supporting \nthe American family. Government should never be a substitute for the \nfamily, but the family should be able to rely on the Government for \ncertain support services to enable them to be the best at caregiving \nand not wear out.\n  The National Family Caregiver Support Program will provide very \nimportant support services. It will also provide information assistance \nto millions of Americans who are searching for what are the best \nresources to help their older parent. Also, it provides for them \ntraining, counseling, and even some respite care. Even the best family \ncan't keep at it 24-7, 52 weeks of the year.\n  It will also help grandparents who care for grandchildren, and, as I \nsaid, this program has strong bipartisan support.\n  Later I will go into the need for caregiving, why it is so important, \nwhy we need to support the families.\n  At the same time, though, while we look for innovation, we also \nmaintain the core programs of the Older Americans Act. I remember when \nthis legislation was passed in 1972, I was so excited about it, working \nin Baltimore's neighborhoods, that we were actually going to have \nprograms that would come right to the community and right at the \nneighborhood level.\n  We knew the seniors needed support services. We knew they were facing \nloneliness. We knew they were facing poor nutrition. We knew they were \noften the subject of scams and fraud and a variety of kinds of abuse. \nAs a result of what was done in 1972, we stayed the course. But now, \nwhat are the best practices, the highest use of new technologies, and \nso on, to accomplish this goal?\n  The program called Meals on Wheels changed the face of America.\n  Fifty volunteers, often working with nonprofits, were able to get \nmeals into a home in order to keep people independent and at the same \ntime keep a unique partnership between the Federal Government and \nnonprofits, helping people remain independent. There\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nwere people who were lonely--often widows or men who lost wives who \nwere kind of walking around, hanging out at diners or cafes in certain \nareas. They needed companionship and maybe a hot meal, and they also \nneeded a sense of purpose where they themselves would volunteer. We use \nthe term congregate meals. What an insipid term because what we really \nwanted them to do is congregate with other people, to have fun and good \nmeals and even learn some new skills which we are going to bring in \nwith crossing the digital divide. Those nutritional programs kept \npeople alive. My own dear mother, when she came home from an acute care \nfacility, temporarily used that as we pitched in with the rest of the \nfamily.\n  We also maintain a separate and distinct title IV program for \nresearch and demonstration because we think we have to try new ideas \nbefore we create them and institutionalize them into the legislation. \nInnovation has always been a unique characteristic. We also talk about \na White House conference in 2005. We maintain another poor program--\nsupport for transportation services. It is absolutely crucial in our \nown community and into rural areas. This language also requires older \nAmerican services to be directed to those who need them the most. \nHowever, we acknowledged the unmet need that can exist in rural areas, \nso we included provisions to improve the delivery of services to older \nindividuals in rural areas.\n  I congratulate Senator DeWine, who really ensured a sensitivity to \nthat. I represent rural counties myself. At the same time, we recognize \nthe need to strengthen certain programs and increase accountability. \nThe bill gives greater flexibility to transfer of funds between those \ncongregate and home-delivered meals to the areas of greatest need. It \nalso includes performance measures for States and private sector \ngrantees in the Senior Community Service Employment Program. If these \nstandards are not met and performance is not improved, other entities \nwill get the opportunity to competitively bid for a portion or all of \nthe original entity's grant--whatever the word ``entity'' means. While \nI believe that overall the current grantees are performing very well, \nthese provisions will ensure that seniors get the high-quality services \nthey deserve. We ensure accountability for not only the taxpayers' \nfunds but the services being delivered.\n  So this bill strikes a good balance between recognizing the need for \nadditional resources to support OAA programs and protecting the most \nvulnerable citizens and their access to services. It also authorizes \nthe seniors to make voluntary contributions for all OAA services. It \nalso allows States to require cost sharing for a limited number of \nservices, such as transportation, respite care, and personal care. A \nlong list of services is exempt from cost sharing, such as Meals on \nWheels, information and assistance, and that very important ombudsman \nprogram. It also provides guidance to States and protections to help \nensure that seniors are not discouraged from seeking services because \nof cost sharing.\n  I note the strong need for increased funding for the Older Americans \nAct programs. Very few OAA programs have seen increased funding in \nrecent years. Yet there is a growing need for services. I support full \nfunding for OAA and also for the new National Family Caregiver Support \nProgram. Also, the core programs need increases in funding.\n\n  So I think this is good legislation. I think it is good \nauthorization. I think it will provide immeasurable guidance to the \nappropriators for the next 3 years. This morning I say we have good \nlegislation. We can be so proud of the bipartisan, bicameral support. \nThis is what America wants us to do, really--focus on the day-to-day \nneeds of our constituents, look ahead to an aging population, and come \nup with a fiscally prudent, service-effective framework, and get the \njob done. All too often in this institution, when all is said and done, \nmore gets said than done. Today, let's stay late and get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I renew Senator DeWine's earlier request \nwith respect to the Older Americans Act and amend the request to \ninclude that at the conclusion or yielding back of the debate time, the \nbill be set aside with the votes to occur on the amendments and the \nbill at 5 p.m. today. I further ask consent that the time consumed thus \nfar be deducted from the time agreement accordingly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder if \nthe Senator from Vermont knows and can give us assurance that that will \nbe the first vote of the day.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I cannot give such assurance.\n  Mr. REID. We won't object, however. It is quite apparent that we are \ninterested in that being the first vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand. I have no authority to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The general debate time is gone. The majority and minority \nused more than their allotted time. We have 4 hours under the control \nof the Senator from New Hampshire, and we would make it easier for \nstaff and the parties here debating if we would explicitly determine \nthat the time you are going to use will come off Senator Gregg's time. \nOtherwise, we don't have any time to be debating. Would the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire allow the Senator from Vermont to use part of his \ntime?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11035-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11035-S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 782) to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     to extend authorization of appropriations for programs under \n     the Act, to modernize programs and services for older \n     individuals, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is authorized \nto offer two amendments to the bill with 2 hours evenly divided on each \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nVermont at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure that the \nSenate is moving to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. \nThis year is the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Program. Since \n1965, the act has provided a range of needed social services to our \nNation's senior citizens.\n  It is the major vehicle for the organization and delivery of \nsupportive and nutrition services to older persons, and it has grown \nand changed to meet our citizens' needs. In 1972, we created the \nnational nutrition program; in 1978, we established a separate title \nfor Native Americans; and in 1987, we authorized programs to prevent \nelder abuse and neglect.\n  The act has been reauthorized 12 times, most recently in 1992. \nReauthorization legislation was considered in the 104th and 105th \nCongresses but did not pass due to controversy about a number of \nproposals. Now, we have the chance to pass this act and provide our \nelderly with desperately needed help.\n  The Older Americans Act programs play a vital role in all our \ncommunities. Because of the Older Americans Act, millions of nutritious \nmeals are delivered each year to the generation that served our country \nin World War II. It funds the operations of senior centers and other \nsupportive services to enhance the dignity and independence of the \nNation's elders; and it provides part-time employment opportunities to \ntens of thousands of senior citizens.\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\n  Indeed, virtually all of our Nation's elderly are benefiting from the \nact. However, more could be done to help our senior citizens and their \nfamilies. This is why we are here to pass the Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2000. I want to commend all of the members of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for their work and \ncontributions in this effort. Senator DeWine and Senator Mikulski led \nthe way on this reauthorization effort early in this Congress. The \nSubcommittee on Aging held a series of seven hearings, receiving \ntestimony from over 30 witnesses. The hearings addressed important \nissues, including elder abuse, supportive services, State and local \nviews, longevity in the workplace, and long-term family caregiver \nprograms. In March, 1999, we were very fortunate to hear testimony from \nMs. Reeve Lindbergh of St. Johnsbury, Vermont. She spoke to our \ncommittee about the unacceptable problem of elder abuse which confronts \nsome of our most fragile elders.\n  Then, in April, we heard from another Vermonter, Mr. John Barbour, \nwho serves as the director of the Champlain Valley Agency on Aging, in \nWinooski, Vermont. He alerted the committee to changes needed in the \nnutritional programs outlined in title III of the act. This bill \nimproves the Older Americans Act in several key areas. For example, it \nsets out specific policies objectives related to income, health, \nhousing, long-term care, employment, retirement, and community services \nthat will improve the lives of all older Americans. One of the most \nimportant aspects of this Act is the establishment of the Grassley-\nBreaux, National Family Caregiver Support Program. According to the \n1994 National Long Term Care Survey, there are more than 7 million \ninformal caregivers--including spouses, adult children, other \nrelatives, and friends who provide day-to-day care for most of our \nNation's elders.\n  The National Family Caregiver Program authorizes $125 million in \nFederal assistance to help families care for their elderly by providing \na multifaceted system of supportive services, including information, \nassistance, counseling, and respite services. Moreover, it will help \nolder individuals who are caring for relative children, such as their \ngrandchildren. This program will also extend to older folks who are \ncaring for their adult children with mental retardation and \ndevelopmental disabilities. Significant changes have been made to title \nV which authorizes community service employment for older Americans to \nprovide part-time community service jobs for unemployed, low-income \npersons 55 years old and over.\n  There will be 1.4 million more low-income persons over the age of 55 \nin the year 2005 than there were a decade earlier, and many of them \nwill continue working. Employment obtained through this program \nprovides these workers with needed economic support. It keeps them \nactive and involved in their communities, and it provides them with the \nopportunity to make important contributions to their communities, learn \nnew skills, and enhance their sense of dignity and self-esteem. The \nchanges made in title V by the bill are a critical part of this \nlegislation, because they strengthen and modernize the Senior \nEmployment Program.\n  To begin, the program will now stress economic self-sufficiency and \nwill increase the number of placements in public- and private-sector \nunsubsidized employment. The employment program is integrated with the \nWorkforce Investment Act, including one-stop delivery systems and \nparticipant assessments and services, while the program itself and the \nadministrative costs are codified. Also, under this title, a State \nSenior Employment Services Plan is established which provides Governors \nwith greater influence and responsibility concerning the allocation of \njob slots. The newly established State plan ensures for the first time \na planning process with broad participation by representatives from \nthroughout the aging community.\n  Other sections have also been strengthened. It authorizes the \nAssistant Secretary for Aging to award funds for training, research, \nand demonstration projects in the field of aging. This act consolidates \nthe demonstration programs from 18 to 10 categories, including sections \non violence against older Americans, rural health, computer training, \nand transportation. Title VI, grants to Native Americans, authorizes \nfunds for social and nutrition services to older Indians and Native \nHawaiians. It also adds a provision which authorizes funds for \nactivities that protect the rights of the vulnerable elderly. I want to \ntake this opportunity to acknowledge the many other individuals and \norganizations that have contributed to this effort. Senator Kennedy \ncontributed his long experience to this effort. He helped us find the \nmiddle ground and solutions to many thorny issues. Senator Hutchinson \nwas especially active on these efforts to address the employment and \nservices needs of the rural elderly.\n  Among the groups in the network of aging organizations, special \nrecognition must go to the National Council of Older Americans and the \nNational Association of State Units on Aging for their insight in \nproposing a compromise to the employment services program. AARP, with \nthe leadership of Horace Deets, undertook the difficult task of seeking \nconsensus among the many aging organizations. Green thumb tirelessly \neducated Members of Congress about the importance of these aging \npopulations, especially those Members representing rural \nconstituencies. The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, \ncurrently being chaired by the Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, provided a continuous forum for many issues to be \naddressed. Others contributing to this effort include the Southern \nGovernors Association, the National Caucus on Black Aging, the National \nAssociation of Area Agencies on Aging, and Meals on Wheels. Finally, \nthe Administration on Aging, headed by Jeanette Takamura, provided \nongoing leadership and continuous expert support in strengthening these \nprograms.\n  Yesterday our colleagues in the House passed the Older Americans \nReauthorization Act by an overwhelming majority. In summary, S. 1536 \ngoes a long way to improving supportive, employment, and nutritional \nservices for the elderly. This legislation updates the Older Americans \nAct, making it more relevant and useful to our country's senior \ncitizens. All of these individuals have worked hard to develop \ninnovative strategies to strengthen and modernize the Older Americans \nAct, and I know that through these efforts our Nation's elders will be \nbetter served by this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand, there are 2 hours under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both sides have 1 hour on each of the two \namendments, so the Senator does have 2 hours.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4343\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio \nand the ranking member, the Senator from Maryland, for bringing this \nbill forward, the chairman and ranking members of the subcommittee, and \nalso the chairman of the full committee and ranking member of the full \ncommittee, the Senators from Vermont and Massachusetts.\n  The Older Americans Act is a significant piece of legislation. I had \nthe good fortune to chair this subcommittee for a number of years and \nworked very hard on this piece of legislation. Regrettably, at that \ntime we were unable to pass it all the way through the Congress. \nCertainly, the work of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from \nMaryland in getting it to this point is significant and positive for \nsenior citizens of America.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. There is no question \nabout that. The changes made to this bill are extremely constructive to \nmaking the plan more flexible, more vibrant, more effective for our \nseniors and for the States in their ability to administer this program. \nAgain, they have done an excellent job and I look forward to voting for \nfinal passage of the full bill.\n  There is, however, one area where I have reservations about the \nmechanisms in the bill which are designed to protect the money and make \nsure the money flows to the benefit of senior citizens. The whole \nobject of this piece of legislation is to benefit our seniors primarily \nin meals programs, employment programs, and a variety of other \nprograms. It is extremely critical that the dollars that are spent not \nget tied up in bureaucracy and not get abused or misused, not be \nsubject to fraudulent activity but, rather, actually flow through \nthe system to the benefit of seniors; in the specific area of title V, \nwhich is the employment program of the bill, that the dollars flow for \nthe purposes of employing seniors in jobs that can be constructive for \nthem and give them a better lifestyle. That is the purpose of this \nbill.\n\n  The problem, the concern, I have with the bill is that I do not \nbelieve it is strong enough in the area of enforcing the discipline in \norder to assure that the dollars flow through and end up benefiting the \nseniors of our country.\n  I have suggested some changes to the bill which are part of this \namendment. The bill has what is known as a responsibility test in title \nV which essentially lays out approximately 12 different areas where the \nDepartment must review the activities of grantees in order to determine \nwhether or not they are delivering services correctly.\n  Let me step back a minute and explain that there are a series of \ngrantees under this title V proposal. One group is funded at the State \nlevel; another group is funded at the Federal level. The group funded \nat the Federal level is made up of a series of named agencies, specific \nagencies. Some of them are extraordinarily good at what they do. For \nexample, Green Thumb does an extremely good job. Our parks department \ndoes an extremely good job. These agencies every year get what amounts \nto an entitlement, a specific amount of money to specifically grant to \nthem $350 million in total which flows to each one of these agencies \nwithout any competition.\n  With most Federal grants, most Federal contracts, if you want to \nbuild a road or you want to start a program of social service \nsomewhere, you want to help people out in a day-care center, you have \nto usually compete, go through a system of applying to the proper \nFederal agency and competing for that money to see if the program you \nare proposing makes more sense that the program somebody else is \nproposing. That is called good government, creating that atmosphere of \ncompetition so that different ideas come to the table.\n  In the area of these initiatives, I think nine agencies get the money \nindependent of any competition. They get this money as an entitlement. \nIt is simply a check written every year to them and they get it under \nthe law. They don't have to compete for it.\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nThey don't have to apply for it. All they have to do is go to the \nDepartment of Labor and pick up their check.\n  Obviously, when you have that structure, you are bypassing one of the \nsafeguards for making sure that the money is effectively spent and that \nit flows to the people who deserve it. You are bypassing the safeguard \nof annual competition for the funds--a fairly significant decision, by \nthe way.\n  When you do bypass that safeguard, you need to put into the law \nsomething that makes sense in the area of giving the Department of \nLabor oversight over those dollars so the Department of Labor has the \nauthority and the capacity to look at a grantee who has an absolute \nright to this money and say: Well, even though you have an absolute \nright to this money, Mr. or Mrs. Grantee, you have to do a better job \nor we are going to have to question whether you should get the money. \nIf you don't do a better job, we will have to put you through some \ndisciplines to get you to do a better job or, alternatively--and this \nis where I am really concerned--if you happen to misuse this money, if \nyou happen to use it in a way which is totally inappropriate to the \npurposes of assisting seniors in getting better employment, the \nDepartment of Labor should have the authority to go in and say you \ncan't have that money any longer. I mean, that is just logical to me. \nThis is pure logic, as far as I see; ``intuitively obvious through \nobservation,'' as a professor of mine once said.\n\n  If someone is abusing the money, the Department of Labor ought to \nhave the right to go in and reduce that grant, or maybe even eliminate \nthe grant, take the money back and redistribute it to people who are \nusing it effectively, such as Green Thumb.\n  But, under the present law, that is not the case. That type of \nauthority really does not rest with the Department of Labor. There are \nprocedures the Department of Labor can go through, but the \ncomplication, bureaucracy, and time limit involved in executing those \nprocedures makes them virtually useless. As a result, there is no \nclear-cut way for the Department of Labor to, essentially, make \naccountable those agencies which presently have what amounts to an \nentitlement from the Department of Labor and from us, the Congress, for \n$350 million.\n  What my legislation does is try to address that issue. It tries to \nadd to the responsibility test which is in the bill. The present \nresponsibility test in the bill has good language, but unfortunately it \ndoes not have good enforcement and does not have the language we need \nin order to accomplish enforcement in any sort of reasonable timeframe. \nIt tries to add to that language tightening elements which will make it \nmore effective for the Department of Labor.\n  Let me run through it briefly. Essentially what it does is it says: \nFirst, the grantees have to have the proven ability to do what they say \nthey are going to do. That is reasonable. You wouldn't want someone who \ncannot establish that. It says if they misuse the funds--including \ndoing lobbying or litigation against the Federal Government, which is \nillegal, by the way; they are not allowed to do that--if they misuse \nthe funds and the Secretary identifies that or an independent inspector \ngeneral audit identifies that or there are official inquiries of the \nFederal Government that identify that, that misuse of funds is cause \nfor the Department of Labor to move and take the money back from that \ngrantee. It does not have to, but it creates a cause that allows the \nDepartment of Labor to do that. One would think they would because why \nwould the Department of Labor want to fund somebody who had been found \nby, for example, the General Accounting Office or the inspector \ngeneral, to have misused funds? So that only makes sense, in my \nopinion.\n  It also tightens the disallowance. Under the present proceedings, you \ncan have a 5-percent misuse of funds and still get away with it. There \nis law that says basically if you want to take 5 percent of your grant \nand misuse it, essentially you are going to get protection. We move \nthat down to 2 percent, which I think seems a little more reasonable. \nThen what it says is, if there is a grantee who has misused funds, who \nhas been found by the Department of Labor or the IG or the GAO, some \ngroup that has the imprimatur of authority of the Federal Government--\nif that group determines there has been a misuse of funds and revokes \nthe grant, then the dollars get rebid. The dollars flow back into the \npool, the pot; they are not lost. They go back into title V and they \nget rebid.\n  For example, if one of the nine grantees were found to be acting \ninappropriately, misusing funds--inappropriateness doesn't lose your \nfunds but misusing funds, fraudulently using funds, that grantee loses \nits funds--that money would go back in the pool and logically somebody \nsuch as Green Thumb or some other agency which has a respectable track \nrecord and knows what they are doing and has not been using the money \nfor inappropriate activities and has been getting the money out to the \nsenior citizens would have the right to compete to get those dollars. \nThat is the theme of this amendment: good government, it is called; a \ngood government amendment.\n\n  Why do we need it? We need it because we have an example of one of \nthese agencies that gets an entitlement acting in a way which \nessentially has been a misuse of funds. Yet there has been no way to \nremove that agency from the list of those who get an entitlement. This \nagency is, today, called the National Senior Citizens Education and \nResearch Center. It used to be known as the National Council of Senior \nCitizens. I think it is important to review the things this group has \ndone with these tax dollars which have flowed to it for the purposes of \nhelping seniors, and have turned out to be doing a lot less than that. \nIn fact, they have been found by innumerable Federal reviews to have \nactually been misusing those funds in a way that is significant.\n  This is not a small agency. This agency every year gets $64 million \nin tax money written to it as a check, as an entitlement--$64 million. \nThat is a lot of money to be flowing to an agency without any \ncompetition, without any oversight in the sense it has to justify how \nit uses those dollars or, when it does have to justify them, actually \nhas to produce a result, as we will see from what they have actually \ndone as an agency. So it is not small dollars.\n  The IG took a number of looks at this. I think it is important to \nreview what the IG has found. The IG found this grantee has misused \nover $10 million of Federal taxes since 1992--$10 million. In an audit \nin 1992-1994--and remember, the IG does not audit every year, so it \ncould have been more. Who knows? But from an audit in 1992-1994, they \nquestioned $5.8 million of direct costs claimed by the National Council \nof Senior Citizens as not allowable under OMB regulations. These \nregulations are regulations the Department did not enforce: $3.8 \nmillion for health insurance refunds that it received from insurers \nproviding health coverage for seniors participating in the JOBS \nProgram.\n  This may seem to be a worthy endeavor, purchasing health insurance \nfor seniors. It is. But the IG found the National Council of Senior \nCitizens paid premiums out of its DOL account but received refunds \nbased on favorable claim experiences and, instead of using the refunds \nto offset the earlier charges to the DOL grant, the National Council of \nSenior Citizens essentially pocketed the money. Under the Federal \nregulation, Circular A-122 of the OMB, the refund should have been \ncredited directly to the costs of the program. But they were not; $1.1 \nmillion of direct costs were questioned in 1992 and 1994 because the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens charged its DOL grant the cost of \nincurring the administration for this health insurance program on which \nthey got the refunds.\n  Here is a clever little scheme. They charged a fee to the insurer and \nclaimed the fee for administering the plan was membership promotion \nincome. The fee should have gone to reduce the DOL grant cost as \nrequired under the circular I just cited. But, instead, the money went \ninto--where? The National Council of Senior Citizens' pockets. We will \nlater get to what that money went to and, believe me, it was not senior \ncitizens. It is very interesting where this money ended up. This trail \nleads down some very interesting roads.\n\n  Mr. President, $580,000 of the $850,000 total general liability \ninsurance cost was also questioned during the 1992-1994 audit as being \nan arm's length\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\ntransaction because the insurance company shared the same management as \nthe personnel of the National Council of Senior Citizens, and it was \nnot competitively bid. In other words, the National Council of Senior \nCitizens was hiring its leadership to run an insurance company to \ninsure its programs. That has a very suspicious note to it, I would \nthink, under any program. It is a very disturbing finding by the audit.\n  This very disturbing finding by the audit was that the liability \ncompany, which was being run by the National Council of Senior \nCitizens, appeared to be related almost entirely to the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens and its affiliated entities. Many of the \ninsurance company board members were members of the National Council of \nSenior Citizens' executive management group.\n  This is not my information, by the way. This is information found by \nthe IG. The IG found this liability insurance to not be an arm's length \ntransaction, and the DOL, Department of Labor, has even concluded that \nall of the costs of the policy should be disallowed.\n  So you have what appears to be a sham contract, not an arm's length \ncontract, for $850,000 that was not even competed out. The Department \nof Labor has agreed with the bulk of these findings from the 1992-1994 \naudit and has issued a final determination that requires the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens to repay millions of dollars in questionable \nfunds. Has the agency repaid these funds? No, it has not. In fact, they \nhave appealed the administrative law judge decision, and are currently \nin a discovery process.\n  Then there is, of course, the fact that they will probably go to \nFederal court, all the time keeping these funds which are so clearly \nbeing misused.\n  Believe me, they are not running to benefit any senior citizen who is \ntrying to get a job under this program.\n  All during this process, they have been running this sham operation--\nthat is my term; ``it is not an arm's length transaction'' was the IG's \nterm--all during this process they have been receiving $64 million a \nyear every year, just being paid out.\n  There are other items about this organization that are working their \nway through the Department of Labor which are showing there are even \nmore serious issues and significant problems.\n  An IG report reviewing the 1995 funds--remember, the ones I was \ntalking about reviewed 1992 to 1994--finds identical violations--\nidentical violations. In other words, after they have already been \nfound to have violated the rules of the Department of Labor, the rules \nof the Office of Management and Budget, and the rules of objectivity, \nidentical violations were committed in 1995, and it was recommended \n$2.8 million be disallowed.\n  There are still other audits reviewing 1996 and part of 1997 that \ncall into question approximately $2.7 million. This grantee has simply \nnot, under any reasonable test, been administering these funds in a \nresponsible way. It has been misusing these funds.\n  As if these types of findings are not bad enough, there is another \naudit from the IG dated April 24, 1998--fairly recently--which exposes \na $6.1 million slush fund at the National Council of Senior Citizens \nmaintained for over 14 years. This fund, which they euphemistically \ncall a contingency fund, was set up in 1984 with $3.7 million in \nFederal funds to provide financial assistance to enrollees ``in case \nthe JOBS Program had been terminated by the Congress or the \nadministration.'' In other words, they set up a slush fund, the purpose \nof which was to continue the program in case Congress, by some \ndecision, decided the program was not any good. In other words, they \nwere going to be an extraordinary form of government. We now do not \nhave three branches of Government, we have a fourth over here. It is \ncalled the National Council of Senior Citizens which had decided even \nif Congress determined, which it has not and which it will not, that \ntitle V did not make sense, they were going to continue to run title V \nwith tax dollars. That is a new form of government in our midst.\n  The program was not terminated, of course. It has continued. It will \ncontinue as far as the eye can see because it is a program which, on \nbalance, has worked extraordinarily well for our seniors.\n  Has the slush fund been terminated which was set up in 1984 in case \nthere was a contingency that this program might be terminated? Has that \nslush fund been terminated? No, it has not. The IG found it. After the \nIG discovered the fund, by then the money had been transferred to a \ntrust fund. It recommended the money be returned to the Treasury, but \nthe National Council of Senior Citizens filed a lawsuit in Federal \ncourt saying they should be able to keep the money.\n  This is unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to all of us. Anybody \nwho is interested in good government should say, on the face of it, \nthis is an unacceptable action by somebody who is using our Federal \ndollars in trust for the purposes of helping seniors get jobs.\n  Many of the grantees who participate in these programs, even the \nentitlement grantees--in fact, all the entitlement grantees--do so with \nthe understanding that they have local and community organizations; \nthey basically take the money from the Federal Government under this \nentitlement, and they funnel it out to the local community \norganizations which then manage the money and the people they \nadminister. Green Thumb is a classic example of this. Urban League and \nARP are other examples. This is a very legitimate, good way to do it. \nThey have a national organization and send it out to the local \norganization. That is the concept behind this.\n\n  This is why we had, I presume, although I do not know, the original \nnine grantees. I hope nine is right. Nine grantees were picked because \nthey were national but they had local organizations or they at least \nrepresented they would.\n  The National Council of Senior Citizens does not. It does not have \nlocal affiliates. Instead, they function exclusively as a middleman \nprogram. They subcontract the services and the job placement out to \nother nonprofit organizations in States. They do not have a unique \nexpertise to bring to the table. They are simply an intermediary.\n  In their case, they are an intermediary which takes a fair amount of \nthe money and keeps it here in Washington, as it would appear, under \ntheir insurance program to benefit an insurance company with which it \nis affiliated, in the sense its membership is the same membership as \nthe National Council of Senior Citizens group, and that it creates a \nslush fund with the money, and that the IG in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, \n1996, 1997, and 1998 found in violation of the rules of the Department \nof Labor and the Office of Management and Budget.\n  One has to wonder why we need such a middleman. Would it not make \nmore sense, if we are going to have these entitlement programs, if we \nat least send them to people who are using the money to benefit seniors \nand give them jobs, such as the Urban League, ARP, or Green Thumb, and \nlet them compete for it.\n  There is something equally disturbing about this organization \nbecause, as I said earlier, where did this money go? What were they \ndoing? It is my understanding that at one point almost 90 percent of \nthe money of this organization came from this entitlement, and even \ntoday this entitlement makes up a huge amount of their funds. So \nshouldn't they be basically working on senior citizens issues? You say, \nyes, that is right, of course.\n  It turns out that a lawsuit in New York City involving the Teamsters \nUnion and the illegal use of cash in the electoral process for the \npresident of the Teamsters Union, which some may remember involved \ntransferring money from the Democratic National Committee to the \nTeamsters Union and the Teamsters Union to the Democratic National \nCommittee--back and forth and in and out--that in that lawsuit, lo and \nbehold, the National Council of Senior Citizens ended up being named as \nan unindicted co-conspirator.\n  According to the scheme outlined by the Federal prosecutors in the \ncourt documents, the Teamsters allegedly funneled money illegally into \nthe National Council of Senior Citizens, which then arranged to hire \ndirect mailing firms whose president applied a portion of the money \nreceived to the campaign for the presidency of the Teamsters Union.\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\n  Money, of course, is fungible, but one has to presume that some of \nthe operating dollars was being used by the National Council of Senior \nCitizens to float this exercise with the Teamsters Union. You explain \nto me why funds which are supposed to be flowing to benefit seniors \ngetting jobs are flowing to get the president of the Teamsters Union \nelected president of the Teamsters Union. Explain that to us and tell \nus that we, as a Senate, justify allowing this to happen. It is pretty \nhard to explain.\n  Is that their only illegal campaign activity? No, it is not. In yet \nanother instance involving the same organization, the Federal Election \nCommission conducted an investigation of the National Council of Senior \nCitizens, and as part of the complaint filed relating to the 1994 \nVirginia Senate race, that investigation resulted in the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens admitting that they had violated the law, \nand I believe they actually paid a fine as a result of violating an \nelection campaign law.\n  These election violations involved paying for publications \nspecifically endorsing candidates, making illegal corporate advances, \nand coordinating activities of political candidates.\n  This, by the way, is an organization which gets a majority of its \nfunding or has traditionally gotten a majority of its funding, as a \nresult of an entitlement to tax dollars, the purpose of those tax \ndollars being to hire senior citizens to give them work so they can \nhave a better lifestyle.\n  So one would guess that maybe--this is only a guess or a projection--\nmaybe some of that contingency fund, otherwise known as a slush fund \nthat the IG found was used at least potentially, because money is \nfungible, be exchanged with the dollars which were being used, in the \nFEC's opinion, in violation of campaign financing, and in opinion of \nthe U.S. attorney for the district of New York for the purposes of \nbeing an unindicted co-conspirator in the election of the president of \nthe Teamsters Union, who later lost his election. He won the election, \nbut it was sort of one of those elections that was thrown out because \nthere was so much inappropriateness about it; and he was found to have \nviolated the law in that election as did a number of other individuals.\n  So this organization has a pretty sour--and ``poor'' would be \ngenerous--track record on the management and use of the funds which \nflowed to it as an entitlement under title V.\n  Does my language specifically say this organization gets defunded? \nNo, it does not. I would certainly hope there would be a conclusion by \nthe Department of Labor that this sort of action was intolerable and \nthat tax dollars should not be used in this way. They should not be \nused to create slush funds. They should not be used to fund liability \nin health insurance corporations which are closely connected to the \nmanagement of the group that is paying for them. They should not be \nused in a mismanaged way, as the IG has found. I would certainly hope \nthat.\n  But my amendment does not specifically say the National Council of \nSenior Citizens, which has now been renamed--I always forget its new \nname, but I guess it is changing its name again anyway. It changes its \nname a lot. I can't, quite honestly, understand why they did that. They \nare going to change its name again and are going to be absorbed into \nthe AFL-CIO, which is the original creator of the organization.\n  The National Senior Citizens Education and Research Center --the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens--which will soon be an AFL arm, \nthat the organization should lose its funding and that those funds \nshould be made available to other agencies which are doing the job \nright, does my amendment say that has to happen? No, it does not.\n  What my amendment says is this. I will run through it. Basically, it \nboils down to saying we should manage these Federal resources in the \nway they are intended; that we should manage them for the purposes of \ngiving senior citizens jobs, and making sure the people who are \nresponsible for giving them jobs are responsible organizations. That is \nessentially what my amendment does.\n  Let me run through the specifics so people understand this is a \nreasonably benign amendment. I do not know why it has been resisted. I \nfind the resistance, in light of what the National Council of Senior \nCitizens has done--in fact, we have a track record of an agency that \nhas clearly misused funds-- highly inappropriate.\n\n  But in the first part of my amendment, basically, I take the \nresponsibility tests section of the present bill, and I add to them \nlanguage which says, first, there must be proven ability of the agency \nwhich is getting these entitlement dollars from the Federal Government \nto do the job of delivering a senior citizen employment program. There \nis nothing unreasonable about that.\n  Second, we say the Secretary must do a timely review of each agency \nto determine that they have the capacity to do the job they claim they \nare going to do.\n  There is a problem here in that sometimes these----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend?\n  We have an order to go to morning business until noon.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the request?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nunder this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say to my \nfriend from New Hampshire, we have had a number of people lined up \nsince yesterday to speak in this period of time.\n  Does the Senator have an idea how long he wants to speak on his \nstatement?\n  Mr. GREGG. My statement will go for about another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair, and I especially thank the Senator from \nNevada for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed.\n  Anyway, the first section goes to requiring proven ability.\n  The second section requires that there be timely reviews and that \nthere be no disruption of service. In other words, I do not want \nseniors losing their jobs because the agency has come in and said that \nsomebody has been misusing their funds.\n  Thirdly, we make it clear that in three major areas if you are found \nto be in violation of the responsibility test, you lose your funding if \nthe Department of Labor decides to do that.\n  The first two are already in the bill: fraud and debts after three \ndemand letters. The third one, which I am putting in, is:\n\n       Established misuse of funds, including the use of funds to \n     lobby or litigate against any Federal entity or official or \n     to provide compensation for any lobbying or litigation \n     activity identified by the Secretary, independent Inspector \n     General audits, or other official inquiries or [audits] by \n     the Federal Government.\n\n  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we basically lower the hold \nharmless from 5 percent to 2 percent.\n  Lastly--and I think equally importantly--we put in a competition \nclause so if it is determined that one of these agencies does not \nqualify, is misusing funds, or has acted fraudulently, then the funds \ncan be competed out.\n  We also make it clear that the Department of Labor can use some of \nthe extra money which they retained from this program for the purposes \nof auditing programs to make sure they are being done correctly.\n  The important point here is this. I am not suggesting anything \nradical. I am not suggesting anything even remotely outrageous or \nexcessive. All I am saying is, let's, under this responsibility test, \nhave some teeth. Let's make it possible for the Department of Labor to \ncome in, and when they find that a group has been acting \ninappropriately with these funds, misusing these funds, let's give them \nthe authority they need to take action. They may not take action, but \nlet's at least give them the authority to do that.\n\n  Under the present responsibility test, and the time constraints, and \nthe bureaucracy, it is 3 years, at a minimum, before they could take \naction--3 years for the National Council of Senior Citizens; that is \n$64 million a year, almost $200 million of taxpayer money being \nmisused.\n  We have already had audits which establish beyond a question that one\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nagency has acted inappropriately and has misused the funds. It is \nappropriate we give the Department of Labor the authority to act, so if \nthey determine that, they can take action to make sure the money ends \nup where it is supposed to be, which is in the pockets of seniors who \ndeserve to have jobs and need those jobs for a better lifestyle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on October 17, 1997, 28-year-old Lisa Black, \na registered nurse from Reno, Nevada, was nursing a man in the terminal \nstages of AIDS when a needle containing his blood punctured her skin.\n  Today, Lisa Black is infected with Hepatitis C and HIV.\n  She must take 22 pills a day to keep her HIV infection from \nprogressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects of Hepatitis C.\n  Karen Daley, a nurse for over 20 years and President of the \nMassachusetts Nurses Association, sustained a needlestick injury when \nshe reached her gloved hand into a needle box to dispose of the needle \nwith which she had drawn blood.\n  Karen Daley did everything in her power and took all the necessary \nprecautions--including wearing gloves and following proper procedures--\nto reduce her risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Her injury did \nnot occur because she was careless or distracted or not paying \nattention to what she was doing.\n  Karen Daley has good reason to believe that had a safer needle and \ndisposal system been in place at her hospital, she would not be sick \ntoday. According to the CDC, eighty percent of all needlestick injuries \ncan be prevented through the use of safer needles.\n  I am pleased that today we are passing bipartisan legislation--the \nNeedlestick Worker Safety and Prevention Act--that will help reduce the \nincidence of needlestick injuries and illnesses, like those sustained \nby Karen Daley and Lisa Black.\n  The Health Care Worker Safety and Prevention Act will strengthen the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) standard on \nbloodborne pathogens to encourage greater utilization of newer, safer \ndevices in health facilities. It will require the involvement of \nworkers who provide direct patient care in determining which safer \nneedles and sharps to use in the workplace and a more consistent \ndocumentation of all needlestick injuries.\n  I would like to thank Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, and Enzi as well as \nRepresentatives Ballenger and Owens for their commitment to this \nlegislation. I am pleased that we were able to come together across \nparty lines to protect the health and safety of our front-line health \ncare workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Enzi, \nand Senator Reid for their effective work on this important \nlegislation. And I also commend the American Nurses Association, the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International \nUnion and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and \nMunicipal Employees for their effective efforts in supporting it.\n  Needle stick protection is vitally important to health care \nprofessionals and to the many others who come in contact with them. \nLast year, as many as 800,000 health care professionals suffered needle \nstick injuries. Over 1,000 health care workers were infected with \nserious diseases, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.\n  These injuries were preventable, and because of this bill, many \nfuture needle stick injuries will be prevented. The Center for Disease \nPrevention estimates that this bill will reduce needle stick injuries \nby as much as 88 percent.\n  But numbers alone cannot convey the human tragedy of these injuries. \nOne of my constituents, Karen Daley of Boston, is the President of the \nMassachusetts Nurses Association and was a registered nurse, a job she \nloved and found very fulfilling. In January 1999, while on duty in an \nemergency room in Boston, Karen was accidentally stuck by a \ncontaminated needle. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and \nHepatitis C. Fortunately, Karen is in reasonably good health today, \nalthough she may never again be able to practice her chosen profession \nof nursing.\n  The Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act will help prevent tragic \naccidents like Karen Daley's. This bill requires employers to use, \nwhere appropriate, safety-designed needles and other sharp devices to \nreduce the potential transmission of disease to health care workers and \npatients. It is not enough to rely solely on one type of control, such \nas disposable needles and other equipment, when safer, appropriate \nmedical devices are available and can be effective in reducing the risk \nof contaminated needle injuries.\n  This bill also provides that employers must establish an injury log \nto record the kind of devices, and the location, of all needle stick \naccidents.\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nThis information must be considered when determining appropriate \ndevices to be used.\n  This bill strikes a critical balance between the reasoned judgment of \nhealth care professionals on patient safety and OSHA's responsibility \nto protect the health and safety of employees. The bill also provides \nthat non-managerial employees and their representatives--those on the \nfront lines of service delivery--must participate in determining the \nappropriate devices used in health care settings. Nothing in this bill \nwould justify the establishment of an employer-dominated labor \norganization or the bypassing of a collective bargaining representative \nin violation of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to speak today at the \npassage of H.R. 5178, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. By \npassing this bill, we ensure a safer workplace for the men and women \nwho perform the valuable service of taking care of the people of this \ncountry. The bi-partisan nature of this bill is a testament to the \nimportance of the problem we have addressed and the fairness and \nreasonableness of the solution. I want to commend the hard work of my \ncolleagues Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Reid and their staff in \ncrafting this solution. I also want to recognize the efforts of my \nHouse colleagues, Representatives Ballenger and Owens and their staff. \nThis truly was a bipartisan and bicameral effort and it is a wonderful \nexample of what we can accomplish when we all work together.\n  We came together over this bill to address the convergence of \nincreased concern over accidental needlestick injuries in health care \nsettings (``needlesticks'' is a term used broadly, as health care \nworkers can suffer injuries from a broad array of ``sharps'' used in \nhealth care settings, from needles to IV catheters to lancets) with the \ntechnological advancements made over the past decade in the many types \nof engineering controls that can be used in the workplace to help \nprotect health care workers against sharps injuries. We responded to \nthese two factors by drafting a bill that highlights the importance of \nusing newer, safer technologies but also allows health care employers \nthe flexibility to choose the technology that provides the best \nprotection under the circumstances. I have further elaborated on my \nviews on the substance of this legislation in the Joint Statement of \nLegislative Intent, submitted with the legislation.\n  The passage of this bill today is extremely significant on several \nlevels. First and foremost, this bill will save lives because fewer \nhealth care workers will contract deadly diseases from accidental \nneedlesticks. Almost equally as important, it will also reduce the \nnumber of health care workers who are forced to suffer the living hell \nof not knowing whether they contracted a deadly disease after a \ncontaminated needlestick. The health care workers on the front lines in \nhospitals, clinics, and other locations are absolutely critical to this \ncountry and I hope this bill will provide some peace of mind to these \nindividuals.\n  Finally, I want to reiterate the significance of the bipartisan and \nbicameral nature of this legislation. I believe this bill brings \nemployers and employees together to improve safety in the workplace and \nI hope to be able to work with my co-sponsors and my colleagues in the \nHouse on more such measures in the future.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude and \ndelight because of the successful outcome of a bipartisan, bicameral \neffort to protect the health of those who protect the health of others. \nI speak, of course, of our nation's health care workers, who dedicate \ntheir lives to caring for others. And I am gratified because today we \nhave enacted legislation, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, \nwhich addresses an important health issue threatening our nation's care \ngivers.\n  In March of this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimated that more than 380,000 percutaneous injuries from \ncontaminated sharps occur annually among health care workers in United \nStates hospitals. Estimates for all health care settings are that \n600,000 to 800,000 needlestick and other percutaneous injuries occur \nannually. Due to these injuries, numerous health care workers have \ncontracted fatal or other serious viruses and diseases, including the \nhuman immunodeficiency virus, (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\n  The statistics paint a bleak picture, but there is hope. There has \nbeen an explosion of technological development, resulting in a \nsubstantial increase in the number and assortment of new, and much \nsafer, medical devices, such as needleless systems, retractable \nneedles, and syringes with needle guards or sheaths. The legislation \nthat we have passed today will require employers to identify, evaluate, \nand make use of these devices. As a result, lives will be saved.\n  This bipartisan success resulted from a shared concern about this \nhealth hazard, and a shared belief of how to resolve it, among myself, \nand Senators Enzi, Kennedy and Reid. I must also thank our dedicated \nstaffs, and also Representatives Cass Ballenger, and Major Owens, and \ntheir staffs. Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Reid, and I have also worked \ntogether on a Joint Statement of Legislative Intent. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Congressional Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from Charles N. Jeffress, Assistant \nSecretary for Occupational Safety and Health, to Senator Jim Bunning, \nand a letter from Representatives Ballenger and Owens, addressed to me, \nbe made a part of the Record.\n  I thank all my colleagues who have joined in helping to adopt this \nimportant legislation. It is a vital step in ensuring worker safety in \nhealth care settings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Joint Statement of Legislative Intent on H.R. 5178\n\n       The legislation derives from the convergence of two \n     critical circumstances which have a profound effect on the \n     safety of health care workers in the United States. The first \n     circumstance is the increased concern over accidental \n     needlestick injuries in health care settings. \n     ``Needlesticks'' is a term used broadly, as health care \n     workers can suffer injuries from a broad array of ``sharps'' \n     used in health care settings, from needles to IV catheters to \n     lancets. The second circumstance is the technological \n     advancements made over the past decade in the many types of \n     engineering controls that can be used in the workplace to \n     help protect health care workers against sharps injuries. \n     Because of the convergence of these two circumstances--and \n     because of increasing concern over the public health issue \n     related to the spread of hepatitis C, it is appropriate to \n     take this action at this time.\n       Section 1 of the Bill provides the title the ``Needlestick \n     Safety and Prevention Act.'' Section 2 of the bill provides \n     the Congressional findings.\n       Section 3 of the bill directly modifies the Bloodborne \n     Pathogens Standard, 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030, one of the \n     health and safety standards promulgated by the Department of \n     Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). \n     The legislation builds on the most recent action taken by \n     OSHA related to the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard--the \n     revision in November 1999 to OSHA's Compliance Directive on \n     Enforcement Procedures for the Occupational Exposure to \n     Bloodborne Pathogens (``Compliance Directive'').\n       In modifying the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (``BBP \n     standard'') this bill makes narrowly-tailored changes to the \n     BBP standard. It makes clear in the BBP standard the \n     direction already provided by OSHA in its Compliance \n     Directive: namely, that employers who have employees with \n     occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens must consider \n     and, where appropriate, use effective engineering controls, \n     including safer medical devices, in order to reduce the risk \n     of injury from needlesticks and from other sharp medical \n     instruments (``sharps''). This bill is not intended to change \n     the existing application of OSHA's BBP standard to all \n     employees who are reasonably anticipated to have occupational \n     exposures to blood or other potentially infectious materials, \n     including health care workers, laboratory personnel, \n     housekeepers and waste disposal employees, among others.\n       The bill accomplishes this in several ways. First, the BBP \n     standard is modified so that the definition of ``engineering \n     controls'' at 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030(b) includes as \n     additional examples of such controls, ``safer medical \n     devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections and needleless systems.'' Following that step, \n     the BBP standard is amended so that both ``sharps with \n     engineered sharps injury protections'' (``SESIPS'') and \n     ``needleless systems'' are added to the definitions of the \n     standard.\n       The citing of these examples should not be considered an \n     endorsement or preference of a specific product or assurance \n     of a specific\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\n     product's effectiveness. Rather, it is the intent of this \n     legislation to reflect innovation and evolving technology in \n     the marketplace, in particular development in safer medical \n     devices such as SESIPS and needleless systems. This \n     legislation anticipates that hospitals and other employers, \n     in crafting their Exposure Control Plans, will adopt \n     procedures and use devices that have been proven to reduce \n     the risk of needlestick injuries. Employers use their \n     Exposure Control Plans to evaluate appropriate practices and \n     devices for reducing occupational exposure. To focus \n     attention on the need for employers to look at changes in \n     technology, this legislation further modifies the BBP \n     standard by adding to the existing requirements concerning \n     Exposure Control Plans at 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030(c)(1)(iv). \n     Through these modifications, employers will be required to \n     demonstrate in the review and update of their Exposure \n     Control Plans that their Exposure Control Plans reflect \n     changes in technology and also that they document annually \n     the consideration and implementation of appropriate, \n     commercially available and effective safer medical devices.\n       It is through an employer's Exposure Control Plan that \n     engineering controls, including safer medical devices, are \n     considered and deployed in the workplace. It is not the \n     intent of this legislation to disturb OSHA's existing \n     determination that to the extent that specific types of \n     devices, such as catheter securement devices or sharps \n     destruction devices can reduce the risk of needlestick \n     injuries, such devices could be appropriate components of an \n     employer's comprehensive exposure control plan. OSHA \n     expressed its understanding of and agreement with this intent \n     in a letter to Senator Jim Bunning, dated October 13, 2000. \n     The letter is submitted as an attachment to this joint \n     statement.\n       It is also not the intent of this legislation to disturb \n     the underlying flexible, performance-oriented nature of the \n     Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. For example, this \n     legislation's reference to the consideration and \n     implementation of safer medical devices is hinged upon the \n     ``appropriateness'' and the ``commercial availability'' of \n     such devices. Finally, while this may be stating the obvious, \n     it is not the intent of this legislation, nor for that matter \n     of the current Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, for employers \n     to implement use of any engineering control, including a \n     safer medical device, in any situation where it may \n     jeopardize a patient's safety, an employee's safety or where \n     it may be medically contraindicated. Moreover, all of the \n     affirmative defenses available to an employer under the \n     current BBP standard remain intact with this legislation. It \n     is not the intent of this legislation to alter OSHA's current \n     enforcement of the BBP standard in these circumstances. \n     Attached to this Joint Statement is a letter from \n     Representatives Ballenger and Owens, the co-sponsors of H.R. \n     5178, expressing their full support for the views expressed \n     in this statement.\n       The drafters are aware that some of the newer most \n     effective technologies are more expensive than others and may \n     create higher costs for health care facilities. Because some \n     entities largely dependent on Medicare and/or Medicaid, such \n     as long term care providers, will be required to comply with \n     this legislation, we encourage the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to examine the costs of the new technologies \n     and consider these costs when determining \n     Medicare reimbursement rates. Similarly, we hope that the \n     states will examine these costs and determine whether the \n     costs should be reflected in the Medicaid reimbursement \n     rates.\n       Section 3 of the bill amends the BBP standard in two \n     additional ways. First, it adds a requirement that in \n     addition to the recordkeeping requirements already found in \n     the BBP standard, employers must record percutaneous injuries \n     from contaminated sharps in a sharps injury log. The \n     legislation sets out the minimum information to be included \n     in such a log, namely the type of device used, an explanation \n     of the incident, and where the injury occurred. Employers are \n     free to include other information should they find it \n     helpful. However, this legislation does require that in \n     recording the information and maintaining the log, the \n     confidentiality of the injured employee is to be protected.\n       The requirement for a sharps injury log is consistent with \n     current OSHA recordkeeping in two specific ways. First, the \n     sharps injury log requirement does not apply to any employer \n     who is not already required to maintain a log of occupational \n     injuries and illnesses under 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1904. Second, \n     employers are not required to maintain the sharps injury logs \n     for a period of time beyond that currently required for the \n     OSHA 200 logs.\n       The sharps injury log is to be used as a tool for employers \n     so that they may determine their high risk areas for sharps \n     injuries and use it as a means to evaluate particular devices \n     that may or may not be effective in reducing sharps injuries. \n     At a House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections hearing in \n     June, representatives of the American Hospital Association \n     testified that many health care settings, particularly \n     hospitals, already have in place some type of ``surveillance \n     system'' for tracking needlestick and other sharps injuries. \n     The AHA witness noted that hospitals have found this to be an \n     effective tool to provide necessary information to help \n     reduce such injuries.\n       The second way in which Section 3 amends the BBP standard \n     is by specifying that employers must solicit input from non-\n     managerial employees responsible for direct patient care who \n     are potentially exposed to injuries from contaminated sharps \n     in the identification, evaluation and selection of effective \n     engineering and work practice controls. Employers are also to \n     document this in the Exposure Control Plans. The intent of \n     this section is simple--to involve in the selection of \n     engineering controls those workers who are potentially \n     exposed to needlestick injuries.\n       Section 4 of the legislation explains that the \n     modifications as delineated by Section 3 of the bill can be \n     changed by a future rulemaking by OSHA on the Bloodborne \n     Pathogens Standard.\n       Finally, Section 5 of the bill directs that the \n     modifications to the BBP standard are to be made without \n     regard to the standard OSHA rulemaking requirements or the \n     requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. \n     Admittedly, preemption of the OSHA rulemaking procedures is \n     not an action to be undertaken lightly. Indeed, the \n     requirements of this bill are driven by the unique \n     circumstances surrounding this narrow and particular public \n     health issue. Although there is no such thing as binding \n     precedent for Congress, it is not the intent of this \n     legislation, through the process used here, to diminish the \n     carefully constructed requirements and procedures for OSHA \n     rulemaking.\n       The legislation does prescribe, however, that the changes \n     to the BBP standard are to be made by the Secretary of Labor \n     and published in the Federal Register within six months of \n     enactment and that the changes will take effect 90 days after \n     such publication.\n       Submitted October 25, 2000.\n       James M.

Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bunning: Thank you for your inquiry regarding \n     OSHA's enforcement of the bloodborne pathogens standard and \n     the effect of OSHA's November 1999 Compliance Directive on \n     Enforcement Procedures on Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne \n     Pathogens.\n       OSHA has long required employers to protect employees from \n     exposure to bloodborne pathogens through the use of \n     engineering controls, which include sharps disposal devices \n     such as sharps destruction devices. To the extent that \n     specific types of engineering controls such as sharps \n     destruction devices can reduce the risk of needlestick \n     injuries, such controls could be appropriate components of an \n     employer's comprehensive exposure control plan. OSHA has \n     allowed, and intends to continue to allow, employers to use \n     sharps destruction devices to help reduce the risk of \n     needlestick injuries in appropriate circumstances, as set \n     forth in OSHA's November 1999 Compliance Directive.\n       It is my understanding that S. 3067, like the House \n     companion bill, is entirely compatible with and closely \n     tracks the language of OSHA's November 1999 Compliance \n     Directive and will not change in any way OSHA's treatment of \n     needle destruction devices or OSHA's enforcement of the \n     bloodborne pathogens standard's obligation that employers use \n     engineering controls.\n       I hope that this letter is responsive to your inquiry. \n     Thank you for your interest in occupational safety and \n     health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles N.

We appreciate your sharing \n     with us the Senate Joint Statement of Legislative Intent and \n     want to express our full support for the views expressed in \n     the Senate statement. We want to reiterate that it is not the \n     intent of this legislation to alter OSHA's current \n     enforcement of the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cass Ballenger,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.\n     Major R. Owens,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5178) was read the third time and passed.\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11041-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11041-S11044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEEDLESTICK SAFETY AND PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on October 17, 1997, 28-year-old Lisa Black, \na registered nurse from Reno, Nevada, was nursing a man in the terminal \nstages of AIDS when a needle containing his blood punctured her skin.\n  Today, Lisa Black is infected with Hepatitis C and HIV.\n  She must take 22 pills a day to keep her HIV infection from \nprogressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects of Hepatitis C.\n  Karen Daley, a nurse for over 20 years and President of the \nMassachusetts Nurses Association, sustained a needlestick injury when \nshe reached her gloved hand into a needle box to dispose of the needle \nwith which she had drawn blood.\n  Karen Daley did everything in her power and took all the necessary \nprecautions--including wearing gloves and following proper procedures--\nto reduce her risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Her injury did \nnot occur because she was careless or distracted or not paying \nattention to what she was doing.\n  Karen Daley has good reason to believe that had a safer needle and \ndisposal system been in place at her hospital, she would not be sick \ntoday. According to the CDC, eighty percent of all needlestick injuries \ncan be prevented through the use of safer needles.\n  I am pleased that today we are passing bipartisan legislation--the \nNeedlestick Worker Safety and Prevention Act--that will help reduce the \nincidence of needlestick injuries and illnesses, like those sustained \nby Karen Daley and Lisa Black.\n  The Health Care Worker Safety and Prevention Act will strengthen the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) standard on \nbloodborne pathogens to encourage greater utilization of newer, safer \ndevices in health facilities. It will require the involvement of \nworkers who provide direct patient care in determining which safer \nneedles and sharps to use in the workplace and a more consistent \ndocumentation of all needlestick injuries.\n  I would like to thank Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, and Enzi as well as \nRepresentatives Ballenger and Owens for their commitment to this \nlegislation. I am pleased that we were able to come together across \nparty lines to protect the health and safety of our front-line health \ncare workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Enzi, \nand Senator Reid for their effective work on this important \nlegislation. And I also commend the American Nurses Association, the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International \nUnion and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and \nMunicipal Employees for their effective efforts in supporting it.\n  Needle stick protection is vitally important to health care \nprofessionals and to the many others who come in contact with them. \nLast year, as many as 800,000 health care professionals suffered needle \nstick injuries. Over 1,000 health care workers were infected with \nserious diseases, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.\n  These injuries were preventable, and because of this bill, many \nfuture needle stick injuries will be prevented. The Center for Disease \nPrevention estimates that this bill will reduce needle stick injuries \nby as much as 88 percent.\n  But numbers alone cannot convey the human tragedy of these injuries. \nOne of my constituents, Karen Daley of Boston, is the President of the \nMassachusetts Nurses Association and was a registered nurse, a job she \nloved and found very fulfilling. In January 1999, while on duty in an \nemergency room in Boston, Karen was accidentally stuck by a \ncontaminated needle. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and \nHepatitis C. Fortunately, Karen is in reasonably good health today, \nalthough she may never again be able to practice her chosen profession \nof nursing.\n  The Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act will help prevent tragic \naccidents like Karen Daley's. This bill requires employers to use, \nwhere appropriate, safety-designed needles and other sharp devices to \nreduce the potential transmission of disease to health care workers and \npatients. It is not enough to rely solely on one type of control, such \nas disposable needles and other equipment, when safer, appropriate \nmedical devices are available and can be effective in reducing the risk \nof contaminated needle injuries.\n  This bill also provides that employers must establish an injury log \nto record the kind of devices, and the location, of all needle stick \naccidents.\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nThis information must be considered when determining appropriate \ndevices to be used.\n  This bill strikes a critical balance between the reasoned judgment of \nhealth care professionals on patient safety and OSHA's responsibility \nto protect the health and safety of employees. The bill also provides \nthat non-managerial employees and their representatives--those on the \nfront lines of service delivery--must participate in determining the \nappropriate devices used in health care settings. Nothing in this bill \nwould justify the establishment of an employer-dominated labor \norganization or the bypassing of a collective bargaining representative \nin violation of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to speak today at the \npassage of H.R. 5178, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. By \npassing this bill, we ensure a safer workplace for the men and women \nwho perform the valuable service of taking care of the people of this \ncountry. The bi-partisan nature of this bill is a testament to the \nimportance of the problem we have addressed and the fairness and \nreasonableness of the solution. I want to commend the hard work of my \ncolleagues Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and Reid and their staff in \ncrafting this solution. I also want to recognize the efforts of my \nHouse colleagues, Representatives Ballenger and Owens and their staff. \nThis truly was a bipartisan and bicameral effort and it is a wonderful \nexample of what we can accomplish when we all work together.\n  We came together over this bill to address the convergence of \nincreased concern over accidental needlestick injuries in health care \nsettings (``needlesticks'' is a term used broadly, as health care \nworkers can suffer injuries from a broad array of ``sharps'' used in \nhealth care settings, from needles to IV catheters to lancets) with the \ntechnological advancements made over the past decade in the many types \nof engineering controls that can be used in the workplace to help \nprotect health care workers against sharps injuries. We responded to \nthese two factors by drafting a bill that highlights the importance of \nusing newer, safer technologies but also allows health care employers \nthe flexibility to choose the technology that provides the best \nprotection under the circumstances. I have further elaborated on my \nviews on the substance of this legislation in the Joint Statement of \nLegislative Intent, submitted with the legislation.\n  The passage of this bill today is extremely significant on several \nlevels. First and foremost, this bill will save lives because fewer \nhealth care workers will contract deadly diseases from accidental \nneedlesticks. Almost equally as important, it will also reduce the \nnumber of health care workers who are forced to suffer the living hell \nof not knowing whether they contracted a deadly disease after a \ncontaminated needlestick. The health care workers on the front lines in \nhospitals, clinics, and other locations are absolutely critical to this \ncountry and I hope this bill will provide some peace of mind to these \nindividuals.\n  Finally, I want to reiterate the significance of the bipartisan and \nbicameral nature of this legislation. I believe this bill brings \nemployers and employees together to improve safety in the workplace and \nI hope to be able to work with my co-sponsors and my colleagues in the \nHouse on more such measures in the future.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude and \ndelight because of the successful outcome of a bipartisan, bicameral \neffort to protect the health of those who protect the health of others. \nI speak, of course, of our nation's health care workers, who dedicate \ntheir lives to caring for others. And I am gratified because today we \nhave enacted legislation, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, \nwhich addresses an important health issue threatening our nation's care \ngivers.\n  In March of this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimated that more than 380,000 percutaneous injuries from \ncontaminated sharps occur annually among health care workers in United \nStates hospitals. Estimates for all health care settings are that \n600,000 to 800,000 needlestick and other percutaneous injuries occur \nannually. Due to these injuries, numerous health care workers have \ncontracted fatal or other serious viruses and diseases, including the \nhuman immunodeficiency virus, (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\n  The statistics paint a bleak picture, but there is hope. There has \nbeen an explosion of technological development, resulting in a \nsubstantial increase in the number and assortment of new, and much \nsafer, medical devices, such as needleless systems, retractable \nneedles, and syringes with needle guards or sheaths. The legislation \nthat we have passed today will require employers to identify, evaluate, \nand make use of these devices. As a result, lives will be saved.\n  This bipartisan success resulted from a shared concern about this \nhealth hazard, and a shared belief of how to resolve it, among myself, \nand Senators Enzi, Kennedy and Reid. I must also thank our dedicated \nstaffs, and also Representatives Cass Ballenger, and Major Owens, and \ntheir staffs. Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Reid, and I have also worked \ntogether on a Joint Statement of Legislative Intent. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Congressional Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from Charles N. Jeffress, Assistant \nSecretary for Occupational Safety and Health, to Senator Jim Bunning, \nand a letter from Representatives Ballenger and Owens, addressed to me, \nbe made a part of the Record.\n  I thank all my colleagues who have joined in helping to adopt this \nimportant legislation. It is a vital step in ensuring worker safety in \nhealth care settings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Joint Statement of Legislative Intent on H.R. 5178\n\n       The legislation derives from the convergence of two \n     critical circumstances which have a profound effect on the \n     safety of health care workers in the United States. The first \n     circumstance is the increased concern over accidental \n     needlestick injuries in health care settings. \n     ``Needlesticks'' is a term used broadly, as health care \n     workers can suffer injuries from a broad array of ``sharps'' \n     used in health care settings, from needles to IV catheters to \n     lancets. The second circumstance is the technological \n     advancements made over the past decade in the many types of \n     engineering controls that can be used in the workplace to \n     help protect health care workers against sharps injuries. \n     Because of the convergence of these two circumstances--and \n     because of increasing concern over the public health issue \n     related to the spread of hepatitis C, it is appropriate to \n     take this action at this time.\n       Section 1 of the Bill provides the title the ``Needlestick \n     Safety and Prevention Act.'' Section 2 of the bill provides \n     the Congressional findings.\n       Section 3 of the bill directly modifies the Bloodborne \n     Pathogens Standard, 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030, one of the \n     health and safety standards promulgated by the Department of \n     Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). \n     The legislation builds on the most recent action taken by \n     OSHA related to the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard--the \n     revision in November 1999 to OSHA's Compliance Directive on \n     Enforcement Procedures for the Occupational Exposure to \n     Bloodborne Pathogens (``Compliance Directive'').\n       In modifying the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (``BBP \n     standard'') this bill makes narrowly-tailored changes to the \n     BBP standard. It makes clear in the BBP standard the \n     direction already provided by OSHA in its Compliance \n     Directive: namely, that employers who have employees with \n     occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens must consider \n     and, where appropriate, use effective engineering controls, \n     including safer medical devices, in order to reduce the risk \n     of injury from needlesticks and from other sharp medical \n     instruments (``sharps''). This bill is not intended to change \n     the existing application of OSHA's BBP standard to all \n     employees who are reasonably anticipated to have occupational \n     exposures to blood or other potentially infectious materials, \n     including health care workers, laboratory personnel, \n     housekeepers and waste disposal employees, among others.\n       The bill accomplishes this in several ways. First, the BBP \n     standard is modified so that the definition of ``engineering \n     controls'' at 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030(b) includes as \n     additional examples of such controls, ``safer medical \n     devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections and needleless systems.'' Following that step, \n     the BBP standard is amended so that both ``sharps with \n     engineered sharps injury protections'' (``SESIPS'') and \n     ``needleless systems'' are added to the definitions of the \n     standard.\n       The citing of these examples should not be considered an \n     endorsement or preference of a specific product or assurance \n     of a specific\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\n     product's effectiveness. Rather, it is the intent of this \n     legislation to reflect innovation and evolving technology in \n     the marketplace, in particular development in safer medical \n     devices such as SESIPS and needleless systems. This \n     legislation anticipates that hospitals and other employers, \n     in crafting their Exposure Control Plans, will adopt \n     procedures and use devices that have been proven to reduce \n     the risk of needlestick injuries. Employers use their \n     Exposure Control Plans to evaluate appropriate practices and \n     devices for reducing occupational exposure. To focus \n     attention on the need for employers to look at changes in \n     technology, this legislation further modifies the BBP \n     standard by adding to the existing requirements concerning \n     Exposure Control Plans at 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1910.1030(c)(1)(iv). \n     Through these modifications, employers will be required to \n     demonstrate in the review and update of their Exposure \n     Control Plans that their Exposure Control Plans reflect \n     changes in technology and also that they document annually \n     the consideration and implementation of appropriate, \n     commercially available and effective safer medical devices.\n       It is through an employer's Exposure Control Plan that \n     engineering controls, including safer medical devices, are \n     considered and deployed in the workplace. It is not the \n     intent of this legislation to disturb OSHA's existing \n     determination that to the extent that specific types of \n     devices, such as catheter securement devices or sharps \n     destruction devices can reduce the risk of needlestick \n     injuries, such devices could be appropriate components of an \n     employer's comprehensive exposure control plan. OSHA \n     expressed its understanding of and agreement with this intent \n     in a letter to Senator Jim Bunning, dated October 13, 2000. \n     The letter is submitted as an attachment to this joint \n     statement.\n       It is also not the intent of this legislation to disturb \n     the underlying flexible, performance-oriented nature of the \n     Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. For example, this \n     legislation's reference to the consideration and \n     implementation of safer medical devices is hinged upon the \n     ``appropriateness'' and the ``commercial availability'' of \n     such devices. Finally, while this may be stating the obvious, \n     it is not the intent of this legislation, nor for that matter \n     of the current Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, for employers \n     to implement use of any engineering control, including a \n     safer medical device, in any situation where it may \n     jeopardize a patient's safety, an employee's safety or where \n     it may be medically contraindicated. Moreover, all of the \n     affirmative defenses available to an employer under the \n     current BBP standard remain intact with this legislation. It \n     is not the intent of this legislation to alter OSHA's current \n     enforcement of the BBP standard in these circumstances. \n     Attached to this Joint Statement is a letter from \n     Representatives Ballenger and Owens, the co-sponsors of H.R. \n     5178, expressing their full support for the views expressed \n     in this statement.\n       The drafters are aware that some of the newer most \n     effective technologies are more expensive than others and may \n     create higher costs for health care facilities. Because some \n     entities largely dependent on Medicare and/or Medicaid, such \n     as long term care providers, will be required to comply with \n     this legislation, we encourage the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to examine the costs of the new technologies \n     and consider these costs when determining \n     Medicare reimbursement rates. Similarly, we hope that the \n     states will examine these costs and determine whether the \n     costs should be reflected in the Medicaid reimbursement \n     rates.\n       Section 3 of the bill amends the BBP standard in two \n     additional ways. First, it adds a requirement that in \n     addition to the recordkeeping requirements already found in \n     the BBP standard, employers must record percutaneous injuries \n     from contaminated sharps in a sharps injury log. The \n     legislation sets out the minimum information to be included \n     in such a log, namely the type of device used, an explanation \n     of the incident, and where the injury occurred. Employers are \n     free to include other information should they find it \n     helpful. However, this legislation does require that in \n     recording the information and maintaining the log, the \n     confidentiality of the injured employee is to be protected.\n       The requirement for a sharps injury log is consistent with \n     current OSHA recordkeeping in two specific ways. First, the \n     sharps injury log requirement does not apply to any employer \n     who is not already required to maintain a log of occupational \n     injuries and illnesses under 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1904. Second, \n     employers are not required to maintain the sharps injury logs \n     for a period of time beyond that currently required for the \n     OSHA 200 logs.\n       The sharps injury log is to be used as a tool for employers \n     so that they may determine their high risk areas for sharps \n     injuries and use it as a means to evaluate particular devices \n     that may or may not be effective in reducing sharps injuries. \n     At a House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections hearing in \n     June, representatives of the American Hospital Association \n     testified that many health care settings, particularly \n     hospitals, already have in place some type of ``surveillance \n     system'' for tracking needlestick and other sharps injuries. \n     The AHA witness noted that hospitals have found this to be an \n     effective tool to provide necessary information to help \n     reduce such injuries.\n       The second way in which Section 3 amends the BBP standard \n     is by specifying that employers must solicit input from non-\n     managerial employees responsible for direct patient care who \n     are potentially exposed to injuries from contaminated sharps \n     in the identification, evaluation and selection of effective \n     engineering and work practice controls. Employers are also to \n     document this in the Exposure Control Plans. The intent of \n     this section is simple--to involve in the selection of \n     engineering controls those workers who are potentially \n     exposed to needlestick injuries.\n       Section 4 of the legislation explains that the \n     modifications as delineated by Section 3 of the bill can be \n     changed by a future rulemaking by OSHA on the Bloodborne \n     Pathogens Standard.\n       Finally, Section 5 of the bill directs that the \n     modifications to the BBP standard are to be made without \n     regard to the standard OSHA rulemaking requirements or the \n     requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. \n     Admittedly, preemption of the OSHA rulemaking procedures is \n     not an action to be undertaken lightly. Indeed, the \n     requirements of this bill are driven by the unique \n     circumstances surrounding this narrow and particular public \n     health issue. Although there is no such thing as binding \n     precedent for Congress, it is not the intent of this \n     legislation, through the process used here, to diminish the \n     carefully constructed requirements and procedures for OSHA \n     rulemaking.\n       The legislation does prescribe, however, that the changes \n     to the BBP standard are to be made by the Secretary of Labor \n     and published in the Federal Register within six months of \n     enactment and that the changes will take effect 90 days after \n     such publication.\n       Submitted October 25, 2000.\n       James M.

Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bunning: Thank you for your inquiry regarding \n     OSHA's enforcement of the bloodborne pathogens standard and \n     the effect of OSHA's November 1999 Compliance Directive on \n     Enforcement Procedures on Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne \n     Pathogens.\n       OSHA has long required employers to protect employees from \n     exposure to bloodborne pathogens through the use of \n     engineering controls, which include sharps disposal devices \n     such as sharps destruction devices. To the extent that \n     specific types of engineering controls such as sharps \n     destruction devices can reduce the risk of needlestick \n     injuries, such controls could be appropriate components of an \n     employer's comprehensive exposure control plan. OSHA has \n     allowed, and intends to continue to allow, employers to use \n     sharps destruction devices to help reduce the risk of \n     needlestick injuries in appropriate circumstances, as set \n     forth in OSHA's November 1999 Compliance Directive.\n       It is my understanding that S. 3067, like the House \n     companion bill, is entirely compatible with and closely \n     tracks the language of OSHA's November 1999 Compliance \n     Directive and will not change in any way OSHA's treatment of \n     needle destruction devices or OSHA's enforcement of the \n     bloodborne pathogens standard's obligation that employers use \n     engineering controls.\n       I hope that this letter is responsive to your inquiry. \n     Thank you for your interest in occupational safety and \n     health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles N.

RICHARD H. BRYAN\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, within the next few days, I will cast my \nlast vote as a U.S. Senator, and by the end of this year, I will \nconclude 36 years of public experience.\n  Permit me to reflect for a moment on this experience and share with \nyou some observations.\n  The last decade of the 20th century has witnessed more change than \nany decade in human history. When I began my Senate service in January \nof 1989, the world was a very different place than it is today. The \nSoviet Union and the United States faced off in a cold war, a cold war \nthat dominated global politics from the end of World War II. The \nancient capitals of Eastern Europe were satellite appendages of the \nSoviet Union. There were two Germanys and a wall divided Berlin. The \neconomic pundits were telling us that the Japanese economic model \nrepresented the wave of the future, and it was feared that America was \nin decline.\n  All of that has changed. The Soviet Union has imploded. It no longer \nexists. Eastern Europe is no longer a series of satellite states of the \nSoviet Union, but nascent democracies are developing in most of eastern \nEurope. The Berlin Wall has come down. Germany is reunited. And once \nagain, Berlin is the capital of that country. The Japanese economy for \nthe past decade has remained largely stagnant. And here at home, \nAmerica enjoys the longest economic expansion in the Nation's history.\n  The way in which we live our day-to-day lives has experienced \ndramatic change as well, from the omnipresent cellular telephone to the \nadvent of the Internet and the world of e-commerce.\n  What about the Senate, this place where we spend our working hours. \nIt has seen much change as well: The great debate that proceeded a \nresolution of support for operation Desert Storm was in the finest \ntraditions of Webster and Calhoun--many have said that this was our \nfinest bipartisan hour--the unpleasant duty of sitting in judgment of a \nfellow colleague and ultimately rendering the appropriate judgment; and \nthe awesome responsibility of determining the fate of an American \nPresident, only the second Congress in our Nation's history to be so \ncharged.\n\n  There have been moments of inspiration as well. None of us will ever \nforget listening in those joint sessions of Congress to Lech Walesa, \nVaclav Havel share with us their struggle to achieve democracies in \ntheir own countries. The democratic spirit may be suppressed but never \nextinguished.\n  In the history of the Senate, there have been 1,581 men and women who \nhave served, only 23 of them from Nevada. It has been a great honor and \nprivilege for me to be one of those and to represent the State of \nNevada. How effectively I have discharged that responsibility awaits \nthe verdict of history.\n  As a youngster, I dreamed of serving as Governor of my own State. It \nwas my life goal. Serving in the Senate of the United States is like \nadding a little frosting to that cake.\n  I have thought often of my parents during these past 12 years. My \nfather, like so many Nevadans of his generation, came from a poor \nfamily. His dream was to become a lawyer. But America was gripped in a \ngreat depression. This city and the patronage of Nevada's Congressman \nJames Scrugham made it possible for him to achieve his goal. While \nattending law school in the Nation's Capital, he met my mother, a \nnative Virginian. The following year, I was born in this city. So in a \nsense, I have been here before.\n  I spoke about change a moment ago. The Senate today is a very \ndifferent institution than it was a decade ago; I fear in many respects \na diminished institution. Those of us who seek election to the Senate \ntoday frequently denigrate it and seek public favor by demeaning it. \nThis has taken a toll on the public esteem in which we are all held. A \nmedia that is appropriately critical of our shortcomings is not always \nable to find its voice in telling the American public of its successes. \nWe are more partisan, more polarized than we were a decade ago. And for \nsome, compromise has become a nasty word, forgetting our own heritage, \nbecause the Senate itself is a product of the great compromise of our \nConstitution--a Senate with equal representation for each State, and a \nHouse of Representatives based on population.\n  The role of money: Yes, it is fair to say that it has always been a \nfactor in American politics, but today it has become too much of a \ndominant force. It consumes more of our time. It drives our schedule. \nIt is a corrosive force that threatens to undermine public confidence \nin our institutions of government.\n  I believe there is a direct correlation between the decline of \ncitizen participation in government and voting, to the public \nperception that politics is all about money. Most Americans feel they \nare excluded from this process.\n  Perhaps less visible to the public, the rules which have served this \ninstitution so well for decades and which govern the way in which we \nprocess legislation have broken down.\n  There is much that I will miss: My colleagues, who represent a broad \nspectrum of political views, who bring their varied experience to the \nSenate, dedicated men and women who labor mightily on behalf of the \nconstituents they represent, most especially my senior colleague with \nwhom I have worked in this body, as well as the State legislature, and \non issues affecting the State of Nevada for the last 37 years.\n\n  My personal staff, both here in Washington and at home--I have simply \nloved our working relationship. It has been a joy for me to come to \nwork each morning. I have appreciated their hard work, the long hours, \nthe personal sacrifice. Nevadans have been well served by their \ndedication. Without their support, any success I might have had would \nnot have been possible.\n  The people who make our hectic lives a little more manageable--the \nelevator operators, the Capitol Police, the food servers, those who \nstaff the Cloakrooms, our floor staff and many, many others.\n  This building in which we work, so rich with the history of our \ncountry--there has not been a single day in the past 12 years that I \nhave not felt a sense of awe when coming to work.\n  And this city, with its magnificent cathedrals of governance that \nserve as the guardians of the American dream--I will miss that as well.\n  My wife joins me this morning in the gallery of this great Chamber. \nNothing I have been able to do, nothing I have been able to achieve, \nwould have been possible without her support, her personal sacrifice, \nand those of our three children, Richard, Leslie, and Blair, who have \nall been a part of my life and a part of public service in my life. \nWhatever I have become, whatever I am, is largely because of their \nsupport of my efforts to pursue my own dreams and goals.\n  I leave the Senate with a great sense of respect for this \ninstitution, which has been so much a part of my life for the past 12 \nyears. It is troubled in many ways, as I have said. However, none of \nthose problems is insurmountable. If we can resist the temptation to \nseek momentary partisan advantage, if we can restore civility in our \npublic discourse as we debate the great issues and policy differences \nof our time, if we can apply the rules that govern the process by which \nwe conduct the Senate's business fairly to all, and if we can work \ntogether for the common good, I am confident that the future of the \nSenate can be as bright as the past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for the last time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11044-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11044-S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR RICHARD BRYAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want to \nsay a couple things to him and have on the record of the Senate for the \nremainder of time of this Republic the fact that\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\nthe State of Nevada has had 23 Senators, and never in the history of \nthe State of Nevada on any level of government have there been two \nelected officials who have worked more closely together than Senators \nBryan and Reid.\n  We took the bar together in 1963. He then began service for a short \nperiod of time as a private attorney. Then he became a prosecuting \nattorney and then Nevada's first public defender. We went to the State \nlegislature together in 1967 where we were known as the ``gold dust \ntwins.'' We were the only two freshmen in that 60-body legislature. \nThat was the beginning of our love for the legislative process.\n  Senator Bryan went on to serve, after the Nevada Assembly, in the \nState senate, then to serve as attorney general of the State of Nevada, \nas Governor of Nevada, elected twice, and then he came to Washington as \na U.S. Senator. No one in the history of the State of Nevada has had \nsuch an electric and exciting political career as Senator Richard \nBryan. I feel so fortunate that this partnership we have developed over \nthe years is one we both feel good about.\n  As strong as the partnership is of Senators Reid and Bryan, as he \nmentioned, the knowledge that we in Nevada have as to the relationship \nof Richard and Bonnie Bryan is very significant. She literally has been \nwith him every step of the way. She was a wonderful first lady who is \nstill talked about as to her proficiency.\n  It is with a great deal of sadness that occasions such as this have \ncome since he announced his retirement. The first came when he \nannounced at a press conference in front of his alma mater, Las Vegas \nHigh School, he wasn't going to run anymore. I shed about all the tears \nI could on that occasion. I don't think I have shed any tears since \nthen publicly, but I have privately. My life will never be the same \nwithout Senator Richard Bryan working with me. We have had a wonderful \nrun. I hope that at least I can speak from his perspective that the \npeople of the State of Nevada have benefited as a result of his \nservice. He has done some wonderful things--helping local government in \nNevada, State government in Nevada, and helping people throughout \nAmerica, especially with his consumer advocacy.\n  So I wish there were something I could say that would translate into \nthe love and affection and admiration I have for Senator Bryan, but I \ncan't do that, other than to close by acknowledging our unique \nfriendship and the love we have for one another.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say that no one has really \nperformed more distinguished service than our colleague from Nevada, \nRichard Bryan. I have seen them all now over my 34 years. Senator Bryan \nhas judgment. It comes from his hard experience as a State's Governor, \nand it comes from a tremendous sense of history. I have always been \nimpressed with his fascinating knowledge of historical facts, and he \nbrings history into focus in regard to present-day realities. We are \ngoing to miss that. We are going to miss that here in the Senate. We \nare going to miss his charming wife Bonnie. We have worked with both of \nthem, traveled with both of them, and they have made a magnificent \ncontribution to the future of this country.\n  I have said time and again that, more than a balanced budget, what we \nneed is balanced Senators, balanced Congressmen. If anyone is one who \nis really balanced in his approach to the needs of the Nation and the \nway we go about doing our business here in the Senate, it is Richard \nBryan of Nevada. I didn't realize that was what we were going to have \nhere this morning, but I jump at the chance to say something about a \ndistinguished Senator such as Senator Bryan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11045-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11045-S11048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET FRUSTRATIONS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am going to go into my frustration \nthat, I take it, is well known. I am back almost like George Wallace \nsome 30 years ago when he said there wasn't a dime's worth of \ndifference. Both Republicans and Democrats pass these trade bills on \nthe premise that they are going to create jobs in America, when the \ntruth of the matter is they are going to create jobs outside of \nAmerica. We are going to transfer the fine, good manufacturing jobs \nfrom the United States--more or less the middle class of the country--\nto countries offshore and to Mexico and the Caribbean. Otherwise, we \nconstantly talk of saving Social Security--both Republicans and \nDemocrats--when the truth of the matter is we are squandering Social \nSecurity.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``Trust Funds \nLooted to Balance Budget.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                      [By fiscal year, in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 1999     2000     2001\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security..............................      855    1,009    1,175\nMedicare:\n  HI.........................................      154      176      198\n  SMI........................................       27       34       35\nMilitary Retirement..........................      141      149      157\nCivilian Retirement..........................      492      522      553\nUnemployment.................................       77       85       94\nHighway......................................       28       31       34\nAirport......................................       12       13       14\nRailroad Retirement..........................       24       25       26\nOther........................................       59       62       64\n                                              --------------------------\n      Total..................................    1,869    2,106    2,350\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows that last year--the year 2000--\nwe owed Social Security some $l.009 trillion. That is a significant \nfigure. The year before that--1999--we owed $855 billion. But you can \nsee it is jumping in increments of $150 billion.\n  These are the trust funds that we are borrowing from when they talk \nabout surplus, because both Republicans and Democrats are talking about \nthe surplus. Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are out on the \ncampaign trail talking about how we are going to spend the money.\n  Yesterday, in USA Today, the headline was ``Clinton announces record \n$237 billion surplus.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article and headline be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Clinton Announces Record $237B Surplus\n\n                          (By Jeannine Aversa)\n\n       Washington.--Flush with tax revenue from a booming economy, \n     the federal government posted a record $237 billion surplus \n     for the budget year that ended Sept. 30, the Clinton \n     administration announced Tuesday.\n       It marked the third straight year of surpluses, something \n     that hasn't happened since the late 1940s. Social Security \n     taxes provided nearly $150 billion of the surplus.\n       ``This is the third surplus in a row--the first time our \n     nation has done that in 51 years, since 1949, when Harry \n     Truman was president,'' Clinton said on the White House South \n     Lawn during an event to push his education initiatives.\n       Clinton said that in 1993, the federal deficit was $290 \n     billion, the national debt had quadrupled in 12 years and \n     economists predicted that this year, instead of a $237 \n     billion surplus, the United States would have a $455 billion \n     deficit.\n       Clinton then used the new surplus numbers to plug Vice \n     President Gore's bid for the presidency. ``Working together, \n     we turned that around--not by chance, but by choice,'' he \n     said. ``I believe we have to first stay with what got us \n     here--pay down the debt, strengthen the Social Security and \n     Medicare systems . . . and we need to then seize this \n     opportunity to take the money that's left to invest in our \n     future, especially education.''\n       The official announcement of the surplus came two weeks \n     before voters elect a new president. A major point of \n     contention between Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the \n     Republican nominee, has been what should be done with \n     surpluses that are projected to total $4.6 trillion over the \n     next decade.\n       Bush has proposed a $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut; \n     Gore has proposed smaller, targeted tax cuts and more \n     government spending.\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\n       The government's surplus for 2000 surpassed the record of \n     $124 billion for fiscal year 1999 and came on top of a $69.2 \n     billion surplus in fiscal year 1998.\n       The surplus in 1998 marked the first time the government \n     had managed to finish in the black since 1969.\n       The last time the government reported three consecutive \n     years of surpluses was in 1947, 1948 and 1949. The record-\n     breaking economy is in its longest-ever streak of \n     uninterrupted growth.\n       Americans are enjoying plentiful jobs, low inflation--\n     outside of the recent burst in energy prices--and rising \n     incomes. That prosperity also is helping to generate more tax \n     revenue, thanks to increases in both personal and corporate \n     incomes.\n       Economists say low unemployment has been one of the \n     cornerstones to the prosperity. The surging economy pulled \n     the nation's unemployment rate back down to a three-decade \n     low of 3.9% in September from an already low 4.1% in August.\n       Last month, Clinton had estimated a surplus of around $230 \n     billion for the recently ended fiscal year, and the \n     Congressional Budget Office was predicting $232 billion.\n       Revenue for fiscal year 2000 totaled $2.03 trillion, while \n     expenditures came to $1.79 trillion, the Treasury Department \n     and the Office of Management and Budget said.\n       Tax payments from individuals totaled $1 trillion, compared \n     with $879 billion in fiscal year 1999. Payments from \n     corporate taxes came to $207.3 billion, up from $184.7 \n     billion.\n       The biggest spending categories in fiscal 2000 were:\n       Social Security, $441.8 billion, up from $419.8 billion in \n     fiscal 1999.\n       Programs of the Health and Human Services Department, \n     including Medicare and Medicaid, $382.6 billion, compared \n     with $359.7 billion.\n       Interest on public debt, $362.1 billion, up from $353.5 \n     billion.\n       Military spending, $281.2 billion, up from $261.4 billion.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I see our distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee here.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the morning's editorial of the \nWashington Post entitled ``Say Goodbye to the Surplus'' printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Say Goodbye to the Surplus\n\n       Congressional Republicans reached agreement yesterday on \n     the contents of the tax cut bill they intend to send the \n     president before adjourning. They suggest it's a relatively \n     minor measure, but it's not. If it becomes law atop all the \n     spending increases also agreed to in this session, Congress \n     and the president will have used up, before the election, \n     well over a third of the projected budget surplus--the $2.2 \n     trillion over 10 years in other than Social Security funds--\n     that the presidential candidates are so busily dispensing on \n     the campaign trail. It's an astonishing display of lack of \n     discipline and misplaced priorities.\n       The president sent a letter implying that he might sign the \n     tax bill even while objecting to major parts. He ought \n     instead to veto it if congressional Democrats won't block it \n     first. As with the other Republican tax cuts he vetoed \n     earlier in the year, this would cost too much--an estimated \n     quarter-trillion dollars over the 10 years--and too much of \n     the money would go to the part of the population least in \n     need.\n       In the name of increasing access to health care, the \n     legislation would grant a new tax deduction to people who buy \n     their own insurance. The deduction would mainly benefit those \n     in the top tax brackets who tend already to be insured. The \n     president observed that, far from increasing access, it could \n     have the perverse effect of inducing employers to drop \n     insurance they now maintain for their employees. Among much \n     else, the bill would also increase the amounts that can be \n     contributed annually to tax-favored retirement accounts, a \n     step that by definition benefits only those who can afford to \n     save the maximum now.\n       The health insurance deduction was part of the Republicans' \n     price for the $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage that \n     the bill also contains. The price is too high. Also in the \n     bill will be so-called Medicare givebacks, increases in \n     payments to providers that the president earlier objected \n     were tilted in favor of managed care companies already \n     overpaid. This is on balance a bad bill dusted with \n     confectioner's sugar and offered up at year's end on a take-\n     it-or-leave-it basis. The right response would be to vote it \n     down.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is not goodbye to the surplus. We \nnever had it.\n  I promised the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, \nthat I would jump off the Capitol dome if the so-called Balanced Budget \nAct balanced the budget by this year. I came close to having to buy a \nparachute and getting ready to jump. I really did.\n  There was an inordinate collection of revenues, including personal \nincome taxes and corporate returns throughout the year. I was extremely \nworried and was going to have to face up to the truth to my good \nfriend, the distinguished chairman of our Budget Committee. But I was \nsaved by the bell with the reality that we never had a surplus.\n  There is no better document than this one. The Treasury news ``For \nImmediate Release'' of October 24 entitled ``Joint Statements of \nLawrence H. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jacob J. Lew, \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget on budget results for \nthe fiscal year 2000.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you can see the total Federal \nsecurities, and the net transactions at the beginning of this year were \n$5,606.1 trillion. At the close of the month, September 30, the end of \nfiscal year 2000, the debt was $5,629.0 trillion. The debt increased \n$22.9 billion. That is not a surplus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the table of \nbudget realities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           HOLLINGS' BUDGET REALITIES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

Mr. President, as you can see, during 1968-1969, when \nPresident Lyndon Johnson last balanced the budget, we had at that \nparticular time a $2.9 billion surplus. We have been running deficits \never since.\n  I heard the litany in the debates why we had not done anything.\n  When this Congress started 8 years ago, as the Record shows, in 1992, \nthere was a deficit of $403.6 billion. We were spending $403.6 more \nthan we were taking in.\n  Under the 1993 provisions, whereby we not only cut spending but we \nincreased taxes, including the tax on Social Security and the tax on \ngasoline. We reduced the Federal workforce by 300,000 employees. That \ngot us on the road to reducing the deficit from $403.6 billion to $22.9 \nbillion. But the debt has continued to increase, and there is no \nsurplus. That is the point I am trying to make.\n  Only on last evening, in trying to renegotiate the State-Justice-\nCommerce bill--I don't know whether it will be included--but they \nwanted the statement that $240 billion shall be used to pay down the \ndebt. Absolutely false. They transfer the debt to these trust funds \nthat I have already listed in the Record with respect to Social \nSecurity, Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, \nunemployment compensation, and on down the list. They are really \ntransferring. They are not paying down anything. There is no surplus. \nWe have increased the debt.\n  The reality is that we have just created the biggest waste in the \nhistory of government.\n  I served on the Grace Commission against waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nworked very diligently and carried out about 85 percent of the \nrecommendations of the Commission. In spite of our efforts, however, \nunder President Reagan's so-called ``voodoo'' economics, the debt \nincreased. We kept going, first under President Reagan, with a $1 \ntrillion debt, and then a second trillion dollars, a third trillion \ndollars, a fourth trillion, a fifth trillion, and now the debt has \ngrown to $5.7 trillion.\n  Along with that is the interest cost.

Mr. President, you can see the interest cost of \n$361,997,734,302.36, and on down the list.\n  At $1 billion a day--I will never forget the comments made by the \ndistinguished majority leader at the time President Clinton was making \nhis address to the joint session of Congress at the beginning of the \nyear. He said that gentleman is costing us $1 billion a minute. The \nPresident talked for 90 minutes. Governor Bush wants to cut taxes some \n$90 billion. So the two of them--the Bush program and the Clinton \nprogram--are $180 billion. We are spending $362 billion on interest \ncosts alone.\n  That leaves $182 billion that you can use to increase research for \ncancer, increase defense--defense is stretched now--and everything \nelse.\n  The point is we are spending a fortune on absolutely nothing. With \nthe profligacy of these past Congresses, the lack of awareness of the \nAmerican people, and the media's failure to deliver the truth to the \nAmerican public, I wanted the record to be cleared.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do I understand I have a half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Senator Hollings, for your kind remarks. I \ndon't agree with your theory or your conclusions, but I appreciate \nworking with you over the years. Your dedication to getting the debt \nunder control has not gone unnoticed over the years. We had an unusual \nrecovery with huge amounts of new taxes coming in that neither you or I \nexpected. Society has changed, no doubt about that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11048-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11048-S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ODD GIFT OF BONDS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I will speak about Vice President \nGore's lack of a Social Security policy. I will entitle my premise \ntoday ``Odd Gift of Bonds.''\n  Let me start by saying I found it interesting that just 2 days ago \nthe Treasury Secretary--that is, Secretary Summers--took time out of \nhis busy schedule to speak with reporters and go on the talk show \ncircuit to comment on Governor Bush's Social Security proposal. Some of \nSecretary Summer's conclusions appeared on the front page of the \nWashington Post yesterday. The title was ``Cabinet Opens Up On Bush.'' \n``Treasury Secretary says Social Security Math Doesn't Add Up.''\n  I hope when I am finished some people will take a look at the Vice \nPresident's so-called Social Security plan, and maybe they will \nconclude, as I have, that the math does add up, but it doesn't do a \nthing for Social Security long term. Nothing. Zero.\n  It should be noted, at least while I have been here, that \ntraditionally, Secretaries of the Treasury do not get themselves \ninvolved in political campaigns, and for good reason. Indeed, former \nSecretary Bob Rubin, also an appointee of this administration, stayed \nout of the campaign in 1996. But apparently Secretary Summers had \nenough time to give interviews; but he didn't have enough time to offer \nany real evidence to back up his stated claims. None. No evidence. In \nfact, I'm quite sure that the Secretary of the Treasury is grading a \nfictional Bush plan so that he can join with the Vice President and \nmany other Democrats in orchestrating a campaign to scare senior \ncitizens, as they have done regularly in past campaigns.\n  Also, I find it interesting that the Washington Post reporter--whom I \nknow--who wrote this story, didn't come to any Member or anyone who has \ntried to understand the Gore Social Security plan to ask for some \ncomments about it and whether it does anything at all for Social \nSecurity.\n  So today I will take a few minutes to explain the Clinton-Gore Social \nSecurity plan, and then the Gore plan, which is slightly different than \nthe Clinton-Gore plan, which is really not a plan at all but an \nillusion of a plan. It is not a plan. It is an illusion of a plan.\n  President Clinton initially proposed a version of this plan in \nJanuary of 1999. It was never taken seriously then or now. And for good \nreason. I can remember it was very difficult to get a Democrat to offer \nthe President's plan, including the so-called Social Security fix in \nthe budget hearings, in the Budget Committee, and surely there were \nnever more than a few Senators whom I believe in clear partisan \ndedication who supported this odd gift of bonds to the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  This so-called plan, the one that President Clinton sent us in 1999, \nis strictly a political exercise intended to create the perception that \nthe President and Vice President have met their commitment to ``save \nSocial Security first,'' as they state it, when, in fact, they have no \nsuch plan, and the Social Security long-term problems remain absolutely \nunresolved.\n\n  In fact, as Governor Bush has said, for 8 years the Clinton-Gore \nadministration has promised to save Social Security, and yet, under the \nClinton-Gore administration, the present value of the Social Security \ndeficits have already increased 60 percent during that 8 years of doing \nnothing, according to the Social Security actuaries. That's roughly \n$28,000 per household. That is the amount that it has gone up. Perhaps \nSecretary Summers, as the managing trustee of Social Security, should \nbe asked why he has allowed that to happen. It has happened because we \nhave not taken steps to reform or fix Social Security.\n  Now I will talk about the $40 trillion IOU plan. What does the \nClinton-Gore plan do? Beginning in the year 2011, and continuing \nthrough 2050, they transfer IOUs from the general fund of the \ngovernment to the Social Security trust fund. I will soon introduce a \nletter from the Congressional Budget Office that says over that period \nof time from 2011 to 2050 the total accumulated costs of both interest \nand IOUs--get this--will be $40 trillion. That means for that plan to \nmake sense somehow, some way, some time, during 2011 and 2050, they \nwill have to ask the American people to do one of three things:\n  No. 1, increase taxes by $40 trillion over that period of time. Why? \nTo pay off the IOUs which are soon going to be needed by the Social \nSecurity recipients of our country.\n  No. 2, restrain and restrict the programs of our Federal Government \nover that period of time; that is, discipline our programs so we will \nsave $40 trillion and put it against the IOUs--a mammoth expectation \nwithout any probability of occurring.\n  Or we can do some of the two of them.\n  Or we can just say we will do it all by cutting programs of ordinary \npeople that are going on day by day.\n  Nonetheless, these estimates will indicate that we will have to do \nsomething in the future to raise large amounts of money that are not \ncurrently within the Social Security actuarial expectations from the \npayroll tax. It will have to come from somewhere. Is that a plan to fix \nSocial Security? I ask anyone if that is a plan? It is not a plan. It \nwon't work. It has been more or less unacceptable to Congress for the \n2\\1/2\\ years that it has been lounging around someplace, for somebody \nto consider.\n  The estimate I am talking about comes from the Social Security \nactuaries who estimated the initial amount of general fund transfers to \nbe $9.9 trillion.\n  We then asked the Congressional Budget Office to calculate for us how \nmuch additional interest would be paid to the trust fund, based on \nthese transfers. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, using the \nactuaries' numbers, estimated that the interest payments would add $30 \ntrillion to the general fund transfers to the trust fund. In total, \nthen, that is $40 trillion in IOUs by 2050.\n  For those who might have a little difficulty with IOUs, let me just \nsay,\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\nthink of it as a postdated check. The check is there and it is valuable \nbecause it has a signature on it: USA. But it is dated 2050. Then when \nyou say: OK, the check is good, pay me--we will, as a nation, have to \ncome up with $40 trillion.\n  When the President initially made this proposal, he--that is \nPresident Clinton--he at least proposed one real provision that would \nhave changed Social Security's long-term financing. The President \nproposed to set up a new Government-run board that would invest up to \n15 percent of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market and \nprivate bonds. President Bill Clinton recommended that. But it would be \nrun by the Government and the Government would be involved in huge \nnumbers and huge dollar values of the stock of the American stock \nexchanges and of companies of America.\n  There was a resounding opposition to using a Government board to \ninvest Social Security money in the stock market because it would \nbecome political. It would become a board that might not want to invest \nin this because of public opinion, or that, because the particular \ncorporation causes obesity by selling hamburgers, that is not the right \nthing so you would not invest in that particular stock.\n  The Federal Reserve Board Chairman said, to that piece of the \nPresident's plan: Too much Government involvement in the private \neconomy.\n  So the Vice President has said he does not support that portion of \nPresident Clinton's plan. So what he has left is a plan with no \ninvestment and $40 trillion will accumulate, by the year 2050, which we \nwill have to pay from somewhere.\n  If you ask, Has he helped anything in his plan? Well, I ask you. He \nalso, I think, makes matters a little worse by proposing two new \nunfunded benefit expansions that will cost between $100 and $180 \nbillion over 10 years, which just adds to the numbers we have been \ntalking about because we have expanded Social Security without the \nwherewithal to pay it after 2011.\n  To show you the lack of seriousness of this IOU proposal, the Gore \nplan does not start transferring funds to Social Security until 2011, \nwell beyond any two terms that he might serve, and five Congresses from \nnow. What he is really saying is he wants the economy of this country \nto commit $40 trillion in general funds on the promise that we will \nimpose fiscal discipline on 10 future Presidential terms and 20 \nCongresses. But he will not transfer a penny to Social Security until \n2011.\n  Who is going to pay these IOUs off? Our children and our \ngrandchildren. They will be saddled with all the debt and they will be \nforced to pay these IOUs back--in the form of higher taxes or through \nthe other suggestions that are possibilities that are talked about.\n  In March of 1999, Senator Bob Kerrey said, this plan ``has a great \ndeal of pain in [the] plan--a hidden pain in the form of income tax \nincreases that will be borne by future generations of Americans.''\n  That is by Bob Kerrey, Democrat from Nebraska. I could not agree \nmore.\n  What is more, the President's own budget for 2000 agreed with Senator \nKerrey:\n\n       These [trust fund] balances . . . are claims on the \n     Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by \n     raising taxes, through borrowing from the public, or reducing \n     the benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large \n     trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any \n     impact on the Government's ability to pay the benefits.\n\n  An odd gift of bonds--which is the full extent, that I can find, of \nthe plan the Vice President has put forth. I can find very few \neconomists who believe these transfers to Social Security are a good \nidea and they will fix Social Security.\n  In fact, Ed Gramlich, whom this President recently appointed to the \nFederal Reserve Board, headed a commission for the President on Social \nSecurity. This is what he said:\n\n       During the deliberations of the 1994-1996 Social Security \n     Advisory Commission, we considered whether general revenues \n     should be used to help shore up the Social Security program. \n     This idea was unanimously rejected for a number of reasons . \n     . . there are serious drawbacks to relaxing Social Security's \n     long-run budget constraint through general revenue transfers.\n\n  Alan Blinder, Gore's economic adviser, said, in 1999, that the \nadministration should drop the ``gift of bonds.''\n  It is from his quote that I named this assessment. He said that the \nadministration should drop the ``gift of bonds.''\n  This is what he said, that is Blinder, at a Ways and Means Committee \nhearing in 1999.\n\n       It amounts to a pledge to provide that much more money for \n     Social Security in the future--somehow. But it does not \n     specify the sources. Thus, by itself, it does not fill any of \n     the funding gap. . . . There is a simpler and more \n     intuitively appealing plan which, had the President proposed \n     it, would, I believe, have generated less confusion and \n     raised fewer objections. That would be to dedicate the \n     [Social Security surpluses] over the next 15 years to debt \n     reduction, and therefore to national saving--and to forget \n     about the new gift of bonds and odd scorekeeping rules.\n\n  Meaning that you have to invent some way to score this in a budget \nway or to make sense.\n  The Clinton-Gore plan is not really a plan at all. It is a political \nproposal to confuse the debate and absolve him from the responsibility \nto offer a real plan to save Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article by Glenn Kessler \nregarding the Secretary of Treasury's assessment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 25, 2000]\n\n                        Cabinet Opens Up on Bush\n\n\n      treasury secretary says social security math doesn't add up\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers offered a detailed \n     critique of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Social Security plan \n     yesterday, wading into a political fight usually shunned by \n     his predecessors and creating an unusual chorus of criticism \n     of the GOP presidential nominee by senior Cabinet officials.\n       In an interview, Summers said that Bush's comments on \n     Social Security ``reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of \n     the system.'' The Bush plan to divert a portion of payroll \n     taxes to help establish individual accounts for young \n     workers, he added, well require either ``large cuts'' in \n     guaranteed benefits or an infusion of billions of dollars in \n     new revenue.\n       But Summers--an economist who also serves as managing \n     trustee of Social Security and conducted academic work on \n     funding the system before he entered government--said there \n     is no way money collected now can also pay current benefits \n     if it is channeled into investment accounts.\n       ``It is an arithmetic challenge that cannot be met,'' \n     Summers said, asserting that under the Bush plan the Social \n     Security trust fund would be fully depleted when someone who \n     is now 42 retires.\n       Summers' remarks come as the Gore campaign and the \n     Democratic National Committee are pounding battleground \n     states with advertisements and recorded phone calls that echo \n     the themes outlined by Summers--that Bush's math on Social \n     Security doesn't add up and that the Republican is bound to \n     break promises to either senior citizens or young workers.\n       While Summers is a key behind-the-scenes economic adviser \n     to Vice President Gore, the Treasury Secretary, the Secretary \n     of State, the Defense Secretary and the Attorney General are \n     generally the Cabinet officials who try to remain aloof from \n     politics in presidential elections.\n       Yet, over the weekend, Secretary of State Madeleine K. \n     Albright also departed from that tradition, taking the \n     unusual step of denouncing Bush's proposal to withdraw U.S. \n     ground forces from the Balkans as risky and misguided and \n     possibly leading to the dissolution of NATO.\n       ``This is a very inappropriate continuing pattern of the \n     politicization of the most sensitive Cabinet agencies, State \n     and Treasury,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``In the \n     waning days of the Clinton era, perhaps it was too much to \n     hope that the historically nonpolitical agencies could remain \n     about the fray.''\n       As Treasury secretary four years ago, Robert E. Ruben would \n     only obliquely make observations about the economic proposals \n     offered by Republican presidential candidate Robert J. Dole, \n     usually in response to questions and then mostly to defend \n     administration policy. Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary in \n     1988 under President Ronald Reagan and in 1992 under Bush's \n     father, President George Bush, said yesterday that Summers' \n     comments were ``totally inappropriate.''\n       ``I don't think it's his business to be commenting on \n     Governor Bush's proposal on Social Security,'' Brady said.\n       Allen Sinai, chief executive of Primark Decision Economics, \n     agreed that the critique was unusual but said it was \n     appropriate, given Summers' background. ``We happened to have \n     the coincidence of having a Treasury secretary who is also \n     the finest economist of our generation,'' Sinai said. ``Who's \n     to say what's fair or not fair?''\n       Treasury officials made much the same case, saying Summers' \n     comments were justified because he is the managing trustee of \n     Social Security and had been considered an expert in the \n     field when he was in academia.\n       Summers also took issue with Bush's claim that he would be \n     able to build up $3 trillion in these new private accounts \n     while also\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\n     eliminating the national debt by 2016. Gore has set a goal of \n     eliminating the debt by 2012.\n       ``Without dedicating Social Security surpluses to debt \n     reduction rather than to new private accounts, it appears to \n     me that on any realistic basis it is impossible to eliminate \n     the debt any time in the next 20 years without using nearly \n     the entire budget surplus, which is clearly precluded by \n     their large tax cuts,'' Summers said.\n       Under the Bush plan, about $1.9 trillion would be \n     transferred from the Social Security surplus to the private \n     accounts by 2016, which the campaign says would grow to $3 \n     trillion, assuming a 5.5 percent return and moderate \n     inflation. But that money could not also be used to pay down \n     the debt.\n       Fleischer insisted the Bush plan will pay down the entire \n     national debt by 2016.\n       Summers began making the case against Bush's Social \n     Security plan in a little-noticed address before the \n     Conference Board in New York last week. In that speech, he \n     said that diverting two percentage points of the payroll \n     tax--about 15 percent--a year ``would lead to an excess of \n     benefits over tax revenues by 2005, and the total exhaustion \n     of the trust fund in the early 2020s.''\n       Yesterday, Summers expounded on that theme and also \n     targeted Bush's contention in his first debate with Gore that \n     ``I want to get a better rate of return for your own money \n     than the paltry 2 percent that the current Social Security \n     trust gets today.''\n       Summers said that reflected a ``fundamental \n     misunderstanding'' because payroll taxes are used to provide \n     benefits for retirees, the disabled and survivors, and thus \n     can't be invested. ``Comparing rates of return is just not a \n     legitimate argument,'' Summers said.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I ask unanimous consent the June 26, 2000, memorandum \nto Social Security chief actuary Harry C. Ballantyne, on long-range \nOASDI financial effects of the President's proposal for strengthening \nSocial Security, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Social Security Administration Memorandum, June 26, 2000\n\n     To: Harry C. Ballantyne, Chief Actuary\n     From: Stephen C. Goss, Deputy Chief Actuary\n     Subject: Long-Range OASDI Financial Effects of the \n         President's Proposal for Strengthening Social Security--\n         Information\n       This memorandum provides estimates of the financial effects \n     of the proposal presented in the President's Mid-Session \n     Review of the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget on June 20, 2000. This \n     proposal would require that transfers be made from the \n     General Fund of the Treasury of the United States to the Old-\n     Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance \n     (DI) trust funds for each fiscal year 2011 through 2050. In \n     addition, the President proposes that a portion of the \n     transfers would be invested in corporate equities (stock), up \n     to a limited portion of the total assets of the trust funds.\n       If transfers were invested only in special interest-bearing \n     obligations (special issues) of the United States Treasury, \n     the date of exhaustion of the combined OASI and DI trust \n     funds would be extended by an estimated 20 years, from 2037 \n     under present law to 2057 under the proposal. The estimated \n     size of the long-range actuarial deficit would be reduced \n     from 1.89 percent of effective taxable payroll under present \n     law to 0.86 percent of payroll under the proposal. All \n     estimates reflect the intermediate assumptions of the 2000 \n     Trustees Report, adjusted to reflect the recent enactment of \n     the retirement earnings test beginning in the year 2000 for \n     persons who have attained their normal retirement age.\n       In addition to the transfers, the President proposes that \n     up to 15 percent of trust fund assets would eventually be \n     invested in stock. With both the transfers and the investment \n     in stock, the date of exhaustion of the combined OASI and DI \n     trust funds would be extended by an estimated 26 years, from \n     2037 under present law to 2063 under the proposal. The \n     estimated size of the long-range actuarial deficit would be \n     reduced from 1.89 percent of effective taxable payroll under \n     present law to 0.48 percent of payroll under the proposal. \n     (Due to interaction among provisions, a complete elimination \n     of the actuarial deficit would require additional OASDI \n     changes that would reduce the present law deficit by up to \n     about 0.75 percent of taxable payroll.) These estimates are \n     based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2000 Trustees \n     Report (adjusted for elimination of the earnings test at the \n     normal retirement age) and other assumptions described below.\n       The amount of transfer for each year would be based on a \n     calculation of the increase in the combined OASI and DI trust \n     fund assets that would have occurred during fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2015 if all trust-fund assets had been invested in \n     obligations of the United States Treasury. However, actual \n     transfer amounts would be limited to dollar amounts specified \n     in the law, based on projected on-budget surpluses in the \n     President's Mid-Session Review of the FY 2001 Budget.\n       Base transfer amounts are intended to be equal to the \n     amount by which interest on publicly-held Federal debt would \n     be lower as a result of the OASDI ``surplus'' during fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2015 than if there had been no such \n     surplus, assuming that all transfers had been invested solely \n     in special issues of the Treasury.\n       Beginning in the year 2011, 50 percent of the amount \n     transferred would be used to purchase stock and 50 percent \n     would be used to purchase special issues of the Treasury. All \n     dividends would be reinvested in stock. This procedure would \n     continue until the market value of all stock held by the \n     OASDI trust funds reaches 15 percent of total OASDI trust \n     fund assets. Thereafter, the percentage of total trust fund \n     assets that is held in stock would be maintained at 15 \n     percent by buying and selling stock as necessary.\n       Stock investments would be managed by the private sector. \n     Stock investments would be required to reflect the \n     composition of all publicly-traded stock in the United States \n     (for example, the composition of the Wilshire 5000 index).\n\n\ntransfer amounts from the general fund of the treasury to the oasi and \n                             di trust funds\n\n       The proposal would provide for transfers in each fiscal \n     year 2011 through 2050 with the amount based on the following \n     procedure:\n       (1) A base amount would be computed for each fiscal year \n     2011 through 2016 equal to:\n       (a) the calculated increase in the amount of assets in the \n     combined OASI and DI trust funds that would have occurred \n     from September 30, 2000 to the September 30 immediately prior \n     to the start of the fiscal year, if all assets had been \n     invested only in special issues of the Treasury, multiplied \n     by,\n       (b) an interest rate based on the average market yield on \n     all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United \n     States forming a part of the publicly-held debt in the month \n     prior to the fiscal year.\n       (2) The actual transfer amount for each fiscal year 2011 \n     through 2016 would be equal to the base transfer amount for \n     the year, subject to a dollar-specified limit in the law. \n     This limit, computed by the Office of Management and Budget, \n     represents the amount\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\n     of on-budget surplus that was projected to be available for \n     transfers to the OASDI trust funds under the assumptions and \n     policy of the President's Mid-Session Review of the FY 2001 \n     Budget.\n       (3) The actual transfer amount for fiscal years 2017 \n     through 2050 would be equal to the actual transfer amount \n     computer for fiscal year 2016.\n       Under (1)(b), calculation of the interest rate would be \n     based on yields on corporate bonds if there is no publicly-\n     held debt. In this case, the interest rate would be based on \n     the current market yield of investment-grade corporate \n     obligations, less an adjustment to account for the estimated \n     difference between yields of such corporate obligations and \n     ``obligations of comparable maturities issued by risk-free \n     government issuers selected by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.''\n\n        ESTIMATED TRANSFER AMOUNTS AND LIMITS UNDER THE PROPOSAL\n                      [Billions of current dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Estimated   Dollar-   Estimated\n              Fiscal year                   base    specified   transfer\n                                           amount   limit \\2\\    amount\n--------------------------------------------\\1\\-------------------------\n2011...................................     $122.4       $123     $122.4\n2012...................................      145.0        147      145.0\n2013...................................      169.8        172      169.8\n2014...................................      196.7        200      196.7\n2015...................................      225.7        230      225.7\n2016 and later.........................      257.0        263      257.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2000 Trustees Report\n  (adjusted for elimination of the earnings test at the normal\n  retirement age).\n\\2\\ Specified in law, computed by the Office of Management and Budget\n  based on the President's Mid-Session Review of the FY 2001 Budget.\n\n       It should be noted that the ``base'' amounts that would be \n     computed for transfers in years 2011 through 2016 may be \n     higher or lower than the estimates provided above based on \n     the intermediate assumptions of the 2000 Trustees Report. For \n     example, if price inflation (increase in the CPI) turns out \n     to be higher or lower than assumed by the Trustees between \n     now and 2015, with real rates of growth as currently assumed, \n     the based transfer amounts could differ substantially.\n       If inflation is lower than expected through 2015, making \n     base amounts computed in years 2011 through 2016 lower than \n     those estimated above, the dollar-specified limits on \n     transfers would not affect these base amounts in the \n     determination of actual transfers. However, if inflation is \n     higher than expected through 2015, making base amounts \n     computed in years 2011 through 2016 higher than those \n     estimated above, the dollar-specified limits on transfers \n     would reduce the actual transfer amounts to levels below the \n     base amounts.\n\n\n                    OASDI trust fund assets in stock\n\n       The 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security requested \n     estimates assuming that the total annual real yield on stock \n     investments would ultimately average about 7 percent, \n     approximately the average (geometric mean) total yield on \n     stocks since 1900 (or since 1926). Total yield includes \n     dividends as well as capital gains. Estimates for this \n     proposal are based on this assumption. (See section below for \n     analysis of the sensitivity of the estimates to variation in \n     the assumed real yield on stock.)\n       The 4-percentage-point difference between this assumed \n     ultimate real stock yield and the Trustees' 3.0-percent \n     assumed ultimate real yield on government bonds held by the \n     trust funds (the equity premium) is assumed to be maintained, \n     on average, throughout the 75-year projection period.\n       The table below provides the estimated percentage of OASDI \n     trust fund assets that would be held in stock at the end of \n     each calendar year 2010-17. The stock holdings are estimated \n     to reach the level of 15 percent of total trust fund assets \n     by the end of 2017, after which point this percentage would \n     be maintained under the proposal.\n\n        PERCENT OF OASDI TRUST FUND ASSETS IN STOCK, END OF YEAR\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             Year                               Percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2010.........................................................        0.5\n2011.........................................................        2.4\n2012.........................................................        4.4\n2013.........................................................        6.6\n2014.........................................................        8.9\n2015.........................................................       11.4\n2016.........................................................       13.8\n2017.........................................................       15.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The portion of the total value of publicly-traded stock in \n     the United States that is held by the OASDI trust funds will \n     depend not only on the yield achieved in the market, but also \n     on the rate of growth in the total market value of all stock. \n     The total value of stock represented in the Wilshire 5000 \n     index (a fair representation of all publicly-traded stock in \n     the United States) was $9.3 trillion at the beginning of \n     1998.\n       Assuming that the total market value of publicly-traded \n     stock will rise on average by the rate of growth in GDP after \n     1998, the trust funds would be expected to hold about 3.7 \n     percent of the total market value, on average, over the 30-\n     year period 2011 through 2040.\n\n      AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL STOCK MARKET VALUE HELD BY OASDI\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            Years                               Percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2011-20......................................................        2.3\n2011-30......................................................        3.5\n2011-40......................................................        3.7\n2011-50......................................................        3.6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               SENSITIVITY TO ASSUMED REAL YIELD ON STOCK\n\n       Due to the current, historically-high, level of stock \n     prices relative to corporate earnings, many analysts expect \n     that the total real yield on stock will average less than 7 \n     percent over the next 75 years. For example, the 1999 \n     Technical Panel appointed by the Social Security Advisory \n     Board recommended the assumption that the ultimate real yield \n     on stock would exceed the real yield on government bonds held \n     by the trust funds by 3 percentage points, on average, over \n     the next 75 years. In the context of the intermediate \n     assumptions of the 2000 Trustees Report, this would imply a \n     long-run average total real yield on stock of 6 percent (3 \n     percentage points above the Trustees' assumption of an \n     average 3-percent real yield on government obligations held \n     by the trust funds).\n       Assuming a 6-percent average total real yield on stock over \n     the long-range (75-year) period, the estimated year of trust \n     fund exhaustion would be extended by 25 years, from 2037 to \n     2062 (one year sooner than with an assumed 7 percent real \n     stock yield). The estimated long-range OASDI actuarial \n     deficit would be reduced from 1.89 to 0.57 percent of taxable \n     payroll (0.09 percent of payroll higher than with an assumed \n     7 percent real stock yield).\n                                                  Stephen C.

I will read a paragraph.\n\n       Although the transfers (and the interest earned on them) \n     would improve the apparent solvency of the trust fund, they \n     would increase the liabilities in the rest of the budget at \n     the same time.\n\n  That is what I have been saying.\n\n       As a result, the proposed transfers would have no impact on \n     the Government's net indebtedness, nor would they directly \n     enhance Government's ability to meet promises to future \n     retirees. Indeed, the Government's revenues and expenditures \n     would be the same regardless of whether the transfers were \n     made.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dan Crippen's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In your letter of October 6, you asked \n     the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to use data you \n     provided from the Social Security actuaries to estimate the \n     size of the cumulative impact, including interest, of the \n     President's proposal to make transfers from the general fund \n     of the Treasury to the Social Security trust funds.\n       Although the transfers (and the interest earned on them) \n     would improve the apparent solvency of the trust funds, they \n     would increase the liabilities in the rest of the budget at \n     the same time. As a result, the proposed transfers would have \n     no impact on the government's net indebtedness, not would \n     they directly enhance the government's ability to meet its \n     promises to future retirees. Indeed, the government's \n     revenues and expenditures would be the same regardless of \n     whether the transfers were made. Ultimately, the government's \n     ability to pay for future commitments, whether they are \n     Social Security benefits or some other payments, depends on \n     the total financial resources of the economy--not on the \n     balances in the trust funds.\n       As you requested, CBO prepared its estimates using \n     information about the proposal and the size of the transfers \n     from a June 26, 2000, memorandum issued by the actuaries of \n     the Social Security Administration.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments on two \nother subjects. First, the Vice President of the United States \ncontinues to tell the American people that he has been a master at \nreorganizing our Government and making it efficient, and that a very \nlarge number of employees have been cut from the payroll of the U.S. \nGovernment due to this effort.\n  I want to print in the Record a chart from the Office of Management \nand Budget--their own--the total executive branch civilian full-time \nequivalent employees during this period of time that they claim they \nreduced the workforce.\n  All I want to say is one thing: It did not take much to do this \nbecause 96 percent, a larger number than I thought, 96 percent of the \nemployee reduction--that is the civilian full-time equivalent \nreduction--are military civilians who were taken off the payroll as we \nreduced the Defense Department of the United States; 96 percent. Four \npercent is the reduction in the nonmilitary civilian payroll of the \nUnited States.\n  Let's get it right, Mr. Vice President. Let's tell it right. There \nwere no real reductions other than civilians who were laid off because \nwe reduced the Defense Department. I want to be correct. I said there \nwere none; 4 percent of reductions were from the rest of the civilian \nGovernment of the United States.\n  On the last item, let's get this one right. Mr. Vice President, you \nreferred twice in debates to a program to give health insurance to \nkids. There is a program called CHIP which the U.S. Government gave \nmoney to each State so they could try to insure or bring into Medicaid \nor at least in some way cover more children.\n  The Vice President said to the Republican nominee: Texas has not done \nvery well with that. Your program for covering children obviously \nindicates--I am paraphrasing--that you did not care about children's \nhealth.\n  What should have been said is that 40 States of the Union were unable \nto use their CHIP money. Would that not have been a fairer thing to say \nrather than say Texas? The State that has the largest amount of money \nunder that program for children's health and cannot spend it, has not \nspent it to this date is the State of California. As a matter of fact, \nthey had $591 million that they could not spend on children's health \ncoverage because the program will not work. You cannot fit it into \nStates. You cannot get it approved by the legislature. You cannot find \nthe match, or whatever the reason.\n  Those 40 States, in addition to Texas, are California, Georgia, \nWashington, Minnesota--Minnesota had the highest percentage of that \nmoney left over because they could not spend it, 99 percent. New \nMexico, my State, had 92. Arizona had 67 percent of their money.\n  Let's be fair. When you talk about children's health coverage and \nthis Federal program, do not say Texas was unable to spend theirs. \nLet's say 40 States have been unable, so there must be some deficiency \nin the program, not in the States. All of those States are led in \ndollar numbers by the State of California which could not spend $591 \nmillion because the program is difficult to do and very difficult to \neffectuate the coverage of children.\n  It is widely recognized that this S-CHIP program began slowly because \nState legislatures and HCFA had to approve plans. Right now, we are \nbusy trying to extend the plan for 2 more years for all States. That is \nbecause 40 of them have been unable to spend all of the money \navailable.\n  I ask the Vice President: In all those States, including California \nbecause they have this huge balance they could not use, is the Governor \nthere adverse to covering children and having more children involved in \nsomething like children's insurance or Medicaid or the like? I do not \nthink so, nor do I think the Governor of Texas is because I believe \nwhen 40 States cannot do it, we ought to tell it like it is.\n  The next time you are talking about this, Mr. Vice President, you \nought to say not Texas alone but California and 39 other States have \nbeen unable to use this CHIP money, this children's insurance money, \nfor one reason or another. Texas is among the 40. They do not stand \nalone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that information that summarizes what I have \nsaid be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               State Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n\n                  1. federal funding and requirements\n\n       As part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Congress created \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP).\n       The program provides allotments to States to expand health \n     insurance coverage for children based on a formula that takes \n     into consideration the number of low income children in the \n     state with no health insurance coverage.\n       States must match the federal funding, but at a rate that \n     is more favorable to the states than Medicaid.\n       States may use S-CHIP funds to: expand Medicaid, provide \n     coverage outside of Medicaid as long as the program meets \n     certain requirements, or some combination of the two.\n       The aggregate federal allotments for S-CHIP are as follows:\n\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             Year                               Dollars\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1998.........................................................        4.3\n1999.........................................................        4.3\n2000.........................................................        4.3\n2001.........................................................        4.3\n2002.........................................................        3.2\n98-02........................................................       20.3\n98-07........................................................       39.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              2. large eligible but unenrolled population\n\n       Estimates indicate that there are 2 to 4 million children \n     eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid and another 2 million \n     or more who are eligible but not enrolled in S-CHIP.\n       Some families lack information; others wait to sign up for \n     the program when they need to get health care.\n       As more working class families have become eligible, it is \n     likely that many of them get health insurance sporadically \n     through work, but most S-CHIP programs do not provide \n     subsidies for employer-based coverage.\n\n\n                3. states with unexpended fy 1998 funds\n\n       There are approximately 40 states that did not use their \n     full FY 1998 allotment by the end of FY 2000.\n       32 states had no spending in FY 1998\n       6 states had no spending at all in FY 1998 and FY 1999.\n\n                          [Dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Unused FY\n            Selected states                FY 98       1998     Percent\n                                         Allotment    Funds*     unused\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCalifornia.............................       $855       $591         69\nTexas..................................        581        449         77\nArizona................................        117         78         67\nGeorgia................................        125         77         61\nWashington.............................         47         46         98\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\n \nMinnesota..............................         28         28         99\nLouisiana..............................        102         74         73\nNew Mexico.............................         63         58         92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Source: Health Care Financing Administration (6-27-00).\n\n                      4. extension of use of funds\n\n       It is widely recognized that the S-CHIP program began \n     slowly because state legislatures and HCFA had to approve \n     state plans.\n       Congress is expected to allow states with unused funds from \n     FY 1998 and FY 1999 to keep those funds for an additional \n     period of time as enrollment accelerates.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today \nabout the issue of this country's economy. I was reminded the other \nday, in one of the discussions with respect to the contest for the \nPresidency this year, that some say: Really, nothing has happened with \nrespect to the last 8 years and this administration. It got me to \nthinking of where we have been and what we are experiencing in this \ncountry today.\n  As I have indicated previously, I believe we are blessed in this \ncountry. We have the strongest economy in the world and the longest \neconomic expansion in this country's history. And this is not all \naccidental. Some say that had nothing to do with Government, it had to \ndo with the American people. The American people were working very hard \nin the 1950s and the 1980s, and during other periods. However, you also \nneed a set of sensible Government policies that reduce the Federal \nindebtedness, stimulate investment and do the other things that are \nnecessary to allow this economic engine to run and to work right. So \nthis is not an accident.\n  Let me describe where we are. At the moment, we are 115 months into \nthe longest economic expansion on record. That is something all of us \nshould feel very good about.\n  Let me describe what happened to us back in the 1980s. In the early \n1980s especially, we began a significant amount of red ink, deficit \nafter deficit after deficit, and it kept getting worse and worse.\n  As you can see from this chart, the deficits went up to $290 billion \nin the Federal budget in 1992. Then, in 1993, Congress made some hard \ndecisions. This President, a new President, proposed a controversial \nnew economic plan. Some did not like it. Some still do not like it. It \npassed the Senate by one vote and passed the House by one vote. This \nnew economic plan provided a different direction. The deficits got \nsmaller and smaller, and then we began to see surpluses, and more \nsurpluses, and more.\n  Is this a turnaround? Yes, I think so. Is it accidental? No. It \nhappened, as you can see indicated on this chart, when a new President \nproposed a bold economic plan and, by one vote in the House and the \nSenate, we embraced a new direction and a new approach. You can see by \nthis chart what the result has been. We went from the largest deficits \nin history to the largest surpluses in this country's history.\n  Jobs created. The Government does not create jobs. But jobs are \ncreated in a timeframe in which the Government, with a set of policies, \nprovides for economic opportunity in the expansion of the economy. \nUnder the Reagan administration, in 8 years, 16 million jobs were \ncreated; the Bush administration, 4 years, 2.5 million jobs; under this \nadministration, in 8 years, 22 million new jobs. It is a wonderful \nrecord, with an economy that is working better than anyone ever could \nhave anticipated.\n  The unemployment rate. This economy is full of good news for our \ncountry. You can see what has happened to the unemployment rate, \nbeginning in 1992 and 1993, when this Congress set this country on a \ndifferent course to an economy of reduced deficits, with more robust \ngrowth. Unemployment has gone down, down, way down. That is good \neconomic news for America's families.\n  The inflation rate is down. As we can see, we have had a low \ninflation rate that has been stable throughout the 1990s.\n  The lowest poverty rate in two decades. You can see from this chart \nwhat happened when this economy began to kick into fifth gear and we \nbegan to see lower deficits and more economic growth. We saw lower \nunemployment, and now we see lower poverty rates.\n  Some say: That is just an accident; isn't it? No, it is not just an \naccident. This Congress, by one vote, embraced a new plan offered by a \nnew President in 1993. It was very controversial, and it worked. The \nevidence is all around us.\n  We had people on the floor of the Senate who said: Pass this plan, \nand it will bankrupt our country. Pass this plan, and our country will \nexperience a recession. Pass this plan, and there will be people \nunemployed in the streets.\n  They were wrong. Where we were headed was a very difficult \ncircumstance for our country: Bigger and bigger deficits; slow, anemic \neconomic growth. We changed the plan. The Clinton-Gore proposal in 1993 \nwas passed by one vote in both the House and the Senate. We changed \ndirection. And we see unemployment down, inflation down, poverty rates \ndown, and more.\n  And now, as a result of economic growth and better opportunity, the \nfederal income tax burden on middle-income taxpayers has decreased, as \nwell as the percent of income paid in Federal income taxes.\n\n  With respect to the burden of Federal income taxes on middle-income \nworkers, those with average income of $39,000 in 1999, the Federal \nincome tax\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\nburden has actually decreased during this same period.\n  Federal spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product in \nthis country is down. That is not an accident either. That relates how \nmuch we spend to what our economy is in terms of its total value of \ngoods and services produced. Federal spending is lower as a percent of \nGDP.\n  Let's review the U.S. economy, since we passed the bill in 1993, that \na new President, a new Vice President proposed that we pass to change \ndirection. We were headed in the wrong direction. We saw deficit after \ndeficit. It was getting larger.\n  Let me show the chart again, because I think it is important --\ndeficit after deficit, getting larger each year. Here is where we were. \nAs you can see, a $290 billion Federal deficit in that 1 year, growing \nby leaps and bounds. We changed direction. The deficits got smaller and \nsmaller and turned into surpluses. That is not an accident. That is a \nfunction of good public policy.\n  In 1992, we had the highest dollar deficit in history. Today, we have \nthe largest dollar surplus in our Federal budget history. Economic \ngrowth, 2.8 percent annually in the 12 years before 1993, since 3.9 \npercent annually; job growth, 1989 to 1992, one of the worst 4-year \nperiods in history, 2.5 million new jobs; in the 8 years since, 22 \nmillion new jobs. The unemployment rate average, 7 percent from 1981 to \n1992; 4.1 percent in the last 8 years, the lowest in 30 years. Home \nownership fell between 1982 and 1992. Now it is the highest in history. \nMedian family income fell from 1988 to 1992. Now it has increased by \n$5,000 since 1993. Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1982 to \n1992; decreased by 53 percent between 1993 and 2000. The Dow Jones was \nat 3,300, and now it is over 10,000.\n  That is the consequence of having an economic plan that works. When \npeople say, well, not much has changed, a lot has changed. In 1992, \nthis country was headed in the wrong direction. Now it is headed in the \nright direction. In 1992, we had an anemic economy that was producing \nhigher deficits, slower growth, more unemployment. Now we have an \neconomy that is producing budget surpluses, lower unemployment, lower \ninflation, and the longest economic expansion in this country's \nhistory.\n  When I hear discussions on the campaign trail about where we have \nbeen and where we are, they need to be rooted in some basis of fact. \nYou would have had to have been on another planet not to understand \nthat the last 8 years have been truly significant.\n  I am not saying that one side or the other should claim credit for \neverything. I am saying this because I was here and I know it. This \ncountry was headed in the wrong direction, with fiscal policies that \nsaid you can have a very big tax cut, you can double defense spending, \nand somehow everything will turn out all right. It didn't. It turned \nout with huge, growing, abiding deficits every year that sucked the \nstrength out of this country's economy. It meant people didn't have \njobs when they wanted jobs. It meant businesses couldn't expand when \nthey wanted to expand. It meant our Federal budget deficit was swollen \nwith red ink.\n  It wasn't working. It was a plan that didn't work. David Stockman \ntold us in his book, shortly after helping concoct the plan in early \n1981, that it wouldn't work. It didn't work. It put this country in a \ndeficit ditch, a deep hole.\n  We had a new plan, a different plan. No, it wasn't the same old \ntrickle down where you pour something in at the top and hope everybody \ndown at the bottom gets damp somehow. It was a plan that percolates up, \nsaying that this country's economic engine works best when everybody \nhas a little something to work with, when everyone has confidence in \nthe future.\n  Our economy rests on a mattress of confidence of a sort. If people \nare confident about the future, they do things that manifest that \nconfidence. They buy a car, a house, do the kinds of things that \nmanifest confidence in the future. If they are not confident in their \nfuture, they do exactly the opposite and the economy contracts.\n\n  No one has ever repealed the business cycle nor will they. We have \neconomic expansions and contractions. But economic expansions occur \nwhen people are confident, and they are sustained when people are \nconfident.\n  Right here, in 1993, this new President, President Clinton, and Vice \nPresident Gore said: We have a different plan. We are going to change \ndirections. We don't want to be in the same deficit ditch we have been \nin all these years. It is going to be tough. It is going to be \ncontroversial, but we want you to be with us to make these changes. \nEnough of us were. As I indicated, by one vote in the Senate and one \nvote in the House, we changed direction.\n  The American people had an assessment that was different than the \nassessment they had in the past. They became confident that Congress \nfinally was going to do something to tackle these deficits, not just \ntalk about them but tackle them, to get this country's fiscal policy \nback under some amount of control.\n  People's confidence increased. The result was that our economy began \nto rebound. It produced more economic growth than anyone thought \npossible. It produced lower unemployment than virtually anyone thought \npossible, and we have economic strength and opportunity across the \nentire country as a result of it.\n  Some areas have been left behind; I understand that. My point is, \neven as we work on those remaining areas, this country has done very \nwell. It is not an accident. I get a little fatigued hearing people say \nnothing has happened in the last 8 years.\n  What has happened is this administration, the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, inherited a weak, anemic economy, and we turned it \naround. Was it easy? No. We paid a price for the votes we cast to do \nit. It wasn't easy. It wasn't the best political choice. It wasn't the \nmost popular choice. But it was the required choice to say what is \nhappening in this country isn't right and we need to change it.\n  Changing it has meant that virtually everything in this country has \nimproved. Welfare rolls are down, home ownership is up, unemployment \ndown, inflation down. Almost every indices of economic health in this \ncountry shows strong, sustained improvement. That is not some \nhistorical accident. It is not. It is a function of a Congress, a \nPresident, and Vice President teaming up to make tough choices, to say \nwe are moving in the wrong direction and, with as much strength and \ncourage as it takes, we are going to turn that steering wheel and move \nthe country back in the right direction.\n  When people said, we blame you for the votes you cast in 1993, even \nback then, just after the vote, I said: You can't blame me. I demand \nthat you give me credit for that vote. As unpopular as it might be, it \nwas the right thing for this country to do. I am proud to have \nparticipated in it. I feel exactly the same way today. Do not dare to \nblame me for that vote. I voted to change direction because this \ncountry was headed in the wrong direction.\n  This country is now headed in the right direction. We have a lot of \nchallenges ahead of us and a lot to do. One of my great worries is that \nthose people who now say, oh, by the way, we are going to have 10 years \nof surpluses, don't understand the lessons of history. We don't have 10 \nyears of surpluses. We have economic uncertainty ahead, unless we \nmaintain a fiscal policy that makes sense. A trillion and a half \ndollars in tax cuts before even the surplus exists will put us right \nback into the same deficit ditch we had been in for so long back in the \n1980s and early 1990s.\n  We dare not squander this opportunity. We need a fiscal policy that \nmakes sense, one on which we can rely, one that says to the American \npeople, our first priority is not to give tax cuts with money we don't \nhave. Our first priority, when we have better economic times and have a \nbudget surplus, is to use part of that surplus to pay down the Federal \ndebt. If during tough times you run up the Federal debt, as we did, \nduring good times you ought to have the common sense to pay down part \nof that Federal debt, as we should.\n  This is the story. This is where we have been, and this is where we \nare. I worry very much that the kind of proposals offered by some here \nand by Governor Bush running for President--about $1.5 trillion in new \ntax cuts, most of which will go to those who need it least--will put us \nright back into the same deficit we have been in too long. We have \nworked too hard to squander our economic strength now.\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11053-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11053-S11055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today \nabout the issue of this country's economy. I was reminded the other \nday, in one of the discussions with respect to the contest for the \nPresidency this year, that some say: Really, nothing has happened with \nrespect to the last 8 years and this administration. It got me to \nthinking of where we have been and what we are experiencing in this \ncountry today.\n  As I have indicated previously, I believe we are blessed in this \ncountry. We have the strongest economy in the world and the longest \neconomic expansion in this country's history. And this is not all \naccidental. Some say that had nothing to do with Government, it had to \ndo with the American people. The American people were working very hard \nin the 1950s and the 1980s, and during other periods. However, you also \nneed a set of sensible Government policies that reduce the Federal \nindebtedness, stimulate investment and do the other things that are \nnecessary to allow this economic engine to run and to work right. So \nthis is not an accident.\n  Let me describe where we are. At the moment, we are 115 months into \nthe longest economic expansion on record. That is something all of us \nshould feel very good about.\n  Let me describe what happened to us back in the 1980s. In the early \n1980s especially, we began a significant amount of red ink, deficit \nafter deficit after deficit, and it kept getting worse and worse.\n  As you can see from this chart, the deficits went up to $290 billion \nin the Federal budget in 1992. Then, in 1993, Congress made some hard \ndecisions. This President, a new President, proposed a controversial \nnew economic plan. Some did not like it. Some still do not like it. It \npassed the Senate by one vote and passed the House by one vote. This \nnew economic plan provided a different direction. The deficits got \nsmaller and smaller, and then we began to see surpluses, and more \nsurpluses, and more.\n  Is this a turnaround? Yes, I think so. Is it accidental? No. It \nhappened, as you can see indicated on this chart, when a new President \nproposed a bold economic plan and, by one vote in the House and the \nSenate, we embraced a new direction and a new approach. You can see by \nthis chart what the result has been. We went from the largest deficits \nin history to the largest surpluses in this country's history.\n  Jobs created. The Government does not create jobs. But jobs are \ncreated in a timeframe in which the Government, with a set of policies, \nprovides for economic opportunity in the expansion of the economy. \nUnder the Reagan administration, in 8 years, 16 million jobs were \ncreated; the Bush administration, 4 years, 2.5 million jobs; under this \nadministration, in 8 years, 22 million new jobs. It is a wonderful \nrecord, with an economy that is working better than anyone ever could \nhave anticipated.\n  The unemployment rate. This economy is full of good news for our \ncountry. You can see what has happened to the unemployment rate, \nbeginning in 1992 and 1993, when this Congress set this country on a \ndifferent course to an economy of reduced deficits, with more robust \ngrowth. Unemployment has gone down, down, way down. That is good \neconomic news for America's families.\n  The inflation rate is down. As we can see, we have had a low \ninflation rate that has been stable throughout the 1990s.\n  The lowest poverty rate in two decades. You can see from this chart \nwhat happened when this economy began to kick into fifth gear and we \nbegan to see lower deficits and more economic growth. We saw lower \nunemployment, and now we see lower poverty rates.\n  Some say: That is just an accident; isn't it? No, it is not just an \naccident. This Congress, by one vote, embraced a new plan offered by a \nnew President in 1993. It was very controversial, and it worked. The \nevidence is all around us.\n  We had people on the floor of the Senate who said: Pass this plan, \nand it will bankrupt our country. Pass this plan, and our country will \nexperience a recession. Pass this plan, and there will be people \nunemployed in the streets.\n  They were wrong. Where we were headed was a very difficult \ncircumstance for our country: Bigger and bigger deficits; slow, anemic \neconomic growth. We changed the plan. The Clinton-Gore proposal in 1993 \nwas passed by one vote in both the House and the Senate. We changed \ndirection. And we see unemployment down, inflation down, poverty rates \ndown, and more.\n  And now, as a result of economic growth and better opportunity, the \nfederal income tax burden on middle-income taxpayers has decreased, as \nwell as the percent of income paid in Federal income taxes.\n\n  With respect to the burden of Federal income taxes on middle-income \nworkers, those with average income of $39,000 in 1999, the Federal \nincome tax\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\nburden has actually decreased during this same period.\n  Federal spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product in \nthis country is down. That is not an accident either. That relates how \nmuch we spend to what our economy is in terms of its total value of \ngoods and services produced. Federal spending is lower as a percent of \nGDP.\n  Let's review the U.S. economy, since we passed the bill in 1993, that \na new President, a new Vice President proposed that we pass to change \ndirection. We were headed in the wrong direction. We saw deficit after \ndeficit. It was getting larger.\n  Let me show the chart again, because I think it is important --\ndeficit after deficit, getting larger each year. Here is where we were. \nAs you can see, a $290 billion Federal deficit in that 1 year, growing \nby leaps and bounds. We changed direction. The deficits got smaller and \nsmaller and turned into surpluses. That is not an accident. That is a \nfunction of good public policy.\n  In 1992, we had the highest dollar deficit in history. Today, we have \nthe largest dollar surplus in our Federal budget history. Economic \ngrowth, 2.8 percent annually in the 12 years before 1993, since 3.9 \npercent annually; job growth, 1989 to 1992, one of the worst 4-year \nperiods in history, 2.5 million new jobs; in the 8 years since, 22 \nmillion new jobs. The unemployment rate average, 7 percent from 1981 to \n1992; 4.1 percent in the last 8 years, the lowest in 30 years. Home \nownership fell between 1982 and 1992. Now it is the highest in history. \nMedian family income fell from 1988 to 1992. Now it has increased by \n$5,000 since 1993. Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1982 to \n1992; decreased by 53 percent between 1993 and 2000. The Dow Jones was \nat 3,300, and now it is over 10,000.\n  That is the consequence of having an economic plan that works. When \npeople say, well, not much has changed, a lot has changed. In 1992, \nthis country was headed in the wrong direction. Now it is headed in the \nright direction. In 1992, we had an anemic economy that was producing \nhigher deficits, slower growth, more unemployment. Now we have an \neconomy that is producing budget surpluses, lower unemployment, lower \ninflation, and the longest economic expansion in this country's \nhistory.\n  When I hear discussions on the campaign trail about where we have \nbeen and where we are, they need to be rooted in some basis of fact. \nYou would have had to have been on another planet not to understand \nthat the last 8 years have been truly significant.\n  I am not saying that one side or the other should claim credit for \neverything. I am saying this because I was here and I know it. This \ncountry was headed in the wrong direction, with fiscal policies that \nsaid you can have a very big tax cut, you can double defense spending, \nand somehow everything will turn out all right. It didn't. It turned \nout with huge, growing, abiding deficits every year that sucked the \nstrength out of this country's economy. It meant people didn't have \njobs when they wanted jobs. It meant businesses couldn't expand when \nthey wanted to expand. It meant our Federal budget deficit was swollen \nwith red ink.\n  It wasn't working. It was a plan that didn't work. David Stockman \ntold us in his book, shortly after helping concoct the plan in early \n1981, that it wouldn't work. It didn't work. It put this country in a \ndeficit ditch, a deep hole.\n  We had a new plan, a different plan. No, it wasn't the same old \ntrickle down where you pour something in at the top and hope everybody \ndown at the bottom gets damp somehow. It was a plan that percolates up, \nsaying that this country's economic engine works best when everybody \nhas a little something to work with, when everyone has confidence in \nthe future.\n  Our economy rests on a mattress of confidence of a sort. If people \nare confident about the future, they do things that manifest that \nconfidence. They buy a car, a house, do the kinds of things that \nmanifest confidence in the future. If they are not confident in their \nfuture, they do exactly the opposite and the economy contracts.\n\n  No one has ever repealed the business cycle nor will they. We have \neconomic expansions and contractions. But economic expansions occur \nwhen people are confident, and they are sustained when people are \nconfident.\n  Right here, in 1993, this new President, President Clinton, and Vice \nPresident Gore said: We have a different plan. We are going to change \ndirections. We don't want to be in the same deficit ditch we have been \nin all these years. It is going to be tough. It is going to be \ncontroversial, but we want you to be with us to make these changes. \nEnough of us were.

The result was that our economy began \nto rebound. It produced more economic growth than anyone thought \npossible. It produced lower unemployment than virtually anyone thought \npossible, and we have economic strength and opportunity across the \nentire country as a result of it.\n  Some areas have been left behind; I understand that.

Mr. President, the business before us is the Older \nAmericans Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of Senator \nJeffords of Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 108 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. DeWINE. One minute, and then I will ask that my colleague from \nIowa be recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the business before the Senate is the \nOlder Americans Act. Specifically, we have Senator Gregg's amendment. I \nrise, very reluctantly, to oppose that amendment. In a moment, I will \nexplain to my colleagues why I believe that amendment is unnecessary \nand why I believe it simply must be turned down if we are going to pass \nthe Older Americans Act this year.\n  Before I do that, I want to allow my colleague from Iowa, who has \ncome to the floor and has a major provision in this bill, to talk about \nthis provision. I compliment him on it. He has been the lead sponsor in \nthe Senate on a separate bill. We incorporated his bill into the Older \nAmericans Act. The provision he will explain to the Senate is one of \nthe new provisions of the Older Americans Act in this bill and it is a \nmajor contribution. I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from \nOhio. He has the floor. I thought we would be alternating in the spirit \nof comity. What was the preference?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I was trying to accommodate Mr. Grassley, whom I asked to \ncome over here about this time. It is my understanding he has about 10 \nminutes. I would be happy to have you proceed at any point. At some \npoint, I am going to talk about the Gregg amendment and why I think it \nshould be opposed. I will be on the floor, so it doesn't matter when I \ndo it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My suggestion is that Senator Grassley proceed and then \nour colleague, Senator Murray, proceed. She wishes to speak for 10 \nminutes. How about if those two speak--Grassley followed by Murray--and \nthen, if it is appropriate, unless other Members want to speak, the \nSenator and I can engage in debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is fine with me.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 782, the \nOlder Americans Act Amendments of 2000. I join my colleagues in \ncommending Chairmen Jeffords and DeWine and other members of the \ncommittee for their hard work and endless energy in bringing this \nimportant measure to the floor.\n  In its 35th year, the Older Americans Act continues to meet its \nmission of helping seniors stay independent and part of their \ncommunity. The wide array of services available under the act serve as \nthe life-line to millions of seniors across the Nation.\n  Seniors in both rural and urban areas rely heavily on one or more of \nthese services: nutrition services such as home-delivered meals; meals \nserved in congregate settings; transportation services to medical \nappointments; legal assistance; protection from abuse through the \nombudsman program; pension counseling services; in-home services; and \nvolunteer and employment opportunities for older persons.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \nparticularly pleased that this bill contains the National Family \nCaregiver Support Program. Over the past 3 years, Senator Breaux and I \nhave convened a number of hearings to examine the important role that \nfamily caregivers play. More than 20 million Americans are caring for \nan aging or ailing family member. To put this number in perspective, \nthere are fewer than 2 million seniors living in nursing homes. So \nsimply by looking at the numbers, we can conclude that the bulk of \ncaring for our Nation's elderly is carried out by family and friends in \nthe form of informal caregiving.\n  The story of Barbara Boyd, a state legislator from Ohio who testified \nbefore the Special Committee on Aging last year, provides a good \nexample of what a caregivers job entails. Ms. Boyd cared at home for \nher mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Her mother \nhad $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security check. That went \nquickly. Her prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month. Antibiotics, \nointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence supplies, and other \nexpenses cost hundreds of dollars a month.\n  Ms. Boyd exhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and \nexhausted herself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't \ncomplain.\n  The contribution of family caregivers is enormous. Economically, \nfamily caregiving is worth billions of dollars. Emotionally and \nphysically, caregiving is often an overwhelming task. Caregivers know \nwhat it entails to juggle personal and professional demands with the \nresponsibilities that accompany caregiving.\n  This is why the Family Caregiving Support Program, now a part of the \nOlder Americans Act bill before us, is critically important to families \ncaring for loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. The program \nuses existing resources to meet a pressing need. In this case, the \nalready successful network of aging centers will administer the \nprogram.\n  It will serve millions of caregivers throughout hundreds of \ncommunities nationwide by providing: respite care; information and \nassistance; caregiving counseling and training and supplemental \nservices to caregivers and their families.\n  Our country is aging, and that demographic shift creates new needs, \nand this legislation helps us meet those needs. The Older Americans Act \nnot only serves as a critical safety net, but it embraces important \nprinciples that we should uphold in policies that serve our nation's \nelderly.\n  The act calls attention to the need to prepare our nation's aging \npopulation for its own longevity by enhancing health promotion \nopportunities, improving flexibility for states and area agencies on \naging, by modernizing programs and services, and in calling for a White \nHouse Conference on Aging in 2005.\n  Finally, the act provides authorization for the thirteen area \nagencies on aging in my home state of Iowa. In 1999, these funds \nenabled the agencies to serve nearly 293,000 elderly Iowans. The \nservices the act funds are critical to older Americans in my state and \nthroughout the country.\n   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter I recently received \nfrom Representative Boyd be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Ohio House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Columbus, OH, October 16, 2000.\n     Senator Chuck Grassley,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: We have in the state of Ohio term \n     limits, and I am at the end of my fourth term. I will \n     certainly miss the House, but I know my work is not done. I \n     will continue to advocate for the elderly, especially \n     Alzheimer's and caregivers. There is a rumor that I will be \n     in other areas of ``expertise'', which are Welfare Reform, \n     Human Services, and healthcare. It is my understanding that I \n     have a great advocacy being voiced in my interest in public \n     policy in the state of Ohio.\n       My passion will always revolve around the issue of \n     caregiving. I have found that I remain a voice on the issue \n     and a sounding board for those who are heartbroken.\n       October 21st will be two years since Mother passed, and \n     there is not a day that dawns that I do not think of her. \n     She, in her last years, taught me more than I ever learned in \n     college. Everyday I marvel at the fact that I did what I set \n     out to do during those five and a half years. Truly, my \n     heavenly father watches over me.\n       If there is ever an opportunity to serve on a national \n     level, on a board or committee on caregiving, please keep me \n     in mind. I will be sure to keep in touch with you.\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\n       Thank you again for giving me an opportunity to tell my \n     story as a caregiver.\n           Yours in Service,\n                                                     Barbara Boyd,\n                                             State Representative.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \non the HELP Committee in urging passage of this important bipartisan \nlegislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act.\n  For more than 30 years, the Older Americans Act has been our Nation's \nmost important resource for helping seniors get the services they need \nin their own communities.\n  The OAA provides funding for senior centers, transportation, \nrecreation, adult education, Meals-on-Wheels, preventive health care, \nand other essential services.\n  In fiscal year 2000 alone, OAA programs have provided more than $15 \nmillion in services in Washington State.\n  In addition, the act provides resources for the Nation's largest \nprogram for older workers, and it provides subsidized jobs and training \nto more than 65,000 low-income workers over age 54.\n  With more people retiring, the demand for OAA services has grown \ndramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, the program has not kept \npace with current needs.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to finally reauthorize the Older \nAmericans Act, and I'm calling on my colleagues to pass a clean \nreauthorization bill that is based on the bipartisan legislation \ndeveloped by the members of the HELP Committee.\n  As a member of the Aging Subcommittee of the HELP Committee, I have \nbeen eager to pass a strong reauthorization bill,\n  While I'm disappointed it has taken so long, I know this bill will \nimprove the programs that seniors and their families rely on.\n  As I have traveled around my State, I've seen the impact these \nprograms are making. It's not just seniors who want the act \nreauthorized. Their families, physicians and communities also want to \nsee the Act strengthened.\n  The safety net programs authorized in the Older Americans Act provide \na life line for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The Older Americans Act closes the gaps in services and offers \nseniors a way to maintain a dignified quality of life.\n  The nutritional assistance programs alone are critical to addressing \nthe needs of low and moderate income seniors.\n  Job training programs allow seniors to keep their economic \nindependence and to maintain important social ties to their \ncommunities.\n  The most significant improvement in this legislation is the creation \nof the new Family Caregiver Support program.\n  This innovative new program will offer families real support in \nmeeting the long term care needs of their loved ones.\n  It will also provide assistance to older spouses--often older women--\nwho are left to care for a frail family member.\n  The Aging Subcommittee heard testimony from many family members who \nare struggling to care for their aging parents. Because they don't have \nany help, they face significant financial and emotional burdens.\n  I know this new program will begin to address the problems facing \nthose families who are caring for aging relatives in their homes.\n  I thank the chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, Senator DeWine, for \nhis leadership in making this bill a reality.\n  I also thank Senator Mikulski for her efforts and hard work in making \nsure we honor the commitment to our seniors before we adjourn for the \nyear.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the pending amendment and send this \nbill to the President without further delay.\n  We cannot allow this session to end without continuing the programs \nthat have served America's seniors so well throughout the years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety-three minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I rise very reluctantly to oppose the amendment of my \ncolleague, Senator Gregg. I do so reluctantly because it is very well \nintended. Frankly, as I listened to his speech, there was very little, \nif anything, about which I disagreed. The bottom line is that the \nreforms he has requested and about which he has been so eloquent over \nthe last few years are, in fact, included in the bill that is in front \nof us. The reality is that while those reforms are already in the bill, \nif his amendment were accepted, it would kill the bill at this late \ndate.\n  We need to keep in mind that the House of Representatives has already \npassed this bill overwhelmingly with only two dissenting votes. This \nbill is the result of over 2 years of compromise work and labor. This \nbill has the accountability and the reforms that my colleague was \nasking about and has requested. I salute him for bringing these issues \nup not just on the floor today but, frankly, for bringing them up \nduring the committee hearings, and I salute him for bringing them up \nbefore that. Because of what my colleague has done and because of the \nissues he has raised, we have incorporated these reforms into this \nbill. He gets a lot of credit, I believe, for doing that.\n  I think, therefore, his amendment is simply just not necessary and \nultimately, at this late date, turns out to be an amendment that could \nkill this bill.\n  I would like to talk a minute about this bill from the point of view \nof the Governors. I think when looking at it from the point of view of \nthe Governors, we can get a better understanding of the reforms this \nbill makes, the improvements this bill makes, and the accountability \nthat is now in this bill that does not exist in the status quo.\n\n  Let me make something very clear. The killing of this bill will not \nimprove the status quo. We will be stuck with the status quo if this \nbill goes down. The question is, Does this bill fundamentally improve \nwhere we are today and bring about more accountability? I think clearly \na fair reading of this bill indicates that it would.\n  Let me talk about this bill from the point of view of the Governors.\n  First of all, this bill recognizes growth in States that have more \nsenior citizens, and therefore it is fair and it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  No. 2, this bill has numerous reforms in regard to title V. We recall \nwhat title V is. Title V is employment for seniors who couldn't get a \njob. That helps them; it not only helps them but helps the community. \nWe have these all over the country. My colleague talked about Green \nThumb and talked about the National Park Service. These jobs are all \nover the country in all 50 States. They are very valuable to the \nseniors and very valuable to the communities that are being served.\n  The appropriators have traditionally, year after year, split this \nmoney 78 percent and 22 percent--78 percent going to the 9 or 10 \nnational contractors and 22 percent going to the States. That has not \nchanged. That is what the appropriators have done year after year.\n  We bring about some more equity and fairness. We say dollars on top \nof that up to $35 million--any additional dollars up to $35 million--we \nare going to split and we are going to reverse that. Basically, we are \ngoing to have 25 percent that is going to go national but 75 percent of \nthe money will be spent by the Governors in the local communities as \nthey see fit. That is a fundamental change. Again, it is one of the \nreasons the Governors of our Nation want this bill.\n  We then go further and say beyond $35 million--if the appropriators \nput in beyond $35 million--it would be a 50-50 split; again, certainly \nan improvement over the status quo. Again, we get to the issue of \naccountability.\n  The next reason the Governors like this bill is that they get to \nsubmit for the first time a plan to the Department of Labor for the \nnational contractors that are coming into the States. The complaint we \nhear from them now is: These national contractors come into\n\n[[Page S11057]]\n\nour States, and they may be doing good work, but they may be in the \nwrong area or they may not spread around the States. The Governors and \nthe people in the States of Ohio, or Illinois, or Pennsylvania, or \nFlorida understand what our communities' needs are. We ought to have \nsome input in that.\n  This bill says: Yes, you can have that input. You can submit this \nplan to the Department of Labor, and they have to pay attention to it \nfor the first time. That is an improvement in local control. That is \none of the reasons the States like this bill so much and one of the \nreasons the National Governors' Association has endorsed this bill \nwholeheartedly.\n  We next provide more accountability. We say after the national \ncontractor comes in, after the national contractor begins its work, \nafter they have this employment, if the State of Ohio or the State of \nVermont or the State of Massachusetts decides the contractor is not \ndoing a good job, they have redress and procedures they can follow to \nhold that national group accountable--again, a very significant \nimprovement. Again, a reform that is contained in this bill.\n  In summary, Governors will have a greater role in planning and \nadministering a program within a State. Under our reauthorization bill, \nGovernors will submit a State plan to the Department of Labor which \nwill describe where these jobs are needed within a State, where the \npopulation of older individuals who qualify for the program are \nlocated, and describe how the plan would coordinate with the programs \nunder the Workforce Investment Act. The Governors are also given, under \nour bill, the opportunity to submit recommendations to the Secretary of \nLabor regarding proposed projects within the State that would be \ncarried out by the public and private nonprofit grantees.\n  Finally, under our bill, the Governors can hold those public and \nprivate grantees that operate in their States, for the first time, \naccountable if they fail to serve seniors. Under the bill, the Governor \ncan request the Secretary of Labor to review a public and private \nnonprofit grantee operating within the State. If the grantee is not \nmeeting performance standards, the Secretary, under our bill, is \nrequired to take corrective action against that grantee.\n  Next, new cost controls will prevent misuse of funds by the grantees. \nThat is very important. The reauthorization bill would codify \ndefinitions of administrative expenses and programmatic expenses. It \nwould also require at least 75 percent of a grantee's funds be used for \nenrollee wages and benefits. This bill also explicitly states that the \nfunds a grantee receives for the program must be used solely for that \nparticular program. Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee \nto comply with OMB circulars and rules, and requires the grantees to \nmaintain records sufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that \nfunds have not been spent unlawfully.\n  Further, grantees will be required to serve seniors or they will lose \ntheir grant. The reauthorization bill introduces performance measures \nin competition into the program for the first time.\n  The bill will establish a three-strikes-and-you-are-out policy to \nensure performance goals are met. Failure to meet performance standards \nwill first result in technical assistance and require the grantee to \ncome up with a plan for the future. Failure to meet performance \nstandards a second consecutive year will result in a net loss of 25 \npercent of the grant which will be competitively bid in an open \ncompetition. Failure to meet performance standards a third year will \ncut off the grantee from the program, and the grant will be \ncompetitively bid in open competition. Failure of a public and private \nnonprofit agency grantee to meet performance standards a fourth year in \nan individual State will also lead to the loss of the grant, which will \nthen be competitively bid in an open competition.\n  These reforms significantly improve the Older Americans Act. They \nprotect the taxpayers and provide seniors with a jobs program that \nworks. Failure to pass these reforms this year will only continue a \nsystem that has not served the job placement needs of seniors in many \nStates and will not correct the deficiencies in the administration and \nplanning of the program. The only way these improvements will be \nrealized is to pass this bill, the Older Americans Act, a bipartisan, \nbicameral initiative.\n\n  Under the bill, funding may only be used for provisions of title V. I \nwant to make this very clear. The provisions of training and jobs to \nlow-income seniors is the only legal use of money under our bill. You \ncan't use, under this bill, money for lobbying. Under our bill you \ncannot use it for litigation. We make sure of that by specific \nreference to the OMB circular and we make reference in the bill to that \nwhich prohibits that type of activity.\n  Each grantee receiving funds must comply with the law. They cannot do \nlobbying; they cannot do electioneering activities. That is under our \nbill, as well.\n  Under our bill, the Secretary must conduct a review and apply \nresponsibility tests to all applicants receiving funds, just as the \nGregg amendment provided. Under our bill, it is simple: If you fail to \nmeet a responsibility test, you cannot be a grantee.\n  Putting this bill together has not been an easy task. Let me remind \nmy colleagues, it has been 8 years since Congress reauthorized the \nOlder Americans Act. It has been 5 years since that last \nreauthorization expired. It has not been easy, but we are here today \nwith a bill that fundamentally changes the status quo. Our bill makes \nsignificant and substantial improvements to the existing Older \nAmericans Act. Failure to pass this bill would mean that we are going \nto be stuck with the status quo for at least 2 more years.\n  I will be quite candid. After what we have gone through to put this \ntogether, if this bill fails today, I don't know how anybody thinks we \ncould put another bill together next year or the year after. It would \nforce another Congress to rehash these issues and try to pass a \nbipartisan bill. Keep in mind, we now have a bill that is more \nacceptable to our friends in the House. We worked this bill and \ncoordinated this bill closely with them. They passed this bill \nyesterday 405-2. This bill has the support, as I indicated a moment \nago, for very good and substantial reasons, of the National Governors' \nAssociation. It is not easy getting all 50 Governors to agree on \nanything. They agree on this bill. They want this bill. They have \nlobbied for the bill. They have been a part of putting it together. \nFailure to pass this bill means we will be stuck with the status quo \nfor a long time.\n  I congratulate my colleague from New Hampshire for his work. I \nbelieve it is abundantly clear we have covered the concerns he has \nraised. The good news is if we pass the bill before the Senate, we can \nchange the status quo for the better, particularly title V.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the status of title V. It is funded \nnow at $440 million annually and administered by the Department of \nLabor, which awards grants to 10 national organizations, AARP, Green \nThumb, U.S. Forest Service, and the State governments. As I outlined, \n78 percent of the funds are awarded by the Department of Labor on a \nnoncompetitive basis to the 10 national organizations; 22 percent of \nthe funds are distributed to the States. That is the status quo. As I \nindicated a moment ago, we fundamentally change that status quo.\n  Let me conclude by referencing the bill. If my colleagues have \nconcerns about the reforms, whether or not they were in this bill, I \nreference them to this bill, to actually look at the bill. We provide \nfor accountability in regard to title V entities in two separate ways. \nOne, we do it before the fact, before they are chosen; second, we \nprovide it after the fact.\n  The first is what is labeled in the bill as a responsibility test. In \nthe section on the responsibility test, it outlines what the Federal \nGovernment must look at before a grantee is chosen. Let me emphasize \nthis is not in current law. The great improvement this bill makes is we \nput this in law. No matter who the Secretary of Labor is, no matter \nwhich party runs the Department of Labor, they have to follow the law. \nThey have strict criteria that they have to follow. We spell it out.\n  The bill provides:\n\n       Before final selection of a grantee, the Secretary shall \n     conduct a review of available records to assess the applicant \n     agency or State's overall responsibility to administer \n     Federal funds.\n\n  As part of that, the Secretary may consider any information about \nthat\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\nproposed grantee-specific language which I will read.\n  The organization's history with regard to the management of other \ngrants--\n  So I listened very carefully to the concerns of my colleague from New \nHampshire about a specific grantee. I say to him, look at the language \nin this bill. We have addressed those concerns. The Department of Labor \nwill look at these things and they will look at a past history and they \nwill look at a pattern and they will look to see if there have been \nproblems in the past. We go on and spell this out, page after page, all \nthe different things the Department can look at and should, in fact, \nlook at:\n\n       Failure to submit required reports; failure to maintain \n     effective cash management or cost controls; failure to ensure \n     that a subrecipient complies with the Office of Management \n     and Budget Circular[s]; failure to audit a subrecipient \n     within the required period; willful obstruction of audit \n     process; failure to establish a mechanism to resolve a \n     subrecipient's audit in a timely fashion--[et cetera, et \n     cetera.]\n\n  I will not read them all. They are all here. Then we also provide any \nhistory and we provide any information.\n  So the Department, for the first time, is being told they have to \nconsider this information, and that is what the law will be after we \npass this bill.\n  We next say after the fact, if they get that, if they do get the \ngrant, we then provide in a section called ``National Performance \nMeasures And Competition For Public And Private Nonprofit Agencies And \nOrganizations'':\n\n       The Secretary shall determine if each public or private \n     nonprofit agency or organization that is a grantee has met \n     the national performance measures established. . . .\n\n  We outline, as I indicated a minute ago, how that is done as well. \nThat is in this bill as well. We step them down and we punish them and \nwe eventually, if they keep doing it, say they do not get any more \nmoney and they are gone. That is what is in this bill.\n  So let me conclude. We have a strong bill in front of us. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It is our chance to pass the Older Americans Act. We \nwill not have another chance in this Congress. We may not get another \nchance in the next Congress. It is the right thing to do. There are \ngroups across this country that want this but, more importantly, the \nsenior citizens of this country need it. It is the right thing to do.\n  We address the concerns my colleague has raised. I again thank my \ncolleague from New Hampshire for raising this amendment, but I very \nreluctantly must oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Make \nno mistake about it, we have this covered. We have the reforms in the \nbill and, No. 2, if his amendment would pass, this bill would die and \nwe would not reauthorize the Older Americans Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I yield myself enough time to congratulate the Senator from \nOhio for doing a tremendous job. We have been waiting 8 long years to \nsolve some of these problems. I also congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire for raising these issues over and over. I firmly believe we \nhave, now, a bill that takes care of those problems and we have one \nthat we must vote in favor of, otherwise this bill will die. That would \nbe a terrible thing to happen.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be charged \nevenly against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all of their \nkind comments on this legislation and also how they were complimentary, \nboth on the content and the bipartisan nature of it. We really only \nhave one unresolved issue and that is the amendment raised by our \ncolleague from New Hampshire. I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, \nwe admire his stewardship over Federal funds and his insistence on \naccountability. However, we think his amendment, though very well \nintentioned, is really misguided.\n  We are concerned, both on the basis of content and then also the \nconsequences for this legislation. Number one, if the Gregg amendment \nshould prevail, this could have the consequence of really killing this \nbill. This is a bill that has been arrived at through a very delicate \nbipartisan agreement, not only within our own institution but in the \nHouse. We are in the closing hours of the 106th Congress. If an \namendment is agreed to, we are going to have to have a conference or \nthis bill will go back to the House. Then the lid goes off and we will \nbe involved in a variety of other discussions. I think my colleagues \nknow that once you start talking you tend not to stop talking.\n  So we really encourage that people be aware this could sink the Older \nAmericans Act for the 106th Congress. I would so regret that because we \nhave worked so hard among ourselves with constituency groups and \nothers. Really, from the standpoint of process, I hope, one would \nreally look at this.\n  The second point is, in terms of the Gregg amendment itself, we are \nconcerned that it does not provide due process. What it would do is \nallow a preliminary finding from an agency other than the Department of \nLabor to stop an organization from running its jobs program. There \nwould be no opportunity to appeal or to be heard. There would be an \naudit by the IG or GAO, which would then serve as a final determinant. \nAudits are meant to raise questions, not to be a final determination. \nSo we would raise that as, really, a very serious question.\n  This amendment is not needed. Current law already prohibits using \nthese funds for lobbying or litigation against the Government. These \nare in well-known, well-circulated OMB circulars. Also, our own \nlegislation pending before the Senate already has pretty firm, strict, \nand clear accountability. It says if you don't meet the standards, you \nlose all or part of your grant. And then those funds not used, because \nyou have lost them, will be able to be competed for by other national \norganizations. This is a process for recompeting funds of a State or \nnonprofit agency or organization that does not meet established \nperformance standards. I believe the process will work, and we should \nnot interfere with it.\n  We believe we do have very firm accountability in this legislation. \nThese performance measures in this bill are simply this: If an \norganization or a State fails to meet these standards or improve its \nperformance, other entities will get the opportunity to competitively \nbid for a portion or all of the organization's grant. We establish a \nminimum amount that must be spent on enrollee wages and fringe \nbenefits. We clarify the way the organization must define and report \ntheir costs, so there is no room for ambiguity. We codify our own clear \nresponsibility tests and have very firm criteria for granting \neligibility. We require a broad planning process so the area of \ngreatest need within a State is served as efficiently and as \nspecifically as possible. These provisions will ensure seniors get the \nhigh-quality services they deserve, and taxpayers will get value for \ntheir dollar.\n  Also, know that in addition to what we have in this legislation, as I \nsaid, the Government already has Government-wide standards and \nprocedures, applicable to the suspension and debarment of any Federal \ncontractor and grant recipient. The NSCERC is currently engaged in an \naudit resolution process with DOL. All indications are that this \nprocess is working and we should not interfere with it.\n  Also, during the debate words were used such as ``slush fund,'' et \ncetera. I think that was a little harsh and inaccurate. Did the \nNational Senior Citizens Education Research Center have problems? You \nbet.\n  The Department of Labor did an audit. They found that there was no \nmalicious intent to defraud. There was no intent to be scum or scam. \nWhat they did was essentially have a certain program related to the HIP \nindemnity in the wrong category.\n  Do they owe the Federal Government some money? Yes. Is there \ndiscussion ongoing now about the most effective way to recapture that? \nYes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document giving the status of the \nNational\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\nSenior Citizens Education and Research Center grant program be printed \nin the Record, along with a letter from the Department of Labor \nessentially saying how all of this is currently going through a process \nand is coming to a satisfactory conclusion. Some serious mistakes were \nmade, but they were not malicious, they were not criminal, and they \nwere not intentional.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Status of the National Senior Citizens Education and Research Center \n                         Grant, October 5, 2000\n\n       The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) \n     provides community service employment opportunities to \n     economically disadvantaged senior citizens. The National \n     Senior Citizens Education and Research Center (NSCERC) is one \n     of 10 national grantees. It is funded for over $65.0 million, \n     which it subgrants to about 150 groups in 28 States, \n     including local governments, and nonprofit organizations. \n     This year it will provide positions to about 15,000 low-\n     income seniors.\n       Prior to 1996, the SCSEP program was operated by the \n     National Council of Senior Citizens, NCSC. As a result of \n     1995 legislation, NCSC as a 501(c)(4) organization became \n     ineligible to be a grantee. Consequently, a novation \n     agreement was made which transferred the grant to NSCERC, an \n     affiliated but separate 501(c)(3) organization.\n       An audit was conducted by the Department's Inspector \n     General (IG) of NCSC's program administration which covered a \n     three year period from July 1, 1992 thru June 30, 1995. The \n     audit was initiated by the IG as part of its regular \n     responsibility to audit federal employment programs. A Final \n     Determination was issued in March, 2000 disallowing nearly $5 \n     million. This determination is under appeal to the \n     Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges (ALJ's). The \n     ALJ's decision can be appealed to the Secretary.\n       ``About 78 percent of the disallowed costs are attributed \n     to NCSC's/NSCERC's treatment of the program's Hospital \n     Indemnity Insurance Plan (HIP) refunds and administrative \n     funds. Payments for participant insurance were charged to the \n     SCSEP grant. NCSC/NSCERC treated the refunds as royalty \n     income instead of program income, crediting the refunds to \n     the NCSC organization rather than to the SCSEP grant.''\n       The OIG has also conducted audits of the NCSC's/NSCERC's \n     grants for subsequent fiscal years. There are substantial \n     amounts of questioned costs for these years, as well. A large \n     portion of the questioned costs related to the same issue, \n     the proper application of HIP refunds. The Department, NCSC, \n     and its successor grantee NSCERC continue to work to resolve \n     issues related to these subsequent audits. On March 24, 2000, \n     the Department issued an Initial Determination on the second \n     audit, covering the period 7/1/95 to 6/30/96. This \n     determination proposes to disallow $1.3 million in direct \n     cost against both NCSC and NSCERC. The Department anticipates \n     issuing a final determination in the near future.\n       As a result of these audit findings the Department has \n     taken the following steps:\n       1. Payments for the hospital insurance indemnity plan, \n     which produced the refunds were phased out as of September \n     1999.\n       2. An escrow account has been established to receive \n     refunds and other insurance payments until a final resolution \n     can be reached on the audits. As of March 2000, the escrow \n     account totaled approximately $3.1 million.\n       3. A clear organizational separation was established \n     between NCSC and NSCERC. Each organization now has a separate \n     board and management.\n       4. The Department is committed to providing ``due process'' \n     and a fair and equitable resolution of the audit findings.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Labor, Assistant Secretary for \n           Employment and Training,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We are pleased to respond to your \n     request for information about the status of the agency \n     determinations with respect to the Department of Labor's \n     (DOL) Final Determination of the National Council of Senior \n     Citizens (NCSC) and National Senior Citizens Education and \n     Research Center (NSCERC) audits conducted by the DOL's Office \n     of the Inspector General (OIG).\n       Prior to 1996, NCSC operated a grant under the Senior \n     Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). Pursuant to \n     legislative and regulatory requirements, NCSC as a 501(c)(4) \n     organization became ineligible to be a grantee. Consequently \n     a novation agreement was made which transferred the grant to \n     NSCERC, an affiliated but separate 501(c)(3) organization.\n       The status of the DOL's Final Determination is as follows:\n       Background: The OIG issued an audit on February 3, 1999 \n     which covered the period from July 1, 1992 through June 30, \n     1995--with a total cost audited of $184,746,124. Of the \n     audited costs, $5,814,942 or 3.1 percent of the total grant \n     funds was questioned by the auditors.\n       Final Determinations: On March 2, 2000, ETA issued a Final \n     Determination disallowing $4,961,583 or 2.7 percent of the \n     total costs audited.\n       Current Status: The Final Determination was appealed to the \n     Office of Administrative Law Judges on March 20, 2000.\n       The OIG issued a second audit on September 24, 1999. The \n     resolution status of this audit is as follows:\n       Background: The audit covered the period from July 1, 1995 \n     through June 30, 1996 with a total cost audited of \n     $60,828,900. Of the audited costs, the auditors questioned \n     $2,250,828 or 3.7 percent; they also questioned the indirect \n     cost allocation base proposed by NCSC and NSCERC.\n       Initial Determination: On March 24, 2000, ETA issued an \n     Initial Determination proposing a disallowance of $1,262,607 \n     in direct costs and an undetermined amount of indirect costs \n     pending the negotiation of a Final Indirect Cost Agreement \n     between the Department of Labor, NCSC and NSCERC.\n       Current Status: The Department of Labor's Office of Cost \n     Determination is currently in negotiations with NCSC and \n     NSCERC to reach an agreement on the final indirect cost rate. \n     If an agreement is reached, a Final Determination will be \n     issued relating to the questioned direct costs only. If no \n     agreement is reached, a Final Determination will be issued \n     addressing both the direct and indirect questioned costs with \n     an indirect costs rate determined by the Office of Cost \n     Determination.\n       A third OIG audit was issued March 29, 2000. It covered the \n     period from July 1, 1996 through December 31, 1997. The \n     Department of Labor has not issued an Initial Determination, \n     pending a review of the indirect cost rate.\n       Should you or your staff have any questions, please contact \n     Raymond J. Uhalde, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor. Mr. \n     Uhalde can be reached at (202) 693-2700.\n       As a courtesy, I am sending a copy of this letter to Senate \n     Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman, \n     Senator Jeffords.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond J. Uhalde\n     (For Raymond L. Bramucci).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Good Reasons To Support SCSEP\n\n       The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) \n     authorized under Title V of the Older Americans Act should be \n     preserved and expanded for the following reasons:\n       1. The SCSEP is our country's only workforce development \n     program designed exclusively to maximize the productive \n     contributions of a rapidly growing older population through \n     training, retraining, and community service and is a good \n     model of success in the area of welfare-to-work programs. \n     History has taught us that mainstream employment and training \n     programs like JTPA and CETA are not successful in serving \n     older workers. A targeted approach is needed.\n       2. The SCSEP is primarily operated by private, nonprofit \n     national aging organizations that are customer-focused, \n     mission driven, and experienced in serving older, low-income \n     people. These nonprofit organizations work in close \n     partnership with the Governors, Department of Labor, aging \n     network, and employment and training system, actively \n     participating in One Stop Service initiatives designed to \n     streamline and integrate services.\n       3. The SCSEP is a critical part of the Older Americans Act, \n     balancing the dual goals of community service as well as \n     employment and training for low-income seniors. Many \n     nutrition programs and other services for seniors are \n     dependent on labor provided by SCSEP.\n       4. The SCSEP has consistently exceeded all goals \n     established by Congress and the Department of Labor, \n     surpassing the 20% placement goal for more than 15 years. \n     Virtually all appropriated funds are spent each grant year, \n     in stark contrast to similar programs.\n       5. The SCSEP is a means tested program, serving low-income \n     Americans age 55+. The program serves less than 1% of those \n     who are eligible; long waiting lists are common in most areas \n     of the country.\n       6. The SCSEP serves the oldest and poorest in our society, \n     and those most in need: 41% of enrollees are minorities--the \n     highest minority participation rate of any Older Americans \n     Act program; 73% are female; 36% are age 70 and older; 83% \n     are age 60 and older; 36% do not have a high school \n     education; and 11 % have disabilities.\n       7. The SCSEP ensures national responsiveness to local needs \n     by directly involving participants in meeting critical human \n     needs in their communities, from child and elder care to \n     public safety and environmental preservation. The SCSEP has \n     been a major contributor to national disaster relief efforts, \n     most recently resulting from floods in the midwest, \n     hurricanes in the southeast, and the California earthquakes.\n       8. The SCSEP has demonstrated high standards of performance \n     and fiscal accountability unique in government programs. Less \n     than 15% of funding is spent on administrative costs--one of \n     the lowest rates among federal programs.\n       9. The SCSEP historically has enjoyed strong public support \n     because it is based on the principles of personal \n     responsibility, lifelong learning, and service to community. \n     In addition, the program is extremely popular among \n     participants, host agencies, employers, communities, and the \n     membership of our nation's largest aging organizations.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the other point I want to make is we \nhave\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\nthe accountability. This is a good program, and it is hard to \nadminister. The Senior Community Service Employment Program is under \ntitle V. Do you know what it does? It helps old people of modest income \nfind work. This is not easy.\n  This program itself serves the oldest and poorest in our society. \nForty-one percent are minorities, the highest minority participation of \nany Older Americans Act program. This primarily helps women. Seventy \npercent of them are women. They are old. They are poor. They are trying \nto add extra money to hold body, soul, and prescription drugs together.\n  At the same time, 83 percent are over 60; 36 percent do not have a \nhigh school education; 11 percent have disabilities. This is a very \nintensive hands-on program to operate. It takes a lot of help to get \npeople ready for a job and a lot of professionalism to find the jobs \nfor them. By all accounts, all of the grantees have met those criteria.\n  I could go through example after example in my own State, but I will \ngive two. An 85-year-old woman is now a senior aide working as a \nlibrary assistant for $7.17 an hour. Another 71-year-old female was \nemployed as a customer service rep of one of our Maryland agencies \nbecause she had good manners and a good work ethic, and therefore they \ntaught her the skills to earn some extra money. These are the kinds of \npeople this program helps.\n  Many of the nonprofits that operate these programs operate with a \nvery low margin. This is a very cost-intensive and labor-intensive \nprogram to operate. I hope we defeat the Gregg amendment because: \nFirst, it is not necessary. We have good, tight accountability \nrequirements in the bill and responsibility. Second, it will kill the \nbill. And third, we do not need to add more bureaucracy, more shackles, \nmore audits, more paperwork just because we are cranky with one \norganization. Let's give them the chance to meet the responsibilities \nestablished by the Department of Labor and pay the money back, and \nlet's renew the Older Americans Act and leave this Senate with our \nheads held high that we defied the laws of inertia in this institution \nand reauthorized the Older Americans Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, the case has been very well stated by the Senators \nfrom Ohio, Vermont, and Maryland. I listened carefully to the points \nthe Senator from New Hampshire made earlier today. It is worthy for our \ncommittee to give consideration to these points. I thought the Senator \nfrom Ohio and others thoroughly explained how steps were already taken \nto address those issues and went into considerable detail in explaining \nthe provisions of the bill that will address the challenges which the \ngood Senator raised.\n  A great deal of time was taken by the committee to address those \nchallenges. I think the committee has done a good job in addressing \nthem. I do not think, therefore, that amendment is necessary to ensure \nthe interests of the elderly people, as well as the taxpayers.\n  We must remember that it is not unusual for auditors to identify \nexpenditures which do not conform with the terms of a grant, and for \nthe Department to require repayment of the disputed amounts. Disallowed \ncosts are usually nothing more than good-faith errors or honest \ndisagreements over the interpretation of the terms of a grant.\n  For example, during 1998, the Employment and Training Administration \nof the Department of Labor which administers title V of the Older \nAmericans Act, amongst the many workforce programs it supervises, \nreviewed 84 audits, examining $30 million in questioned costs, and \nultimately disallowed $18 million in grantee expenditures. The \ndisallowed costs included agencies of State and local governments, as \nwell as private organizations, and the disallowance of costs is a \nroutine part of supervision that in no way impugns the integrity of the \ngrantees involved.\n  The Gregg amendment is an extreme and unfair response to a problem \nwhich has already been remedied. The Department of Labor has already \ndisallowed the insurance royalty payments which were the major focus of \nthe inspector general's report on NCSC's Title V program grant, ordered \nthe financial practice in question terminated, and demanded repayment \nof the disallowed costs. The cost items which DOL has disallowed cover \nthe period between 1992 and 1996. The objectionable practices have been \nstopped. The matter is currently before an administrative law judge.\n  Furthermore, the legislation reported from the HELP Committee already \naddresses the financial accountability of title V program operators. It \nestablishes strong new performance measures which program operators \nmust meet each year, and provides for removal of operators who \nconsistently fail to meet performance standards. It sets strict limits \non the purposes for which the funds can be used. It sets forth in \nstatute a 14-point ``Responsibility Test'' which each program operator \nmust pass in order to be eligible to participate in the title V \nprograms. Section 514(d) requires a detailed examination of the \norganization's past performance in administering federal funds. The \nDepartment will have ample authority to disqualify those program \noperators whom it deems untrustworthy or unreliable. The procedures we \nhave established are tough and fair. After extensive review of the \nSenior Community Service Employment Program, the committee believes \nthat these new performance standards and responsibility tests will \neffectively protect the interest of both the senior citizens who \nparticipate in the program and the taxpayers who fund it.\n\n\n               senator gregg's ``dear colleague letter''\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire claimed in a ``Dear Colleague'' dated \nSeptember 27 that: ``Under current law, nine grantees--mostly aligned \nwith the Democratic Party and organized labor--receive over $400 \nmillion in federal grant dollars on a noncompetitive basis.'' This \nstatement is both factually inaccurate and highly misleading. Firstly, \nover $400 million does not go to private organizations under the Senior \nCitizens Community Employment Act. Of that amount, $96 million actually \ngoes directly to state government agencies, and an additional $28 \nmillion goes to the U.S. Forest Service. Secondly, the largest private \ngrantee is Green Thumb, which receives $107 million each year. Green \nThumb's principal activity is operating senior employment programs and \nits political involvement is minimal. AARP receives $51 million and the \nNational Council on the Aging receives $38 million. They are broadbased \nadvocacy groups for senior concerns, not aligned with any political \nparty. Another $38 million is divided amongst four organizations \nfocused on serving low income minorities--African-Americans, Hispanics, \nAsians, and American Indians, and $15 million is provided to the \nNational Urban League to support its senior employment efforts.\n  The National Council of Senior Citizens, which the Senator from New \nHampshire has so sharply criticized, receives less than 15 percent of \nthe total appropriation for title V. While I certainly disagree with \nthe allegations he has leveled against NCSC, it would be grossly unfair \nto impugn the legitimacy of the entire Senior Community Service \nEmployment Program based on those allegations even if his claims about \nNCSC were accurate. The same organizations which are receiving funds \ntoday to operate senior employment programs were selected to operate \nthose programs in the Reagan and Bush administrations, as well as in \nthe current administration. The facts clearly demonstrate that these \nprogram operators were not selected because of their partisan \n``alignment,'' as the ``Dear Colleague'' letter implies. They have been \nselected because of their strong track record of delivering employment \nservices to seniors.\n\n\n                          ncsc/nscerc programs\n\n  As I noted earlier, the inspector general reports which the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire discussed cover the period from 1992 to 1996. In \nfact, NCSC has not been the recipient of grants to operate senior \nemployment programs since that time. As a result of legislation passed \nby Congress in 1995, NCSC as a 501(c0(4) organization became ineligible \nto be a grantee. A new 501(c)(3) organization, the National Senior \nCitizens Education and Research Center (NSCERC) was established to \nreceive the grant and operate the program. Federal funds received by \nNSCERC have been used by NSCERC to operate the senior employment \nprogram. Thus,\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\nthe activities, political and otherwise, which NCSC may have engaged in \nsince that time are not relevant to the operation of the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment program in any way.\n  Let's look at the program which NSCERC operates and the impact it has \non the lives of thousands of older Americans each year. One hundred and \nforty-four senior employment projects are operated by NSCERC in 27 \nstates and the District of Columbia. More than 15,500 seniors are \nenrolled in these programs each year, working in public and non-profit \norganizations. Most of these older workers would be living below the \npoverty line but for this program. Three quarters of them are women and \nhalf are minorities. A third of them never graduated from high school. \nWithout this program it would be extremely difficult for them to find \nemployment. This program makes an enormous difference in their lives. \n(Worker Profiles).\n\n  The impact of the program extends far beyond the seniors who are \nemployed in it. They perform a broad variety of community services, \nincluding teaching children as aides in schools and day care centers, \nperforming clerical work in libraries and in government and charitable \norganization offices, delivering meals to homebound elderly, assisting \nwith in-home health care services, and driving senior citizen transport \nvans. Their work touches the lives of countless people--the very young \nand the very old, the sick, the frail, and the disabled. We should not \nmake light of their contributions, nor of the importance of the non-\nprofit senior employment program operators who make the program \npossible.\n  Let me give you a few examples. NSCERC works with the Flint Michigan \nCommunity School system and operates a Senior AIDES project in the \nschools. Dr. James E. Ray, the Superintendent of Community Education \nexplains the importance of the program:\n\n       Flint Community Schools and NSCERC have piloted a unique \n     Title V intergenerational tutor training program. This \n     initiative has proven to be very successful in meeting the \n     educational and emotional needs of our at-risk elementary \n     school children, while at the same time providing income \n     assistance and social purpose for low-income senior citizens. \n     It has been so successful in fact that a consultant for the \n     U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) recommended that DOL partner \n     with the U.S. Department of Education to expand the program \n     nationwide.\n\n  NSCERC works with the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation in Los \nAngeles to help Hispanic children bridge the language barrier. Martin \nCastro, president of the foundation, describes the program:\n\n       Since 1978, our agency, the Mexican American Opportunity \n     Foundation, has operated three Title V Programs through \n     contractual agreements with the National Council of Senior \n     Citizens and now with the National Senior Citizens Education \n     and Research Center. Our three Senior AIDES Programs, with a \n     combined enrollment of almost 300 Senior Aides, have provided \n     thousands of Hispanic elderly with the opportunity to remain \n     in the workforce while simultaneously increasing their skills \n     to obtain unsubsidized employment . . . This partnership has \n     allowed our organization to develop a comprehensive \n     intergenerational model in teaching preschool children in a \n     bilingual and bicultural environment. It has allowed our \n     preschool children in East Los Angeles, the majority of whom \n     speak only Spanish, to learn English by the time they enter \n     Kindergarten. Senior Aides assigned to our child care centers \n     have contributed enormously to the success of this teaching \n     model.\n\n  NSCERC and its predecessor NCSC have worked with Seniors Inc. in \nColorado to operate that state's largest program. Seniors Inc.'s \nexecutive director Lewis Kallas explains the significance of NSCERC's \nparticipation:\n\n       Seniors Inc. is Colorado's largest Title V local sponsor \n     with 225 senior positions in 18 countries. We have contracted \n     with Colorado's Aging Services Division and NSCERC to \n     effectively administer the Title V Program since 1970. Our \n     long and positive relationship and experiences with NCSC, and \n     now NSCERC, have resulted in a Colorado program that serves \n     as a national model. Much of this success is directly \n     attributed to the National Council of Senior Citizens and \n     NSCERC. These national organizations do business with one \n     thing in mind--the needs of older and vulnerable senior \n     citizens--My insight is not in passing; but rather historic \n     and based upon real experiences that I now have enhanced the \n     lives of thousands of low-income Colorado seniors.\n\n  While the prime purpose of the program is to fund community service \nemployment for low income seniors, it also helps to train these workers \nand place many of them in unsubsidized jobs. Of the nine national \norganizations and fifty states that operate senior employment programs, \nNSCERC has one of the highest success rates in placing senior workers \nin unsubsidized jobs. It has the third highest placement rate amongst \nnational organizations, and its placement rate is higher than the rates \nachieved by 41 of the states. (1998)\n\n\n                          ``disallowed costs''\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has made it sound as if having \n``disallowed costs'' means a program operator has engaged in serious \nmisconduct. That is simply not an accurate portrayal. Agencies which \nreceive substantial federal grants are audited routinely. It is not \nunusual for the auditors to identify expenditures which do not conform \nwith the terms of a grant, and for the Department to require repayment \nof the disputed amounts. ``Disallowed costs'' are usually nothing more \nthan good faith errors or honest disagreements over the interpretation \nof the terms of a grant. For example, between 1997 and 1999, the \nEmployment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor, \nwhich administers title V of the Older Americans Act amongst the many \nworkforce programs it supervises, reviewed 71 audits--examining $102.4 \nmillion in questioned costs out of $1.9 billion in federal grants \nexamined, and ultimately disallowing $76.8 million in grantee \nexpenditures. The percentage of costs questioned by the inspector \ngeneral was 5.3 percent, and the percentage disallowed by the \nDepartment of Labor was 4.0 percent. The grantees found to have \n``disallowed costs'' included agencies of State and local governments \nas well as numerous private organizations. The disallowance of costs is \na routine part of grant supervision, and in no way impugns the \nintegrity of the grantees involved.\n  The inspector general's audit which questioned certain expenditures \nby NCSC covered the fiscal years 1992 through 1995. The audit was \ncompleted in February of 1999. Based on that audit, the Department of \nLabor issued its final determination disallowing $5 million in costs \nover the three year period. During that period, NCSC had received \napproximately $180 million in funding for the operation title V \nprograms. Thus, the amount disallowed constituted less than 3 percent \nof the federal funds which NCSC received during that period. Most of \nthe disputed amount involved one administrative practice by NCSC which \nwas disapproved by the auditors. A subsequent audit covering fiscal \nyear 1996 led to an initial determination of $1.3 million in disallowed \ncosts for that period. Most of the disallowance arose from the same \ndisputed administrative practice. Again, this disallowance involved \nless than 3 percent of the $61 million in funding which the \norganization received to operate title V programs.\n  The administrative practice which gave rise to the disallowances \ninvolved payments from a health insurance company which provided \ncoverage to NCSC members and to title V program participants. The \nhealth insurance premiums for senior citizens participating in the \ntitle V program were properly paid from the title V grant. Under the \nterms of the policy, the insurance company made a payment to NCSC at \nthe end of each year based upon the profit it made on the account \nduring that year. NCSC viewed those payments as ``royalties'' for the \nuse of the organization's name by the insurer in soliciting business. \nSuch royalties would belong to the organization. The DOL auditors \nviewed those payments as ``rebates.'' If they were rebates, then the \nportion attributable to title V participants should have been credited \nto the federal grant. The treatment of those payments from the insurer \nconstitutes an overwhelming majority (approximately 80 percent of the \ncosts which DOL has disallowed).\n  When the issue of these disputed payments from the insurance company \nwas raised by the first inspector general's Report in early 1999, the \npractice was stopped. Federal funds have not been used to purchase \ninsurance for more than one year. Over $3 million has been placed by \nNCSC in an escrow account to cover a portion of the reimbursement which \nthe Department of Labor is seeking. The issue of whether the payments \nwere ``royalties'' or ``rebates'' is currently pending before an \nadministrative law judge. Like all disputes regarding disallowed costs, \nthis case will\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nbe resolved through the established legal process. Congressional \nintervention in that legal process would be wrong. The administrative \npractice which the auditors objected to is no longer taking place. It \nwas terminated more than one year ago. No congressional action is \nneeded to prevent this practice from occurring in the future. Any \nattempt to change the law retroactively or to impose harsh additional \npenalties after the fact would be unfair and unconstitutional. Congress \nis expressly prohibited from passing ex post facto laws, and that is \nwhat the Gregg amendment would be.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  There are governmentwide regulations established by the Office of \nManagement and Budget which set forth the standards for debarring a \ngrantee from further participation in a federal program. The \ndisallowance of costs in the NCSC/NSCERC matter is not the type of \nincident which would even remotely justify debarment under the existing \nrules. There is no rational basis for establishing a different \ndebarment standard for title V of the Older Americans Act than for \nevery other program in the federal government. Yet, that is what the \nGregg amendment would do. It would set a much harsher standard and \napply that standard retroactively. The amendment should be soundly \nrejected.\n  The rules governing debarment should remain uniform throughout the \nfederal system. These rules certainly should not be changed \nretroactively for one program.\n  The Senate should not allow this issue to jeopardize passage of the \nOlder Americans Act, which is so important to the well-being of so many \nsenior citizens across America. The legislation before you represents a \ndelicate consensus which has been reached across the aisle and between \nthe Chambers. Its provisions have been carefully negotiated over a 2-\nyear period. It is supported by the National Governors' Association and \nby more than 40 senior citizens organizations. The House of \nRepresentatives has already passed it. The Gregg amendment would \nunravel that consensus. If the Gregg amendment were to pass, the Older \nAmericans Act would not be reauthorized this year. We should not allow \nthis narrow issue to stand in the way of a very important bill. We owe \nit to millions of seniors to look at the big picture--to reauthorize \nthe Older Americans Act and to create the National Family Caregiver \nProgram.\n  So I again commend all of our colleagues, the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator DeWine, and particularly the good work of the \nSenator from Maryland. Their work has been indispensable.\n  I think we have a very solid piece of legislation. I hope we will get \nan overwhelming vote in the Senate in support of it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield me time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Five minutes is fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me \nsome time to make some comments on this very important legislation.\n  The Older Americans Act is a piece of legislation that is incredibly \nimportant, not only to the 14 percent of all Americans who are legally \nclassified as being elderly--those who are over the age of 65--but it \nis a piece of legislation that is incredibly important, not only to \nthem but also to their children, to their grandchildren, and to other \nmembers of their family and friends who are concerned that, while we \nmake great strides in technology in this country in keeping people \nliving longer, it is also extremely important we recognize that just \nhaving medical technology to allow people to live longer is not as \nimportant as also making sure we allow them to live better.\n  It is one thing to live longer, but if you are living longer in \nconditions that are not what we, as Americans, think are ideal, \nsometimes people wonder whether, in fact, it is really worth it.\n  So the Older Americans Act clearly addresses some of these types of \nissues and questions about how do we, with medical science, as a \nsociety, allow our citizens to enjoy living longer lives but also \nliving better, more fruitful lives in their golden years.\n  Part of that is the Older Americans Act, which provides, in many \ncases, some of the services that allow people to live better lives. It \nreally is a wonder that this act is supported not only by seniors in \nthis country but, I think, by most Americans by a very large margin. It \nhas not been reauthorized in over 5 years. People would say: What is \nthe matter, Congress? Don't you realize the importance and the numbers \nof older Americans who depend on this particular piece of legislation?\n  In many cases, they depend on it for their transportation because \nmany seniors are homebound and have no way of getting around. It is a \nprogram that provides hot meals delivered to the homes of seniors who \ndo not have the ability to go outside their home for meals. That is \nextremely important. It is a program that encourages the employment of \nmore and more seniors in the workforce, which is incredibly important \nat a time when we actually have a labor shortage in this country. It \nhas been shown, very clearly, that the shortfall can be made up, in \nmany cases, by talented, experienced, learned seniors who can \ncontribute to the workforce past their normal retirement years.\n  It is a program that provides assistance for adult day care, which is \nextremely important now, as more and more of the traditional caregivers \nare working themselves. It is a program that helps provide adult day \ncare for seniors in this country, which is incredibly important.\n\n  It is a program that addresses the question of abuse prevention, and \nhelps elders in this country to know what their civil rights are to \nmake sure they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous \ntelemarketers, for instance.\n  All of those things are done by the Older Americans Act, which \nexpired 5 years ago.\n  Finally, today, this body--and the House did a couple days ago, I \nthink--will be able to reauthorize this very important program.\n  I am delighted that part of the program contains legislation that I \nhave introduced called the National Caregiver Program. I introduced it \nalong with Senator Chuck Grassley and other distinguished Members of \nthe Senate. This is now going to be part of the Older Americans Act.\n  If I may take a moment to say what the National Caregiver Program \ndoes, I think it addresses something that is an incredibly serious \nproblem, and one that is growing every day, of the so-called ``sandwich \ngeneration''--those adults in this country who are trying to raise \nsmall children but also are having to divide up their time by helping \nto take care of their senior parents. That is a very serious problem \nfor many Americans--making sure I am taking care of my children, that I \nam raising them properly, but that I am also taking care of my parents \nwho have given me so much and it is now time for me to help them in \ntheir golden years.\n  The National Caregiver Program will provide $125 million a year. It \nis an authorization to provide assistance for all of those who are \ncaring for an aging parent or an aging spouse, for instance, in their \nhome. I think this is very important and something that this \nlegislation, for the first time, will make available.\n  We have had hearings in Louisiana by the aging committee, of which I \nserve as the ranking Democratic member, with Chairman Chuck Grassley. \nWe are told there are about 22 million families in America who are \nstruggling every day in their lives to provide care for their children \nand at the same time trying to balance that with caring for a senior \nparent or a senior spouse.\n  The National Caregiver Program that is now part of this legislation \nwill provide information to these families about available services of \nwhich many of them are not aware. This program will offer individual \ncounseling to these family caregivers about support groups and how you \ngo about making caregiving work more efficiently and better.\n  It will provide respite care, which is so incredibly important. \nSometimes families who are providing 24-hour-a-day care, 7 days a week, \n12 months out of the year for their children, and are trying to do it \nfor their parents as well--in the same home--quite frankly,\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\nneed a break. They need a rest from this 24-hour-a-day burden, which \nthey are happy to do. It is a joy to be able to be in a position to \nprovide this type of service. But every now and then you simply need a \nbreak.\n  The National Caregiver Program will be able to provide what we call \nrespite care, to give someone a break, to get out of the house, to go \nout with their family and enjoy a meal outside of the home, or to take \na child to a school function, knowing that someone will be there to \ntake care of their adult family member who still resides in their home. \nAlso, it can provide some other supplemental services, which I happen \nto think is incredibly important.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues--both on the Republican side as well as on \nour side of the aisle--this is good legislation. It is important \nlegislation. Everywhere I went in Louisiana over the past couple days, \nI spoke with senior groups and aging councils, and they all asked the \nsame question: Senator, when is Congress going to get around to passing \nthe Older Americans Act? For the life of me, I never had a good reason \nto tell them why we have not done it before.\n  Is this a program that has some things that are not run 100 percent \ncorrectly? We have had examples of that in the past, but you cannot \ntell me a Federal program that can't be improved upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask for 2 more minutes, if that is all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me conclude by saying there were problems in the \nprogram back in the early 1990s that are being corrected--have been \ncorrected. I think the fact is, Congress is showing that we are going \nto provide careful and adequate oversight to this program. I think it \nis very important. We, on the aging committee, have spent an incredible \namount of time, under Chairman Grassley's leadership, looking at \nprograms that benefit seniors. We are making sure we have GAO looking \nat these programs, and making sure they are run properly. I can tell \nyou, they are getting a great deal more scrutiny than they have had in \nthe past. The end result is that we have a better program than we had \nback in the early 1990s.\n  It is essential. It is important. It is necessary. It has widespread, \nacross-the-board support. I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator \nKennedy for at last being able to bring this to the floor of the \nSenate. They eliminated all the roadblocks. I think this is well on its \nway to passing as a clean bill. I strongly support it and strongly \noppose any amendments which would probably result in the bill not \npassing because of the lateness of the hour. I add my strong voice to \nthe support of those who know this is the right thing to do and the \nright time to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Vermont on the \nfloor. If he wanted to make some other remarks on this legislation, I \nwould certainly yield for that purpose, if I could get the floor back \nafter he has concluded. I want to address the Senate on another related \nmatter on health care.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield then to the Senator from Vermont and ask \nunanimous consent that after he concludes, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first thank all Members for the \nsupport they have given to this legislation during the period it has \nbeen under consideration. It has been a long time, some 8 years now, \nfor those of us who have been strong in wanting to get it revised and \ntake a good look at it. Eight years is long enough.\n  I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his long-term efforts \nto reauthorize the act. As the chairman of the Aging Subcommittee \nduring the last Congress, Senator Gregg was instrumental in bringing to \nlight many of the improvements that are now included in this bill.\n  Let me be clear about the changes that have been made to the Senior \nEmployment programs in this bill, the effort that has gone into \ncrafting this balanced agreement, and the broad support this compromise \nenjoys.\n  This act makes significant reforms to the Senior Employment Program. \nThat is where the problems have been. It focuses the purposes of \nemployment programs on enrollee economic self-sufficiency and on \nunsubsidized employment in the public and private sectors. It \ncoordinates SCEP with the Workforce Investment Act programs. That is \nimportant. Importantly, it implements stringent eligibility and \naccountability tests for all grant applicants. Administrative and \nprogram costs are now defined in statute and capped so that resources \nare directed into employment services for the elderly.\n  The bill includes new cost controls that will prevent the misuse of \nfunds by grantees. It also would require at least 75 percent of a \ngrantee's funds be used for enrollee wages and benefits, and the bill \nexplicitly states that the funds a grantee receives must be used solely \nfor the employment program.\n  Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee to comply with OMB \ncirculars and rules and requires the grantees to maintain records \nsufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that funds have not \nbeen spent unlawfully.\n  The bill institutes and requires performance outcome measures, annual \ngrantee evaluations, grantee accountability, and it creates a new grant \ncompetition for those not meeting performance measures.\n  It provides Governors and States greater resources and influence over \njob slot allocations, but also requires broad stakeholder participation \nin a State Senior Employment Services Plan coordinated through the \nGovernors' offices.\n  This bill marks a landmark agreement between the States and the \ngrantee providers of jobs. The bill allocates new funding above the \ncurrent level of effort such that any increases up to $35 million will \nbe divided 75 percent to States and 25 percent to other grantees; \namounts above $35 million would be divided 50/50. This was very \nimportant to the States and a good compromise.\n  Finally, grantees will be required to serve seniors or they will lose \ntheir grant. Our bill introduces performance measures and competition \ninto the senior employment program for the first time. The bill would \nestablish a ``three strikes and you're out'' policy to ensure \nperformance goals are met.\n  Failure to meet performance measures will first result in technical \nassistance and will require the grantee to come up with a plan on how \nit will meet performance measures in the future.\n  Failure to meet performance standards a second consecutive year will \nresult in a loss of 25 percent of the grant, which will be \ncompetitively bid in an open competition.\n  Failure to meet performance standards a third consecutive year will \ncut off the grantee from the program, and the grant will be \ncompetitively bid in an open competition.\n  Failure of a public and private nonprofit agency grantee to meet \nperformance measures in an individual state will also lead to the loss \nof the grant, which will then be competitively bid in an open \ncompetition.\n  These reforms significantly improve the Older Americans Act, protect \nthe taxpayers and, and provide seniors with a jobs program that works. \nFailure to pass these reforms this year will maintain the status quo. \nIt will only continue a system that does not serve the job placement \nneeds of seniors in many states, and will not correct the deficiencies \nin the administration and planning of the program. The only way these \nimprovements will be realized is to pass the Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2000, a bipartisan, bicameral initiative.\n  The bill will bring agreement for the first time in almost 10 years. \nIt is supported by the National Governors Association, the Southern \nGovernors Association, the Administration, and over 40 national aging \ngroups. Yesterday, the House passed this measure on a vote of 405-2. \nThis measure has 73 cosponsors in the Senate.\n  This is a delicate compromise, and any further amendments to this \nmeasure will surely prevent it from being enacted this year. I urge all \nof my colleagues to vote against any amendments and join in the \nbipartisan and bicameral effort to pass the Older Americans Act.\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11064-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11064-S11067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CREDIBILITY GAP IN HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few, if any, issues are of greater \nconcern to American families than quality, affordable health care. \nAmericans want an end to HMO abuses. They want good health insurance \ncoverage. They want a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens \nunder Medicare. They want to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so that \nit will be there for both today's and tomorrow's senior citizens. And \nthey want these priorities not only for themselves and their loved ones \nbut for every American, because they know that good health care should \nbe a basic right for all.\n  The choice in this election is clear, and it is not just a choice \nbetween different programs. it is also a choice based on who can be \ntrusted to do the right thing for the American people. Al Gore's record \nand his program are clear. He has been deeply involved in health care \nthroughout his career.\n  The current administration has made significant progress in improving \nhealth care in a variety of ways--from expanding health insurance to \nprotecting Medicare. He has consistently stood for patients and against \npowerful special interests.\n  Al Gore lays out a constructive, solid program that is consistent \nwith his solid record. He is for expanding insurance coverage to all \nAmericans, starting with children and their parents. He is for a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights. He has a sensible plan for adding \nprescription drug coverage to Medicare. He will fight to preserve \nMedicare, without unacceptable changes designed to undermine Medicare \nand force senior citizens into HMOs and private insurance plans.\n  George W. Bush's approach is very different. His proposals are deeply \nflawed. But even worse than the specifics of his proposals is his \nfailure to come clean with the American people about his record in \nTexas or about his own proposals.\n  On health care, George Bush doesn't just have a credibility gap. He \nhas a credibility chasm. He has consistently stood with the powerful \nagainst the people. He refuses to take on the drug companies, the \ninsurance companies, or the HMOs. His budget plan puts tax cuts for the \nwealthy ahead of every other priority, and leaves no room for needed \ninvestments in American families. On health care, his values are not \nthe values of the American people.\n  On the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, George Bush said in the \nthird debate that he did support a national Patients' Bill of Rights. \nHe said he wanted all people covered. He said that he was in favor of a \npatients' right to sue, as provided under Texas law. He said he brought \nRepublicans and Democrats together in the State of Texas to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  That's what he said. But the reality is very different. Governor Bush \nvetoed the first Patients' Bill of Rights passed in Texas. He fought to \nmake the second bill as narrow and limited as possible. He was so \nopposed to the provision allowing patients to sue their HMOs that he \nrefused to sign the final bill, allowing it to become law without his \nsignature. That's not the record of a person who is candid about where \nhe stands and what he has done. And it's not a record that recommends \nhim for national office for any citizen concerned about a strong, \neffective Patients' Bill of Rights. It's the record of a candidate who \nstands with powerful insurance companies and HMOs, not with American \nfamilies. And it isn't a record that shows leadership, either. In \nCongress, the House of Representatives passed a good Patients' Bill of \nRights by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. That bill is supported by \nall the organizations of doctors, nurses, and patients. No other \nproposal enjoys support from any of those groups. Yet it remains mired \nin the Senate because of the adamant opposition of the Senate \nRepublican leadership.\n\n  On the most recent vote on this bill, we were one vote shy of having \na majority. Governor Bush is now the leader of his party. One phone \ncall from Governor Bush to Trent Lott and that bill would be law today. \nBut Governor Bush has declined to make that call, just as he has \ndeclined to support the Patients' Bill of Rights itself.\n  Yesterday, my good friend from Texas stated that the only reason \nGovernor Bush vetoed that first bill and let the right to sue under the \nsecond program become law without his signature was that there was a \ndisagreement on how much the caps on pain and suffering would be. I \nregret that my colleague has been misled. The fact is there was no \nprovision for lawsuits in the first Patients' Bill of Rights bill \nvetoed by the Governor. To reiterate, there was no provision for \nlawsuits at all in the first bill, yet the Governor vetoed it.\n  In the second bill, there also was no issue about the caps on pain \nand suffering. Texas already had caps on pain and suffering under their \nexisting general tort law, and everybody assumed those caps would apply \nto lawsuits against HMOs. There was never any discussion of this issue. \nThe fact is that Mr. Bush, despite what he may say today, simply \ndoesn't believe health plans should be held accountable. That is why he \nrefused to sign the law allowing suits against HMOs. Once again, he \ndistorted his record in Texas, and both the record and distortions call \ninto serious questions where he would stand as President.\n  In the course of the debate yesterday, my colleagues from Texas said \nthey were tired of hearing Texas ``trashed''. They implied that I had \nsaid offensive things about their State. Let me be clear. I think Texas \nis a wonderful State. I have many good friends in Texas. Texas has \nproduced statesmen who have made our country a better place--from Sam \nHouston to Lyndon Johnson. It produces much of the oil that keeps our \ncountry running. I have no quarrel with the State of Texas. My quarrel \nis with George W. Bush's distortion of his record in Texas. My quarrel \nis with the priorities that the Bush record in Texas demonstrates. My \nquarrel is with the idea that the interests of powerful special \ninterests are more important than the interests of patients. My quarrel \nis with the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy are more important than \nhealth care for children.\n  On health insurance, the record is equally clear and equally bleak. \nGovernor Bush claims he wants insurance for all Americans. He blames \nVice President Gore for the growth in the number of uninsured. Governor \nBush's record in Texas is one of the worst in the country. Texas has \nthe second highest proportion of uninsured Americans in the country. It \nhas the second highest proportion of uninsured children in the country. \nYet Governor Bush has not only done nothing to address this problem, he \nhas actually fought against solutions. In Texas, he placed a higher \npriority on large, new tax breaks for the oil industry instead of good \nhealth care for children and their families.\n  When Congress passed the Child Health Insurance Program in 1997, we \nput affordable health insurance for children within the reach of every \nmoderate- and low-income working family. Yet George Bush's Texas was \none of the last States in the country to fully implement the law. \nDespite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, \nGovernor Bush actually fought to keep eligibility as narrow as \npossible.\n\n  In fact, the Bush campaign's defense of this unacceptable record is \nalmost as telling as the record itself. According to the New York \nTimes, the Bush campaign acknowledges that Governor Bush had fought to \nkeep eligibility narrow, but that he did so because he was concerned \nabout costs and the spillover effect on Medicaid. This so-called \nspillover effect is the increase in enrollment of Medicaid-eligible \nchildren that occurs when the Children's Health Insurance Program is \nput into effect. Vigorous outreach efforts by State governments would \nidentify children who qualify for the new program, and many other \nchildren would also be identified who qualify for Medicaid.\n  In other words, Governor Bush not only opposed expanding eligibility \nfor the new program, he was worried that uninsured children eligible \nfor Medicaid might actually receive the coverage to which they were \nalready entitled. It is no wonder his Texas administration was cited by \na Federal judge for its failure to live up to a consent order to let \nfamilies of poor children know\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nabout their eligibility to enroll their children in Medicaid and about \nthe health services to which they were entitled.\n  An article in Time magazine says it all. It is titled ``Tax Cuts \nBefore Tots. Candidate Bush is pushing his compassion, but poor kids in \nTexas have not seen much of it.'' Under a box entitled ``Lost \nOpportunity? Bush and Poor Kids,'' the author makes the following \npoints:\n\n       Bush helped to secure tax cuts by underfunding Medicaid, \n     causing a $400 million shortfall in the program. He delayed \n     on State law to expand Medicaid coverage for 303,000 new \n     kids. They went five years without health insurance. He \n     fought efforts to require automatic coverage for families \n     forced off welfare rolls.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. That isn't the Senator from Massachusetts \ntalking, that is Time magazine and their conclusion based upon the \nfacts in Texas.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Texas offered all sorts of explanations \nfor Governor Bush's miserable record with regard to covering children. \nShe said the court case I referred to was begun before Governor Bush \ntook office. That is true, but the consent decree settling the case was \nagreed to by Governor Bush's administration in February of 1996. And \nthe recent action by the Federal judge was based on the Bush \nadministration's failure to live up to the consent decree to which it \nagreed. The Bush administration did not keep its word. Children were \nsimply not its priority.\n  She said Texas could not implement the CHIP program promptly because \nits legislature only meets every 2 years. But other States have \nlegislatures that meet every 2 years and they were able to get their \nprograms going more promptly. In fact, Texas was the next to last State \nin the whole country to approve the CHIP program.\n  Now my colleagues yesterday and my friend from New Mexico today \nraised a red herring in trying to defend the indefensible. They claimed \nthat I criticized Governor Bush for failing to spend all his CHIP money \nand said that 40 other states had not spent their full allotment. I did \nnothing of the kind. many states had difficulty in implementing the \nprogram promptly and fully enough to spend all their allotted funds. \nBut they did not delay for almost three years in passing their \nprograms. They do not set up barriers that make it difficult for \nchildren that enroll. They do not put a higher priority on tax cuts \nthan children's health. Their Governors, by and large, did not fight to \nkeep eligibility narrow instead of broad. But Governor Bush has done \nall these things, and then he tries to mislead the American people \nabout his record.\n  The fact is that Bush's shoddy record on children goes well beyond \nCHIP. Far more uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid than CHIP, \nand Bush fought efforts to get them enrolled. He fought a bill to \nprovide for automatic re-enrollment in Medicaid of children whose \nparents lose cash welfare payments. Texas remains one of only ten \nstates that impose an assets requirement on children seeking Medicaid \neligibility, and it is one of just a handful of states that require \nparents to go in person to the welfare office to apply for their \nchildren. In fact, Governor Bush's record is so bad that, although \nTexas has more than one million children who are uninsured, Texas is \none of the few states where the number of children enrolled in CHIP or \nMedicaid actually declined in 1999.\n  When it comes to health care for children, George W. Bush gives new \nmeaning to the term ``compassionate conservative.'' Based on his \nrecord, he is compassionate because he claims to understand the pain of \nuninsured children and their families, and he is conservative because \nhe won't do anything about it.\n  Governor Bush's misstatement of his Texas record does not end with \nuninsured children. In the debates, Vice-President Gore pressed \nGovernor Bush on the Texas record on the uninsured. Governor Bush said \nthat Texas was spending $4.7 billion a year for uninsured people. But \nit turns out that actually only one-quarter of that amount was being \nspent by the State of Texas. The vast majority of the spending was by \nhospitals, doctors, and county governments.\n  On the Texas record on the uninsured, Governor Bush stated that the \npercentage of the uninsured in Texas had gone down, while the \npercentage of the uninsured in America has gone up. In fact, in 1994, \nwhen Governor Bush took office, the percent of the uninsured in Texas \nwas 24.2. By 1998, that percentage had increased--not decreased--to \n24.5. The number of the uninsured had grown by 300,000. In 1998, the \noverall percentage of the uninsured dropped by identical amounts both \nnationally and in Texas--4.9 percent in Texas and 4.9 percent \nnationally.\n  But, because of Governor Bush's inaction on children, the percentage \nof children who were uninsured dropped almost twice as much nationally \nas in Texas--10 percent nationally and only 5.2 percent in Texas. When \nGovernor Bush took office, Texas ranked second from the bottom of all \n50 states in covering children and citizens of all ages. Today, after \nsix years under his watch, Texas still ranks second from the bottom.\n  Perhaps the most ominous revelation about Governor Bush's true \nattitude to this issue came in the third debate, when he said, ``It's \none thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.''\n  Insurance a Washington term?\n  Governor Bush should try telling that to hard-working families in \nTexas and across the country who don't take their children to the \ndoctor when they have a sore throat or fever because they can't afford \nthe medical bill.\n  He should try telling that to the young family whose hopes for the \nfuture are wrecked when a breadwinner dies or is disabled because an \nillness was not diagnosed and treated in time. He should try telling \nthat to the elderly couple whose hopes for a dignified retirement are \nswept away on a tidal-wave of medical debt.\n  He should tell that to the 200,000 families who are forced into \nbankruptcy every year because of medical bills they cannot pay. He \nshould tell that to the nine million families who spend more than one-\nfifth of their income on medical costs. He should tell that to the \nparents of the four hundred thousand children suffering from asthma who \nnever see a doctor--to the parents of the five hundred thousand \nchildren with recurrent earaches who never see a doctor--and to the \nparents of the more than five hundred thousand children with severe \nsore throats who never see a doctor. Mr. President, he should tell that \nto the 27,000 uninsured women who are diagnosed with breast cancer \nevery year--and are 50 percent more likely to die of the illness, \nbecause they are uninsured. He should tell that to the 83,000 Americans \nwho die every year because they are uninsured and, as a result, do not \nreceive timely or adequate medical use.\n\n  Insurance is far more than just a Washington term. It's a Main Street \nterm in every community in America, and its lack of availability is a \ncrisis for millions of families across the country.\n  Prescription drug coverage under Medicare is another major aspect of \nthe health care challenges facing America. Few issues are more \nimportant to senior citizens and their families. They deserve a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare--and we should provide it in a \nway that strengthens the promise of Medicare, not in a way that breaks \nthat promise and breaks faith with the elderly.\n  The differences between Vice-President Gore and Governor Bush on this \nissue are fundamental. Governor Bush stands with the big drug \ncompanies, and Vice-President Al Gore stands with senior citizens. But \nGovernor Bush has sought at every turn to blur the differences between \ntheir two plans in a way that is so misleading as to make a mockery of \nhis own attacks on the Vice-President's credibility.\n  Vice-President Gore laid out his vision for Medicare in clear terms. \nHe wants a guarantee--a lock-box--to assure that the current Medicare \nsurplus will be used only for Medicare--and not diverted to other \npurposes. He wants to use some of the surplus to strengthen Medicare \nand keep it solvent for the future. He wants an immediate prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare that will benefit all senior citizens, not \njust very low income seniors. He wants to assure that senior citizens \nwho prefer to stay with the current Medicare program and retain the \nright to choose their own doctors are not penalized for that choice or \ncoerced into joining an HMO.\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n  In spite of direct challenges from Vice-President Gore, Governor Bush \nrefused to endorse a lock-box. It's not part of his priorities, and the \nreason is clear. He needs to use some of Medicare's surplus to finance \nhis massive tax cuts for the rich.\n  Vice-President Gore has clearly pointed out the many flaws in \nGovernor Bush's prescription drug plan for senior citizens. But \nGovernor Bush has no response on the merits. Instead, he hides behind \nphrases like ``fuzzy numbers'' and ``scare tactics.''\n  But the numbers aren't fuzzy, and senior citizens should be \nconcerned. Let's look at the facts.\n  Prescription drug coverage under the Bush plan is not immediate, and \nmost senior citizens would be left out. As Vice-President Gore has \npointed out, for the first four years, the Bush plan would cover low \nincome seniors only. Al Gore cited the example of a senior named George \nMcKinney. He said, ``George McKinney is 70 years old, has high blood \npressure. His wife has heart trouble. They have income of $25,000 a \nyear. They cannot pay for their prescription drugs. And so they're some \nof the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their \nprescription drugs.''\n  Governor Bush responded, ``Under my plan, the man gets immediate help \nwith prescription drugs. It's called immediate helping hand. Instead of \nsquabbling and finger-pointing, he gets immediate help.'' He kept \naccusing Vice-President Gore of using ``fuzzy math'' and ``scare \ntactics.''\n  But Governor Bush's own announcement of his Medicare plan proves Al \nGore's point. This is what Governor Bush said:\n\n       For four years, during the transition to better Medicare \n     coverage, we will provide $12 billion a year in direct aid to \n     low income seniors . . . Every senior with an income less \n     than $11,300--$15,200 for a couple--will have the entire cost \n     of their prescription drug covered. For seniors with incomes \n     less than $14,600--$19,700 for couples--there will be a \n     partial subsidy.\n\n  George McKinney has an income of $25,000. He would clearly be \nineligible for help under Governor Bush's plan. If Governor Bush thinks \nthat's fuzzy math, then education reform is even more urgent than any \nof us realized. And in the third debate, Governor Bush finally admitted \nthat the first phase of his program is only for ``poor seniors.''\n  George McKinney is not alone. The vast majority of senior citizens \nwould not qualify for Governor Bush's prescription drug program--and \nmany of those who did qualify would not participate.\n  Even this limited program for low income seniors would not be \nimmediate, because every state in the country would have to pass new \nlaws and put the program in place--a process that could take years in \nmany states.\n  The low priority that Governor Bush places on this problem is also \ndemonstrated by the fact that sixteen states have enacted programs to \nhelp low income senior citizens with their prescription drug costs, and \nTexas is not one of them.\n  George Bush's prescription for middle-income senior citizens is \nclear--take an aspirin and call your HMO in four years.\n  Governor Bush's prescription drug plan would also require senior \ncitizens to go to an HMO or an insurance company to obtain their \ncoverage. In the first debate, Vice-President Gore pointed out that \nmost senior citizens ``would not get one penny for four to five years, \nand then they would be forced to go into an HMO or an insurance company \nand ask them for coverage. But there would be no limit on the premiums \nor the deductibles or any of the terms or conditions.''\n  Again, Governor Bush did not respond to the Vice-President's specific \npoints. Instead, he claimed that the Vice-President was trying to \n``scare'' voters.\n  The facts are clear. Governor Bush's policy paper states that, ``Each \nhealth insurer, including HCFA-sponsored plans that wish to participate \n. . . will have to offer an ``expanded'' benefit package, including \nout-patient prescription drugs . . . . This will give seniors the \nopportunity to select the plan that best fits their health needs.''\n  In other words, to get prescription drug coverage under the Bush \nplan, you have to get it through a private insurance plan. How high \nwill the co-payments be? How high will the premiums be? How high will \nthe deductible be? Governor Bush has no answer. Those important points \nare all left up to the private insurance companies.\n  Governor Bush says senior citizens will have the opportunity to \nselect the plan that best meets their health needs. But what they will \nreally have is the opportunity to select whatever plan private insurers \nchoose to offer. If it costs too much, senior citizens are out of luck. \nIf it doesn't cover the drugs their doctor prescribes, they're out of \nluck. The Bush plan is an insurance industry's dream, and a senior \ncitizen's nightmare.\n  Governor Bush believes that private insurance companies and HMOs are \nthe best way to provide prescription drug coverage to seniors. I don't \nquestion his sincerity. But I do question his unwillingness to defend \nhis position in an open debate in front of the American people. When \nVice-President Gore points out the facts, it isn't enough to evade the \nissue by calling the facts ``fuzzy math'' or a ``scare tactic''.\n  The ads that the Republican National Committee is running for the \nBush campaign against the Gore plan reach new lows in disinformation. \nUnder the Bush plan, senior citizens would have to get their \nprescription drugs through an HMO or private insurance company, but the \nGOP ads stand reality on its head by stating that under the Vice-\nPresident's proposal, senior citizens would have to obtain their \ncoverage from a ``government-run HMO.''\n  In fact, under the Vice President's plan senior citizens would obtain \ntheir drug coverage through Medicare, in essentially the same way they \nobtain physician and hospital coverage today. The Gore plan \nspecifically guarantees that it will cover any drug that a senior \ncitizen's doctor prescribes. That's not true under the Bush plan--and \nit is a glaring omission.\n  Another issue in the debate over prescription drug coverage has not \nreceived sufficient attention--the linkage in Governor Bush's proposal \nbetween prescription drug coverage and other cutbacks in Medicare. When \nthe American people and senior citizens understand what Governor Bush \nis proposing, they will reject it resoundingly.\n  Governor Bush has been very clear. His drug benefit won't be \navailable to senior citizens unless they are willing to accept severe \nchanges in Medicare's coverage of their doctor's bills and hospital \nbills. He reiterated that point in the second debate. He said, ``I \nthink step one to make sure prescription drugs are more affordable for \nseniors . . . is to reform the Medicare system.'' Prescription drug \ncoverage that senior citizens need should not be held hostage to \nchanges in Medicare that senior citizens don't want--and it won't be \nheld hostage under Al Gore's plan.\n  Governor Bush thinks that Medicare is obsolete and should be sent to \nthe scrap heap. He favors a new model--in which senior citizens have to \njoin HMOs or other private insurance plans or pay exorbitant premiums. \nBut Medicare is still far and away one of the most successful social \nprograms ever enacted. Senior citizens don't think that Medicare is \nready for the scrap heap. They don't want to have to give up their \nfamily doctor and join an HMO in order to obtain coverage. But under \nthe Bush plan, the price of staying in current Medicare and keeping \nyour own doctor could be a premium increase of as much as 47 percent in \nthe very first year, according to the Medicare actuary. For the vast \nmajority of senior citizens, this heavy financial pressure could force \nthem to give up their current Medicare coverage and their own doctor, \nand join an HMO.\n  Under the leadership of the Clinton-Gore administration, Medicare has \ngone from a condition of imminent bankruptcy to one in which Medicare \nwill be solvent for the next quarter century--the longest period of \nprojected Medicare solvency in the program's entire history. The \nindependent Medicare Commission recently considered a proposal similar \nto the Bush plan, and the Commission said it could cause Medicare to \nbecome insolvent as early as 2005--just five years from now. If so, \nCongress would be faced with the stark choice of raising taxes, cutting \nbenefits, or raising premiums. That's the Bush plan--and it's not a \nplan to protect senior citizens. It's a plan to privatize Medicare, and \nturn it over to the tender mercy of HMOs and the private insurance \nindustry.\n  On prescription drugs and every other aspect of Medicare, the choice\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nbetween the two presidential candidates is very clear--and it is clear \non every other aspect of health care. The Bush record in Texas is one \nof indifference and ineptitude--of putting powerful interests ahead of \nordinary families.\n  The Bush record in the campaign is one of consistent deception and \ndistortion. The Bush proposals are at best inadequate and at worst \nharmful. Tax cuts for the wealthy are not as important as health care \nfor children and prescription drugs for seniors. The American people \nunderstand that--but Governor Bush does not.\n  Al Gore has a career-long record of fighting for good health care for \nfamilies, for children, and for senior citizens. The current \nadministration has a solid record of bipartisan accomplishment, ranging \nfrom protecting the solvency of Medicare to improving health insurance \ncoverage though enactment of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and the Child \nHealth Insurance Program. Al Gore's program responds to the real needs \nof the American people with real resources and a detailed action plan.\n  I am hopeful that every American will examine the records of the two \ncandidates carefully. On health care, there should be no question as to \nwhich candidate stands with powerful special interests and which \ncandidate stands with the American people. The choice is clear. \nGovernor Bush stands with the powerful, and Al Gore stands with the \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11067-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

On the Older Americans Act, I believe.\n  Mr. REID. No. There is no subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of Senator \nJeffords.\n  Mr. REID. I thought that under the unanimous consent agreement he \ncould speak for as long as he needs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry? I believe when I started to speak \nthere was still time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am just asking what happens at the end. I would like \nto put a unanimous consent request in to make sure that we have time \navailable before we vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield for that purpose, if he wants to \nmake that request at this time with the understanding that I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Vermont would state his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Following the remarks of Senator Kennedy, I ask \nunanimous consent all time be yielded back on the bill and that there \nbe 30 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to the vote on \nthe bill with Senator Gregg to be recognized for the last 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand \nthat at 4:30 we would go to general debate on this bill with Senator \nGregg getting the last 15 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

My point is, I say to my friend from Vermont, that until we \nhave something more to do on the floor--we have had a number of \nrequests on this side and probably on your side for people to speak in \nmorning business--we will wait until 3 p.m. If there is no other \nbusiness, we will go into morning business at 3 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to just take a few minutes to \nreview the education record. I think I have tried to outline in as an \nobjective way as possible what the record is with regard to health, \nparticularly with regard to children in the State of Texas, the \nGovernor's record on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on the CHIP program, \nand also on the Medicaid program.\n  I think one can't review that record--not only my statements or the \nstatements in the most recent Time Magazine which have drawn \neffectively the exact same conclusion--and not reach the conclusion \nthat children have not been a priority on the political agenda of Texas \nover the period of the last six years.\n  On the issue of education, I spoke briefly yesterday in the Senate. I \nam troubled, as many of our colleagues, that we are not having cloture \non the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In spite of all of the \nassurances that were given by the majority leader and Republican \nleadership, we still failed to do it.\n  I commend again our colleagues, Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Mikulski, and others for effectively concluding the Older \nAmericans Act shows even in these final hours that bipartisanship can \nwork in a very important area. I welcome the chance to work with our \ncolleagues on the committee and the chairman to make sure that we are \ngoing to take action. That is an enormously important piece of \nlegislation for our seniors.\n  Education is enormously important for families as well. In spite of \nthe fact that assurances were given by the majority, we still have not \ndone so. For the first time in 35 years, we have not completed our work \nand reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  What has to be a central distress to all families is it appears now \nthat the appropriations that are going to fund the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act will be the last train out of the station.\n  They are more than 3\\1/2\\ weeks late after the end of the fiscal \nyear. It is troublesome to me to hear all of the statements about the \nimportance of prioritizing education when we see that we have basically \nfailed to do our work here in the Senate on this issue.\n  I want to take a moment to find out what we might look to in terms of \nthe future, again looking to what has happened in Texas over the period \nof these last several years.\n  On the issue of the record on education in Texas, it is more of an \n``education mirage'' than an ``education miracle.''\n  Under Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for \nEducational Statistics, Texas ranked 45th in the nation in high school \ncompletion\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\nrates. Seventy-one percent of high school dropouts in Texas are \nminorities. Hispanic students in Texas dropped out at more than twice \nthe rate of white students in the State.\n  In August, the College Board reported nationally that from 1997 to \n2000, SAT scores have increased. But in Texas they have decreased. In \n1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national average, and by 2000 \nthe gap had widened to 26 points.\n  Let me review that very quickly. Since we have had a lot of talk and \nwe have had a lot of sound bites on education, let's look at what has \nhappened.\n  We will come back to what happened under the last several years in \nthese same areas at the national level, which the Vice President was \ninvolved in and which he would like to see continued and expanded.\n  On Tuesday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The Rand Corporation \nreleased a study that raises serious questions about the validity of \nthe gains in student achievement claimed by the Governor. On CNN in \nAugust, the Governor said: Our state . . . has done the best . . . not \nmeasured by us but measured by the Rand Corporation . . . who take an \nobjective look as to how states are doing when it comes to educating \nchildren.\n  Clearly, at that time, George W. Bush trusted the conclusions by \nRand.\n  On CNN, in September, Governor Bush said: One of my proudest \naccomplishments is I worked with Republicans and Democrats to close the \nachievement gap in Texas.\n  The recent Rand study shows his claim is false. The achievement gap \nin Texas is not closing; it is widening.\n  On Fox News, in August, Governor Bush said: Without comprehensive \nregular testing, without knowing if children are really learning, \naccountability is a myth, and standards are just slogans.\n  But, the Rand study shows that the tests cited by Governor Bush to \nsupport his claim are biased. They found the gains in student \nachievement are the product of a discredited practice called ``teaching \nto the test,'' and that claims of real success in student achievement \nfar exceed the actual results in Texas.\n  The Rand study also says the gains in student achievement in Texas \nmay be inflated, questioning the validity of the scores. According to \nthe study, gains on the Texas State test are far greater than the \nresults for the same students on standard national tests.\n  The Rand study questions the value of the Texas State test because it \ninvolves teaching to the test instead of real learning. The Bush \neducation plan has the same serious flaw. It focuses on tests, tests, \nand more tests. We, as a country, have more tests than any other \ncountry in the world.\n  Inevitably, schools will focus more and more on test preparation, as \nhappened in Texas with the State tests, and less on real teaching. In \nthe end, it is education that suffers and so do the students.\n  In addition, in Texas more and more students with disabilities are \nexcluded from taking the test, and more and more students are dropping \nout or being held back. That is not a satisfactory prescription for \nimproving education.\n  Instead, we should look at the success of States such as North \nCarolina, which is improving education the right way by investing in \nschools, teacher quality, and afterschool programs in order to produce \nbetter results for students.\n  Governor Bush's plan mandates more tests for children but it does \nnothing to ensure schools actually improve so that children will obtain \na better education.\n  It is clear that Governor Bush is out of touch with parents and \nstudents when it comes to education. Governor Bush says everything in \neducation is failing--it is all doom and gloom. His solutions go back \nto the old scheme to abandon public schools and refuse to make needed \ninvestments in education. He mandates more and more tests for children, \nbut does nothing to help create the change needed to ensure that all \nthe children pass the tests. He turns his back on what works and \nresorts to right wing policies instead, which are inadequate to meet \nthe challenges of genuine school reform.\n  Early education initiatives are especially important. Study after \nstudy has shown that children who have quality learning experiences \nearly in life have a greater ability to learn in school, to work \nsuccessfully with their teachers and their peers, and to master needed \nskills. We can do more--much more--to put this impressive research into \npractice. But Governor Bush has no plan to expand access to preschool \neducation. He has no plan to expand Head Start--only empty rhetoric \nabout reforming the program.\n  Assistance for low-performing schools is also essential. We know that \nwith needed investments, failing public schools will improve. In North \nCarolina, low-performing schools are given technical assistance by \nspecial state teams that provide targeted support to help turn around \nthose schools. In the 1997-98 school year, 15 schools were selected and \nreceived intensive help from these state assistance teams. In August \n1998, the state reported that most of these schools had achieved \n``exemplary'' growth--and none continue to be identified as low-\nperforming. In the 1998-99 school year, 11 schools were identified and \nreceived help from the assistance teams. Nine schools met or exceeded \ntheir growth targets at the end of the year. That's the kind of aid to \neducation that works, and we should support it in all states. Instead, \nGovernor Bush abandons low-performing schools--and proposes instead a \nprivate school voucher plan that drains needed resources from troubled \nschools and traps low-income children in them.\n  Another major problem hindering schools' ability to teach students \neffectively is the fact that many schools have obsolete, crumbling and \ninadequate facilities. All teachers and students deserve safe, modern \nfacilities with up-to-date technology. Sending children to dilapidated \nand overcrowded classrooms sends an unacceptable message. It tells them \nthey don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the \nboardroom--and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. \nWe have an obligation to children and parents to modernize the nation's \nschools--to build more schools, so that there are more classrooms and \nless overcrowding, and more computers and other equipment. It is long \npast time to end the days when the worst building in town is the school \nhouse with its crumbling walls and broken pipes and leaky roofs that \nplague students and teachers and classrooms. But congressional \nRepublicans have repeatedly refused to address these pressing needs. \nGovernor Bush doesn't do nearly enough either. He makes only a token \ninvestment in school construction, and he ignores communities' needs to \nrepair crumbling and unsafe schools.\n  Smaller classes are also an indispensable element of school reform. \nResearch documents what parents and teachers have always known--that \nsmall classes improve student achievement. Teachers are able to \nmaintain discipline more effectively. Students receive more individual \nattention and instruction. Students with learning disabilities are \nidentified earlier, and their needs can be met without placing them in \ncostly special education. Instead of applying this basic and widely \naccepted principle, Governor Bush eliminates the current and \nincreasingly effective effort to help communities reduce class sizes. \nWe must also make a stronger commitment to help communities attract, \ntrain and support the highest quality teachers and principals. Two \nmillion new teachers will be needed over the next 10 years, because of \nthe large number of teachers nearing retirement and the continuing \nlarge increases in student enrollment. The shortage of teachers is \ncompounded by the shameful fact that 50 percent of teachers leave the \nprofession within 5 years.\n  Instead of using our budget resources to strengthen programs that \nwork to improve teacher quality and put well-trained teachers in all \nclassrooms, Governor Bush would simply hand over a block grant to \nstates--a blank check--and hope that state governors will spend the \nfederal aid in ways that improve teacher quality. Clearly, America can \ndo better than that. We have to do better than that. We must also do \nmore to make college accessible and affordable. Parents and students \nacross the country are also struggling to pay for college. The \nopportunity for a college education should not be determined by the \nlevel\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nof family income. Any student who has the ability, who works hard, and \nwho wants to attend college should have the opportunity to do so. We \nshould do more--much more--to make college affordable for every \nqualified student.\n  We also need to do more to help train workers who have lost their \njobs because of corporate down-sizing or business relocations, so they \ncan find other good jobs in their communities. Workers need \nopportunities to upgrade their skills to remain competitive, especially \nin the modern economy. Better services and real training for dislocated \nworkers will give them the skills they need to continue their careers. \nIt will also help to meet employers' growing needs for well-qualified \nworkers. But, Governor Bush has no plan to make college more affordable \nor help these dislocated workers. He expands Pell grants primarily for \nthe first year of college only. He makes only a limited effort to help \nthe nation's workers upgrade their skills.\n\n  The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges \nmore effectively. We know that many schools across the country are \ndoing an excellent job. The real challenge is to do what it takes to \ncreate better schools and better college opportunities for all \nstudents. Like Governor Bush, this Republican Congress deserves a \nfailing grade for its lack of support for school reform. Too often, we \nhave abandoned states and local school districts in their efforts to \nprovide students with a good education. Too often, Congress has stood \non the sidelines and declined to be an active participant in the \nnation's education policy. It is only through a strong and cooperative \ncommitment at every level--federal, state, and local--that the nation \ncan adequately meet its education needs. We have a responsibility to do \nall we can to meet the pressing challenge to guarantee that students \nwill graduate from school and college well-prepared for careers in the \nnew information-age and in our technologically-advanced economy and our \ncompetitive global society.\n  That's what Al Gore and Democrats in Congress are proposing--a \nconstructive and more effective balance between accountability for \nbetter results and additional resources for programs that work to \nimprove schools. We will ensure that every child receives a good early \neducation, by ensuring that preschool is available to all children. We \nwill help communities improve public schools. Our goal is to put a \nwell-trained teacher in every classroom. We understand that when class \nsize goes up, opportunity for learning goes down. We will help schools \nreduce class size, so the nation's students can be taught more \neffectively. We will make major investments in helping communities to \nbuild new schools, to alleviate overcrowding and to repair and \nmodernize obsolete and dilapidated classrooms and facilities. We will \nhold states and schools accountable for results, so that all children \nhave the opportunity to meet high standards. We will expand \nopportunities for college and later learning by making college tuition \ntax deductible and by increasing Pell grants. We will reach out to \nmillions of disadvantaged young children and help them to see and \nbelieve that college can be a realistic option for their future. We \nwill help the nation's workers obtain the on-going skills training they \nneed, and provide tax credits for employers who offer worker training.\n  In all of these ways, Al Gore's approach to education is the right \ndirection for the nation's future. We have reached the final days of \nthis Congress, and we have yet to give needed priority to education. \nNegotiations are underway, and there is still a chance to meet our \ncommitment to families and communities across the country, and do what \nis needed to meet their education needs.\n  At the end of this Congress, families across the country will assess \nwhat we have done to meet these priorities, and the verdict has to be, \n``too little, too later.'' This Republican Congress deserves a failing \ngrade on education, and no ``election eve conversion'' is enough to \navoid that failing grade. The American people share our Democratic \ncommitment to the nation's students, parents, schools and communities. \nWe have already made students and families across the country wait too \nlong for this needed education assistance.\n  We have seen the SAT math scores at their highest in 30 years. This \nis a very modest improvement nationwide, but all the indicators are \ngoing in the right direction as compared to Texas, and scores have \nincreased both for males and females.\n  The number of students taking advanced math and science classes from \n1990 to 2000: There is an increase in the number of students taking \nprecalculus, calculus, and physics; students are taking more difficult \nand challenging courses. They are doing better on the national \nstandardized tests. That is because they want to go to college because \nthere is an increasing opportunity available to them under the \nproposals made by the administration. That is catching on with students \nall over the country because we are finding more and more students are \ntaking the SAT. More and more students are taking the difficult, \nchallenging, rigorous tests. Students are doing better in spite of the \nfact more are taking more difficult and challenging courses, and the \nnational trends are moving in the right direction. That is completely \ncontrary to what has happened in the State of Texas.\n  This is not to suggest we don't have many areas of our country and \nmany school districts that don't need a great deal of help and \nassistance. However, what we are seeing as a result of the \nadministration, which Vice President Gore has been a part of, and he \nhas been strongly supportive of, these education programs are moving in \nthe right direction. They are moving in the right direction.\n  When he talks about smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, \nmentoring in terms of teaching, afterschool programs, new technology, \nand accountability, it is being based upon the schools and school \ndistricts which are effectively breaking the mold where we are getting \nchildren with enhanced achievement and accomplishment. That is what I \nthink families want in this country, not just cliches.\n  I also wish to mention a final point of contrast between Governor \nBush and the Vice President on the early education initiatives and how \nimportant they are. Study after study has shown that children who have \nquality learning experiences early in life have a greater ability to \nlearn in school, to work successfully with their teachers, their peers, \nand master needed skills. We can do much more to put this impressive \nresearch into practice.\n  We have some bold initiatives which are bipartisan. I commend the \nleadership, Senator Stevens, Senator Jeffords, and others who have been \na part of this effort for some period of time. I think we have some \nreal movement here. That debate has been independent of the broader \nissues on elementary and secondary education. I know in the Vice \nPresident's proposal, in terms of investing in the future, this early \neducation program has an important commitment.\n  I remind our colleagues that this whole area was an area that had \nbipartisan support a number of years ago when the Governors met in \nCharlottesville. The first recommendation was made to the American \npeople that the Governors were going to be committed. We were \nchallenging the administration. The Congress was ready to learn. \nChildren ought to be ready to learn when they go to school. ``Ready to \nlearn'' means giving those children the kind of confidence building \nthat is so essential in the very early years, when their brains are in \nformation.\n  Various Carnegie commission reports have demonstrated the early \ninterventions help build confidence. They also demonstrate children \nbegin to appreciate learning in these early formative years. Second, \nthe children develop interpersonal skills which are enormously \nimportant when they begin their education experience. Finally, the \ntests show they develop a sense of humor, which I think is probably of \nvalue in carrying one through life.\n  This early intervention has been particularly and repeatedly \nemphasized and stressed by the Vice President. It ought to be taken \ninto strong consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 10 \nminutes under morning business.\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been following the debate between \nthe two Presidential candidates and notice that the Vice President \nwants to take full credit for paying down the deficit. At the time that \nthe legislation went through the Congress, the President's proposal was \na tax increase, and it was a proposal to increase spending in 1993.\n  I served on the Budget Committee in the House and I expressed at that \ntime in reality this was not a tax to cut the deficit; it was a tax to \nincrease spending. As members of the House Budget Committee, we had \npointed out at that time that it was going to create a $2 billion \ndeficit as far as the mind's eye could see.\n  So now we have the Vice President on the campaign trail taking credit \nfor having eliminated the deficit. In reality, what it was, it was the \nRepublican Congress. In 1993, when this was passed, Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate, Democrats controlled the House, and Democrats \nwere in control of the Presidency. This passed by a very narrow margin \nin the House. Not one Republican voted for it. It came over to the \nSenate and would not have passed the Senate if at that time the Vice \nPresident, Al Gore, had not voted for the budget proposal which, in \neffect, was going to maintain the deficit at $200 billion.\n  So I wanted to bring some facts to the floor in that regard. I \nthought it was important I do that.\n  This year, in July, just before we were ready to adjourn, the \nassistant minority leader pointed out that I made a comment at one time \nand my comment was, about the President's plan in 1992, which we were \nvoting on:\n\n       In summary, the plan has a fatal flaw--it does not reduce \n     the deficit.\n\n  Today I am standing up on the Senate floor to stand by my remarks \nbecause, if we look historically, that plan did not reduce the deficit. \nIn fact, I repeat, Al Gore's record is that of a tax hike because he is \nthe one who voted for this--his vote alone. Al Gore would like to have \nyou believe that actually what he was doing was putting in place a plan \nto eliminate the deficit.\n  I point out there is no document in the Clinton-Gore administration \nthat exists that shows the largest tax hike--and that is what this \nwas--the largest tax hike in American history did, or would have, or \ncould ever have balanced the budget--not one document.\n  I have here before me ``A Vision of Change For America.'' This is \ndated February 17, 1993. This is the President's plan on how he was \ngoing to eliminate the deficit. If we look at that, on page 22 of that \ndocument, we see the projected deficit 5 years out, from 1993, is $241 \nbillion, despite all the rhetoric and how it is going to pay down the \ndeficit with the tax increase.\n  Then, in September of the same year, in 1993, if we look on page 34 \nof the ``Mid-Session Review'' of the 1994 budget, we see the projected \ndeficit out to 1998 is $181 billion.\n  Then, if we look at the budget of the U.S. Government proposed for \n1995, proposed in 1994, again, on page 13 of that particular document \nwe see the projected deficit, 5 years out from the date of that \ndocument, is $181 billion again. It is flat-lining out at approximately \n$200 billion a year.\n  Then we have another document that was published in 1994, the ``Mid-\nSession Review'' of the 1995 budget. On page 3 of that document, it \nshows that the deficit, 5 years out from that date, is projected to be \n$207 billion. This is deficit spending. This is where you are going in, \non any one fiscal year, and you are spending more than what you bring \nin, in revenues.\n  Then, following out through the first couple of years since his \nproposal, we look at the document, ``The Budget Of The U.S. Government, \nFiscal Year 1996.'' If we look on page 2 of that particular document, \nwe see the projected deficit for the year 2000, 5 years out, was $194 \nbillion.\n  Then, in the Mid-Session Review on that particular budget, Mid-\nSession Review of the 1996 budget, we see the projected deficit 5 years \nout on that document is $235 billion in 2005.\n  If you recall, in 1996 we had the Republican Congress elected. Under \npressure from the Republicans in the Congress, the President finally \nadmitted that his plan was not going to eliminate the deficit. So, in \nworking with the Republican Congress, a new plan was beginning to be \nput in place. That is what this chart reflects. It reflects two things. \nThe red part is this projected deficit that was passed by the President \nand the Congress and put into law. As we can see, it is about $200 \nbillion deficit spending. This is a tax increase, the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country.\n\n  Then we see the Republicans come into power in 1996, and what \nhappens, which is reflected by this black line, is that the deficits \ndramatically are reduced, and then we find, a little past 1997, \nactually we are beginning to get some surpluses until where we are at \n2000, where we have the huge surpluses we are dealing with today.\n  I think the wrong person is taking credit for this. It is the \nRepublican Congress that made a difference on deficit spending. It was \nnot the largest tax increase in the history of this country which was \npassed in the Senate, here, by the Vice President. So this is a summary \nof what happened 2 years after the largest tax hike in history. \nFinally, Clinton and Gore admitted America was still 10 years away and \nalmost $1 trillion short of a balanced budget.\n  It is not just their documents I demonstrated with on the floor of \nthe Senate. In their own words, they verify this. During the signing \nceremony on the largest tax hike in history, not a word was uttered by \nPresident Clinton about balancing the budget or saving Social Security \nor paying off the national debt. At that time, the Republican plan was \nwe really needed to have dramatic changes if we were going to make a \ndifference in saving Social Security, eliminating the deficit, and \npaying down the debt. But all the plan we got out of Al Gore and the \nadministration was that we increased taxes and we would eliminate the \ndeficit, and it was not working because they also increased spending.\n  If we look at the President's comments at the signing of the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1993, on August 10 of 1993--this is from a \nbook entitled ``Public Papers of the President, William J. Clinton,'' \n1993, volume 2, page 1355. If you read through his comments and examine \nhis remarks, not once was a word uttered about balancing the budget, \nsaving Social Security, or even paying off the national debt. Thus, Al \nGore's tax hike was actually no act of heroism. What it really was, was \na tax-and-spend vote instead of a tax to end the deficit.\n  So I wanted to address that issue here on the floor of the Senate.\n  In summation, Mr. President, no Clinton-Gore budget document from \nFebruary 13, 1993, through July 28, 1995, ever shows a balanced budget \nresulting from Mr. Gore's record tax hike. No Clinton-Gore budget \ndocument from February 13, 1993, through July 28, 1995, ever shows a \nSocial Security surplus being saved from Mr. Gore's record tax hike. \nAnd no Clinton-Gore budget document from February 13, 1993, through \nJuly 28, 1995, ever shows debt reduction or elimination resulting from \nMr. Gore's record tax hike. Yet Al Gore now claims and lectures as if \nhe actually created this surplus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11070-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11070-S11072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADOPTION TAX CREDIT FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was on the floor yesterday and said \nthat I would be back every day speaking about this issue, I think one \nof the more important issues that we need to address before we leave \ntown. Nobody is too sure when that is actually going to happen. Some of \nus were expecting to be back home, having finished the people's work, \nweeks ago. Even as I inquire on both sides of the aisle, there is not \nany sense of when we will get home. I will stay here as long as it \ntakes to get the job done, and I am not complaining.\n  One of the things I hope we can get done in some way, somehow, \nthrough some rule, some procedure, or some bill before we leave is to \nfix something so we will not be embarrassed about what we have not \ndone. I will explain.\n  A few years ago, 5 years to be exact, a wonderful new provision was \nput in the law called the adoption tax credit.\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\n I am the cochair, along with Senator Craig, my wonderful colleague \nfrom Idaho. This is a wonderful coalition of Democrats, Republicans, \nconservatives, liberals, but we have all come together on the issue of \nadoption, promoting it as a wonderful way to build families, to \nstrengthen communities, to give children hope, to put parents together \nwith children whom they have always wanted to have, dreamed, and worked \nfor, who will love them and raise them because governments do not do a \nvery good job of that. The fact is, there are literally millions and \nmillions of children in this world who are desperate for someone to \nlove them and provide a home.\n  Congress, in a bipartisan expression, overwhelmingly put into effect \na wonderful tax credit because adoptions, unlike pregnancy, are not \ncovered by insurance. There are not the same benefits, unfortunately, \nin the labor market or in business for pregnancies and adoption.\n  Recognizing the somewhat disadvantage on families who build their \nfamilies through adoption, the Congress rightfully put in place a \n$5,000 credit for families.\n  There is a recent Treasury report that says the credit is being used \nby thousands of families. This report, which was filed in the last 2 \nweeks, goes into some very clear and interesting detail about who is \nusing this credit, how much the expenses related to adoption are.\n  For those who are not familiar, since our children are adopted, I can \nsay from personal experience that there are expenses associated not \nonly with the legal act itself but with agency expenses. In the United \nStates, that can range anywhere from a low of $2,000 to a high of \n$15,000 or $20,000. For international adoptions--and there are many \nMembers and staffers who have adopted who can give personal testimony--\nthat can range anywhere from a low of $5,000 to $30,000. It is an \nexpense with which many moderate- and middle-income families have \ndifficulty.\n  Despite those difficulties, there are families all over this Nation \nwho have adopted not one not two children. I met a family recently from \nPhiladelphia that has adopted 20 children, some of them with special \nneeds. This is not a family that inherited a fortune or is heir to a \ngreat fortune. This is a working family struggling to put food on the \ntable, but because they felt compelled to give hope and prayer to some \nchildren, they have opened their home to 20.\n  I do not expect there will be many people who will adopt 20. I am one \nof nine, and my mother did a pretty terrific job of raising nine of us. \nI have two children, which is what I can handle at this time.\n\n  This adoption tax credit is working to a certain extent. We are ready \nto extend it because it runs out this year. We want to do that, and we \nwant to increase it. Right now, it is $5,000 for a regular adoption and \n$6,000 for a special needs child.\n  The problem is--and I urge my colleagues and those who are interested \nin this issue to hear me--that under the current Tax Code, special \nneeds children--special needs children are defined as those who are in \nfoster care. There are 100,000 of them whose parental rights--the \nrights of their parents--have been terminated. These children are freed \nfor adoption. There are another 400,000 children of all ages, races, \nand background in foster care, either on their way to being reunited \nwith their family, which is always our hope if that is possible, or on \ntheir way to an adoptive family.\n  If we do not make a change in the bill on which we will be asked to \nvote sometime in the next few days, or if we do not make a change in \nthe phraseology about this tax credit, we are going to leave behind \n100,000 children. If the train is leaving the station, it is as if you \nare waving goodbye to 100,000 children in this Nation, some of the most \nvulnerable children, children the system has failed, children whose \nparents abandoned them, abused them, or grossly neglected them. The \nsystem has already failed them once, Mr. President. I do not have the \nheart and I do not think we have the heart to fail them again.\n  I know there are many issues, big bills and important issues, but for \n100,000 kids in America, Serina being one of them, if we do not fix \nthis problem, which I think is the intention of this body, then we are \ngoing to leave children like Serina behind. Let me tell you a little \nabout Serina.\n  Serina was taken into foster care immediately upon her birth. Her \nmother was a 16-year-old foster child herself who was addicted to crack \ncocaine. Because of her mother's drug addiction, one might say we could \nblame the mother, but since the system failed her and left her in \nfoster care without a real mother and real father, then I am not sure \nwho is to blame, but this child was born with cerebral palsy because \nbabies do not take crack cocaine very well, as well as other multiple \nproblems, including addiction, a history of herpes, encephalitis, \nseizure disorders, including epilepsy. She has two biological siblings, \none of whom was also adopted by her adoptive parents.\n  The family that adopted Serina, knowing full well these conditions, \nknowing full well the difficulties involved in raising this child--the \ndoctors said she could never walk; she could never hear; she could \nnever function. She is doing all of these things beautifully. She, \nunder our current Tax Code, gets nothing. Her parents get nothing for \nthe adoption because she is a special needs child, as is obvious. There \nare no expenses necessarily associated with her adoption. These are not \nthe kind of children that agencies regularly place. There were no legal \nfees. There are no adoption agency fees.\n  We are about to pass a bill that is going to leave behind 100,000 of \nthe most vulnerable, most needy children and their families who are \ndoing God's work.\n  I am happy these other children--a little girl from Guatemala and a \nlittle boy from the United States--are able to use the current adoption \nsystem. Their parents, too, have done a wonderful job giving these \nchildren an opportunity for life, love, and success. The adoption \ncredit is working for them. I say hooray and let's continue it. But, \nplease, let us not leave behind the special needs children of our own \ncountry, American citizens, children born in the United States.\n  We say in the adoption caucus--and I am proud to be one of the \nleaders--that there are no unwanted children; there are just unfound \nfamilies.\n  If our Tax Code can help people build homes, can help businesses \nstart up, and can help very wealthy people support their products \ninternationally, if we can give millions and hundreds of tax credits to \nspecial interests, I most certainly think the Members of this body--the \nHouse and Senate; Republicans and Democrats--can find the will to add \nnot one dollar but to change a phrase in the law so all children and \nall families can benefit from this adoption credit.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. But I will be \nback on the floor later today and every day, if not today, until we \nleave here. If I have to read the names of every one of the 100,000 \nchildren waiting, I am going to try to do that, until I get some \nresponse that this tax credit we are about to pass is going to include \nthe children who need the help the most and their families. If I have \nto read all 100,000 names--this I hold in my hand is just a few--I am \nprepared to do it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time is left in morning business so I \ncan ask unanimous consent that I have time after the Senator from \nMissouri has spoken. Could the Presiding Officer tell me what the time \nlimit at this point is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 13 minutes; the minority has \n14 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Missouri speaks, we extend the time for the majority and \nthe minority equally by 15 minutes each; 15 minutes for the majority, \n15 minutes for the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11070-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11070-S11072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADOPTION TAX CREDIT FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I rise today to address two issues that are \nrelated; first, to express support for one of the most lethal and \neffective foreign policy instruments we know; that is, our brave \nservice men and women who are standing guard on distant shores. We were \nreminded of that recently by the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole in \nYemen. It was yet another reminder that our forces are on watch 24 \nhours a day in farflung places many of us have never heard of. Their \npresence and service is a crucial component of foreign policy.\n  The effort of the sailors aboard the U.S.S. Cole in saving the ship \nis a testimony to the honor, courage, and commitment the Navy expects \nfrom every sailor wearing the Navy uniform.\n  Our thanks and our congratulations go to them; our sorrow, of course, \nfor those who were lost; and our sympathies and prayers go with their \nfamilies.\n  But in light of the danger in which these fighting men and women of \nthe United States are placed, it is important we assess our foreign \npolicy, and that we take a look at the record of what has happened in \nthe past.\n  What have the two candidates done? Where would the Vice President \nlead us, based on his experience to date?\n  When you talk about experience with respect to Vice President Gore's \nforeign policy, I am reminded of that old saw that ``experience is what \nyou get when you expected to get something else.'' His record of \nexperience has been a very bad one, and one that will put at risk other \nsailors and other U.S. military in the future. You don't need to look \ntoo far to share these concerns.\n  First, let me call attention to a Wall Street Journal editorial page \narticle, ``Gore's Hidden Weakness: Foreign Policy'' from Monday, \nOctober 23. There Robert Zoellick expresses concern over the supposed \nforeign policy experience that Vice President Gore would bring to the \nWhite House.\n  In the article he said that in the Chernomyrdin agreement:\n\n       . . . he blessed Russian exports to Iran of weapons that \n     could only be targeted against the U.S. Navy, which protects \n     the world's energy lifeline.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       . . . Russian technicians continued to help Iran develop \n     ``laser isotope separation technology'' used to enrich \n     uranium for nuclear weapons.\n\n  This was to a country that the State Department called ``the most \nactive state sponsor of terrorism.'' We would have hoped that our Vice \nPresident, in his agreements with Mr. Chernomyrdin, would have been \ntrying to build a market economy based on the rule of law. He should \nhave prodded them to close down the corrupt commissions. But what we \nseem to have seen, as a result, or what has followed on that agreement, \nwas a Soviet-style bureaucracy that never made any progress.\n  There was an admission that the IMF money went to foreigners and \nRussian speculators.\n  Quoting the editorial further, the former chairman of Russia's \nsecurity commission said:\n\n       ``I cannot explain why the Western governments didn't pay \n     serious attention.'' And Anatoly Chubais, Mr. Chernomyrdin's \n     deputy, said pithily: ``We conned them out of $20 billion.''\n\n  And the editorial writer, Mr. Zoellick, says:\n\n       Mr. Gore's Russian record is more than a litany of costly \n     mistakes. The vice president was unable to either perceive \n     the true nature of Russia's transformation or to design \n     creative U.S. policy to match the circumstances.\n\n  I think we ought to be alarmed. We ought to be alarmed at the record \nthat Vice President Gore has written as he takes credit for our foreign \npolicy with Russia.\n  Is it really credit, when we find that the Russians continue to \nexport arms to Iran? Would it alarm Americans that Iran, which relies \non Russian arms sales to maintain its own military, sends arms also to \nHezbollah's guerrillas in Lebanon, which uses those same arms against \nIsraeli soldiers in settlements?\n  Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations began hearings \nto probe the recent press reports that Vice President Al Gore and the \nRussian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made a secret agreement 5 \nyears ago promising the Clinton White House would not enforce the law \nrequiring sanctions for Russian sales to Iran.\n  Is this what we can expect, secret deals with Russia that have not \nstopped the sales of dangerous weapons to Iran? We are still seeking \ndisclosure to the appropriate committees of Congress of the details of \nthe Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement.\n  They have not come forward even to give the committees of \njurisdiction the details on that agreement. What is going on? Why is it \nbeing hidden?\n  I think we all ought to be very much concerned about what appears to \nbe a series of deadly mistakes covered up--covered up--and kept out of \nthe view of the congressional committees.\n  Now, portions of the 12-page agreement between Vice President Gore \nand Mr. Chernomyrdin appeared in the October 17 edition of the \nWashington Times. In there, it appeared that the U.S. Vice President \ncommitted our country to ``avoid any penalties to Russia that might \notherwise arise under domestic law.'' The final document reads: ``This \naide memoire, as well as the attached annexes, will remain strictly \nconfidential.''\n  This secret Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement, and the Clinton-Gore \nadministration's promise not to implement U.S. laws requiring sanctions \nfor Russian weapons proliferation to Iran, was first reported in the \nNew York Times on October 13 of this year. It said there that:\n\n       In exchange for the Russian promises, the United States \n     pledged not to seek penalties against Russia under a 1992 law \n     that requires sanctions against countries that sell advanced \n     weaponry to countries the State Department classifies as \n     state sponsors of terrorism. Iran is on that list.\n\n  The law they are referring to, of course, is the 1992 Iran-Iraq Non-\nProliferation Act. That was sponsored by the Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Al Gore, along with Senator McCain.\n  Let's be clear. This law requires the President impose sanctions on \ncountries that sell advanced weaponry or assist in nuclear weapons \nprograms in countries sponsoring terrorism. Russian cooperation with \nIran's nuclear program was a major concern behind enactment of that \nlegislation. How do you get around that?\n  The White House has attempted to downplay the impact of Vice \nPresident Gore's deal by arguing the weaponry transferred was \n``antiquated.''\n  I see nothing antiquated about laser isotope separation technology, \nwhich was described in the Wall Street Journal article, being used to \nenrich uranium for nuclear weapons.\n  It is my understanding that some of the weapons sold to Iran by \nRussia included the Kilo-class submarine, which is difficult to detect \nand track in the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf because they \ngenerate very little noise while operating on battery power. In the \nevent of a crisis, these submarines would present a credible threat to \nU.S. forces, allied vessels, and merchant marine traffic. They also aid \nwake-homing torpedoes and antiship mines. If these weapons pose a \nsignificant threat to U.S. ships and forces in the region, then these \ntransfers appear to me to meet the threshold for sanctions under the \nGore-McCain Act.\n  Make no mistake, were tensions to escalate between the United States \nand countries in the Middle East, these weapons could have a \ncatastrophic effect on our sailors and other military personnel on \nships in the region. We just saw what a small simple boat loaded with \nexplosives could do. What other reminders do we need.\n  The Vice President defends his actions claiming that none of the \nweapons included met the standard for triggering sanctions. Yet the \nWashington Times uncovered a letter sent last January to the Russian \nForeign Minister by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitting:\n\n       Without the aid memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales \n     to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various \n     provisions of our laws.\n\n  In classified documents obtained by the Washington Times, a 1995 \nletter, apparently written by Mr. Chernomyrdin to Vice President Gore, \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\n\n       The information we are passing on to you is not to be \n     conveyed to third parties, including the U.S. Congress. Open \n     information concerning our cooperation with Iran is obviously \n     a different matter, and we do not object to the constructive \n     use of such information. I am counting on your understanding.\n\n  These secret agreements between the Vice President and Mr. \nChernomyrdin took place in the context of a Gore-Chernomyrdin \nCommission, which began in 1993 and was conducted in twice yearly \nmeetings until Mr. Chernomyrdin was removed from his position in 1998. \nThese secret agreements contradict administration and Vice President \nGore's concerns regarding the spread of dangerous missiles in the \nMiddle East and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to a \ncountry such as Iran who exports terrorism.\n  Former Secretaries of State and Defense, Directors of Central \nIntelligence, National Security Advisers, have put out a strong letter, \ndated October 24, saying in part:\n\n       This is why we are deeply disturbed by the agreement made \n     by Vice President Gore and then Russian Premier Chernomyrdin \n     in which America acquiesced in the sale by Russia to Iran of \n     highly threatening military equipment such as modern \n     submarines, fighter planes, and wake-homing torpedoes.\n       We also find incomprehensible that this agreement was not \n     fully disclosed even to those committees of Congress charged \n     with receiving highly classified briefings--apparently at the \n     request of the Russian Premier. But agreement to his request \n     is even more disturbing since the Russian sales could have \n     brought about sanctions against Russia in accordance with a \n     1992 U.S. law sponsored by Senator John McCain and then \n     Senator Al Gore.\n\n  This letter was signed by George Schultz, Jim Baker, Zbigniew \nBrzezinski, Frank Carlucci, Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, James \nSchlesinger, Brent Scowcroft, Caspar Weinberger, and James Woolsey. I \nthink their concerns ought to be concerns of all of us.\n  This foreign policy effort is part and parcel with Vice President \nGore's approach to the people. Who does the Vice President trust. \nApparently not the people, not the U.S. Congress.\n  The reason we are here discussing this issue is because exactly 13 \ndays ago the New York Times revealed that Vice President Gore signed \nthis secret agreement I have been discussing. This Gore-Chernomyrdin \ndeal has broad foreign policy ramifications. The decision to allow \nRussia to escape the consequences of providing Iran with conventional \nweapons is one which affects the security of our allies and more \nimportantly the security of our troops such as those who routinely \npatrol the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. This is not \nthe type of agreement which should have been kept from the American \npeople.\n  In closing, I find it unconscionable that the Vice President of the \nUnited States could willingly withhold information from the Congress \nregarding the sale of arms from Russia to Iran; to a state described by \nhis own administration as ``the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism.'' I find it highly disturbing knowing the difficulties we \nhave faced in this region over the years that the Vice President would \nwillingly hide from the people a deal that puts in the hands of the \nIranian government weapons that could do real harm to our forces in the \nregion who routinely patrol the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Our \nforces put their lives at risk any time they enter this region of the \nworld because tensions are so high. Is it unrealistic to ask that the \nGovernment that sends our military forces into harm's way would work at \ndecreasing the availability of arms in the region that could \npotentially be used against them?\n  Is it unrealistic to expect from our President and Vice President \nsufficient trust in the people and our form of government to convey \ninformation to the Congress critical to our national security, critical \nto the security of our allies and critical to the stability of a region \nof the world that is wrought with tension and hatred for our allies \nsuch as Israel? I think not. I urge my fellow citizens to not simply \naccept the spin by supporters of Vice President Gore that his foreign \npolicy experience is necessarily good for America and the troops we \nsend in harm's way to enforce it.\n  I urge this body to take action to get copies of that agreement from \nthe administration. We should demand it. We should subpoena it. I hope \nmy colleagues will joint me in seeking that resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall \nStreet Journal and the statement by former Secretaries of State be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wall Street Journal, October 23, 2000]\n\n                 Gore's Hidden Weakness: Foreign Policy\n\n                         By Robert B. Zoellick\n\n       Events around the world have thrust foreign policy into the \n     presidential campaign and political commentators are making \n     routine references to Al Gore's ``experience.'' Yet the vice \n     president's international seasoning reminds me of the hapless \n     Hapsburgs: The Austro-Hungarians had a long record of \n     battles, but kept retreating and losing . . . wars, \n     territories, and eventually their country! If experience is \n     bad, it is a defect, not a credential. Here are four of Mr. \n     Gore's major defects.\n\n\n                              Major Flaws\n\n       First: Mr. Gore proclaims that he led U.S. policy toward \n     Russia. We have learned from the New York Times, however, \n     that he blessed Russian exports to Iran of weapons that could \n     only be targeted against the U.S. Navy, which protects the \n     world's energy lifeline. After Mr. Gore signed a secret \n     agreement approving these arms sales in 1995, the prime \n     ministers of Russia and Iran jointly described the U.S. \n     presence in the Gulf as ``totally unacceptable.'' Instead of \n     making the Russians pay a price for subverting U.S. \n     interests, Mr. Gore promised Russia that America would help \n     Moscow find more customers for its arms and make its military \n     industry eligible for technical assistance.\n       Mr. Gore also stopped sanctions against Russia, required by \n     a law that he had cosponsored in 1992. In return, the \n     Russians promised to stop those arms sales by the end of 1999 \n     but, responding to U.S. weakness, reneged on the deal and \n     sold additional weapons to Iran. Meanwhile, according to the \n     administration's own testimony, Russian technicians continued \n     to help Iran develop ``laser isotope separation technology'' \n     used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. And the State \n     Department recently called Iran ``the most active state \n     sponsor of terrorism.''\n       This example is part of a pattern: Mr. Gore's diplomatic \n     myopia, a function of his concentration on near-term tasks, \n     leaves him blind to the wider, strategic implications of his \n     actions. Consider Mr. Gore's dealings with Russia's economy. \n     Energetically pursuing his penchant for bureaucratic detail, \n     he embraced a commission with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the \n     Russian prime minister, that approached economics with \n     faculty ``Gosplan'' logic.\n       The old Soviet approach to economic relations was to \n     establish joint ventures blessed by high-level officials \n     (who, like Mr. Chernomyrdin, received preferential \n     treatment). To build a market economy based on the rule of \n     law, Mr. Gore should have prodded Russia to close down \n     corrupt commissions and open avenues for private \n     entrepreneurs. Yet as the head of the political section in \n     the U.S. Embassy in Moscow reported, the Gore-Chernomyrdin \n     commisison resembled a Soviet-style bureaucracy with any \n     information that contradicted success filed away forever.\n       Admitting that the IMF's money went to ``foreigners and \n     Russian speculators,'' the former chairman of Russia's \n     Securities Commission said: ``I cannot explain why the \n     Western governments didn't pay serious attention.'' And \n     Anatoly Chubais, Chernomyrdin's deputy, said pithily: ``We \n     conned them out of $20 billion.''\n       Mr. Gore's Russia record is more than a litany of costly \n     mistakes. The vice president was unable either to perceive \n     the true nature of Russia's transformation or to design \n     creative U.S. policy to match the circumstances. Mr. Gore was \n     committed to process over substantive results. Unwilling to \n     face unpleasant truths, he did not hold Russians accountable \n     for lies and other actions that harmed U.S. interests. \n     Second: Commentators generally assume that Mr. Gore supports \n     free trade, but his track record suggests that his \n     ``leadership'' on trade would be tepid at best, and \n     counterproductive at worst.\n       After the 1994 elections, Mr. Gore would not defend the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement, much less make the \n     larger case for free trade. The administration set distant \n     goals for trade, but was unwilling to back words with \n     actions. By the time Messrs. Clinton and Gore stirred \n     themselves to try to recover fast-track trade negotiating \n     authority in 1997, protectionists had made it impossible. As \n     a result, the administration retreated when it could only get \n     the support of about 40 out of over 200 Democrats in the \n     House.\n       Mr. Gore's record provides additional evidence that he is \n     unwilling to expend political capital to promote trade. He \n     did not lift a finger to prevent the World Trade Organization \n     fiasco in Seattle; but he did applaud Mr. Clinton's \n     destructive announcement that any new trade agreement must \n     include labor provisions backed by sanctions, which the \n     administration's own negotiators had resisted.\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\n       When Mr. Clinton and George W. Bush worked this year to win \n     votes for normal trade relations with Beijing--so that China \n     could enter the WTO--Mr. Gore again dodged responsibility. In \n     fact, he told union protectionists behind closed doors that \n     if Mr. Clinton failed with the China vote, he--Al Gore--would \n     insist on labor provisions in any new agreement.\n       Third: Mr. Gore's experience with the environment should be \n     of concern to Americans, regardless of their views on climate \n     change. He locked our climate change policy into a \n     bureaucratic, restrictive, and impractical Kyoto treaty. The \n     Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted 97 to 0 in \n     protest against this agreement. The treaty has many flaws, \n     not the least of which is a failure to include greenhouse gas \n     requirements for China, India and other countries whose \n     growing emissions could dwarf America's own reductions.\n       Even some environmentalists are concerned privately that \n     this impractical agreement--like other in Mr. Gore's \n     international file--impedes realistic goals based on \n     scientific evidence and practical plans to deal with \n     greenhouse gases. Indeed, Joe Lieberman, who recognized that \n     the Kyoto treaty had created stalemate instead of progress, \n     tried to fashion legislation that bypassed the Kyoto \n     strictures.\n\n\n                             poor judgment\n\n       Finally, Mr. Gore's experience flashes warning signs about \n     his approach to being commander-in-chief. Mr. Gore reminds us \n     that he voted in support of the Gulf War resolution. He does \n     not admit, however, that in critical Senate testimony only \n     about six weeks before the war began, he harshly criticized \n     President Bush's decision to send the military reinforcements \n     to the Gulf that were necessary to launch a successful \n     attack. Instead, Mr. Gore wanted to rely on economic \n     sanctions.\n       It was also discouraging that Mr. Gore told a national TV \n     audience that he would impose social policy ``litmus tests'' \n     on appointments to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After learning \n     that this idea would have politicized the military--and \n     precluded the service of Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf and \n     others who differ with him on gays in the military--the \n     ``experienced'' vice president reversed himself.\n       Mr. Gore's spinners are now programmed to blurt out that he \n     has 20-odd years of foreign policy exposure. There is more \n     than a touch of truthful irony in that claim. This is part of \n     a pattern of the vice president relying on references to \n     resumes, committees and agreements--instead of outlining \n     strategies to use U.S. power for sound ends. Mr. Gore does \n     indeed have foreign policy experience. Unfortunately for him, \n     it is bad experience.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement by Former Secretaries of State, Defense, Directors of Central \n  Intelligence and National Security Advisors on the Sale of Russian \n                   Weapons to Iran, October 24, 2000\n\n       The following individuals, who include supporters of both \n     Governor George W.

Mr. President, it looks as though we are going to \nhave to respond to the many charges that are being made on the Senate \nfloor in the Presidential campaign. I am sorry it has come to that \nbecause I don't like to see that happening on the Senate floor. I am \ncommitted to not letting the record go unchallenged when I know for a \nfact the record is being misrepresented.\n  In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts earlier this afternoon \nmisrepresented the facts about Governor Bush's record in Texas. I am \nvery proud to say that Governor Bush has an outstanding record in \nTexas; that Texas is a great place to live; that Texas has surpassed \nNew York now to be the second largest State in America. That is because \nso many people are choosing to come to Texas to live. They are coming \nfor a variety of reasons. Quality of life is No. 1. A good solid public \neducation system that is improving every day is another. Quality health \ncare is another. We have many reasons to be proud of the record of our \nState and the Governor and the legislature of our State.\n  I will address first the issue of education. This has been the most \negregious misrepresentation. In fact, the Rand organization that does \nresearch into many areas put out just this last July a comprehensive \nstudy of public education reforms in our country. The report based its \nanalysis on the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests given \nbetween 1990 and 1996. The authors ranked the 44 participating States \nby raw achievement scores, by scores that compare students from similar \nfamilies and by score improvements. They also analyzed which policies \nand programs accounted for the substantial differences in achievements \nacross States that can't be explained by demographics.\n  What they were doing is taking 44 States that had significant public \neducation reforms and determining what worked and what didn't. I will \nread directly from the press release that was issued by the Rand \nCorporation.\n\n       Math scores are rising across the country at a national \n     average rate of about one percentile point per year, a pace \n     outstripping that of the previous two decades and suggesting \n     that public education reforms are taking hold. Progress is \n     far from uniform, however. One group of states--led by North \n     Carolina and Texas and including Michigan, Indiana and \n     Maryland--boasts gains about twice as great as the national \n     average.\n\n  I just learned that Senator Kennedy made the charge that Texas is \ndead last in public education.\n  I think the Rand study released in July of this year that looked at a \ncomprehensive set of scores from 44 States should be given some weight.\n  No. 2, from the Rand report:\n\n       Even more dramatic contrasts emerge in the study's \n     pathbreaking, cross-State comparison of achievement by \n     students from similar families. Texas heads the class in this \n     ranking. . . .\n\n  I am not going to read the names of the States that are at the bottom \nbecause I don't think it is necessary. Texas is No. 1.\n\n       Although the two States are close demographic cousins, \n     Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points \n     higher on the NAEP math and reading tests than their . . . \n     counterparts. In fact, the Texans performed well with respect \n     to most States. On the fourth grade NAEP math tests in 1996, \n     Texas non-Hispanic white students and black students ranked \n     first compared to their counterparts in other States, while \n     Hispanic students ranked fifth.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       The most plausible explanation for the remarkable rate of \n     math gains by North Carolina and Texas is the integrated set \n     of policies involving standards, assessment and \n     accountability that both States implemented in the late 1980s \n     and early 1990s.\n\n  I remind you that Governor Bush was elected in 1994 in Texas. That is \nwhen we started beginning to see the results of the reforms that have \ntaken place.\n  Let's talk about Governor Bush's record. Since being elected \nGovernor, George Bush has seen minority test scores increase by 85 \npercent. Overall test passage rates increased by 38 percent. Governor \nBush and the legislature, working together, increased teacher salaries \nby one-third since his election, increased public funding of education \nby $8 billion, and per pupil\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\nexpenditures have increased by 37 percent. Under Governor Bush's \neducation reform plan, social promotions were ended. We spent $200 \nmillion in new early education funding to make sure all third graders \nread at grade level.\n  That is the emphasis Governor Bush has made in Texas that is \nbeginning to reap the great rewards shown by the students who have been \ntested in these recent tests that are now being studied. In fact, Texas \nis at the top of the class. It is because they are going to the third \ngrade level to target students who don't have reading skills. Governor \nBush believes that if a child can't read at grade level in the third \ngrade, of course, the child is going to have trouble going through the \npublic education system.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to know if the child is trying to \nprogress without reading skills, the child is going to fall behind. \nThat is what we are trying to correct in Texas, and it is working. It \nis working. That is why our test scores are skyrocketing.\n  I think we need to put to rest all of the misinformation that is out \nthere about the Texas public education system. We are very proud that \nwe are putting the money into the system; we are increasing teacher's \nsalaries; we are attracting more teachers so that our teacher shortages \nwill go down.\n  Most public schools have teacher shortages, and we are trying to \naddress that issue with creativity. We are trying to attract people \ninto the classroom who have specific skills that we don't have in the \nclassroom now because of the teacher shortages. So we are targeting \nmath and science and languages and computer skills. We are looking to \nretired military people, people retired from industry, and we are \ntrying to attract them to the teaching profession because we think it \nis so important that our young people have access to this kind of \nquality in the classroom.\n\n  We in Texas stand second to none in the improvements in our public \neducation system, and it is going nowhere but up. We know if we can \ncatch those children in the third grade, they are going to have a \nchance to reach their full potential, and that is what Governor Bush is \ndoing in Texas and what he wants to do for our country.\n  Let's talk about health care. Governor Bush and the Texas Legislature \nhave led the effort to enact the Nation's first comprehensive Patients' \nBill of Rights. In fact, Texas has a Patients' Bill of Rights, and it \nis a terrific program. It is working. It is working because we have an \nindependent review process, because we are targeting health care; we \nare not targeting trial lawyers being able to sue HMOs--although that \nis allowed if all of the appeals are exhausted. It is allowed, but \nthere are caps on noneconomic damages. So that brings more reasonable \nlimits to irrational lawsuits, but it allows the protection of the \npatient who doesn't get the good care.\n  But the focus is not on retribution; the focus is on getting health \ncare in the first place. It doesn't help the patient to be able to sue \nlater for a terrible accident. What we want is for the health care \ndecisions to be made by the patient and the doctor. That is what the \nPatients' Bill of Rights does in Texas. It became law while Governor \nBush was our Governor, working with our bipartisan legislature.\n  Today, we have 100,000 children enrolled in the CHIP program. We will \nenroll 425,000 by the end of next year. We are in the process of \neducating parents about who is eligible for the CHIP program. We are \ngoing to reach every child who is eligible for this program so that our \nchildren will have health care.\n  Let me tell you what Governor Bush and the legislature did to make \nsure of that coverage. They allocated the largest part of the tobacco \nsettlement that Texas got to the CHIP program for health insurance for \nevery child in Texas, and they put into a trust fund billions of \ndollars from which the interest will go to every county in Texas for \nthe purpose of providing indigent health care in those counties \nbecause, of course, in many counties in Texas the buck stops with them \nfor the provision of health care for their indigent population.\n  This money will come in perpetuity to every one of the 254 counties \nin Texas. Every one of those counties will participate in the interest \non that trust fund for their health care needs in that county, and that \nis a huge help for those counties providing that health care. That was \ndone under the leadership of Governor Bush and the great speaker of the \nTexas House and the Lieutenant Governor of Texas. It was a bipartisan \neffort that made that happen.\n  So I think our Texas health care system is very sound. I have heard a \nlot of charges being made about the quality of our public education and \nour health care, and I just happen to know firsthand that those making \nthe charges are misinformed. I don't think we need to run down one of \nthe great States in our Nation in order to get advantages in the \nPresidential race.\n  I am disappointed, frankly, in my colleagues who would do this. I am \ndisappointed that they don't have enough to say about their views and \ntheir visions for our country, that they have to come to the Senate \nfloor and run down Texas in their campaign for President of the United \nStates. I don't think it is necessary, I don't think it is proper, and \nI don't think it is seemly. I think we can do better in this country, \nand I don't think--at least I hope that not one person in this country \nis going to have his or her vote swayed because of what is happening in \nTexas.\n  I would like to think that if people are looking at Texas they have \nthe facts and that they have a good feeling about my great State. I \ncertainly don't think running down my State is the way to run a \nPresidential campaign because people are moving to our State by the \nthousands. That is why Texas is now the second largest State in \nAmerica--surpassing New York. They are coming there because it is a \ngood climate in which to do business; it is a good climate in which to \ncreate jobs; and it is a good climate in which to raise a family. It is \na good place to live. And we have a Governor who has contributed a \nwhole lot to make that happen. We have a great legislature that has \nworked with our Governor in a bipartisan way.\n  That is what our Governor would like to bring to the Congress. We \nwould like to be able to work in a bipartisan way to make the laws that \nwill achieve the dreams of every American child. We would like to have \ncooperation between the Republicans and the Democrats. But I don't \nthink we are fostering cooperation when people come to the Senate floor \nand run down my State. I don't think that is very bipartisan, and I \ndon't think it is very honorable.\n  I hope we can turn off the Texas bashing. I hope we can talk about \nthe dreams and aspirations of our Presidential candidate. I hope we can \ngive Governor Bush the credit for the reforms in the public education \nsystem that are making such a difference in the lives of so many \nTexans. Our children are learning to read and they are beginning to \nlike school. They are wanting to stay in school, and they are not going \nto drop out of high school if they have a chance to see that their \npublic education is going somewhere. We are giving hope to our \nchildren. We are taking care of them. That is what we should all want \nfor all of our States.\n  I don't think we should have to continually come to the floor to \ndefend our State. I hope I don't have to do it again. But I guarantee \nthat I will be here again if I hear that one of my colleagues is \nbashing Governor Bush and the State of Texas. Every time I hear that is \nhappening, I am going to come to the floor and I am going to ask for \ntime to set the record straight because the record is a good one. The \nrecord is one of education reform that has a goal, that allows every \nchild in Texas to reach his or her full potential, and a goal that we \nwant for every State in this country. We want no child to be left \nbehind. We want every child to reach his or her full potential with a \npublic education--not that we don't wish the children who have private \neducation well. We want them to have those choices. We want children to \nbe able to go to private schools, or parochial schools, or public \nschools, or charter schools. We want all the options out there because \nwe believe with all of the options that every child will then have a \nchance to do what is best for that child, and we believe the base of \nall of this is a strong system of public education.\n  We believe that a public education that has competition is a better \npublic education. That is why we want the\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\nchoices and the creativity for our children's education.\n  I hope this is the end of Texas bashing. I hope this is the end of \nour congressional session so we can have our Presidential campaign on \nthe merits so that the people of our country will be able to listen to \nthe Presidential candidates. But I don't think we need to have a \nPresidential race that runs down the State of one of our candidates. \nThank goodness we don't see that happening on the other side of the \naisle. The Republicans are not bashing Tennessee. We like Tennessee \nvery much. We don't think it is necessary to run down a State from \nwhich another Presidential candidate comes in order to get advantages. \nWe happen to believe Tennessee is a great State. We believe Texas is a \ngreat State, too.\n\n  I hope this is the end of this kind of politicking. I hope it is the \nend of using the Senate floor for political advantage in the \nPresidential race.\n  I hope we can give the credit that is deserved to the Governor of \nTexas and to the Legislature of Texas working together and for their \nwillingness to address the issues of education reform, for their \nwillingness to address the issues related to health care and health \ncare coverage for our children because we have made it a priority in \nTexas. That is why it is such a terrific State; we believe in the jobs \nthat are created in Texas and the good working people who live in Texas \nhave been able to do very well because we have a healthy climate in \nTexas and a healthy business climate, as well as a healthy environment \nand a healthy climate in which to raise families. Those are the \nfundamentals of what our State has to offer, and it is why so many \npeople are moving to our great State and why we welcome that move.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to correct the record \nthat was created with some misinformation earlier today. I hope we will \nnot have to defend Texas again. I hope we are very close to ending the \nTexas bashing because I don't think anybody is going to vote against \nGovernor Bush because of misinformation about Texas. I think the people \nof America are smarter than that. I think the people of America deserve \nbetter than that. It is my fervent hope that they are able to hear the \ncandidates' views on the issues without the negative campaigning on \nwhat is happening in Texas. I think if anybody would just come to Texas \nand see for themselves, they would be very pleased with the leadership \nof Governor Bush and our Texas Legislature.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nin morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague from Texas for \nher comments on the floor. It seems that our colleague, Senator Kennedy \nfrom Massachusetts, has decided that now he wants to come over daily \nand tell people how terrible Texas is. I think my dear colleague from \nTexas has done a very good job answering Senator Kennedy. But I don't \nthink, quite frankly, the charges need to be answered per se in any \nother way other than saying that in America, thank God, we have a \nfreedom where people can move. So if Texas were this terrible State \nthat Senator Kennedy says it is, then we would expect people to be \nexercising their freedom to move out of Texas and to move to paradise \nStates such as Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am thrilled with the presentation of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when he is through I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy would have us believe that \nTexas is a terrible place. But we can look at what is actually \nhappening in Texas. We created 1.6 million new, permanent, productive, \ntax-paying jobs for the future since Governor Bush has taken office. \nThis is 50% faster than job growth nationwide. And while the Nation has \nlost manufacturing jobs, we have created almost 100,000 new \nmanufacturing jobs in Texas under the leadership of Governor Bush.\n\n  But there is a simple, empirical test as to whether people want to \nlive in a State and what the quality of life is and how good the \npolitical leadership is of that State. People vote with their feet. \nPeople vote with their feet by leaving places that have bad government \nand they come to places that have good government.\n  Senator Kennedy wants us to believe that Texas is this terrible \nplace. The incredible paradox is, consistently now for over 30 years, \npeople have been leaving Massachusetts and moving to Texas. For over 30 \nyears, Texas has exploded in population as Americans have chosen to \nmove there, make their life there, and cast their lot with those who \nwere elected to represent them in Texas. And for over 30 years, people \nhave cast their lot by picking up, packing up their children in the \nstation wagon, and driving out of Massachusetts. It seems to me that is \nthe empirical test.\n  I personally believe that this silly business about attacking States \nas part of a political campaign doesn't make any sense. I don't know \nwhy Senator Kennedy feels compelled to talk about it. I don't know why \nhe feels compelled to try to attack Texas. The last fellow that tried \nto attack Texas was General Santa Ana. It did not turn out too well for \nhim. Maybe Senator Kennedy thinks it is going to turn out better for \nhim than it did for General Santa Ana.\n  I think the message here is not that Massachusetts is a bad place \nbecause people are picking up and moving out of it; in fact, it is a \nvery nice place. They have very good people. But they have politicians \nwho have implemented in Massachusetts the program that Al Gore wants to \nimplement in America. They have spent and taxed, spent and taxed, spent \nand taxed. In the process, every time we take a census, every time we \nreapportioned representation in the U.S. Congress for the last 30 \nyears, relatively speaking, as compared to the population growth of the \ncountry, people have moved out of Massachusetts and moved to Texas. We \nhave gained congressional representation, and Massachusetts has lost \ncongressional representation.\n  I don't think that says that Massachusetts is a bad place. Everything \nI know about their people, they are wonderful people. But it says \nsomething about the key issue in the campaign for President of the \nUnited States. It says that when Americans have the right to vote with \ntheir feet, they turn their backs on the policies of Al Gore--spend and \ntax, spend and tax, spend and tax--and they vote with their feet by \nwalking away from those policies.\n  Senator Kennedy has come over today and yesterday and instead of \ndefending Gore's policies, which no one can defend, he tries to attack \nTexas. But the plain truth is, the people who have moved out of \nMassachusetts in the last 30 years have moved because they were \nrejecting Al Gore's policies of spend and tax that have been \nimplemented in Massachusetts.\n  Here is the problem. If we implemented those policies in America, the \npolicies that have been implemented in Massachusetts and that Al Gore \nhas proposed, with almost $3.3 trillion worth of new Government \nspending, over 70 massive new Government programs and program \nexpansions, if we adopted those policies in America, where would you \nmove? How would you move with your feet? Who is ready to walk off and \nleave their country?\n  The problem is, we can vote with our feet to leave Massachusetts and \nflee bad government and come to Texas. But we can't vote with our feet, \nwe don't want to vote with our feet, to leave America. So again we \ndon't want to leave America, I say to my dear colleague from Utah; we \nneed to turn our back on the policies of tax and spend that have been \nimposed by politicians in Massachusetts and we need to reject them for \nAmerica.\n\n  I have thought it is bad policy and bad form to debate the campaign \nfor\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\nPresident on the floor of the Senate. But given that Senator Kennedy is \nnow going to do it every day, apparently, I thought I would take the \nbait and talk for a moment.\n  When people were listening to the Presidential debates--the Senator \nfrom Utah watched them, I know, because we talked about it the next \nmorning--they kept hearing Al Gore say: 1 percent of Americans get all \nthe benefit. They get all these tax cuts. It is the rich people. It is \nthe people against the privileged. And Al Gore is for the people. That \nis what they heard.\n  Those, by the way, are the same slogans that destroyed ancient Rome \nand destroyed ancient Athens. And I have to say that Al Gore sounds \nlike a socialist candidate running in a Third World country, to stoop \nlow enough to use that kind of language.\n  I want to explain to people why it is phony. Let me start by talking \nabout Al Gore's record on taxes. Everybody knows he is not for George \nW. Bush's proposal to cut taxes. We all know that. Let me talk about \nhis record in Congress, and as Vice President, on taxes. How many \npeople know that when Jimmy Carter was President he proposed a tax cut \nin 1978, that among other things raised the personal exemption from \n$750 to $1,000 for working families with children, and made the earned-\nincome tax credit permanent. When Jimmy Carter in 1978 said the \nAmerican people deserve a tax cut and because of inflation--remember, \nSenator Bennett, the inflation was in double digits when Jimmy Carter \nwas President--he said we need to raise the personal exemption. What \ndid Al Gore say? It is for the rich. It is for the rich. When you raise \nthe personal exemption from $750 to $1,000, it will help the rich \npeople. So he voted against the tax cut. Apparently, everybody that got \na tax cut was rich.\n  Then in 1981 when Ronald Reagan proposed reducing taxes across the \nboard for everybody, taking millions of families off the tax rolls \ncompletely, Al Gore thought that was a tax cut for rich people, and so \nhe voted no.\n  Then when we had our effort to reduce the tax burden in 1995, Al Gore \nagain had a chance to support tax cuts, but he supported the veto that \nkilled the bill.\n  Then when we had the Tax Relief Act of 1999, a tax relief that was \naimed at repealing the marriage penalty, Al Gore again supported the \nveto that killed the bill. He believed that if you make $21,800 and you \nmeet another person who makes $21,800 a year and you fall in love and \nyou get married, you become too rich to deserve a tax cut, and you are \ngoing to pay on average $1,400 a year to the Federal Government in \ntaxes for the right to be married.\n  Why should you do that? Because Al Gore believes that he can spend \nthat $1,400 better than your family can spend it. So when he had a \nchance in that tax cut to say yes, he said no.\n  When we passed the marriage penalty repeal, free standing, in the \nyear 2000, he was opposed to it because we actually stretched the tax \nbracket for couples with each person making $21,925 a year so that they \ndidn't go into the higher, 28 percent tax bracket. But Al Gore thought \nthey were the 1 percent who were privileged and so he supported the \nPresident in vetoing the repeal of the marriage tax penalty.\n  Then we passed the death tax repeal. This is a tax that small \nbusiness people and family farmers pay. They work a lifetime to build \nup a business or family farm. They scrimp, they sacrifice, they save, \nand they build up the farm or business. They may not have much cash, \nbut their land, if they are farmers, is worth a lot of money if they \nsold it. But they don't want to sell it. Their father worked it. They \nworked it. They want their children to work it. But Al Gore said: No, \nyou are rich. And, besides, if you have to sell your family business, \nif you have to sell your family farm, it is worth it because the \nGovernment can spend this money better than you can spend this money.\n  Now look, here are all of the tax cuts since Al Gore has been a \nMember of Congress, or Vice President, that have been considered--major \ntax cuts by the U.S. Congress in all the years since Al Gore came to \nthe House of Representatives. Guess what. He thought every one of these \ntax cuts was for rich people, because he never voted for a major tax \ncut. Not once since he came to Congress has he believed, on a major tax \nbill, that we ought to be cutting taxes.\n  I guess he thought, when we were raising the exemption for children \nfrom $750 to $1,000, that all those children were rich. When Reagan cut \ntaxes across the board, took millions of people off the tax rolls, I \nguess Al Gore thought they were all rich, because he was against it. \nThe point is, he has been against every major tax cut since he has been \nin public life; every one of them has been a dangerous scheme, to Al \nGore.\n  Now that is only part of the story. You see, we have raised taxes \nsince Al Gore has been in Congress. In fact, I have here every major \ntax increase that has been voted on since Al Gore came to Congress and \nwhile he was Vice President. Guess what. One thing you have to give him \ncredit for, he is totally consistent; he has never voted against a \nmajor tax increase since he has been in public life. He voted for the \nmajor tax increase in 1983, 1984, 1987, in 1990, and 1993, and let me \ntalk briefly about 1993.\n  You heard, if you watched all those debates, that Al Gore wants to \ntax rich people. He loves capitalism, but he seems to hate capitalists. \nHe loves economic growth, but he seems to hate people who create it. He \nwants to pit people against each other, so if somebody is creating \njobs, you ought to resent them if you are a worker.\n  I do not know about our colleague from Utah, but neither of my \nparents graduated from high school. No poor person ever hired me in my \nlife. Every job I ever got was from somebody who had a lot more money \nthan I had. I was glad to have the job. Those jobs made it possible for \npeople such as me to be successful in America. But Al Gore supported \nevery major tax increase that has been voted on since he has been in \npublic life--he voted for it.\n  Do you remember the point in the debate where he said: I am proud to \nhave cast the deciding vote on the 1993 Clinton economic program. He \ndid not tell people that that deciding vote was for a gasoline tax \nincrease. The rhetoric of Al Gore and Bill Clinton was their 1993 tax \nbill only taxed rich people--it did not tax anybody but rich people. \nBut listen to their definition of rich.\n  If you drove a car or a truck in America, you paid a higher gasoline \ntax, so, by Al Gore's definition, you were rich. If you remember, in \nthe bill that was voted on in the House, that Al Gore supported, it had \na Btu tax that would have taxed everybody's utility bills. Guess what. \nIf you have heating or air-conditioning, if you use electricity or \nheating oil or natural gas, Al Gore believes you are rich, because he \nsaid he was only taxing rich people. Yet he supported taxing \neverybody's utility bill.\n  The final one, which was the ultimate, it seems to me, was the tax on \nSocial Security. You know, it is funny. When you are not in these \ndebates, you watch them on television, and you are brilliant. If you \nwere just there, you would know exactly what to say. It is funny, when \nyou are there, you never quite know what to say. But when Al Gore was \ntalking about Social Security and he was accused of never having done \nanything about it, he didn't defend himself. But in fact he has done \nsomething. Al Gore, in fact, cast the deciding vote on something that \nprofoundly affected Social Security, and that deciding vote was to tax \nthe Social Security benefits of people who make over $25,000 a year--in \nfact, to tax 85 percent of the benefits of every retiree in America who \nmade over $25,000 a year.\n\n  Wait a minute. Al Gore said, when he was for this bill, that it only \ntaxed rich people. If you make $25,000 a year and you are drawing \nSocial Security, to Al Gore you are rich.\n  A final thing, and then I will stop. I thought it would be \ninteresting. We heard all this business about who gets Al Gore's tax \ncut. I decided to do a little experiment. It is a little bit clever--it \nis not too clever--but here is the basic point. I decided to take a \npage out of the Washington Post. This is a want ads page of the \nWashington Post. It is page D11, on Tuesday, October 24. I have \nreproduced it up here.\n  I went through this list of jobs and asked: Who taking a job in this \nlist would not be too rich to get Al Gore's tax cut? I am not talking \nabout a tax cut you get if you do what Al Gore wants you to do. I am \ntalking about a\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\ncut in your income taxes, where you get to keep more of your money. So \nfollow with me, if you will. This is page D11 of the want ads. Here are \nall the jobs: From Fairfax Yellow Cab, ``cash daily''; dispatcher; we \nhave here a sports entertainment local branch office for a national \nsports marketing firm; we have here a newspaper carrier; we have a \ndriver for a warehouse chain--pretty much typical jobs in America.\n  If you go through this and you say, OK, take off every job that was \non the want ads page in the Washington Post on Tuesday so that you just \nleave those jobs that, if you take those jobs, you get Al Gore's tax \ncut, there it is.\n  Now look. This is page D11 of the Washington Post. These are jobs \nthat are out there right now for people: Landscape foreman and laborer, \njanitorial; interior design, sales; driver, class A tractor-trailer; \ndrafter, 2 years of experience needed. These are real jobs in the real \nworld. If you took one of these jobs, would you be too rich to get Al \nGore's tax cut? When you take all the job ads off that would make you \ntoo rich for Al Gore's tax cut, that is what is left. Those are the \njobs you could take and you would get Al Gore's tax cut. Here they are: \nDry cleaning, pants pressers.\n  You can take a job in Vienna. Let me make it very clear, I am not \ndenigrating these jobs. These are tickets to success in America. Thank \nGod people are creating these jobs.\n  I do not want to go too far in reading it. Here is the point: You \ncould get a job pressing pants, you could get a job as a lifeguard and \ncleaning a swimming pool, you could get a job as a newspaper carrier, \nand you could get Al Gore's tax cut. But if you have any of these other \njobs--one can see the difference between them--if you got any of those \nother jobs, you do not get Al Gore's tax cut. I guess this says you are \nin the 1 percent. That comes as a big surprise to people as to who is \nrich and who is not rich.\n  I will sum up, make my point, and then yield to Senator Bennett.\n  Al Gore has served in public life for a long time. In fact, he took \npride in it. Look, it is God's work to be involved in public life. The \npoint is, on every tax increase since Al Gore has been in public life, \nevery one of any size or significance, he has voted for every one of \nthem. Every tax cut voted on since Al Gore has been in public life, he \nhas opposed every single major tax cut.\n  He has written a so-called tax cut that 89 percent of the jobs in the \nWashington Post on page D11 on Tuesday, if you took one of those jobs, \nyour income would be too high to qualify for his tax cut.\n  If you did something he wanted you to do, that there was some kind of \nfavorable tax treatment for, you might get some benefit, but in terms \nof getting to keep more of your own money to spend, which is what most \npeople call a tax cut, this is what you are down to.\n  Why? Why has Al Gore in his whole public life never voted against a \ntax increase, never voted for a tax cut, and why does he want to \nexclude almost anybody who would get any job at random out of the \nnewspaper? Because he believes in his heart that Government can spend \nthe money better in Washington than you can spend it at home.\n  Al Gore is not against married couples. He is not against love. I \nknow he loves his family, and he has a wonderful family. He should love \nthem. But he believes that having working couples in America pay $1,400 \na year in a marriage penalty is OK, it is a good thing, it ought not to \nbe repealed, because he believes Government can spend the $1,400 better \nthan they can spend it.\n  He believes it is OK to make people sell the family farm or sell the \nfamily business and destroy their parents' life's work and everything \ntheir family has worked for in America to give Government 55 cents out \nof every dollar they earn, not because he does not like small business \nor does not like family farms, he likes them, but he believes with all \nof his heart that Government can spend the money better than they can. \nIf you have to sell your family farm and you have to give the life work \nof your parents and grandparents to the Government, he believes the \nGovernment will do the right thing in spending it and you will be \nbetter off.\n  If you believe that, your choice in this election is very clear. If \nyou believe that Government, by spending $3.3 trillion on new \nGovernment programs, which is what Al Gore has proposed, can make your \nlife better, then you ought to vote for him. If you believe it is not \nrisky to spend $3.3 trillion in Washington but it is risky to give back \n$1.3 trillion in tax cuts to working Americans, Al Gore is your man.\n  On the other hand, if you believe the Government is probably about as \nbig as it ought to be, if you believe that you can do a better job \nspending your money than the Government can do, then you probably ought \nnot to vote for Al Gore. You probably ought to vote for George Bush.\n  To tie it all together, what does this have to do with bashing Texas \nand Massachusetts? It has to do with people who have already made these \ndecisions. Millions of people have moved to Texas because they wanted \nlower taxes, because they wanted more opportunity, because they wanted \nto decide. It was not that they hated Government. The Government does a \nlot of good things. It is they believe they can do things for their \nfamily better than the Government can do things for them.\n\n  Senator Kennedy does not believe that. He thinks Al Gore is right. He \nbelieves we need to spend all this money. He believes we need a bigger \nGovernment. His State historically--it has changed; it is getting \nbetter, I believe--but historically, his State believed the same thing, \nwhich is why so many people moved to Texas, because they were voting \nfor freedom instead of Government.\n  Quite frankly, I would rather we not debate the Presidential campaign \non the floor of the Senate, but as long as Senator Kennedy is going to \ndebate it, I am going to debate it. I want to debate the real issues, \nand the real issue is, do you want more Government or do you want more \nopportunity for your family? It is just about as clear as the issue can \nbe clear.\n  Al Gore voted for every tax increase of any significance, against \nevery tax cut of any significance since he has been in public life for \none reason: He believes that Government can spend your money better. I \ndo not. George Bush does not. The question is: What does America think?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized under the \nprevious order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11078-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11078-S11080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas for \nthat most enlightening presentation. I agree with him we probably \nshould not be debating the Presidential race on the floor.\n  I noticed the Senator from Massachusetts comes to the floor every day \nand talks about education, very often giving the same speech using the \nsame set of charts. So I have decided I ought to respond to some of \nthose charts to set the record straight.\n  One of the charts which the Senator from Massachusetts uses shows the \nincreased school enrollment in the Nation, and he uses it to justify \nthe Democratic position that we ought to require spending for new \nschool construction. He says: Where are these students going to be \nhoused if we do not pass this bill in the Federal Government that will \nmandate school construction?\n  We Republicans have always said we are willing to spend the money on \neducation. Make no mistake, we are not talking about dollars here. \nIndeed, the bill that is working its way through the process and may \ncome to the floor this week has more money for education than the \nPresident initially requested. Understand that. We are not talking \nabout dollars, we are talking about control. Who is going to control \nthe spending of those dollars? Will it be the Federal Government or \nwill it be the people in the local areas?\n  I came across this chart, which I have had reproduced. It \ndemonstrates what is happening with the percentage changes in public \nelementary and secondary school enrollment. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has a chart showing enrollment going up, and I agree with \nthat, but this is a different chart, and it comes from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. This, obviously, is not Republican propaganda. \nThis comes from the administration. It breaks down school enrollment by \nregion.\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n  You will notice that there is an increase in school enrollment in the \nWest, where I live. It shows an increase from 1988 to 1998 and a \nprojected increase from 1998 to 2008. It is a tremendous increase.\n  There is an increase in the South. This shows the increase from 1988 \nto 1998 and the projected increase from 1998 to 2008.\n  But when we go to the Northeast, we find that the projection is the \nother way.\n  In the Northeast, the projected percentage change in public \nelementary and secondary school enrollment is going down, not up; and \nin the Midwest, it is going down, not up--down by an even greater \namount. It has gone up less than any other region in the 10-year period \nprior to 1998, and will go down more than any other region in the years \nfrom 1998 to 2008.\n  When you see the breakdown coming from the Department of Education, I \nthink you see the flaw in the argument of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. And I think you see the reason to support the position \nthe Republicans have taken. Yes, we need new school construction in \nthis country, but we do not need it everywhere. We do not need it \nmandated from Washington. Washington, I have discovered, has a way of \nadopting formulas. Boy, have I learned about formulas since I have been \nin the Senate.\n  We had a debate on this floor about funds to address class size, and \neveryone was saying: We must reduce class size if we are going to \nimprove education. I am all for reducing class size. Then I looked at \nthe formula, and I discovered a very interesting thing. Do you know the \nState that has the largest class size? It is a tossup. Sometimes it is \nCalifornia; sometimes it is Utah.\n  When I looked at the formula for how Washington would allocate the \nmoney that we were supposedly adopting to reduce class size, I found \nthat it had nothing whatever to do with class size. It was a formula \nbased on poverty, and States that already had smaller class sizes would \nget most of the money for the purpose of reducing class sizes. And my \nState, which vies for having the largest class size, would get precious \nlittle of that money.\n  So I opposed that proposal. And I got beaten up in my campaign: \nSenator Bennett, you are not in favor of reducing class size because \nyou didn't vote for the proposal. I said to my opponent: Read the bill \nand you will find that it would not have done much for Utah. Once you \ngot past the title, it had little to do with reducing class size where \nenrollments are highest.\n  The same thing is true here. We are talking about the need for new \nconstruction, but are we going to have a Federal formula that will \ndetermine how the money is allocated per State? Every State, I \nguarantee you, will get money to increase school construction, \nincluding States in the Northeast, where enrollment is projected to go \ndown, not up. The money would be allocated the way Washington \nallocates, and those of us in the West would get hurt.\n  We need to understand that when we use these educational slogans \nabout ``we must build new schools because our enrollment is going up,'' \nwe are glossing over the issue, and we are not paying attention to what \nit really is. This is why I am proud to be supporting the Republican \nposition that says: Federal spending for education, yes. Federal \ndominance of education, no. Increased money from the Federal Government \nfor the districts that need it, absolutely. Federal dictating to the \ndistricts, no.\n  So every time the Senator from Massachusetts shows us his charts and \ntells us about enrollments going up, let's remember that enrollments \nare not going up uniformly. Enrollments are going up differently. If we \npass the bill that the Senator from Massachusetts daily demands that we \npass, I'm afraid that those of us in the West would get shortchanged, \nthose in the South would get shortchanged, and those in the area of the \nSenator from Massachusetts would get extra money at the expense of the \nrest of the country.\n  Should we spend more money on education? Yes. Should we dictate it \nfrom Government? No. Ignoring local needs is not good for education. It \nis not good for our schoolchildren. It would not be the smart thing to \ndo.\n  Now, with regard to another education issue, I have listened to the \nSenator from Massachusetts attack Texas.\n  Yesterday, I pointed out that the quoting of the Rand report as a \nvehicle for attacking Texas demonstrated that someone had not read the \nRand report. I pointed out that the President of Rand himself said, as \nthe second report was issued, that it did not negate the findings of \nthe first report, which said that Texas was No. 1--that Texas had done \nthe best job--in a number of areas.\n\n  When the second report came out, which dealt with Rand's analysis of \nthe Texas test procedures, the President of Rand said, this is not in \nconflict with our earlier findings that said that Texas leads the \nNation in increases in improvements in education. But those who use the \nRand report to bash Texas did not bother to quote the President of \nRand, did not bother to look at the earlier Rand report; they just \npicked out those things that they thought would be good for them.\n  So it has been injected into the Presidential campaign, whether we \nlike it or not. And in that spirit, I went to the web site of Gore-\nLieberman, Inc. to find out some of the things that we could expect \nfrom Vice President Gore if he were elected. I found some very \ninteresting things.\n  I now refer to the Gore-Lieberman web site. It states that Gore would \ntest students with real tests for real accountability. He would require \ntesting to measure achievement and attach real consequences to the \nresults of those tests.\n  I find that very interesting. Is the Federal Government going to \nwrite the tests? And is the Federal Government going to mandate the \ntest and come down on schools that do not meet the achievements of the \ntests? And what are the real consequences that he is talking about?\n  In the campaign, sometimes the rhetoric can get fuzzy. But this is \nthe one I find most interesting: Gore would offer choice of high-\ncaliber preschool. He would make high-quality voluntary preschool \navailable to all 4-year-olds so that every family can have a choice in \npreschool.\n  Dare I use the hated word, Mr. President? Are we talking about \n``vouchers''? Are we saying that money would go to families for a \nchoice in preschool that would be funded by the Federal Government? Are \nwe talking about the Department of Education mandating preschool \navailability to every 4-year-old in the country, and then following \nthat 4-year-old with some money? Are we talking about the GI bill for \n4-year-olds?\n  Congress passed the GI bill after the end of the Second World War, \nand established the precedent that the money goes with the student, not \nto the school. That is a precedent I applaud. All of those who talk \nabout vouchers in elementary and secondary schools say it is terrible \nthat you might spend money on a religious school, that it violates the \nseparation of church and state. I did not notice that with the GI bill.\n  With the GI bill, if a veteran wants to take the money and go to \nNotre Dame and study to be a Catholic priest, the Federal Government \nsays: It's none of our business. We are giving you the money. You go \nwhere you want.\n  So I ask the question: When the Vice President says that he would \nmake available high-quality voluntary preschool to all 4-year-olds, \nwould he object if a 4-year-old decided to go to a Montessori school, a \nMontessori school where he might learn a little bit of Catholic \nhistory? Would we have that happen under the program that is touted on \nthe Gore-Lieberman, Inc. web site? What do they mean when they say \npreschool for all 4-year-olds? We have not had any indication of how \nmuch that is going to cost or how that would be administered in the \nDepartment of Education.\n  Based on past experience, I am afraid how it would be administered, \nthat it would take us back into the same morass I was referring to with \nrespect to this chart. We would see a Federal program that does not \naddress real needs. That would be the case with school construction. \nThat would be the case, by the way, in the proposal for 100,000 new \nteachers. We looked at the proposal of 100,000 new teachers in the \nState of Utah. We can use new teachers in the State of Utah.\n  Everyone can use new teachers. We found out that the program for \n100,000\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\nnew teachers would give us a few additional teachers per school \ndistrict--not per school, per school district. We have school districts \nin Utah that have 100,000 students in them. We would get a few \nadditional teachers for each school district in the State of Utah.\n  The thing I am afraid of is that with even one additional teacher \nwould come a whole host of Federal controls, a whole host of Federal \nrequirements. As I have said on the floor before, I was lured back into \npublic life, away from my business career, when I was asked to serve as \nchairman of the Strategic Planning Commission for the Utah State school \nboard. I found out the degree to which the Federal Government controls \nlocal decisions. The Federal Government puts up 6 percent of the money, \nbut controls 60 percent of the decisions. I didn't like that when I had \nnothing to do with elective politics, when I was just serving a public \nservice responsibility trying to improve education. I don't like it \nnow, when I am in a policy position. I don't think it is sound policy.\n  I think you are going to see the same kind of thing apply to this \nsuggestion from ``Gore-Lieberman, Inc.'' that says there will be \npreschool available to all 4-year-olds. I think the process would be \nthat the Federal Government might put up 6 percent of the money and \nmake 60 percent or more of the decisions. I am guessing because we \ndon't have any of the specifics.\n  Let me leave the education issue and make one final observation in \nresponse to the comments of the senior Senator from Texas. He talked \nabout tax cuts and how, in fact, they benefited people other than the \nrich.\n  Let me give, if I may, briefly, my own experience. This is not \ntheoretical. This is not out of some think tank. This is not some group \nof academics. This is a real experience of a real person in real life.\n  It was in 1984 that I received a phone call from a friend of mine in \nSalt Lake City. At the time I was living in California. I was asked: \nWould you come to Salt Lake and consult with us as we try to start a \nlittle business?\n  At the time I flew to Salt Lake to sit down with those people to talk \nabout that business, they had four full-time employees. They were \nliterally operating out of the basement of the man who had the business \ncard that said he was the president of that company--a grandiose title, \na lot of dreams, and four people. Mr. President, 1984 is smack in the \nmiddle of what we have heard some people call ``the decade of greed,'' \nbecause that was the period of time when the top marginal tax rate was \n28 percent. And that is terrible, some people said, because the rich \nare getting by only having to pay 28 percent on their income.\n  Well, I moved to Utah. I became the president of that company. We \ngrew that company through the decade of greed with internally generated \nfunds. The reason we were able to grow that company with internally \ngenerated funds is because we filed as an S corporation under the tax \nlaw, which meant our top tax rate was 28 percent. That meant for every \ndollar we earned trying to get that company going, we could keep 72 \ncents to fund its growth.\n  The company today has over 4,000 employees, 1,000 times what it had \nwhen it was founded. The company pays millions of dollars today in \ncorporate income tax. The suppliers that supply goods to that company \npay millions of dollars in corporate income taxes. Those 4,000 \nemployees of the company pay millions of dollars in income tax. If you \nwill, that company is making its significant contribution to today's \nsurpluses as those millions and millions of dollars come into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  If the top corporate tax rate, top effective tax rate, had been 39.6 \npercent, as it is today, instead of 28 percent, I can tell you from \nfirsthand knowledge that we could not have grown that company in that \natmosphere. Instead of keeping 72 cents out of every dollar we made in \norder to grow the company, if we had only been able to keep 60, that \nextra 12-cent difference would have sunk us. I know. I sweat over the \nbooks. I worried about meeting payroll. I worried about cash-flow.\n\n  It is the harvest of the seeds that were planted in the decade of \ngreed that are now producing the tremendous income that is coming into \nthis economy. Look at the companies that have built over time and ask \nhow many of them were started in the period when the tax rate was lower \nand paid S chapter funds.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I tried to explain how all this \nworked. I asked the question on the Senate floor: Is there anybody here \nwho understands what a K-1 is? I asked the question when the chairman \nof the Budget Committee at the time was on the floor. He was debating \nthe tax structure. He had no idea what a K-1 was. I asked others in my \nown party: Does anybody know what a K-1 is? They had no idea. They knew \nwhat a W-2 was. That is the form that indicates your wages. But they \ndidn't know what a K-1 was.\n  A K-1 is the tax form that is filed that tells you what percentage of \nyour income has to be paid on your individual income tax because it is \na flowthrough in an S corporation structure.\n  Most entrepreneurs all start out in that structure, and most \nAmericans have no understanding of how it works. That is the area where \nthe high marginal tax rates bite, and that is the area where the \nentrepreneur feels it. Just because there is a tiny percentage of the \npopulation who understands, it doesn't mean that it is a tiny \npercentage of the population who pays those taxes.\n  The argument being made by the Senator from Texas is a correct one. \nWe should recognize that in America the economy and our place in the \neconomy is not static. We are fluid, all of us. We move up and down. \nThere have been times when I have been in the top 1 percent and I have \npaid millions of dollars in taxes. There have been times in my life in \nmy entrepreneurial cycle when I have been in the bottom 1 percent and \npaid no taxes. It is the opportunity to move from the bottom 1 percent \nto the top 1 percent that motivates all Americans. It is the tax burden \nthe Senator from Texas was talking about that de-motivates the \nAmericans who want to make that move.\n  Ultimately, it is the revenue that comes from Americans who take \nthose risks and make those moves that gives us the budget surplus.\n  I close with an observation. It came from another politician who made \nit very clear. He said: We must remember, money does not come from the \nbudget. Money comes from the people. Money comes from the economy.\n  If we assume that money comes from the budget and is therefore ours \nto spend, we make a serious mistake. As long as we remember that money \ncomes from the people, we will make intelligent decisions as to how we \ntreat the people's money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my assistant leader if I might have \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes will be fine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11080-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11080-S11083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHOICES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the assistant leader for the time.\n  I was very interested in hearing the Senator from Utah talk both \nabout the economy and about education. I may never have been in quite \nthat high an income bracket as he was, but I think I have a view that I \nlearned growing up as a child of an immigrant family on my mother's \nside, a first-generation American who had to go to public schools.\n  I know the assistant leader has a major story to tell. I think it is \nvery important that we consider that when we are on the floor. We ought \nto be fighting for the people who really need to make sure they have \nthe economic opportunity; and everything that we do, we should keep \nthose working families in mind because I think that the people at the \ntop 1 percent are OK. In fact, many of them live in my State and they \nare telling me: Senator, we don't want a great big, irresponsible tax \ncut. We are doing great. We want to make sure, in fact, that the rest \nof America can come along. I thank them for that progressive position.\n  I think this Presidential race presents the starkest choice when it \ncomes to our economy, and the good news is we have history to prove who \nsucceeded on this economy and who has failed miserably.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator talked about tax cuts. You are aware, are you \nnot, that the Vice President and the minority, the Senate Democrats, \npushed very hard for tax cuts--for example, a tax cut to allow parents \nto deduct $10,000 a year to send their child to school?\n  Mrs. BOXER. To college, absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Also, the Senator has worked since she has been in the \nCongress on afterschool programs and on child care. The Senator is \naware that, again, Vice President Gore and the Democrats in the Senate \nhave pushed for making sure that people who have to work have some help \ntaxwise with child care.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think one of the biggest differences in the \nPresidential race, which is mirrored on the floor of the Senate as we \ndebate tax legislation, is the fact that in Vice President Gore's plan \nit is the middle class who will get the breaks; in Governor Bush's \nplan, it is the very top 1 percent.\n  I want to be specific because I think people are tired of hearing \nthat, and they don't really know exactly what we are talking about. \nUnder Governor Bush's plan, if you earn over $350,000 a year, you get \nback $50,000 a year. You get back $50,000 a year. That is more than \nthree full-time minimum wage jobs, I say to my friend. If under \nGovernor Bush's plan you earn $30,000 a year, you get back about $200 a \nyear. So I think my friend is right to point out that the kind of tax \ncuts Vice President Gore has in his plan, the kind of tax cuts that we \nstand here and fight for, would be for those in the middle class who \nreally need to have the help.\n  I think that tax deduction for tuition is very important because the \ncost of college is going up enormously.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also yield? I will make sure she has \nadequate time for her statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator noticed what happened on the floor in the \nlast couple of days? An independent group, the Rand Corporation, that \ndoesn't have a political bone in its body--it is independent; it is \nbipartisan; it is fair; and it has been around for a long time. The \nSenator from California is aware that, in effect, the Rand \nCorporation's independent report came out yesterday and said the things \nGovernor Bush has been saying about education in Texas are wrong, not \ntrue, misleading. The children in Texas, in fact, aren't doing any \nbetter than the children in other places. They are doing worse. Has the \nSenator noticed those statements from the other side in trying to \nexplain education?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have.\n  Mr. REID. Today, I got up and read the newspaper and the American \nAcademy of Actuaries--another group similar to the Rand Corporation--\nwhich also is not political, has said that what Governor Bush has been \nsaying about his tax plan, his dream for this country, is flawed; it \nwould bankrupt the country. In the last 2 days, there were two \nblockbuster reports, from the Rand Corporation and the American Academy \nof Actuaries, which say what Governor Bush said is wrong about \neducation and that his tax plan would bankrupt the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am aware of those reports, and I am aware of yet \nanother report that came out in the last few days as well. Another \nindependent, nonpartisan report says Texas is 48th in ranking as far as \na good place to raise a child. Only two States were worse than Texas in \nterms of raising a child.\n  I say to my friend that I don't really know why we are in session \nnow. We should have finished our work a long time ago. As long as we \nare in session, I intend, on behalf of the people I represent, to come \ndown to this floor and make sure the folks in the country understand \nthe choices they are facing, both in the Presidential election and in \nthe congressional elections.\n  When our friend from Utah comes and talks about the economy and says, \namazingly, the reason we are doing well in this economy is because of \nwhat happened 20 years ago, I have to scratch my head and say this is \nback to the future, folks, back to the future. He is citing things that \nhappened 20 years ago.\n  I want to cite what happened when then-President Bush in the 1980s \nwent to Japan. He was there to beg for guidance on what to do about our \neconomy, which was failing. People had no hope. They were afraid. The \nrecession was taking hold. Things could not have been worse. Deficits \nwere as far as the eye could see. He went to Japan and said: Please, \nsir, tell me what you are doing.\n  Well, the answer was right here in America: faith in the \nentrepreneurship of our people, faith in our children, investing in \ntheir education, and the guts to cut this deficit, to make the hard \nchoices that President Clinton and Vice President Gore made. We were \nproud to stand with them and we saw Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. \nSo our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to go back 20 \nyears. That is similar to saying if you had a disease 20 years ago and \nyou took something for it and it didn't work, but something else in the \nnineties worked, you are giving credit to that medicine.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator and I were in the Congress in 1993 when not a \nsingle Republican in the House or a single Republican in the Senate \nvoted for President Clinton's Budget Deficit Reduction Act. The Senator \nremembers that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator remember listening to Senator Wayne \nAllard, then a Representative, saying: ``In summary, the plan has a \nfatal flaw; it does not reduce the deficit.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. I remember that.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator remember Senator Conrad Burns saying: ``So \nwe are still going to pile up some more debt, but most of all we are \ngoing to cost jobs in this country.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. I remember that, and I remember serving on the Budget \nCommittee and listening to these remarks in the committee by Senator \nPhil Gramm from Texas predicting the worst. What did he say?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Gramm said: ``This program is going to make the \neconomy weaker. Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their \njobs as a result of this program.''\n  He said: ``I believe hundreds of thousands of people are going to \nlose jobs as a result of this program. I believe Bill Clinton will be \none of these people.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. How about 22 million new jobs instead of 100,000 lost \njobs?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator knows that a majority of those jobs are high-\nwage jobs. As far as the deficit they talked about--how this deficit \nwas going to be exploding--$300 billion a year in deficit, and it was \nmasked because there was about $100 billion a year we used to offset \nthe debt, which would have been really $400 billion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We have a $260 billion surplus now. I say to my friend, you \nknow what they are saying. I was on a little debate on public \ntelevision with some of them. They are scripted. I didn't realize it--I \nsaid you got this from Frank Luntz, and I didn't realize he was up in \nthe room and he briefed them beforehand.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He is a Republican pollster.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry I didn't mention that he is a Republican \npollster. He scripts them. They are saying the Republican majority has \nput this economy on the road to recovery even though not a single one \nof them had the nerve to vote with the Democrats to get the economy on \nthe right track.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from California. I have so much \nadmiration for the Senator from California because she represents a \ncountry, as far as most of the Senators are concerned. She represents \n35 million people. I think what you say we should listen to because you \nhave seen the economy in California reverse itself.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. The economy in California was just on its knees; it \nwas so bad when Bill Clinton and Al Gore took over. I remember being on \nan airplane talking to Leon Panetta, the then-budget adviser to \nPresident Clinton. And we were looking at every avenue to bring hope to \nthe people. One of the things they did was invest in defense \ntechnology. We had the Technology Reinvestment Act. We did so many \nthings to bring this country back. That is why I wonder why the Bush \ncamp isn't ahead in California because they have spent $1 million \npractically every week--if not more--bashing Al Gore. People remember, \nI say\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\nto my friend. We were in a horrible situation.\n  I was an economics major in college, which doesn't qualify me for \nthat so much. But I do know something about Economics 101. It is pretty \nsimple. You don't give a big massive tax cut in a time when the economy \nis running strong.\n  We have been joined by our friend from New Jersey who ran an \nextraordinarily successful business and came here. We are going to miss \nhim so much. He knows because it is so clear that you don't give the \nstimulus with tax cuts to wealthiest people in the middle of a \nprosperous time. You don't do that. You will only then add to \ninflation, which will lead to higher interest rates, which will then \nturn around and make it more expensive for people to buy a home, to \nsend their kids to college, or to buy cars. As sure as you can bet on \nit, people will start retrenching, and it will lead to a recessionary \natmosphere.\n  We know the George W. Bush plan is wrong--not because we are talking \nabout it from an academic point of view but the fact is we lived \nthrough the trickle-down economics. We lived through that decade. Oh, \nyou could go back and find some quotes from those trickle-down big tax \ncuts to the wealthy. What were the wealthy going to do? They were going \nto invest in the businesses here and create jobs. Let me tell you that \ndidn't happen. A lot of that money went offshore. The bottom line is we \ngot into big trouble. While our Republican friends were talking about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, guess what we did. We \nbalanced the budget without one of their votes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator remembers that the Senator from California and \nI sponsored our own constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nDoes she remember that? We wanted to exclude the surpluses from Social \nSecurity, but they wouldn't vote with us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right. We wanted to protect Social Security. They \ndid not want to go that way, which really led me to Social Security.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be recognized for 5 minutes. It is my understanding we \nwould have 10 minutes remaining after that. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey takes the \nfloor, he is a person who came to the Senate with wealth. He created it \nhimself. He knows what it means to be an entrepreneur. Yet he has been \nsomeone who has fought for the working men and women of this country \nfor his entire 18 years in the Senate. He recognizes that the business \ncommunity needs direction to try to do that. There has been nobody in \nthe Senate that has been more for the working men and women of this \ncountry than Frank Lautenberg. When he speaks on an economic issue, we \nshould listen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg has been my real \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Senator Domenici is the official \nchairman. But I always call Senator Lautenberg my chairman because he \nspeaks for me. He has incredible experience on growing a business that \nturns into a mega business with his compassion and his caring about his \nemployees and people who work for a living. My friend helped on the \nissue of Social Security. We tried to protect Social Security and set \naside that surplus in a lockbox, and we finally made it happen.\n  I want to say again, if we had followed Governor Bush on Social \nSecurity, he promised a trillion dollars to the seniors, and he \npromised the same trillion dollars to the young people, telling them \nthey could have their private stock market accounts.\n  The other thing I didn't mention today is I used to be a stockbroker \nafter I graduated from college with my degree in economics. It was a \nlong time ago. But I have seen the market go up, and I have seen the \nsmiles on the faces of the people who entrusted me with their \ninvestments. I have seen the market go down.\n  I think what we need to keep in mind as we talk about privatization \nof Social Security is this: If you happen to retire on a day when your \nstock market funds are turned into an annuity and prices are high, you \nare doing great. But with a volatile stock market that can go down 400 \npoints in one day, and that happens to be your day, or within the days \nof the month that you are going to turn that stock market fund into an \nannuity, you are going to find yourself in deep trouble.\n  That is another reason why Al Gore makes so much sense because he is \nsaying save Social Security; keep it the foundation of the house. And \nif you want to do a voluntary stock market investment on top of your \nSocial Security foundation, that is fine.\n  My friends, that makes sense. It is conservative. It isn't a river \nboat gamble. It is another great issue at stake. Great issues are at \nstake in this election. It is an exciting election. It is not an \nelection between two people who agree on everything. They do not agree. \nWe have a Republican candidate who wants to go back to the 1980s with \ntrickle-down economics of the past, with small investments in \neducation.\n  I will end my remarks with education because the Senator from Utah \nsaid there is a big difference between Republicans and Democrats. He \nsaid Democrats want the Federal Government to tell the local school \ndistricts what to do. That is incorrect. Every single program that we \nsupport dealing with school construction, dealing with smaller class \nsizes, dealing with after school, dealing with high tech in the \nschools--those are all options the school districts can take advantage \nof if they so choose. There is no program on this side of the aisle, or \nany in Al Gore's portfolio, that says that any local school district \nhas to take these funds. I think that is key.\n  It goes back to Dwight David Eisenhower, whom I always quote, because \nhe said you can't really be a strong country and you can't be secure \nunless you have an educated workforce. This was a Republican President. \nI liked Ike. My family liked Ike. One of the reasons they liked Ike was \nbecause he said that educating our children was a national priority and \nthe Federal Government shouldn't just say: Here, States; take a whole \nlot of money and do what you want. He started the National Defense \nEducation Act. That wasn't a blank check to the States. It was clearly \nfor a purpose, and the purpose was to make sure that our teachers knew \nmath and knew science and could teach math and science.\n  We know if you follow the Dwight Eisenhower kind of system that we \nneed to look at our school districts and say: What do you need help \nwith? Can we help you? We have the resources thanks to the great \nstewardship of the Clinton/Gore team. We have the great stewardship of \nthe economy. We can invest some money.\n  Do you know what they told us? We need to help with the hiring of \nteachers. We need school construction. We need afterschool funds so our \nkids can learn after school. And the Democrats responded.\n  The big fight at the end of this year is over a lot of those issues. \nWe stand with the children; we stand with the families; and we stand \nwith the seniors against the HMOs. That will be a big issue in the last \nfew days. Are we just going to do giveaways to the HMOs and keep \nletting them drop the seniors out of Medicare? We on this side of the \naisle and Vice President Gore are ready to stand up to the HMOs. We are \nready to stand up to the tobacco companies. We are ready to stand up \nfor our children. In the waning days, I think these issues will play \nthemselves out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nNew Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say to Senator Boxer and Senator \nReid, thank you for your comments, but, more than that, for our ability \nto work together to try to take care of our citizens as we believe they \nwould want, to look at the issues fairly and squarely, and not spend as \nmuch time dancing around the truth and around the issues, as often goes \non here. I thank the Senator, and I will send my thanks to Senator \nReid. I will miss working with both of you and colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle.\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\n  I am particularly grateful to the occupant of the chair, the chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, who, although we had \nsome disagreements in terms of particular policies, always tried to \nwork them out. I appreciate that balanced view, even though we didn't \nwin as many as I wanted to.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11083-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, last month, and again last week, the \nRepublican staff of the Senate Budget Committee released two reports \ncriticizing what they wrongly described as the economic plan proposed \nby Vice President Gore and our distinguished colleague, Senator \nLieberman. I wanted to come to the floor to discuss these reports, \nwhich I believe were inappropriate, and a misuse of taxpayer dollars. \nThey also were grossly inaccurate and unfair.\n  Let me read from a section of the Senate Ethics Manual.\n\n                   Campaign Use of Official Resources\n\n       Official resources may only be used for official purposes. \n     It is thus inappropriate to use any official resources to \n     conduct campaign or political activities.\n\n  Mr. President, as we all know, and the Senate Ethics Manual makes \nclear, it is inappropriate to use any official resources to conduct \ncampaign or political activities. Of course, it can be difficult to \ndraw a clear line between official Senate business and campaign \nactivities. And reasonable people can disagree about many of the \ndocuments that are produced routinely here in the Congress. But, having \nsaid that, the reports issued by the Budget Committee staff, in my \nview, go well over the line. These reports are focused entirely on Al \nGore's campaign proposals, or at least the staff's erroneous \ninterpretation of those proposals. And their obvious purpose is not to \nprovide an objective analysis, but to attack the Vice President. These \nstaff reports aren't just biased, they're pure propaganda. And I would \nnote that the latest report was issued just hours before the last \nPresidential debate. Not surprisingly, they issued no comparable \ncritique of Governor Bush's budget plan.\n  Now, Mr. President, I recognize that the Budget Committee is not like \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, which is supposed to operate in a \nnonpartisan manner. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee makes \nno pretense to being nonpartisan, and serves only on behalf of \nRepublican Senators. So one would expect them to issue reports that \nfurther a partisan agenda. But, Mr. President, that does not justify \nthe issuance of reports that are so obviously intended for campaign \npurposes, and that are so blatantly misleading and factually \ninaccurate.\n  Mr. President, I could take a long time reviewing the many flaws of \nthe Republican staff reports, but let me\n\n    \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            NOTICE--OCTOBER 23, 2000\n \n    A final issue of the Congressional Record for the 106th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on November\n 29, 2000, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.\n    All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the\n Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, between the hours of\n 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through November 28.

THOMAS, Chairman.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nmention just a few. Perhaps most importantly, the reports dramatically \nand inappropriately exaggerate the costs of the Gore plan. First, they \nsuggest that the Vice President's $360 billion Medicare ``lock box'' \nrepresents new spending that somehow would use Social Security funds \nand increase the budget deficit. This claim is preposterous. In fact, \nthe Medicare lock box reserves funds for debt reduction, not new \nspending. It wouldn't spend a penny of Social Security surpluses, or \nany surpluses, for that matter. Yet by, in effect, counting as spending \nthe $360 billion Medicare lock box, and an additional $99 billion of \nGeneral Fund transfers to Medicare, the Republican staff has \nartifically created a $450 billion raid on Social Security that simply \ndoes not exist. And, Mr. President, that's just the beginning.\n  The GOP staff also charges the Vice President with the costs of \nbudget proposals put forward by President Clinton, even though the Gore \nplan clearly does not endorse the entire Clinton budget. This results \nin doublecounting many similar proposals put forward by both Clinton \nand Gore, such as their different retirement savings plans. And, of \ncourse, it exaggerates the real cost of the Gore/Lieberman plan. \nAnother way that the GOP staff inflates the costs of the Gore plan is \nto adopt its own scoring rules. The GOP staff went well beyond the \nscoring of the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management \nand Budget. It created its own special methods of evaluating the costs \nof the Vice President's proposals. And it shouldn't come as any \nsurprise that they lead to much higher cost estimates.\n  Take, for example, the Vice President's Retirement Savings Plus \nproposal, which the Gore campaign says would cost $200 billion. The \nRepublican staff cites a figure of $750 billion. This number is simply \nmade up, and is not backed up by any official CBO or OMB estimate. \nSimilarly, the GOP staff exaggerates the cost of Vice President Gore's \npreschool proposal. Their report characterizes the Gore plan as if it \nwere an open-ended entitlement, with no state match. That leads to much \nhigher costs. In fact, though, the Gore proposal is for block grants \nthat require a state match.\n  Another trick that the GOP staff used to create a misleading \nimpression about the Vice President's proposal was to deviate from \nstandard practice and use a so-called ``freeze baseline.'' In other \nwords, the GOP staff counted as a cost of his plan $1.2 trillion in \ndiscretionary spending, and related interests costs, that simply \nreflect the costs of maintaining current policy. These costs normally \nare considered part of the budget baseline, not new spending. The well-\nrespected, nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made this \npoint in a sharp critique of the GOP staff report. The Center concluded \nthat the Budget Committee's analysis, and I quote, ``is marred by \nseveral serious flaws''--unquote--which the Center said inflate the \ncost estimate assigned to the Gore plan.\n  Mr. President, the Republican staff was so intent on slandering the \nVice President as a big spender that they went to extremes in \ncharacterizing some of his proposals. The GOP staff calls anything new \nspending--even tax cuts. Look at what they include in their long list \nof new ``spending and regulatory programs'':\n  Marriage penalty relief.\n  A long-term care tax credit.\n  A disabled workers tax credit.\n  Mr. President, is marriage penalty relief ``new spending''? Even \nGeorge Orwell wouldn't go that far. In fact, the GOP staff's blacklist \ngoes beyond tax cuts. It even includes gun control. Closing the gun \nshow loophole. Banning junk guns. Requiring mandatory gun safety locks.\n  Mr. President, would closing the gun show loophole amount to a return \nof Big Government? Would requiring gun manufacturers to include trigger \nlocks amount to a whole new spending program? I don't think so.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about the Republican report, but \nI won't. And, frankly, the misstatements and distortions in their \nreport are only part of the problem. This report should not have been \nproduced in the first place. It's obviously intended to be used in the \npresidential campaign to harm the Vice President. And it's just not the \ntype of report that should be produced with taxpayer dollars. Campaign \nmaterials should be produced by campaigns, Mr. President, not \ncongressional staff. And, at a minimum, if reports on issues related to \nthe campaign are issued, especially this close to an election, they \nought to at least be fair and accurate. I don't think that's too much \nto ask, Mr. President.\n  Let me recite some facts on Gore and the size of Government.\n  Under the Clinton-Gore administration Government is smaller: Between \n1981 and 1992, the size of the Federal civilian workforce increased. \nSince 1993, however, the Federal workforce has been reduced by \n377,000--a 17 percent decline.\n  The Federal workforce is now the smallest since the Kennedy \nadministration in 1960.\n  Under the Clinton-Gore administration Federal spending is lower: \nSpending as a share of GDP increased between 1981 and 1992--rising from \n21.7% to 22.5%. Since 1992, however, federal government spending as a \nshare of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent to 18.7 percent in \n1999--its lowest level since 1966.\n  Although Bush promises to reduce government, under him, Texas \ngovernment spending increased at twice the rate of the federal \ngovernment. While the Federal workforce has been reduced by 17 percent, \nunder George Bush, Texas has added 6,200 bureaucrats--a 2-percent \nincrease.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11088-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11088-S11097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the passage of H.R.782, The Older Americans Amendments Act of 1999. \nEven with the support of seniors' advocacy groups, it has taken the \nCongress a full five years to reach bipartisan agreement on this \nlegislation. We should not miss this opportunity to keep our commitment \nto our most vulnerable senior citizens. I want to applaud the \npersistence, commitment, and leadership of Chairman Jeffords and \nSenators DeWine, Mikulski and Kennedy, their staffs, and other \ncolleagues on the HELP committee who have been unwilling to give up \nduring this long process.\n  With the enactment of the Older Americans Act in 1965, Congress \ncreated a new Federal program specifically designed to meet the social \nservices needs of older people. In 1972, Congress added the best known \nprogram ``Meals on Wheels'' which brought nutritionally balanced meals \nto seniors' homes or to seniors in congregate settings. In Minnesota \nalone, 185,000 seniors benefit from this seniors' meal program. \nWhenever I talk with seniors or their family members in Minnesota, I \nhear about this valuable service that provides seniors with necessary \nnutrition and, in the congregate settings, necessary socialization.\n  On the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Act, it is fitting \nthat in a bipartisan bicameral manner we vote to continue the Act's \nbroad policy objectives of providing programs related to health, \nhousing, long-term care, employment, retirement, and community services \nfor low and moderate income seniors. I hope the Senate will \noverwhelmingly pass this legislation, as did the House yesterday, and \nsignal America's continuing commitment to our senior citizens.\n  In addition to Meals on Wheels, this legislation continues the \npopular senior jobs program which provides financial help for needy \nseniors, provides them with a sense of meaning and usefulness, and also \nexpands their opportunities for needed socialization. During the 1999-\n2000 program year, Green Thumb (one of the grantees) in Minnesota has \nexceeded the major goals set by Congress and the Department of Labor, \nDOL, for job placement, while serving 1,188 mature job seekers. In \naddition, Minnesota seniors provided nearly 640,000 hours of community \nservices to almost 500 public and non-profit ``host agencies'', \nincluding schools, hospitals, rest homes, libraries, parks, senior \ndining sites and senior centers, museums, and many more.\n  During this past winter, Green Thumb in Minnesota engaged in a \nspecial partnership with the Census Bureau to assist in recruiting \nolder census workers. As a result of Green Thumb's advertising, over \n2,700 mature workers were referred to the Census Bureau. With support \nof the Older\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\nAmericans Act, Green Thumb provided job counseling and training to most \nof these workers.\n  In total, for the 1999-2000 program year, approximately 2,260 \nMinnesota seniors were placed in jobs through all the grantee programs \nin the state. Programs like these are invaluable for the seniors \ninvolved, for their families, and for communities. We must vote to \ncontinue them.\n  This legislation also contains a number of new programs which I \nwholeheartedly endorse because I believe they will protect seniors and \nprovide support for their families and communities. Most noteworthy is \nthe National Family Caregiver Program which is authorized at $125 \nmillion. Minnesota will receive about $1.8 million for the program. The \nCaregiver Program will provide grants to states for the following long-\nterm care services: information about available services to caregivers, \nwhether they be spouses, children, or grandchildren; assistance to \ncaregivers in gaining access to services; individual counseling; \norganization of support groups and caregiver training to help families \nmake decisions and solve programs related to their care giving roles; \nand, perhaps most important of all, respite services to provide \nfamilies temporary relief from care giving responsibilities.\n  This legislation also authorizes new programs for protection of older \nwomen from domestic violence and sexual abuse, rural health care model \nprograms, and computer training. There are also grants to establish \nmulti- disciplinary centers of gerontology to do research and train \npeople in different disciplines to work with the elderly. As our \nelderly population grows so does the need for appropriately-trained \npeople to meet their health and social needs.\n  Every program in The Older Americans Amendments Act of 1999 is needed \nand will contribute to the emotional and physical well being of our \nseniors, those who love them, and the communities in which they live. I \nurge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I support \nH.R. 782, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1999. This legislation, \nof which I am a cosponsor, has been a long time coming. For five long \nyears, senior citizens have been anxiously awaiting the reauthorization \nof the Older Americans Act, and seniors in my home state of West \nVirginia have felt betrayed by the failure of Congress to reauthorize \nthis bill. Betrayed, Mr. President. That is why I am so pleased that, \nin the final days of the 106th Congress, the Senate has the opportunity \nto vote on this much-needed legislation.\n  According to the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services, in Fiscal \nYear 1999, the Older Americans Act made it possible for approximately \n50,459 seniors in West Virginia to have access to vital services like \ntransportation, congregate and home delivered meals, adult day care, \nand health screenings. In addition, 676 seniors in West Virginia were \nable to move into the work force through Title V, the Senior Community \nService Employment Program. These programs have surely helped many, \nmany seniors, Mr. President, and I am pleased that the Senate is \ndemonstrating how important our nation's oldest citizens are by \nreauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation would establish a new \nNational Family Caregiver Support program, which would include respite, \nadult day care, and home care services for individuals with the \ngreatest social and economic needs. With West Virginia having the \ncountry's oldest population for the second year in a row, and with more \nthan fifteen percent of West Virginia's seniors who are age sixty and \nolder considered to be living in a state of poverty, the National \nFamily Caregiver Support program will offer much-needed assistance for \nhome-bound seniors and their families, who are struggling to cope with \nthe emotional and financial burdens placed on them.\n  In June of this year, I was fortunate to attend, and speak at, the \nfirst-ever International Conference on Rural Aging, held in my home \nstate of West Virginia. This conference was an historic opportunity for \nglobal leaders in the aging community to converge and explore the \nvarious challenges facing the exploding senior population, both in the \nUnited States and across the globe. Of the many issues that were \naddressed at the conference, including the lack of access to quality \nhealth care and vital services, loss of independence and autonomy, and \nlack of proper elderly nutrition, I am proud to say that the Older \nAmericans Act offers seniors programs that support their desire to \nremain in their own homes and live independently. The Older Americans \nAct gives seniors, in both urban and rural areas, the opportunity to \nmaintain a high-quality of life and the opportunity to feel like active \nparticipants in their communities. Among the highest concerns of the \nelderly in the United States, the need for reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act has been labeled a critical priority for keeping pace \nwith the rapidly growing aging population.\n  I would like to point out, Mr. President, that Copernicus was 70 when \nhe argued that the sun, not the Earth, is the center of the cosmos. \nGrandma Moses was in her 70s when she started painting. Claude Monet \npainted his famous water lilies at the age of 74. My friend from Ohio, \nformer Senator John Glenn, ventured back into space at the age of 76. \nBenjamin Franklin was 79 when he invented bifocals. These remarkable \nindividuals were most certainly contributing to society well into what \nsociety would consider the ``Golden Years.'' By reauthorizing the Older \nAmericans Act, we are not only giving many other ``golden seniors'' the \nopportunity to contribute to society, but we are acknowledging the \nsense that we value them and we are proud to invest in them. I am proud \nto support this legislation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do \nso as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is truly a privilege to be here today \nto speak in support of this important reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act. I want to thank Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Mikulski and \nKennedy for their leadership and steadfast work toward bringing this \nfor us to consider today. As you know, this is the first \nreauthorization of these programs in eight long years. The House passed \nH.R. 782 on a vote of 405-2 yesterday. It's time has come today.\n  The Older Americans Act is the most important Federal senior's \nservices program and has provided essential services to our nation's \nseniors for the last 35 years. In particular, the program has provided \nservices to those seniors who are vulnerable because poverty, frailty \nor isolation. As America gets older, we have a growing need for the \nservices and programs authorized by the OAA. We in Iowa have the \nhighest percentage of seniors over the age of 85 in the country. We are \nranked 5th in the nation in our percentage of seniors over the age of \n65. The services provided through the Older Americans Act provide a \nlifeline to many of my constituents.\n  I'm proud to support the strengthening of programs such as congregate \nand home delivered meals, family caregiver support, in-home services \nfor the frail elderly such as those with Alzheimer's disease, home \nhealth, and the senior community service program. These programs help \nIowa seniors live independently and remain in their homes and \ncommunities.\n  One of my constituents told me recently what the OAA means to her: \nVirginia Mehl, who lives in a rural town in Iowa, had never worked away \nfrom her farm home. At the age of 79, faced with the death of her \nhusband, she had to go and find work, cleaning an office. Suffering \nfrom fibromyalgia, she was having a real tough time. Thankfully, \nsomeone pointed her to Green Thumb, one of the organizations \nadministering the senior community service employment program. With \ntheir help, Mrs. Mehl learned computer and office skills, enabling her \nto be placed in the office where she now works. She told me: ``Green \nThumb is the best thing that ever happened to me. [I have] the \nopportunity to learn new skills, meet new people, and pay for my aqua-\nexercise classes which I need for my disease.''\n  Mrs. Mehl is just one example of how the Older Americans Act has been \nan extraordinary vehicle for helping hundreds of thousands of senior \nAmericans obtain the training and job experience needed to improve \ntheir lives and provide economic independence, changing the negative \nstereotypes about aging, encouraging seniors to embrace new technology \nand keep up with the changing face of our economy.\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\n  Seniors in our States have been calling on us since 1995 to \nreauthorize these important programs. Today, at long last, and with \nstrong bipartisan cooperation, we will do just that.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the strong support of \nmy colleagues for the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.\n  In July, we celebrated the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans \nAct, a milestone for a program that has meant so much to millions of \nAmerica's seniors. The Older Americans Act brings critical support \nservices to the elderly in communities throughout this nation and has \ngreatly benefitted seniors in my State.\n  The long overdue reauthorization of this Act is particularly \nsignificant for the State of Rhode Island. The Older Americans Act has \nhad a long and rich legacy in my State since the Act's inception. \nIndeed, former Rhode Island Congressman John Fogarty played a key role \nin authoring the original Act, and I am pleased to have played a role \nin the reauthorization of this historic Act.\n  Since 1965, thousands of Rhode Island seniors have enjoyed the \nbenefits of Older Americans Act programs--from congregate and home \ndelivered meals, senior center programs, protective and legal services \nfor the elderly, among other essential programs and services, all of \nwhich have brought comfort and enrichment to the lives of seniors in my \nState. For example, this year, Older Americans Act funding has helped \nto provide the following services to seniors in my State: 667,101 \ncongregate meals at 74 sites; 540,008 home delivered meals; and 3,500 \nclients served through the home visitation program.\n  For many unfortunate reasons, authorization of this legislation \nlapsed in 1995 and since that time, Congress has been wrangling with \nits reauthorization. And if it were not for the hard work and sheer \ndetermination on the part of Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, DeWine, and \nMikulski and their staffs frankly we would not be here this afternoon. \nI would also like to recognize Janette Takamura, the Assistant \nSecretary for Aging, for her insights and expertise that have proven \ninvaluable throughout this process and for her tremendous leadership at \nthe Administration on Aging. Indeed, getting to this point has not been \neasy. I commend my colleagues for their diligence and willingness to \ncompromise on key issues, and I have been pleased to support these \nefforts.\n  Their long and hard work has resulted in a thoughtful and balanced \nbill that lays out a vision for Older Americans Act programs for the \nnext several decades. Specifically, this legislation streamlines and \nupdates existing programs and authorizes new programs designed to meet \nthe needs of the growing population of American seniors and their \nfamilies in the coming century.\n  In particular, as an original cosponor of S. 707, legislation \nintroduced by Senators Grassley and Breaux, I would like to highlight \nthe inclusion of the Family Caregiver Support program in the Older \nAmericans Act reauthorization. The Family Caregiver Support program is \ndesigned to meet the critical needs of families who are caring for \nloved ones with chronic illnesses or disabilities. This program will \nsupport respite services for caregivers, counseling and caregiver \ntraining and information about additional support services in the \ncommunity.\n  Family caregivers are the unsung heros in the provision of long-term \ncare in this country. Nationally, more than 7 million Americans serve \nas caregivers for relatives, friends and loved ones. Last Fall, I held \na Special Senate Committee on Aging field hearing in Rhode Island to \nexplore the burdens and challenges that face family caregivers in my \nState.\n  My home State of Rhode Island has the third highest concentration of \npeople over the age of 65 in the Nation, has enjoyed a longstanding \ncommitment to community-based services for the elderly.\n  Consequently, over 90 percent of Rhode Island seniors are living \noutside of institutional-based care settings, thanks in large part to \nthe selfless contributions of families and friends in providing elders \nwith the support they need to remain in their homes and communities.\n  Indeed, my State has already begun to work on creative ways to \nprovide caregivers the resources they need. Recently, the Rhode Island \nDepartment of Elderly Affairs was one of 16 national recipients of an \nAdministration on Aging demonstration grant to develop and implement a \nmodel to provide training, support and qualified respite care for \nAlzheimer's families. Monies provided through the new Family Caregiver \nprogram under the Older Americans Act will greatly help to fortify and \nexpand ongoing home- and community-based initiatives in my State.\n  I would also like to commend my colleagues for the inclusion of \nfunding under Title IV to help States start to address the \ntransportation needs of our Nation's seniors. Indeed, in Rhode Island, \nthere is a growing demand from senior centers for transit vans to move \nseniors who cannot drive and are not served by regular mass transit. \nThis is an issue of growing importance in my State, and I look forward \nto further considering ways to improve senior transit.\n  In closing, I would again like to express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues and their staffs for their tremendous efforts to reauthorize \nthis monumental piece of legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Older \nAmericans Act amendments of 2000. Seniors are a vital part of our \ncommunity. The programs authorized by this Act help make sure low-\nincome and frail seniors have every opportunity to stay independent, in \ntheir own homes, and remain a part of the community. Through meals on \nwheels and the congregate meal program thousands of seniors in \nWashington state whether homebound or not, receive nutritious meals and \nan opportunity to socialize with their peers. Through community service \nemployment many low-income seniors who have poor job prospects have \nbeen meaningfully employed in a wide range of activities including \neducation, health care, senior centers and nutrition services for older \npeople. This reauthorization makes sure these needs will continue to be \nmet.\n  In addition this bill funds activities to protect the rights of the \nvulnerable elderly through the long-term care ombudsman program which \nprovides volunteer advocates for seniors living in nursing homes and \nother long-term facilities; through programs to prevent elder abuse, \nneglect and exploitation; and through assistance programs for insurance \nand other public benefits.\n  This year's authorization also includes an important new addition to \nthe Older Americans Act--the National Family Caregiver Support program. \nThousands of families are choosing to care for their senior parents and \ngrandparents in their own homes. This can be a wonderful option for \nseniors who are no longer able to live independently but may not need \nor want the full time care of a nursing home, or for those seniors \nunable to afford assisted living arrangements. Counseling, training and \nrespite care will be available to family caregivers. These services \nwill also be made available to grandparents who are caregivers to \nchildren.\n  I deeply believe that seniors in this country should continue to have \naccess to the quality services they have received in the past from the \nOlder Americans Act. This reauthorization not only accomplishes that \ngoal but includes needed improvements. My only regret is that I was \nunable to be here in person to vote in favor of its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support passage of \nthe Older Americans Act (OAA) Reauthorization. This Act has been \nproviding a wide range of services, such as a community service \nemployment program, nutrition services, and research, training, and \ndemonstration activities since 1965 for older persons, especially those \nat risk of losing their independence.\n  One such service is the Act's nutrition program, which provides \nmillions of meals to older persons in congregate settings, such as \nsenior centers, and to frail older persons in the comfort of their \nhomes. The nutrition program is the Act's largest program providing \nmeals to people who are generally older, poor, and living alone. Most \nsignificantly, this program is often the most important source of a \nbalanced, nutritious meal for its elderly participants. While these \nseniors need some assistance securing adequate meals for themselves, \nthrough OAA they don't have to give up living on their own to ensure \nthey have proper nutrition.\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\n  In an effort to expand other home-based services, this bill \nauthorizes $125 million in appropriations for a National Family \nCaregiver Support Program. The new caregiver program which will provide \ngrants to support families and other providers of in-home and community \ncare to older individuals, to develop innovative approaches to \ncaregiving, and to link family support programs with programs for \npersons with mental retardation or related developmental disabilities \nand their families. This provision will help not only our seniors, but \ntheir families who are struggling to care for them in a home \nenvironment rather than a nursing home.\n  Another example of how OAA helps seniors keep their independence is \nthrough the senior community service employment program, which provides \nopportunities for part-time employment in community service activities \nfor unemployed, low-income older persons. One goal of this program is \nto increase the income of these persons, however the broader goal is to \nassist them obtain jobs and become more self-sufficient. While the \nprogram supports over 61,500 jobs for elderly Americans, we all benefit \nfrom its efforts. Its participants are enthusiastic additions to our \nlabor force, eagerly taking on jobs in community service that might \notherwise go unattended. The participants are eager to enter the \nworkforce and are often hired into other jobs outside of the program \nbecause of their strong work ethic.\n  In my home state of Tennessee, 1,224 positions have been established \nfor the senior community service employment program through 1999. \nDuring that same year, 547 older Tennesseans were placed into the \nworkforce outside those positions, which means that Tennessee has a \nrate of 45 percent for transitioning these subsidized part-time jobs \ninto employment outside the program. Of the four senior community \nservice employment program grantees operating in Tennessee, Green Thumb \nis the oldest and largest, serving 744 elderly Tennesseans during 2000. \nGreen Thumb is currently transitioning 65 percent of elderly \nTennesseans from their training program into the workforce, or in other \nwords, at a much higher rate than the national average.\n  In Tennessee, the seniors served by the senior community service \nemployment program are typically destitute women, with little to no job \nexperience and the inability to pay for food and other basic needs. I \nrecently heard the story of 83 year old Nell Taylor of Trenton, \nTennessee. Ms. Taylor has worked at the Department of Human Services in \nTrenton since 1987 after starting with Green Thumb in 1985. As a result \nof her experience in the program, she wrote, ``I am so thankful to know \nI have a job in DHS for it makes me feel like I am wanted and I am \nimportant.''\n  Other stories illustrating the success of this program are those of \nElizabeth Powell and Marion Perry. Elizabeth Powell is a teacher's \nassistant, who also tutors individuals in the ``English as a Second \nLanguage class,'' at the Rhea County Adult Education program in Dayton, \nTennessee. At 69 years of age, Ms. Powell inspires students having \nreceived her own GED at age 58 and knowing personally how the lack of a \ndiploma or GED hinders job opportunities. Marion Perry of Etowah, \nTennessee, is a 57-year-old, part-time school bus driver who needed a \nsecond job to support his family, which includes several adopted and \nfoster children of various nationalities. Within a couple of weeks, \nGreen Thumb assisted Perry in securing a job as a security guard with a \nlocal company.\n  These few programs I've mentioned today, together with the many other \nservices and activities established by OAA, are providing our elderly \nAmericans with needed services, helping them maintain their \nindependence, and affirming the valuable role they play in our \ncommunity. I would like to thank Senator Jeffords and Senator DeWine \nfor their leadership on this issue. I would also like to thank Senator \nKennedy for his work and dedication to this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in half an hour we are going to have the \nopportunity to cast two votes. The first vote will be on the Gregg \namendment. The second vote will be on the Older Americans Act. We have \nthe opportunity to do something that Congress has not done for 8 years; \nthat is, to reauthorize and change and improve the Older Americans Act. \nFor 5 years this bill has not been reauthorized. It is time we do it.\n  Let me be very candid and very blunt about the amendment of my \ncolleague from New Hampshire. I understand his concerns. He has \nexpressed them very well. The reality is we have taken his concerns \ninto consideration, and we have done more than that, we have \nincorporated them into this bill. So the bill we will ultimately pass \ntoday, I certainly hope without the Gregg amendment, will reflect what \nmy colleague from New Hampshire has already contributed. That has \nalready been done. He should be very proud of that because he has been \nthe voice talking about accountability.\n  The bill that is in front of us is a bill that needs to pass. Lest \nanyone make a mistake about what is at stake on this first vote on the \nGregg amendment, if the Gregg amendment is agreed to, the Older \nAmericans Act reauthorization will die. It is as simple as that. We \nhave taken a long time to get to this point. We are in the last few \ndays of this Congress.\n  The House of Representatives, that has been working with us so very \nclosely, passed this identical bill yesterday by an overwhelming vote, \nwith only two votes against it. The idea we would be able to add the \nGregg amendment, which makes changes in the bill, and get the bill \nultimately passed is absurd. Make no mistake about it; the key vote \ntoday is on the Gregg amendment. Anyone who is for the Older Americans \nAct needs to vote against the Gregg amendment.\n  Let me talk about the accountability we have been able to put into \nthis bill. The accountability takes care of those issues about which \nSenator Gregg was concerned. We do it, basically, in two separate ways. \nWe do it by requiring, for the first time, the Department of Labor to \nhave very specific standards and very specific criteria. We enumerate \nthat in the section I have in front of me called ``Responsibility \nTests.'' We outline what the Department of Labor will take into \nconsideration when they decide whether or not this contract will be let \nto an organization. It says:\n\n       Before final selection of a grantee, the Secretary shall \n     conduct a review of available records to assess the applicant \n     agency or State's overall responsibility to administer \n     Federal funds.\n       As part of the review described in [this paragraph] the \n     Secretary may consider any information, including the \n     organization's history with regard to the management of other \n     grants.\n\n  It goes on and on, page after page, to describe what is in there that \nthey will have to look at.\n  The second way this bill brings about accountability is after the \nfact, if a grantee is awarded a contract. It provides for a process of \nreview, to make a determination whether or not the grantee has met the \nnational performance standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allocated have expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am sorry, but I am just about out.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, earlier I recognized the many \ncontributions made by Senator Gregg to the provisions contained in our \nbill. We were glad to add those provisions. I regret that my colleague \ndoes not find them sufficient. But I must say that his amendment goes \ntoo far, and if adopted it will kill any chance of reauthorizing the \nOlder Americans Act this year. I urge all of the Senators to vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  On its face, this proposal may look reasonable, but it is not.\n  It sets standards that would penalize all grantees and would preclude \nthem providing these valuable services without the opportunity to have \nwhat are book keeping disputes adjudicated.\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\n  Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee to comply with OMB \ncirculars and rules and requires the grantees to maintain records \nsufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that funds have not \nbeen spent unlawfully.\n  The bill institutes and requires performance outcome measures, annual \ngrantee evaluations, grantee accountability and it creates a new grant \ncompetition for those not meeting performance measures.\n  It provides Governors and States greater resources and influence over \njob slot allocations, but also requires broad stakeholder participation \nin a State Senior Employment Services Plan coordinated through \nGovernor's offices.\n  Our bill introduces performance measures and competition into the \nsenior employment program for the first time. The bill would establish \na `three strikes and you're out' policy to ensure performance goals are \nmet.\n  Failure to pass these reforms this year will maintain the status quo. \nIt will only continue a system that does not serve the job placement \nneeds of seniors in many states, and will not correct the deficiencies \nin the administration and planning of the program. The only way these \nimprovements will be realized is to pass the Older Americans Act \nAmendments of 2000, a bipartisan, bicameral initiative.\n  This amendment is not opposed by just the aging organizations like \nAARP. It is also opposed by the Southern Governors Association. \nYesterday, Governor Bush of Florida urged us to pass this bill and send \nit the President for his signature. Governor Huckabee of Arkansas said.\n\n       The Senate must move expeditiously to pass this bill \n     without any amendments.\n\n  I urge all the Senators to vote against the Gregg amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Today, the Senate is about to approve a reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act which keeps faith with the nation's senior citizens. \nThese programs provide vital links between senior citizens and their \ncommunities.\n  For seniors who are healthy and active, the act offers community \nservice employment opportunities, preventive health services, and \ntransportation services. It also supports a range of social activities, \nincluding congregate meals. The act supports more than 6,400 multi-\npurpose senior citizen centers across the country. For those frail \nseniors who lack mobility, it helps to maintain a lifeline to the \noutside world. It provides daily home-delivered meals, in-home care \nservices, home-maker services, and transportation to doctors and other \ncaregivers, and it supports programs to protect vulnerable seniors from \nabuse and exploitation.\n  This legislation reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that older \nAmericans continue to receive the services which are so essential to \ntheir quality of life. This reauthorization should mean increased \nFederal financial support for these very worthwhile programs.\n  As part of this legislation, we have also created a National Family \nCaregiver Support Program to help families who care for ill or disabled \nparents or elderly relatives at home. We know how difficult it can \nbecome for a family when an elderly person needs a high degree of \ncontinuous care. We know the importance of keeping a frail senior at \nhome in a loving environment whenever it is medically possible. This \nnew program will provide essential support services to help these \nseniors remain with their loved ones. These families deserve our \nassistance, and this new program will ensure that they receive it.\n  Family caregivers will be able to obtain a broad range of support \nservices, including respite care, in-home assistance, training in \ncaregiver skills, and family counseling, all of which will make a major \ndifference for these vulnerable seniors and their families. We have \nauthorized $125 million for the first year of this new effort, and we \nanticipate the program will grow in succeeding years. Massachusetts \nfamilies will receive over $3 million dollars to help them care for \ntheir elderly loved ones.\n  The Senior Community Service Employment Program, authorized by title \nV of the act, is the nation's only employment and training program \naimed exclusively at low-income older persons--and it will have an \nincreasingly important role as the Baby Boom generation ages.\n  Title V serves over 90,000 low-income elderly persons every year. The \njobs obtained through this program provide these men and women with \nneeded economic support. But it does much more than that. It keeps them \nactive and involved in their communities, not isolated at home. It \nprovides opportunities to make important contributions to their \ncommunities and to learn new skills--and it enhances their sense of \ndignity and self-esteem. In this legislation, we have significantly \nstrengthened the Community Service Employment Program and provided for \nits much-needed expansion.\n  The legislation already addresses the financial accountability of \ntitle V program operators. It establishes strong new performance \nmeasures which program operators must meet each year, and provides for \nremoval of operators who consistently fail to meet performance \nstandards. It sets strict limits on the purposes for which program \nfunds can be used, and established a 14-point financial responsibility \ntest which every program operator must pass. The Department will have \nample authority to disqualify those program operators whom it deems \neither untrustworthy or unreliable. The procedures we have established \nare tough and fair. The Gregg amendment is not needed.\n  Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act has been co-sponsored by \nover 70 Senators. It is supported by the National Governors' \nAssociation and by more than forty citizens organizations. It was \noverwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives yesterday on a \nvote of 405-2. It is the product of a delicate bipartisan and bicameral \nconsensus. Any change in the bill at this late date would have the \neffect of killing the reauthorization of the OAA for this session. That \nwould be a serious loss for the millions of seniors who depend on this \nprogram, and are counting on us to reauthorize it. Please oppose the \nGregg amendment so that we can finally enact this important bill this \nyear.\n  I think the real test of a civilization is how it honors its elderly \npeople, its senior citizens. I think that is a very fair criterion and \nit is one we ought to be reminded about. After all, these are the men \nand women who fought the wars, brought the country out of the \nDepression, and continued to make sacrifices for their children. We \nhave enacted legislation historically, with Social Security, to try to \nkeep these individuals out of poverty and also a Medicare program to \naddress their needs.\n  This Older Americans Act is of great importance to millions of our \nsenior citizens, to make sure they can live a quality life. It is not a \nprescription drug program. No, it is not, but it does provide vital \nservices: Nutrition programs, preventive health care programs, \ntransportation programs, feeding programs, in-home delivered meals \nprograms. It is something that is really a lifeline for millions of our \nsenior citizens. It is an employment program for many of our elderly \npeople who want to provide services in local communities in nonprofit \norganizations.\n  The amendment before us, the amendment that has been put forward by \nSenator Gregg, brought a matter to the committee that the committee \nconsidered. I just hope our colleagues listen to the excellent \npresentations of the Senators from Ohio and Vermont, that would \nindicate that on these issues, this legislation responds to those \nquestions and does it well.\n  This is an opportunity, with the defeat of the Gregg amendment, to \npass this legislation and be on the road to provide meaningful services \nto our senior citizens. I hope the Gregg amendment will be defeated and \nwe will have an overwhelming vote in support of the legislation.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from New Hampshire has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the good Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate \npassage of the bipartisan Older Americans Act--OAA Amendments of 2000--\nH.R.\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\n782. This bill passed the House yesterday with the overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote of 405-2. The Senate companion bill S. 1536 has 72 \ncosponsors. H.R. 782 is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to \nreauthorize the OAA. It is built on the strong foundation of S. 1536 \nand the bipartisan compromises reached by the HELP Committee in that \nbill. It also has the overwhelming support of the aging community. H.R. \n782 is well worthy of your support.\n  This bill long overdue. It keeps our promise to older Americans to \nretain and strengthen current OAA programs, but is also provides new \ninnovations and accountability to further improve the Act. It will \nensure that the Older Americans Act continues to meet the day-to-day \nneeds of our country's older Americans and the long range needs of our \naging population.\n  The highlight of this bill is the creation of the national Family \nCaregiver Support Program. This program will provide respite care, \ntraining, counseling, support services, information and assistance to \nsome of the millions of Americans who care for older individuals and \nadult children with disabilities. it also will help grandparents who \ncare for grandchildren. This program has strong bipartisan support, \nwill get behind our nation's families, and give help to those who \npractice self-helped.\n  Today our families are the backbone of the long term care system in \nthis country. Currently about 12.8 million adults need assistance from \nothers to carry out activities of daily living, such as bathing and \nfeeding. By 2030 there will be about 21 million people over the age of \n70 needing care. More than half of the elderly that do not currently \nreceive help do not expect to have help in the future.\n  One in four adults currently provides care for an adult with a \nchronic health condition. The economic impact of caregiving is \nstaggering. A recent study found that on average, workers who take care \nof older relatives lose $659,139 in wages, pension benefits, and Social \nSecurity over a lifetime. Further, it is estimated that the national \neconomic value of informal caregiving was $196 billion in 1997.\n  Many of us have personally cared for sick or aging parents or other \nrelatives and understand firsthand the strains and stresses facing \ncaregivers. We know that adult children are most often the providers of \ncare for seniors. This is the sandwich generation with moms and dads \ncaring for their own children and their own parents. They have full-\ntime jobs at the office and then they come home to full time jobs of \ncaring for other family members.\n  My sisters and I cared for my mother when she was ill. We were \nfortunate. We all lived relatively close to my mother and could share \ncaregiving responsibilities. But may families may be scattered across \nthe country and find it more difficult to ensure that older members of \ntheir family are cared for properly. In addition, as our population \nages, many people are living longer. We now see 80-year-old spouses \ncaring for each other. We can see 70-year-old daughter caring for her \n90-year-old mother.\n  The National Family Caregiver Support Program will help caregivers \nacross the country care for their older relatives, grandparents care \nfor grandchildren, and older individuals care for adult children with \ndisabilities. It is a vital new innovation in this bill. It will meet \nthe day-to-day needs of countless families across the country. We must \npass this bill to create this program to help families.\n  When many Americans think of how the Federal Government helps our \ncountry's older Americans, they think of Social Security and Medicare. \nBut what many Americans do not realize is the vital role that the Older \nAmericans Act plays in meeting the day-to-day needs of seniors in this \ncountry. In this bill we maintain core programs in this Act that help \nour seniors.\n  Some of the most well known OAA programs are congregate and home-\ndelivered meals. OAA provides about 240 million meals to over 3 million \nolder persons. About half of these meals are provided in congregate \nsettings and the other half are provided to frail older persons in \ntheir homes. These meal programs are vital to seniors.\n\n  A national evaluation of the nutrition program shows that, compared \nto the total elderly population, nutrition program participants are \nolder and more likely to be poor, to live alone, and to be members of \nminority groups. The report found that the program plays an important \nrole in the participants' overall nutrition and that these meals are \nthe primary source of daily nutrients for these seniors. For every \nFederal dollar spent, the program leverages on average $1.70 for \ncongregate meals, and $3.35 for home-delivered meals. A hot lunch at a \nsenior center could be the only hot meal some seniors get each day.\n  Congregate meals also provide an opportunity for seniors to get out \nof their homes and socialize with other older persons in their \ncommunity. After a meal, seniors may stay on for other activities. A \nmeal can lead to a spirited game of bingo, ping-pong, pool, a dance \nclass, or an exercise class. These kinds of activities keep older \nAmericans more active and engaged which can help them live longer and \nlive better. Home-delivered meals allow the frail elderly to enjoy a \nnutritious hot meal in the comfort of their own home. It can help keep \nseniors in their own home rather than having to live in an institution.\n  We also maintain important protective services for seniors such as \nlegal assistance, the long-term care ombudsman, and elder abuse \nprevention activities. Legal assistance helps seniors with everything \nfrom writing a will to guardianship issues to assistance with housing \nto accessing Social Security benefits.\n  The long-term care ombudsman is the only OAA program that focuses \nsolely on the needs of institutionalized persons. A senior in a nursing \nhome or that senior's family can contact a local long-term care \nombudsman if they are concerned about the quality of care their family \nmember is receiving in a nursing home. The ombudsman is a neutral third \nparty that investigates and helps resolve complaints about quality of \ncare. This is an invaluable resource for seniors to help ensure that \nthey get the best care possible.\n  The Act also provides for elder abuse prevention programs. OAA helps \ncoordinate elder abuse prevention programs and combat crimes against \nseniors. It helps train professionals who serve seniors to help them \nbetter recognize signs of abuse and help seniors who are victims of \nabuse. OAA helps increase public awareness about elder abuse both among \nseniors and in the community at large.\n  We keep innovation and new ideas flowing by maintaining a separate \nand distinct Title IV for Research and Demonstration Projects, which is \nwhere innovative programs like the eldercare locator got started. We \nrecognize the importance of the White House Conference on Aging to the \naging community, and require the President to call such a conference \nbefore the end of 2005. Past White House conferences have brought forth \ninnovative new ideas and created new programs to better serve seniors.\n  We maintain strong support for transportation services, which are \ncritically important to seniors in our rural areas. I know this can be \nespecially important in areas like Western Maryland and the Eastern \nShore where seniors may have to travel further to the grocery store or \na doctor's appointment or to their nearest senior center. And we retain \ncore provisions of the law, like minority targeting language. That \nlanguage ensures that OAA services are directed to those who need them \nthe most. However, we acknowledge that unmet need can exist in rural \nareas, so we have included provisions to help improve the delivery of \nservices to older individuals in rural areas.\n  At the same time, we recognize the need to strengthen certain \nprograms in the Act and increase accountability. We have focused \nefforts on strengthening accountability and improving the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program or title V.\n\n  This program provides part-time community service jobs to low-income \nseniors. It gives them a steady source of income that they need for \nrent, groceries, medical care, and utilities. Most of the seniors \nparticipating in the program are older women whose work histories \ninclude working in the home, domestic work, caring for their children \nand grandchildren, or part-time unskilled employment. Many have not \nfinished high school. Few have pensions, and Social Security or \nsupplemental security income may be the\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nonly source of income for the majority of participants. They count on \ntheir check from this program to pay their bills.\n  Seniors also receive valuable training and skills that enable them to \nget unsubsidized jobs in the public and private sectors. This is \nespecially important in today's right labor market. Increasingly, \nemployers are looking to older workers to fill jobs traditionally not \nheld by older Americans.\n  Title V also gives something back to communities. Seniors in this \nprogram serve meals in senior centers and drive the vans to help \nseniors get to their local senior center for a hot lunch. They work in \nschools and hospitals and day care centers. They make a difference in \ntheir communities and their work does not go unnoticed.\n  We have taken a number of steps to increase accountability. We \nestablish performance measures. If an organization or a state fails to \nmeet these standards and improve its performance, other entities will \nget the opportunity to competitively bid for a portion or all of the \noriginal organization or entity's grant. We establish a minimum amount \nthat must be spent on enrollee wages and fringe benefits. We clarify \nthe way organizations must define and report their costs so that there \nis no room for ambiguity. We codify responsibility tests and new \ncriteria for grantee eligibility. We require a broad and open planning \nprocess so that areas of greatest need within a State are served as \nefficiently as possible.\n  While I believe that overall the current grantees are performing very \nwell, these provisions will help ensure that seniors get the high \nquality services they deserve. They also strengthen the entire SCSEP \nprogram and do not target one particular grantee.\n  This bill strikes a good balance between recognizing the need for \nadditional resources to support OAA programs and protecting the most \nvulnerable seniors and their access to services. It specifically \nauthorizes seniors to make voluntary contributions--donations--for all \nOAA services. The bill also allows states to require cost-sharing for a \nlimited number of services such as transportation, respite care, and \npersonal care. A long list of services is exempt from cost sharing, \nsuch as the meals program, information and assistance, and ombudsman. \nIt also provides guidance to states and protections to help ensure that \nseniors are not discouraged from seeking services because of cost-\nsharing.\n  I also want to note the strong need for increased funding for Older \nAmericans Act programs. Very few OAA programs have seen increased \nfunding in recent years, yet there is a growing need for services. I \nstrongly support full funding of the new National Family Caregiver \nSupport Program, but other OAA programs must also receive needed \nincreases in funding. I strongly urge my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee and in the Senate leadership to do as much as \npossible to increase funding for these valuable programs in the final \ndays of this Congress and in the future. I look forward to working with \nyou to do that.\n  I want to thank Senator DeWine, Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, \nfor his sincere dedication to reauthorizing the OAA and willingness to \nwork in a bipartisan manner to accomplish this. Thank you to Senator \nJeffords for his strong leadership in moving this bill through the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and all the way \nthrough until enactment. Senator Kennedy also deserves credit for this \nbill--he continues to be a tireless advocate for the OAA and the people \nit serves. I want to thank the Senate staff that have worked so hard on \nthis legislation: Sean Donohue, Hollis Turnham, Karla Carpenter, Jeff \nTeitz, Abby Brandel, and Rhonda Richards. I can not think of any better \nway to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the OAA in 2000 than by \nenacting this long-awaited bipartisan reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the bill and defeat \nof the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized 2\\3/4\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I think it has pretty much been said. I \nask my colleagues to defeat the Gregg amendment and to pass the Older \nAmericans Act. This is a bill that needs to pass. It is a bill that is \nsponsored by 73 Members of this body. It is a bill that is supported by \nthe National Governors' Association which urges us to pass the bill. I \nhave a letter from the Southern Governors' Association, signed by all \nthe Southern Governors, including Governor Bush from Texas, as well as \nGovernor Bush from Florida.\n  Governor Bush from Florida has been very instrumental in working with \nus on this bill and is a very strong proponent and advocate of the bill \nbecause he understands what a difference it will make.\n  I reiterate, the concerns my colleague from New Hampshire has raised, \nand I know he will speak in a moment, are valid concerns. We have taken \nthem into consideration. We have incorporated them into this bill. We \ncongratulate him on the work he has done. This bill is a better bill \nbecause of what Judd Gregg has done.\n  We are now, though, at the point where we have incorporated those \nreforms. This is a reform-minded bill. This is a bill that will make a \ndifference. This is a bill that will change the status quo. We are now \nfaced with the prospect of either passing this good bill and sending it \non to the President of the United States or, if we adopt the Gregg \namendment, killing the bill and seeing the status quo remain because \nthat is what will happen.\n  None of the reforms my colleague wants to see take place will take \nplace if we kill this bill. It will not be one of them. We will \ncontinue to muck along. We will continue to move along as we have year \nafter year with the status quo and with no reforms at all. If you are \nfor reforms, you have to vote against the Gregg amendment and then vote \nfor final passage.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4343\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 15 minutes \nremaining. All time controlled by Senator Jeffords has expired. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I appreciate the kind words that have been \nexpressed relative to my efforts on this bill. They are minor compared \nto the efforts of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maryland \nwho have worked very hard.\n  The underlying bill is a strong bill. Remember, we are talking about \na 5-year authorization. We are not talking about 1 day, 2 days, 1 year, \nor 2 years. We are talking about 5 years. We are talking about \ncontinuing the status quo for another 5 years on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  This amendment is about good government. The amendment is: Are you \nfor language which says that a grantee that misuses the funds can be \ndisciplined by the Department of Labor? It is that simple. It is \ngeneric. If the Department of Labor determines that a grantee misuses \nfunds, this gives the Department of Labor the capacity to do something \nabout that.\n  As I talked about earlier today, we have an example of one of the \ngrantees, the National Council of Senior Citizens, which has grossly \nmisused funds, which set up a slush fund of $6 million, which spent \nover $10 million basically to pay for expenses for insurance, which \nwere insurance organizations operated by the same people who ran the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, which has had an audit in the \nyears 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, all of which audits \nhave shown it has misused funds.\n  If we do not adopt this amendment, that organization will continue to \nget $64 million a year, will continue to misuse those funds, and the \nDepartment of Labor will not have the authority to act against that \norganization in anything that is even conceivably a reasonable \ntimeframe. Under this bill, as it is presently structured, the fastest \ntimeframe in which the Department of Labor can act against an \norganization which has acted in the manner in which this organization \nhas acted is 3 years. Even then it is not an issue because there is no \nlanguage for activity for misuse of funds. They would have to raise it \nto a level of\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\ncriminal or fraudulent activity, which is a standard that is very hard \nto prove.\n  It is very obvious that American tax dollars are not being used for \nthe purposes of employing senior citizens, which should be our goal. I \nam asking for some extremely reasonable good government language to be \ninserted into this bill. The only argument I have heard today against \nthis language is essentially that, if this little amendment goes in, \nthis bill dies.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is absurd on its face. We are not \nleaving here very soon. Regrettably, I wish we were leaving here today. \nA lot of us wish we were leaving here today, but we are not. I happen \nto know of three major pieces of legislation which are not going to be \ncompleted today. They probably are not going to be completed tomorrow. \nIt is a fairly safe bet that we are going to be back next week. In \nfact, I can almost guarantee it. I can say that with some authority \nbecause I happen to chair one of the committees which has jurisdiction \nover one of these pieces of legislation, the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. That bill is not going to be completed today, and \nit is probably not going to be completed this week, and probably we \nwill be back next week.\n  The same is true of the Labor-HHS bill, and the same is true of the \ntax bill. We know we are going to be able to take this amendment, send \nit back to the House, have it passed, and come back here and pass the \nwhole bill.\n  If that is the reason this language is being opposed, it is \ninaccurate. This language can be inserted, this bill can be reformed \nand it can be corrected, and the bill can be brought back to us and \npassed.\n  The House of Representatives passed this bill overwhelmingly. This \nlanguage is not debilitating to the bill. It is an attempt to make the \nbill function as it should.\n  What should it do? It should make sure that when we give $350 million \na year to agencies without requiring them to bid on the programs, when \nwe give them an entitlement that says, you get this money; you just \nwalk up to the window and we give it to you, at least those agencies \nshould be required not to misuse the money; that those agencies should \nbe required to spend the money for the purposes of employing senior \ncitizens, not for the purpose of creating a slush fund, not for the \npurpose of financing a Teamsters Union election, not for the purpose of \nfinancing a campaign against a Senator, not for the purpose of creating \nan insurance vehicle which benefits the underlying agency. It should be \nthat those moneys should be used for the senior citizens, to be \nemployed under the bill under title V.\n\n  That is all this language does. It is benign language. Without this \nlanguage, we will essentially continue a process that allows these \nagencies to come to the window, take the money, and run, without \nadequate accountability. Even more importantly, there will be no \ncompetition and no performance standards.\n  So the language is reasonable. It needs to be included in the bill. \nThe timing of this bill is not such that this language is going to kill \nthe bill. The momentum for this bill is immense. There is no way that \nthis bill will not pass with this language in it if this amendment is \nagreed to. The bill will pass. The bill will be conferenced. The bill \nwill be back here. The bill will be voted on before we adjourn as a \nSenate or a Congress. So that debate is inaccurate.\n  So I hope that this language, which is a very reasonable attempt to \naddress what is regrettably a glaring problem in the delivery of these \nservices, will be accepted. I hope people would not vote against \nsomething so simple as a statement that we should allow the Department \nof Labor to discipline people who misuse tax dollars. To vote against \nthat is really to take a position which I think is very hard to defend.\n  We are going to vote on this amendment. I would certainly appreciate \nmy colleagues not being swayed by the argument that a vote for my \namendment will bring the bill down because that argument is a red \nherring, in my opinion, because we are going to be here next week and \nwe can certainly pass this bill next week. It will pass on a voice vote \nonce this amendment is taken. In fact, it will pass by unanimous \nagreement.\n  But, rather, I hope my colleagues will be swayed by the fact that if \nwe fail to include this amendment, we will continue to have the issue \nof whether or not the dollars we are spending to employ seniors, to \nmake their lives better, are, instead, going to be able to be spent to \nbenefit some agency in some way that has no relationship to seniors and \ntheir needs. A good government requires that this type of language be \nput in the bill. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I understand that all time on the other side has been \nused; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Gregg \namendment No. 4343. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I withdraw my pending motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure that the \nSenate has passed the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. This year \nis the 35th anniversary of the Older Americans Program. Since 1965, the \nAct has provided a range of needed social services to our Nation's \nsenior citizens. It is the major vehicle for the organization and \ndelivery of supportive and nutrition services to older persons, and it \nhas grown and changed to meet our citizens' needs. In 1972, we created \nthe national nutrition program; in 1978, we established a separate \ntitle for Native Americans; and in 1987, we authorized programs to \nprevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The Act has been \nreauthorized 12 times, most recently in 1992. Reauthorization \nlegislation was considered in the 104th and 105th Congresses but did \nnot pass due to controversy about a number of proposals. But those \ncontroversies were addressed and the Senate has voted unanimously to \npass this Act and provide our elderly with desperately needed help.\n  The Older Americans Act programs play a vital role in all our \ncommunities. Because of the Older Americans Act, millions of nutritious \nmeals are delivered each year to the generation that served our country \nin World War II. It funds the operations of senior centers and other \nsupportive services to enhance the dignity and independence of the \nNation's elders; and it provides part-time employment opportunities to \ntens of thousands of senior citizens. Indeed, virtually all of our \nNation's elderly are benefitting from the Act. However, more could be \ndone to help our senior citizens and their families. This is why we are \nhere to pass the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000.\n  I want to commend all of the members of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions for their work and contributions in this \neffort. Senator DeWine and Senator Mikulski led the way on this \nreauthorization effort early in this Congress. Beginning on March 3, \n1999, the Subcommittee on Aging held a series of hearings, receiving \ntestimony from over 30 witnesses. The first hearing presented \nSubcommittee members with an overview of the various Older Americans \nAct programs. Subsequent Subcommittee hearings covered other important \nissues, including elder abuse, supportive services, State and local \nviews, longevity in the workplace, and long-term family caregiver \nprograms. In March, 1999, we were very fortunate to hear testimony from \nMs. Reeve Lindbergh of St. Johnsbury, Vermont. She spoke to our \nCommittee about the unacceptable problem of elder abuse which confronts \nsome of our most fragile elders. Then, in April, we heard from another \nVermonter, Mr. John Barbour, who serves as the Director of the \nChamplain Valley Agency on Aging, in Winooski, Vermont. He alerted the \nCommittee to changes needed in the nutritional programs outlined in \nTitle III of the Act.\n  This bill improves the Older Americans Act in several key areas. For \nexample, Title I sets out broad policy objectives related to income, \nhealth, housing, long-term care, employment, retirement, and community \nservices that will improve the lives of all older Americans. \nModifications under this title establish a Federal definition of ``in-\nhome services'' and give both State units and area agencies on aging \nthe ability to include locally significant in-home services in their \nservice definition.\n  Title II identifies the Administration on Aging as the chief Federal \nagency advocate for older persons and also establishes the Eldercare \nLocator Service and Pension Rights and Counseling as ongoing programs.\n  Significant modifications have been made to Title III, grants for \nState and community programs. One of the most important aspects of this \nAct is the establishment of the Grassley-Breaux National Family \nCaregiver Support Program. According to the 1994 National Long Term \nCare Survey, there are more than 7 million informal caregivers--\nincluding spouses, adult children, other relatives, and friends who \nprovide day-to-day care for most of our Nation's elders. The National \nFamily Caregiver Program authorizes $125 million in Federal assistance \nto help families care for their elderly by providing a multifaceted \nsystem of supportive services, including information, assistance, \ncounseling, and respite services. Moreover, it will help older \nindividuals who are caring for relative children, such as their \ngrandchildren. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1997, \nalmost 4 million children were living in homes maintained by their \ngrandparents. This program will also extend to older folks who are \ncaring for their adult children with mental retardation and \ndevelopmental disabilities.\n  Other changes to this title clarify the role of area agencies on \naging with respect to case management, information and referral \nservices, and also strengthen their obligations to coordinate volunteer \nprograms and efforts with other community organizations providing \nsimilar services. In addition, the interstate formula allotments are \nupdated, with appropriations being tied to minimum-growth hold harmless \namounts, so that no State receives less than it did in FY 2000.\n  Title V authorizes community service employment for older Americans \nto provide part-time community service jobs for unemployed, low-income \npersons 55 years old and over. There will be 1.4 million more low-\nincome persons over the age of 55 in the year 2005 than there were a \ndecade earlier, and many of them will continue working. Employment \nobtained through this program provides these workers with needed \neconomic support. It keeps them active and involved in their \ncommunities, and it provides them with the opportunity to make \nimportant contributions to their communities, learn new skills, and \nenhance their sense of dignity and self-esteem.\n  The changes made in Title V by this bill are a critical part of this \nlegislation, because they strengthen and modernize the Senior \nEmployment Program. To begin, the purpose statement is amended to \nstress economic self-sufficiency and to increase the number of \nplacements in public- and private-sector unsubsidized employment. The \nemployment program is integrated with the Workforce Investment Act, \nincluding one-stop delivery systems and participant assessments and \nservices, while the program itself and the administrative costs are \ncodified. Also, under this title, the State Senior Employment Services \nPlan is established which provides Governors with greater \n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\ninfluence and responsibility concerning the allocation of job slots. \nThe newly established State Plan ensures for the first time a planning \nprocess with broad participation by representatives from State and area \nagencies on aging; State and local workforce investment boards; public \nand private non-profit providers of employment services; businesses and \nlabor organizations; and other aging network stakeholders.\n\n  The remaining sections have also been modified. Title IV, training, \nresearch, and discretionary projects and programs, authorizes the \nAssistant Secretary for Aging to award funds for training, research, \nand demonstration projects in the field of aging. This Act consolidates \nthe demonstration programs from 18 to 10 categories, including sections \non violence against older Americans, rural health, computer training, \nand transportation. Title VI, grants to Native Americans, authorizes \nfunds for social and nutrition services to older Indians and Native \nHawaiians. The modifications by this Act authorize the Family Caregiver \nSupport Program for tribal organizations. Then, a provision is added \nunder Title VII, vulnerable elder rights protection activities, which \nauthorizes funds for activities that protect the rights of the \nvulnerable elderly. The new provision requires that ombudsman programs \ncoordinate with ``law enforcement'' agencies.\n  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many other \nindividuals and organizations that have contributed to this effort. In \naddition to leadership Senator DeWine and Senator Mikulski, Senator \nKennedy contributed his long experience to this effort. He helped us \nfind the middle ground and solutions to many thorny issues. Senator \nGregg was instrumental in focusing the Committee's attention on the \nmuch-needed reforms in the employment services program, and the program \nis much strengthened by his work. Senator Hutchinson was especially \nactive on these efforts to address the employment and services needs of \nthe rural elderly.\n  Among the groups in the network of aging organizations, special \nrecognition must go to the National Council of Older Americans and the \nNational Association of State Units on Aging for their insight in \nproposing a compromise to the employment services program. AARP, with \nthe leadership of Horace Deets, undertook the difficult task of seeking \nconsensus among the many aging organizations. Green Thumb tirelessly \neducated members of Congress about the importance of these aging \npopulations, especially those members representing rural \nconstituencies. The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, \ncurrently being chaired by the Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, provided a continuous forum for many issues to be \naddressed. Others contributing to this effort include the National \nCaucus on Black Aging, the National Association of Area Agencies on \nAging, and Meals on Wheels. Finally, the Administration on Aging, \nheaded by Jeanette Takamura, provided ongoing leadership and continuous \nexpert support in strengthening these programs.\n  Many of our staff deserve considerable recognition for their \ndedicated work. Daphne Edwards in the Office of the Legislative Counsel \nworked tirelessly on countless drafts of this legislation. Carol \nO'Shaughnessy of the Congressional Research Service lent her counsel, \nas well as her years of experience with aging programs, to this bill. \nAbby Brandel and Rhonda Richards of Senator Mikulski's office, and \nJeffrey Teitz of Senator Kennedy's staff, worked diligently to reach \naccords on many of these difficult issues. Alan Gilbert with Senator \nGregg provided invaluable guidance on the employment services program. \nKate Hull, of Senator Hutchinson's staff, also dedicated many hours of \neffort to the final product. Recognition is deserved especially by \nKarla Carpenter, the staff director of the Aging Subcommittee, who with \nSenator DeWine developed the framework for this modernization bill and \nwho stuck with the effort to see it finished. Finally, on my own staff, \nI want to acknowledge and commend the efforts of Hollis Turnham and \nSean Donohue. Hollis came to my office as the Senator John Heinz Fellow \non Aging, and her extensive experience with these programs was \ninvaluable to the completion of the bill. Hollis brought with her years \nof experience in serving our Nation's elders and a full knowledge of \njust how the Older Americans Act affects our older Americans. After \nseveral years of trying, this effort to reauthorize the Older Americans \nAct could have gone astray at countless points over these past two \nyears. Therefore, much credit must go to Sean Donohue, whose focus, \nexperience, and sheer tenacity guided this successful effort.\n  In summary, our bill goes a long way to improving supportive, \nemployment, and nutritional services for the elderly. This legislation \nupdates the Older Americans Act, making it more relevant and useful to \nour country's senior citizens. All of these individuals have worked \nhard to develop innovative strategies to strengthen and modernize the \nOlder Americans Act, and I know that through these efforts our Nation's \nelders will be better served by this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act which just received the Senate's unanimous approval is \nthe product of a two-year bipartisan effort. Earlier today, I said \nSenators Jeffords, DeWine, Mikulski, and I share a common commitment to \npreserving and strengthening these programs, which have done so much to \nimprove the lives of millions of senior citizens. I commend my three \ncolleagues for their tremendous leadership in fashioning this \nlegislation.\n  Now, I would like to recognize the members of our staffs who did the \nwork that made this bill possible: Rhonda Richards and Abby Brandel \nfrom Senator Mikulski's office, Karla Carpenter from Senator DeWine's \noffice, Sean Donohue, Hollis Turnham and Mark Powden from Senator \nJefford's office, and Jeffrey Teitz, Michael Myers, and Jerry Wesevich \nfrom my office. We assigned them an extremely difficult task. Efforts \nto reauthorize the Older Americans Act had failed in the last two \nCongresses. This year, at each point when the differences appeared too \nwide, these individuals found a creative way to bridge the divide. They \nmanaged to build the consensus which has enabled this legislation to \npass both the House and Senate so overwhelmingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11097-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11097-S11098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ENACTMENT OF CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESS, HEALTH, TAX, AND MINIMUM WAGE \n            PROVISIONS--CONFERENCE REPORT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to read some headlines from \nnewspapers across the United States commenting on our work:\n\n       ``Congress' Pork Roast'' The News and Observer (Raleigh, \n     NC)\n       ``Imaginary Numbers Game: Congress Pork-Barrel Is Eroding \n     The Surplus'' The Record (Bergen County, NJ)\n       ``Congress Rolls Out The Pork-Barrel Election, Surplus \n     Bring Free Spending'' The Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville)\n       ``Costly Delay: Politics Prompts Capitol Hill Feeding \n     Frenzy'' Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, MA)\n       ``Bellying Up To A Pork Barrel'' The Christian Science \n     Monitor\n       ``Dollars Flying In Congress' Flurry Of Final Spending'' \n     USA Today\n       ``Congress Has Last-Minute Pork Feast'' Chattanooga Times\n       ``Spending Bill Fat With Pork: Both Parties Engaged In \n     Budget-Busting Spree'' The Houston Chronicle\n\n  I am saddened by these headlines because of the damage such words do \nto the reputation of our governmental institutions. But I am also \nangered by them.\n  Why? Because we are deliberately, of our own free will, spending the \nsurplus and jeopardizing future prosperity.\n  With this year-end spending blitz, Congress and the President have \nblown away the last remaining vestiges of fiscal discipline that, for a \nbrief, very brief moment in time, had put the brakes on the spending \nfrenzies that all too often engulfed our Capitol and contributed to our \nhuge national debt, which stands today at $5.7 trillion.\n  Tens of billions in pork barrel and special interest spending have \nbeen packed into these appropriations bills, as well as numerous \nprovisions pushed by Capitol Hill lobbyists that the American public \nwill not know about until after these bills become law. In fact, Dan \nMorgan of the Washington Post aptly characterized this well-\ncoordinated, last minute lobbying offensive as ``high noon at Gucci \nGulch.''\n  I regard such a spectacle as demeaning to our Government.\n  U.S. News & World Report, October 23, 2000:\n\n       Nearly two weeks past its promised departure date, Congress \n     remains in Washington, locked in a standoff with the White \n     House and mired in its own disarray over the Federal budget. \n     And as the dealing crackles up and down Pennsylvania Avenue \n     and across the Capitol Rotunda, the shenanigans are going to \n     cost a staggering amount of money. By some estimates, if the \n     spending increases continue at the current pace--nearly twice \n     the rate of inflation--the non-Social Security surplus could \n     be eliminated in less than 5 years.\n     \n                                *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\n\n       Feast day. The $650 billion figure must be stacked against \n     the famed 1997 balanced budget deal. Under that agreement, \n     the government was supposed to spend $541 billion in \n     discretionary dollars this year. They should miss the mark by \n     a mere $100 billion or so. The Republicans will outspend \n     their own budget resolution passed this spring by about $50 \n     billion. Election-year politics, an irrepressible instinct \n     for pork, and a unique moment of plenty have combined to \n     create a kind of fiscal third-base coach waving everybody \n     home to score whatever spending project his heart desires\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The spending comes in big chunks and small. In Alaska, \n     thanks to Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens, \n     taxpayers will spend $176,000 to help the Reindeer Herders \n     Association. Stevens set aside a total of $43 million for \n     other Alaska transportation projects. Alabamians may be \n     forever grateful for the $1.5 million set aside to help \n     restore the venerable Vulcan statue in Birmingham, a 56-foot, \n     iron rendition of the Roman god of fire and metalwork. Built \n     as an entry for the 1904 World's Fair, it won the grand prize \n     in the Palace of Metallurgy. Stewart Dansby, executive \n     director of the Vulcan Park Foundation, says officials at the \n     organization talked to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby about \n     helping to fund the renovation. ``Why are federal tax dollars \n     being spent on a statue in Birmingham?'' asks Dansby. \n     ``Because Vulcan is symbolic of American industrial strength. \n     He represents the working person and . . . . These are \n     federal dollars that would have gone somewhere.''\n       There is ample evidence of that. The huge surpluses \n     projected over the next decade--$268 billion next year--may \n     have forever changed politics in Washington. The result is a \n     kind of giddiness. ``The surplus is burning a hole in our \n     pocket. It is affecting our judgment,'' says Republican Sen. \n     Phil Gramm of Texas\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Senators from both sides of the aisle have been treating \n     themselves to hundreds of spending programs of peculiar, and \n     perhaps dubious, value. Examples:\n       Harry Reid has secured more than $14 million for five \n     projects in Nevada, including $2 million to enable airline \n     passengers to get boarding passes at their hotels.\n  Who I see here.\n\n       Tom Harkin added more than $7 million to next year's \n     Agriculture bill to fund ``integrated cow resources \n     management and agriculture-based industrial lubricants \n     research.''\n\n  Perhaps Senator Harkin can enlighten us on that.\n\n       Robert Byrd has earmarked $5.25 million for a new dorm at \n     the National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, a \n     facility run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), the appropriator in chief, scored \n     $400,000 for a parking lot in Talkeetna--a slice of the $43 \n     million in special projects he pulled out of the \n     Transportation bill.\n       Pete Domenici a nominal budget hawk, claims that the \n     $200,000 he got for a railroad museum in Las Cruces ``could \n     improve transportation for the entire nation.''\n       Richard Shelby opposed Federal involvement in peanut \n     allergy research in 1998, but he has secured $500,000 for the \n     same in fiscal year 2001.\n\n  Mr. President, I have included the top 10 list on several occasions. \nOne of my favorites was insect rearing, bug raising for fun and profit. \nThere are many others that my colleagues may be entertained by, but \nalso American taxpayers may be somewhat disturbed by.\n  The Washington Post, Eric Pianan, October 25:\n\n       Rules created more than two decades ago to impose fiscal \n     restraint on Congress have broken down, helping fuel a year-\n     end spending spree that is resulting in billions of extra \n     dollars for highways and bridges, water projects, emergency \n     farm aid, school construction and scores of other projects.\n       Many budget hawks have derided the binge as a typical \n     election year ``porkfest.'' But key lawmakers and experts on \n     federal budgeting say another less visible problem is that \n     the law aimed at reining in such spending has been \n     effectively gutted by the congressional leadership.\n       In particular, lawmakers are increasingly ignoring the \n     annual congressional budget resolution, the document that is \n     supposed to guide spending and tax decisions in the House and \n     Senate every year. In years past, lawmakers might miss their \n     budget targets by a few billion dollars, but now they are \n     busting the budget by as much as $50 billion this year.\n       This year's budget resolution, for instance, called for \n     about $600 billion in spending this fiscal year on defense, \n     health, education, and other non-entitlement programs. When \n     Congress and the White House finally complete their \n     negotiations . . . the total will be $640 billion or more. . \n     . .\n       The decision to ignore the budget resolution is only one \n     sign of a general breakdown of fiscal discipline on Capitol \n     Hill, according to fiscal experts. Congress and the Clinton \n     administration are also ignoring spending caps, both agreed \n     to as a part of the 1997 legislation to balance the federal \n     budget.\n       Congress's enthusiasm for real budget constraints began to \n     wane almost as soon as deficits gave way to surpluses \n     beginning three years ago. Until then, the specter of \n     towering annual deficits of as much as $290 billion had \n     fostered a series of hard-nosed policies, including a 1990 \n     budget deal that for the first time imposed caps on \n     spending and required Congress to offset tax cuts by \n     reducing spending or raising other revenues.\n       The emergence of surpluses has left it to lawmakers to \n     produce budget plans that would impose spending discipline \n     with an eye to the time when Medicare and Social Security \n     will begin to run short of money. But that has not happened.\n\n  All of this maneuvering and horse trading predictably has been \nconducted behind closed doors, away from the public eye, bypassing a \nprocess whereby all of my elected colleagues should evaluate the merit \nof each budget item.\n  The big winner in this budget ritual is not the American people but \nbigger Government and bigger bank accounts for special interests.\n  As Ronald Reagan was fond of saying, ``Facts are stubborn things,'' \nand the facts swirling around the fiscal year 2001 budget are \ndisheartening to anyone who believes in smaller Government, fiscal \nrestraint, and the responsibility of elected officials to do everything \npossible to ensure prosperity for our children and grandchildren.\n  A few months ago, Republicans outlined our spending plan, calling for \nabout $600 billion in so-called discretionary spending. That is \nspending on programs other than Social Security, Medicare, and interest \non our $5.7 trillion debt. The President's budget requested about $623 \nbillion in discretionary spending.\n  But the unsavory mix of Members adding billions upon billions more in \nspecial interest spending, in what the Associated Press described as a \n``bipartisan spending bazaar,'' combined with a President determined to \nsqueeze as many taxpayer dollars as possible as the price for letting \neveryone go home, led to a ``compromise'' only Washington could love. \nIn the end, bidding up the final spending tally in the range of $640 \nbillion to $650 billion, give or take a few billion, but this explosion \nof spending does not seem to bother the White House. Just last week, I \nwas amused to read the words of the President's Chief of Staff, who \nsaid in a speech that at the end of this budget process, ``We will have \na budget that is fiscally responsible.''\n  It is a mind-boggling comment, at odds with the facts.\n  For the fiscal year 2001, we have already spent at least $30 billion \npast the discretionary spending limits set by the budget resolution for \nthis year. When all is said and done and all the bills have been \nproperly reviewed, we could very well spend up to $50 billion more. \nWhat is going on here?\n  The Congress has not always acted this way. As a matter of fact, in \n1997 and 1998, when we still had deficits, we spent less money than the \nactual budget caps. Since the era of surpluses began in 1999, the \nCongress and the President have taken this to mean they now have a \nlicense to spend freely without any adherence to limits. In fact, a \nrecent Cato Institute study of congressional budget habits found that \nfrom fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2000, domestic spending grew by \nmore than 14 percent in real terms.\n  Our continuing irresponsibility is threatening to consume a \nsubstantial portion of the projected on-budget surpluses before they \nare realized. Do any of my colleagues genuinely believe we will \nactually spend less next year?\n  According to a CBO report released this month, even if we are to save \nall of today's projected surpluses, we still face the possibility of an \nuncertain long-term fiscal future as the aging of our population and, \nthanks to the wonders of modern medicine, the lengthening of our \nlifespans lead to surging entitlements costs.\n\n  The CBO projected the three main entitlements programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--will rise from roughly 7.5 percent of \ngross domestic product today to 17 percent by the year 2040, absent \nstructural reforms. One line in particular in the report should grab \nthe attention of my colleagues. It reads:\n\n       Projections of future economic growth and fiscal imbalances \n     are quite sensitive to assumptions about what policymakers \n     will do with the budget surplus that are projected to arise \n     over the next decade.\n\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n\n\n  Remember, today's official budget surplus projections assume \ndiscretionary spending will grow for the next 10 years at the rate of \ninflation, which makes the conclusion of a recent Concord Coalition \nreport even more alarming. The report warns ``that if discretionary \nspending continues to grow at the same rate it has in recent years, \ntwo-thirds of the projected 10-year non-Social Security surplus would \ndisappear.'' That will translate into a reduction of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus by $1.4 trillion.\n  While the White House was the chief engineer pushing the spending \nbonanza, my party, yet again, let pass a golden opportunity to showcase \nour fiscal discipline and resolute devotion to debt reduction. We could \nhave supported spending bills with no hard-earned taxpayers' money \nspent at the behest of individual lawmakers without authorization and \nadequate congressional review, but we did not.\n  As we are close to the end of this Congress, we must look to the next \nCongress, indeed the next President, to address many of the pressing \nproblems that plague our Nation. The real question that faces us is \nwhether we will end the Washington partisan gridlock and achieve \nresults for the American people on a range of critical issues, such as \nprescription drugs, HMO reform, Social Security reform, and military \nreform.\n  I strongly submit that to break the gridlock that cripples \nWashington, we must break the stranglehold of the special interests on \nour political process.\n  For example, we have been trying for nearly 2 years to get a decent \nhealth care bill of rights passed into law. The purpose of the \nlegislation is to provide every American who is caught in a squeeze \nplay between employers' HMOs and their doctors with some basic rights \ndesigned to ensure they get the quality health care they have paid for \nand deserve. Yet the trial lawyers and the health care industry lobbies \nhave succeeded in derailing any hope of reaching a meaningful \ncompromise. So Americans, average Americans, will go on suffering at \nthe hands of health care bureaucracy decisions often guided more by the \nbottom line than the best interests of the patients.\n  We must have courage to say no to the special interests who pay the \nsoft money fee to gain access to the high political councils while the \naverage taxpayer is left out in the cold. It will not be easy breaking \nour addiction to soft money.\n  Roll Call newspaper reports that in a recent survey of 300 senior \ncorporate executives conducted by the Tarrance Group:\n\n       Nearly three-quarters said pressure is placed on business \n     leaders to make large political donations, and half of the \n     executives said their colleagues ``fear adverse consequences \n     for themselves or their industry if they turn down requests'' \n     for contributions.\n\n  And 79 percent said the campaign finance system is ``broken and \nshould be reformed.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I will make the rest of my remarks \nbrief.\n  Such pressure for campaign contributions seems to be paying \ndividends. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 1992, \nsoft money accounted for 18 percent of the political parties' overall \nfundraising. Today, that figure has more than doubled to ``40 percent \nof everything the parties raise.''\n  We are going in the wrong direction, and it is undermining our \ndemocracy. That is why I pledge to bring campaign finance reform to the \nSenate floor when the Senate convenes next year.\n  Let me be clear; no matter which party prevails in November, our \ndemocracy will be the loser unless we clean up our political process. \nWithout real change in how we conduct our politics, cynicism will \nprevail and continue to eat away at our public square, fueling even \nlower voter turnout and turning more and more Americans away from \npublic service.\n  Mr. President, this is too high a price to pay. That is why I am \ncommitted to clean up the budget process and the way we fund campaigns. \nPlease join me in this process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11100-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11100-S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LOW-POWER FM RADIO SERVICE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a great example of the influence \nof special interests, which I am told has been inserted into the \nCommerce-State-Justice, the Judiciary, and related agencies \nappropriations conference report, without a debate on this floor, \nwithout a vote on this floor.\n  Mr. President, I understand that legislation restricting low-power FM \nservices has been added behind closed doors to that appropriations \nbill. The addition of this rider illustrates, once again, how the \nspecial interests of a few are allowed to dominate the voices of the \nmany in the backdoor dealings of the appropriations process.\n\n  Low-power FM radio service provides community-based organizations, \nchurches, and other nonprofit groups with a new, affordable opportunity \nto reach out to the public, helping to promote a greater awareness \nwithin our communities, about our communities. As such, low-power FM is \nsupported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of \nCities, Consumers' Union and many religious organizations, including \nbut not limited to, the U.S. Catholic Conference and the United Church \nof Christ. These institutions support low-power FM because they see \nwhat low-power FM's opponents also know to be true--that these stations \nwill make more programming available to the public, and provide outlets \nfor news and perspectives not currently featured on local radio \nstations.\n  But, the special interests forces opposed to low-power FM--most \nnotably the National Association of Broadcasters and National Public \nRadio have mounted a vigorous behind-the-scenes campaign against this \nservice.\n  Let me repeat--and my dear friend from Nebraska joined me in this \neffort. Together, we tried to stop the National Association of \nBroadcasters and National Public Radio. Simply put, they have won \nagain.\n  I believe the Senator from Nebraska will agree with me there is no \nway they could have carried that vote on the floor of this Senate. \nThere is no way they could have deprived all of these communities, all \nof these small business people, all of these religious organizations, \nall of these minority groups--but they stuck it into an appropriations \nbill, a piece of legislation that never had a single bit of debate and \nwould never have passed through the Commerce Committee, of which I am \nthe chairman, if it had been put to a vote.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Kerry and I introduced the Low Power FM \nRadio Act of 2000, which would have struck a fair balance between \nallowing low-power radio stations to go forward while at the same time \nprotecting existing full-power stations from actual interference. Under \nour bill, low-power stations causing interference would be required to \nstop causing interference--or be shut down--but noninterfering low-\npower FM stations would be allowed to operate without further delay. \nThe opponents of low-power FM did not support this bill because they \nwant low-power FM to be dead rather than functional.\n  Congress should not permit the appropriations process to circumvent \nthe normal legislative process.\n  Mr. President, low-power FM is an opportunity for minorities, \nchurches and others to have a new voice in radio broadcasting. In the \nCommerce Committee, we constantly lament the fact that minorities, \ncommunity-based organizations, and religious organizations do not have \nadequate opportunities to communicate their views. Moreover, over the \nyears, I have often heard many Members of both the Committee and this \nSenate lament the enormous consolidation that has occurred in the \ntelecommunications sector as a whole and the radio industry \nspecifically. Here, we had a chance to simply get out of the way, and \nallow noninterfering low-power radio stations to go forward to help \ncombat these concerns. Instead, we allowed special interests to hide \ntheir competitive fears behind the smokescreen of hypothetical \ninterference to severely wound--if not kill--this service in the dead \nof night.\n  Mr. President, speaking for my side of the aisle, we are the party of \nAbraham Lincoln. We constantly endorse the importance of religious \nspeech to American culture. How can we possibly stifle an opportunity \nfor minority and religious organizations to communicate more \neffectively with their local communities? By permitting special \ninterests to stifle these voices we are\n\n[[Page S11101]]\n\ntruly compromising the most fundamental principles of our party and our \nNation.\n  I stand before these community-based organizations, these religious \norganizations, these people throughout these small communities all over \nAmerica and say: I apologize. I apologize to you for this action--\nbehind closed doors--that we are going to deprive you of a voice, of a \nvery small FM radio station. And I will tell you who did it. The \nNational Public Radio and the National Association of Broadcasters--the \nsame organization that got $70 billion worth of free spectrum of public \ntaxpayer-owned property. And, by the way, they are not giving back \ntheir analog spectrum, which is the subject for another speech. I say \nto the National Association of Broadcasters and the National Public \nRadio, shame on you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for up to \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened somewhat tentatively to the \ncomments made by my friend from Arizona. He talked about ending the \npartisan gridlock. If you want to end the partisan gridlock, take a \nlook at the tax bill that just came over. This package was never \nconsidered in the Finance Committee, never considered on the Senate \nfloor. No Democrats were ever invited to any of the meetings to work it \nout. There was no consultation with any Democrat. No paper was ever \nshared with any Democrat in putting it together. It was stuffed into an \nunrelated conference report. It was sent over here for a vote. And the \nRepublicans have said to the Democrats: Take it or leave it, but you \nhave no part in drafting it, debating it, or anything else.\n  I would say, if you want to end the partisan gridlock, Republicans \nshould start working in a bipartisan fashion around here to fashion.\n  I hear George Bush out there. He is saying he wants to come to \nWashington and end this gridlock. I say to Governor Bush: Pick up the \nphone and call Senator Lott. Pick up the phone and call Speaker \nHastert. Tell them to quit playing these kinds of games, these partisan \ngames around here, where we get a tax bill on the Senate floor, in the \nclosing days of this year, that we have had absolutely no part in--\nabsolutely none whatsoever.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would just like to ask the Senator a question. If the \nSenator wouldn't mind yielding, I think we can do this almost as a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I would be glad to.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from Iowa has been around here a couple years \nlonger than I have. I wonder if the Senator would agree with me. My \nexperience is that all 100 people in this Senate--every single one of \nthem--are trying to do the best job they can. They have different \npoints of views. The Republicans bring certain things to the arguments \nsometimes that Democrats don't bring, and Democrats bring things that \nRepublicans don't bring from time to time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. True.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator would agree with that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true. That is the way the legislative process \nworks. I am not always right. You are not always right. Republicans are \nnot always right. But if we work together in that kind of a spirit, it \ncan be worked out. That is the way it should be done.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator from Iowa would yield for a \nsecond question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. KERREY. I heard the Governor of Texas say he does not like the \nVice President's tax cut proposal because it is targeted. Doesn't it \nseem that the tax cut proposal that is being brought to us--though it \nmight be hard for my friends on the other side of the aisle to state \nthat they are saying the Vice President is right--is not an across-the-\nboard tax cut, this is a targeted tax cut? Will my friend from Iowa \nagree they seem to be saying we should have a targeted tax cut?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree on targeted tax cuts, but I would appreciate the \nSenator expanding on his point.\n  Mr. KERREY. Well, their bill does not have across-the-board tax cuts. \nThere has been a debate going on between the Vice President and the \nGovernor of Texas as to whether or not there should be an across-the-\nboard tax cut of $1.6 trillion that the Governor of Texas wants to do, \non top of $1.1 trillion of payroll tax cuts, and hundreds of billions \nof dollars of spending as well.\n  I said the other day, it reminds me of voodoo economics II. I do not \nthink he would be proposing this, which is essentially the failed \npolicies of the past. We tried that once before. President Bush, in \n1990, broke from the failed policies of that.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona earlier talk about the budget caps \nthat were in the 1990 budget agreement. That started us on the road of \neliminating our deficits. But he has an across-the-board tax cut. He is \ncriticizing the Vice President for targeting tax cuts, and it seems our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are saying the Vice President is \nright, we should have a targeted tax cut.\n  I wonder if my friend from Iowa has also experienced, when you are \nhaving discussions, there are some things Democrats bring to the \nargument, bring to the discussion. I wonder, as I look at this tax \nbill, if any of the people, the Republicans who are part of this thing, \never asked the question: Now that we are going to target tax cuts, is \nit fair? Are we being fair here? Are we targeting it to the right group \nof people?\n  It seems to me, as I look at least at the early analysis, that that \nquestion couldn't have been asked.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator enlighten us a little further?\n  Mr. KERREY. I don't know. I am certain we will have a chance to look \nat the precise numbers that CBO and others have done. As I look at the \nnumbers right now, it seems our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nhaving put this together without Democrats there --if the American \npeople wonder what they lost by not having Democrats there, it doesn't \nlook as if anybody was there to say: Is this fair?\n  What they have said is, we are going to target $4 billion a year of \ntax cuts to Americans who make more than $319,000 a year. A lot of my \nfriends make more than $319,000 a year, but $4 billion total out of \nwhat appears to be about $6 or $7 billion a year seems to be a pretty \nbig targeted tax cut for people over $300,000 a year. For Members of \nCongress on up, we are a little over $130,000. It is $670 million of \ntargeted tax cuts to that group. But for the group of Americans under \n$40,000 a year, they get about $50 or $60 million total.\n  I don't know. I guess many of my colleagues felt the same sort of \nmovement of their hearts when they read the stories of the sailors who \nlost their lives on the U.S.S. Cole. We had a chance to read the \nbiographies. It was a very moving thing to think about their lives. I \nnoted that not a single one of those individuals were college \ngraduates. They were all high school graduates. They were all enlisted, \nsave one who was an ensign, just became an ensign after 12 years of \nenlistment. If you read their stories, their moms and dads are waiters; \ntheir moms and dads are nurses; their moms and dads are schoolteachers; \ntheir moms and dads are making less than $40,000 a year. That is a \nmajority of the country. Those are the folks who are running our Little \nLeague baseball groups. Those are the people who are volunteering at \nchurch.\n  If you decide the Vice President is right--we should not have an \nacross-the-board tax cut; we ought to have a targeted tax cut--it seems \nto me that we ought to be trying to target it to those folks who are \nhaving trouble sending their kids to college, having trouble paying \nhealth care, having trouble doing all sorts of other things as well. It \nseems to me what was missing as they put this thing together was some \nDemocrat raising their hand and saying: Is this fair?\n  I wonder if the Senator from Iowa would agree with that sort of quick \nanalysis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator from Nebraska bringing that out \nbecause obviously this is a targeted tax cut. As the Senator just said, \nthey have targeted it to the wrong people: not the kind of people and \nthe families whose sons and daughters lost their lives in the Persian \nGulf recently, not those, but to those with the highest incomes.\n  I know the Senator had the aggregate figures, but he mentioned the \nfact\n\n[[Page S11102]]\n\nthat most of these families make less than $40,000 a year. Under the \nRepublicans' targeted tax cut, if you are a family making $24,000 to \n$39,300 a year, if you are in that group where average Americans are, \nyou get $94 a year in a tax cut. If, however, you are making more than \n$319,000 a year, on average, you get 4,158 bucks a year in a tax cut \nfrom their targeted tax cut.\n  So the Senator is right. They have targeted it to those who make more \nthan $319,000 a year. And the Senator is right, you have to ask the \nquestion: What is fair about this?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am very sympathetic to the large amount of taxes that \nhigher income Americans are paying. They have been contributing a \nsubstantial amount to deficit reduction since President Bush signed \ninto law an increase in their taxes in 1990 and President Clinton \nessentially continued that in 1993. And the Republican Congress, to \ntheir eternal credit, continued it in 1997. We have been generating a \nlot, and I am grateful for the income. Indeed, I understand why a group \nof men and women putting together this tax bill would be more \nsympathetic to people making over $130,000 a year. That is most of us. \nIn fact, indeed, it is all of us. We tend to hang out with people who \nmake more than $130,000 a year, and we complain about our taxes, too. I \nunderstand why we are sympathetic.\n  It seems to me what was missing in all of this, what I find to be \nvery difficult to support, now that we have decided the Vice President \nis correct; we should have a targeted tax cut rather than across the \nboard, I don't think it passes the fairness test. As a consequence, the \nAmerican people are going to end up, if this becomes law--and the \nPresident has indicated he is going to veto it, thank goodness, because \nif it did become law, they would end up having a very difficult time \nsaying, well, yes, it cut taxes in a targeted way, as the Vice \nPresident is suggesting, but it doesn't seem to be a fair proposal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. It does not pass the fairness test \nat all. I might ask the Senator one other question. We know that there \nare a lot of people in this country who lack health insurance. As I \nunderstand it, in this tax bill, there is a provision that is supposed \nto expand coverage. But the way it is drafted, $18,000 in tax benefits \nare provided for each estimated person who will gain health insurance \ncoverage. I ask the Senator, does this sound like fiscal conservatism?\n  Mr. KERREY. It seems nobody was in the room to say: Hey, that doesn't \nseem to be fair. If you look at the average household--Nebraska and \nIowa are pretty close to being the same --the average household in \nNebraska pays more payroll taxes than they pay income taxes. Income \ncredits very often don't affect them at all. One of the great paradoxes \nof allowing people to deduct health insurance is the higher your \nincome, the more subsidy you get. We have an awful lot of people in \nNebraska who don't have health insurance as a consequence of where they \nwork. And when they go out and try to buy this health insurance, they \ndon't get as much subsidy as somebody who has a higher income. As a \nconsequence, they are not buying it. As a consequence, we now know it \nis fact that you are going to be less healthy if you don't have health \ninsurance. My friend from Iowa is exactly right again. It doesn't pass \nthe fairness test.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator points out that most people pay payroll \ntaxes. Especially in the income brackets where they are lacking health \ninsurance, they are paying more in payroll taxes than they are income \ntaxes. That is why you are only getting 600,000 more people with health \ninsurance at a cost of $18,000 in tax incentives per person per year. \nWhat a giveaway.\n  Does the Senator agree that for those income groups that lack a lot \nof health insurance coverage--and that is low-income people who are \nworking for minimum wage or maybe above minimum wage, or working for \nsmall businesses that can't afford to give them health insurance \ncoverage in our small towns and communities --would it not be better or \ncheaper, fairer to expand the Medicaid program or the CHIP program to \ncover the kids?\n  Mr. KERREY. Absolutely. It would be fairer to provide full \ndeductibility for the self-employed. The Senator from Iowa and I both \nrepresent a lot of self-employed families, many of whom are farmers, \nand they are increasingly going into town to get the jobs just to get \nhealth insurance. Absolutely, it would be more fair.\n  I find most Americans want to do things in a fair way. They want us \nto tell them the truth about the facts. If they see the facts, they see \nthe struggle that is going on.\n  Again, I wonder if anybody who was sitting in this room putting this \ntax bill together said, hey, did you see the story that says that now a \nmajority of households in America have both mom and dad working? Did \nyou see the story in the newspaper that said of the 270 American \ncorporations surveyed, 70 percent paid less than the 35 percent \neffective tax rate, and a large number of them didn't pay any taxes at \nall because they are using stock options to reduce the cost of their \ntaxes?\n  Did you read the story about Americans with higher incomes saying \nthey don't want to pay any taxes so they will park their accounts down \nin the Bahamas and get a credit card or a debit card? Did anybody in \nthis room say that is not fair? Maybe we should say to these folks who \nare down there running their accounts in the Bahamas: The next time you \nhave a fire in your house or need the police force, or need the Navy, \nwhy don't you get the Bahamian Navy or the Bahamian police force or the \nBahamian firefighters to help you out?\n  I mean, did anybody in this room say, with all the evidence around, \nthis isn't fair? I have to say to my friend from Iowa, it just doesn't \npass the fairness test. I think Americans want our laws to be fair. \nThey want us to write fair laws and regulations. They want us to look \nat society and say it needs to be the land of opportunity for \neverybody. There are very few Americans who would not like a tax cut. \nIf we are going to target them, as Vice President Gore has been saying, \nand the Republicans are going to say, we agree, the Vice President is \nright; we ought to have a targeted tax credit, it seems we ought to try \nto apply some standard or test of fairness as we do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I really appreciate the Senator's remarks.\n  What the Republicans have done is they have given us this tax package \nwithout involving any Democrat. So you are right, none of us was in the \nroom to ever ask the question, Is this fair? They have now dropped this \non us. What they have done, really, is sort of given lie to their whole \ncampaign theme with Governor Bush, and that is that you need a tax \ncut--to just shotgun it out there--and they have given us a targeted \ntax cut. I am grateful to the Senator for pointing that out.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have one last question. I find myself saying it doesn't \nhurt me. I wasn't in the room. It didn't hurt me at all. As a matter of \nfact, because my income is over $130,000, those folks making the \ndecision in that room helped me out. I guess I should sneak over and \nthank them for giving me a big tax cut. The people who get hurt are not \nMembers of Congress who weren't in the room; they are Americans who \neither don't get the targeted benefit or who do get it and say, oh, my \ngosh, if you are going to do a tax cut, for gosh sakes, help the people \nwho really need it. I think most Americans want our tax laws and the \nrest of the laws to be as fair as we possibly can make them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right.\n  Again, I will just add on top of that, the other unfairness part of \nthis bill is that they didn't what they should have to really expand \nhealth insurance coverage in a meaningful way to low-income people. I \nam talking about people who are working, not people who are on Medicaid \nand getting coverage. I am talking about low-income people above the \npoverty line and modest income people who are working hard, making \n$20,000 a year; they may have a couple kids. They are not in this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am sure my friend knows this, but one of the problems \nis this: Let's say you have a mom and dad both on minimum wage. That \nmeans they are probably making a $14,000 or $15,000 gross salary--maybe \na bit more, maybe $16,000 or $17,000. I can't remember, but I think it \nis $8,000 that the minimum wage will produce. Say both are working 40 \nhours a week and generating $18,000 to $20,000 a year. FICA is taking a \nlot of taxes from them to pay the health insurance of a lot of other \npeople. I have a claim on their income.\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\n Every Member of Congress who will get a big tax cut has a claim on \ntheir income to pay our health insurance.\n  Did anybody in that room putting the tax proposal together say, hey, \nI don't think that is fair? Well, that is why you need Democrats in the \nroom. That is why God created Democrats. We sit in the room and say, Is \nthat fair? Sometimes we do it to a fault. That is why we need \nRepublicans to push back and say, Can we afford it? Some of us have \nRepublican and Democrat in us and go back and forth all the time. This \nisn't fair. As the Senator said, I represent low-income working \nfamilies without health insurance subsidizing my health insurance. I \nhave a claim on their income. They have no claim on mine, and I am \ngetting a big tax cut. I just say to my friend, does that seem fair to \nyou?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is not fair.\n  After listening to the Senator, it raises another question in my \nmind. Sometimes it seems that Republicans don't believe there is \nanybody in this country who makes $20,000 or $30,000 a year. Maybe they \nthink this is a myth. Sometimes it seems like they don't exist for \nthem.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I think they do understand it. I think they do, but the \nproblem, it seems to me, is you have to step back from time to time and \nlook at the work you are doing, and you have to apply other values, \nother standards, to it.\n  I just don't, in this case, look at this proposal--and I am not able \nto reach the conclusion that I am going to target a tax cut, as the \nVice President has been calling for, that somebody was in that room \nsaying, gee, we have to make sure it is fair. It just didn't get there.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator answering the questions I have \nasked of him. I look forward, in fact, to a time when we have our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle engaging in this dialog.\n  Maybe there is an answer here. Maybe somebody was asking the question \nover and over: Is this fair? I watched with great interest as the Texas \nGovernor talked about compassionate conservatism. I wonder if my friend \nnoticed that some of his Republican friends were saying: Hey, knock \nthat compassion stuff off. You are sounding too much like a Democrat \nthere, let alone acting compassionately. If you use that word too much, \nyou might not get enough people to come out and vote for you.\n  I understand and appreciate when my friends on the other side come \nand say: You want to make it fair, but we have to afford it. God bless \nthem. Senator McCain earlier was talking about it. God bless Senator \nMcCain for bringing that up. We have to pay attention to the need to \nkeep the economy growing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sometimes they ask can we afford it. I ask: can we afford \nto add 600,000 additional individuals under their bill by giving a tax \nincentive for health insurance that costs $18,000 per person per year \nthat gains coverage, how can we afford that? Can we afford it when \nthere are so many ways that far more people could acquire health \ninsurance with a far smaller incentive, but one that was properly \ndesigned for the purpose.\n  Mr. KERREY. It does seem a little pricey.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. We are going to have \nthe debate tomorrow. We will be talking more tomorrow on the tax bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11103-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11103-S11104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB KERREY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I enjoyed the exchange I just had with my \ngood friend of longstanding, Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. I just \nwant to talk a little about my friend Bob Kerrey as he seeks to retire \nfrom the Senate to start a new career.\n  Bob Kerrey is what I have often referred to as two dying breeds all \nrolled into one: He is a true American war hero, the likes of which \nthis body hasn't seen for over a century, and he is a public servant \nwho speaks his mind and the truth regardless of the political costs. \nAround here, that is refreshing, as we just heard.\n  We all know that, as a young man, Bob volunteered for duty, was \naccepted into the elite Navy Seals--believe me, I was in the Navy, and \nthat is tough duty. He served in Vietnam. Three months into his \nservice, in a very daring night mission, a grenade exploded at his feet \nthat was thrown by the enemy. He lost his right leg below the knee. \nAlthough he was in unbearable pain from that and from other wounds on \nother parts of his body--his arms and hands--barely conscious, he \ncontinued to direct his men until they were able to escape.\n  He won the Congressional Medal of Honor--the highest American \ndecoration--for his courage. He is the only current Member of Congress \nwith this distinction and only the fifth Member of the Senate to win \nthis medal. The other four won theirs during the Civil War. So Bob \nKerrey is the first Member of the Senate to win the Congressional Medal \nof Honor since the Civil War. That is why we haven't seen his likes \naround here in over a century.\n  Senator Kerrey will never tell you all this. It is funny how those \nwho have done the most in battle talk about it the least, and those who \nhave done the least, who have used money and family connections to \nskirt military service, are always the loudest supporters of more \nmilitary spending.\n  Well, Senator Kerrey and I go back a long way--back to when he first \nran for Governor and won in 1982. I had been in Congress for three or \nfour terms by then. I remember going from my district border, the \nMissouri River--right across the Missouri River from Omaha. And since I \nwas somewhat known in Omaha, I went across the river to campaign for \nthis guy I had heard so much about. In spite of my having campaigned \nfor him, he won the governorship. Since then, we have campaigned for \neach other in almost every election. He has either come over to \ncampaign with me, or I have gone over to campaign with him in Nebraska. \nThe exception, of course, was the Presidential race of 1992 when we \nboth sought the nomination. So I suppose looking back on how things \nturned out, we might as well have campaigned for each other that year.\n  Throughout his service as Governor of Nebraska and as that State's \nSenator, Bob Kerrey has never been afraid to let his colleagues, his \nconstituents, and the American public know what is on his mind. He is \nnot afraid to learn and grow and modify his opinions when issues become \nmore clear and convincing and when other views come into play. In this \nway, Bob Kerrey is a model legislator--not so rigid that he is mired in \nconstancy and not so drifting that he has lost his anger.\n  Senator Kerrey has brought his honesty and clear thinking to a host \nof important issues. Throughout his career, he has worked to improve \neducation in America. He has been a staunch advocate for Head Start, \nyouth and family mentoring, and vocational education. He has been a \nleader in our battle to bridge the digital divide and bring technology \nto the classroom. The e-rate amendment that he cosponsored allowed \nschools in rural areas across America to access the Internet.\n  He has been a lifelong champion of family farmers in Nebraska and \nthroughout the country. He has fought to strengthen market prices, \nimprove agricultural education, empower producers in USDA \ndecisionmaking, and, of course, he has been one of the best supporters \nof increasing the use of ethanol.\n  Bob Kerrey has also been at the forefront of a host of important \ngovernment reform initiatives. He has worked on a national bipartisan \ncommission to reform Medicare. He is chair of a bipartisan commission \non entitlement and tax reform. He is cochair of a national commission \non restructuring the IRS, a commission which he created back in 1996.\n  In addition, Bob has a strong record of service to the Democratic \nParty. As chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee in 1995, \n1996, and 1997, he pulled the Democrats through some tough times. If it \nweren't for his hard work, we might be a lot more of a minority than we \nare now.\n  Senator Kerrey's heroism in Vietnam was just the beginning. He \ncontinued to act bravely and sacrifice greatly for this country \nthroughout his career in government. The New School University is lucky \nto have someone of his stature and character at its helm. Bob Kerrey is \na truly unique American, one who my wife Ruth and I have been \nprivileged to call a friend for many, many years. Ruth and I wish Bob \nthe\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\nbest in his future endeavors, and we hope he will continue to make \nhimself available for further public service. Our country needs it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11104-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GOVERNOR BUSH'S TAX PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, an article appeared today in the \nWashington Post, Thursday, October 26, 2000, in which the American \nAcademy of Actuaries, a respected nonpartisan organization of financial \nand statistical experts, reported Governor Bush's plan to cut taxes and \ndivert Social Security payroll taxes to establish individual accounts \nwould make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held \nnational debt.\n  It is interesting. Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, faulted the study \nbecause it relied on growth estimates contained in a recent \nCongressional Budget Office report that projected long-term budget \ntrends. He said that this assumes growth ``at an unusually low level'' \npast 2010.\n  Wait a minute. The Congressional Budget Office is run by the \nRepublicans, not by the Democrats.\n  Lastly, this report said ``counting his taxes and individual \naccounts, Bush is very much overspending Gore.''\n  I ask, in this campaign who is really the big spender?

I wanted to talk briefly tonight about where we are. We \nare now 26 days into the new fiscal year. We should have completed our \nwork 26 days ago. We are at a stage that should command we work \ntogether to try to resolve what remaining differences there are, finish \nour work, and do all we can to bring this session to a close.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what has happened tonight. What has \nhappened tonight is that our Republican colleagues have insisted on a \nconference report for Commerce-State-Justice which they know will be \nvetoed. They have insisted on drafting a piece of legislation \nincorporating $240 billion in tax cuts, approximately $81 billion we \nare told--even though we still haven't had it analyzed and calculated--\nin changes to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  They insisted at the last minute, without any consultation, on \nincorporating one of the most controversial pieces of legislation \npending before the Senate at the end of the year, a bill having to do \nwith forcing States to accept a certain position on physician assisted \nsuicide. There hasn't been any vote in the full Senate, but it is in \nthis tax bill. It is a bill that has nothing to do with taxes, nothing \nto do with hospitals and ways with which to address the real problems \nwe are facing all across this country with health providers, hospitals, \nclinics, hospice facilities, nursing homes. You name it, virtually \nevery health facility in this country today is either on the verge of \nbankruptcy or in a serious financial position. We all recognize the \nneed to do this before we leave, to address the problems our hospitals \nand all of our health facilities are facing.\n  What happened is that our Republican colleagues, with absolutely no \nconsultation with any Democrats--House, Senate, or White House--have \ncobbled together a bill they know will be vetoed. The President just \nthis afternoon sent a letter indicating he will veto the Commerce-\nState-Justice bill and he will veto the tax bill.\n  I come to the floor chagrined, disappointed, angered, frustrated. \nSpeaker Hastert has already reacted to the veto letters. I will quote \nwhat is reported in Congress Daily:\n\n       Do you have to have everything you want? How much petulance \n     is there on the other side of the aisle?\n\n  When asked if Republicans would be willing to rework a tax bill at \nall, he responded that any new legislation would have to go through \ncommittee ``because anything else would amount to half-assed \nlegislating.''\n  Let me repeat that. He said that new legislation would have to go \nthrough committee ``because anything else would amount to half-assed \nlegislating.''\n  What is this, if it isn't what the Speaker has already described as \nhalf-assed legislating? We have got a bill before the Senate that \nnobody has seen. We have a bill before the Senate that hasn't gone \nthrough committee. No one has had the opportunity to consider it \ncarefully. I hope my colleagues will hear me out on this. In fact, we \nhave just heard and been told, and now it has been confirmed, that the \nconference report we are about to vote on\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\ntomorrow literally eliminates the minimum wage for 6 months--eliminates \nit because of a glitch in the writing of the bill. We are eliminating \nthe minimum wage for half a year in this legislation, totally. We are \nnot rolling it back. We are not freezing it. It is eliminated.\n  I know our Republican colleagues had no real desire to eliminate the \nminimum wage, but that is what is in this legislation. Why? I think the \nanswer is clear. Because the Speaker described it--I won't repeat it \nagain and again but I think he had a very apt description for what we \nare doing right now. We are not going through committee. We are not \ngoing through the legislation on the floor. We are not going through a \nnormal conference.\n  Let me start by saying what this is really all about is fairness. \nThis is about fairness. It is about whether we are fair to a process \nand whether we are fair to all Senators who ought to have an \nopportunity to more carefully consider a $240 billion tax cut. It is \nabout whether or not fairness would dictate that, if we are going to \naddress a bill as important as restoring some of the payments through \nMedicare for all the health facilities in this country, we would have a \nchance to look at it; that we would have a chance to be consulted about \nit; that we would have a chance to voice our concerns about it and \nultimately to have a chance to put the bill together in a way we can \nbring it back to the Senate and House with some expectation that there \nhas been this deliberation. That is fairness.\n\n  I hear the Republican candidate for President, Governor Bush, talk, \nas he should, about the need for bipartisanship. If he says it once, he \nsays it 10 times a day: I want to restore bipartisanship.\n  I must say, why wait until next year? Why not do it now? What is \nwrong with a little bipartisanship in putting a tax bill together? What \nis wrong with a little bipartisanship in ensuring that as we write a \nBalanced Budget Restoration Act that we have Republican and Democratic \ninput? That is bipartisanship.\n  We have had a lot of bipartisan votes this year. We have the votes, \nnow, to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is bipartisanship. We \nhave had Patients' Bill of Rights votes throughout the year. We have a \nbipartisan bill. We have had a bipartisan bill on a number of pieces of \nlegislation relating to education, a bipartisan bill on minimum wage, a \nbipartisan bill on gun safety. Every time we have a bipartisan bill, \nthe Republican leadership is not willing to allow the process to be \ncomplete. So there is no bipartisanship, whether it is on all the \nissues upon which we have already voted or whether it is on this bill \ntonight. None. Zero. No consultation.\n  This is about fairness. It is also about fairness when it comes to \nthe issues we are talking about in the bill itself. I am very troubled \nby the amazing and extraordinarily complex ways our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have attempted to address many of the issues \nbefore us in this bill. We have not seen, until just this afternoon, \nwhat the tax bill entails. But we are told the tax bill has provisions \nincorporated that allow the bottom 60 percent of all taxpayers to \nreceive only 5 percent of the tax benefits--60 percent of all taxpayers \nget 5 percent of the benefit. That is an unfairness as well.\n  We hear so much debate at the national level, at the Presidential \nlevel, about making sure everybody benefits. How is it the top 40 \npercent should get 95 percent of the benefit, once again? And why is it \nwe have to insist that, in situation after situation involving tax \nfairness, it has to be a fight about whether or not we can equitably \ndistribute the benefit? Once again, each and every time the minimum of \nwhat you would expect for working families is left off the table. I do \nnot understand why we cannot be more fair when it comes to tax policy \nand distribution. But for 60 percent of the people to get 5 percent of \nthe benefit is not fair.\n  It is not fair as well to be sending millions of children to schools \nthat are in a total state of disrepair. I do not have the number in \nfront of me, but I will tell you this: 76 percent of all the school \ndistricts in this country have at least one school building that is in \na state of disrepair. There are hundreds of billions of dollars in \nbacklog all over this country with regard to school construction. We \nhave had problems with infrastructure all over our State. My State is \nnot unique. There is not a State in this country that has been able to \nadequately and satisfactorily address the problems with regard to \nschool construction--not one.\n  What we have said is let's take at least a modicum of the \nresponsibility. My goodness, if we can pass highway construction bills \nand courthouse construction bills and airport construction bills and \nall the array of other housing construction bills at the Federal level, \ncertainly we can help school districts help build better schools. What \nis wrong with providing them with some tools, financially, to get that \njob done? If this fight is about anything tonight, it is about that. It \nis about our inability to address in a meaningful way real school \nconstruction this year.\n\n  We had asked for a $25 billion commitment on the part of the Federal \nGovernment and this bill falls far short of the mark. And the President \nsaid on that basis alone he would be prepared to veto this bill. If we \ndo not fix the school construction bill adequately in this legislation, \nit will never be signed. That, too, is a question of fairness--fairness \nfor those school kids who must face the fact each and every day that \ntheir safety and the quality of their education is dictated by the \ncrumbling school they must enter each and every day they come. That is \nwrong. That is unfair. That ought to be addressed in this Congress \nbefore we leave. And whether it is in this tax bill or in the education \nfunding that has to be appropriated prior to the time we leave, we have \nto fix it. We have to address it.\n  There is also, as I noted earlier, a serious question relating to the \nfairness of the BBRA, the Balanced Budget Reform Act. We know what \nlimited dollars we have. We recognize this may be our last shot. This \nmay be our last real opportunity to send as much help out to the States \nas we can possibly provide if we are going to solve the problem of \nnursing homes, solve the problem of hospitals and clinics, solve the \nproblems of hospice. Whether or not we are able to get that job done \ndepends on whether or not we can adequately address it in this bill.\n  But what did our Republican colleagues do? They spent $28 billion \nover five years, more than a third of which goes to HMOs who have \nalready indicated, with or without the money, they are pulling out of \nMedicare in many States. They will not be influenced by this \nlegislation or by the incredible price tag this legislation holds for \nthem.\n  I must say, I don't get it. We all claim to be concerned about the \nthreat to the surplus that we have so carefully been able to amass over \nthe last couple of years. We have all indicated that is our highest \npriority, to assure that we can retain the fiscal responsibility this \nyear, next year, and from here on out. Yet we pass a bill that includes \na gift of more than $11 billion to HMOs in the name of trying to keep \nthem in Medicare in States when they have said they will not stay in \nthose States regardless of how much we pay them, ransom or not. There \nis an $11 billion ransom payment in here and it is not going to help \none State.\n  The problem we have is that it is taking money away from nursing \nhomes. It is taking money away from hospitals. It is taking money away \nfrom hospice. It is taking money away from clinics. I do not \nunderstand, in the name of fairness, why we can't appreciate how \nextraordinarily important this is.\n  This is a question of fairness. It is a question of being fair to the \nnursing homes and hospitals which are hanging on by their fingernails \ntonight, hoping we can do the right thing in providing them with the \nassistance they need in fixing the mistake we made in 1997. It is a \nquestion of fairness about whether or not we are going to provide tax \nbenefits to all the people, not just to those at the top.\n  It is a question of fairness with regard to whether or not schools \nare going to have the kinds of funds they need to ensure they have the \nability to build the schools our children need today; not tomorrow, \ntoday. It is a question of fairness whether or not we can do what \nGovernor Bush, Vice President Gore, and so many of those out there seem \nto be talking about each and every day: restoring some semblance of \nbipartisanship in this\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nbody, in the Congress, and in the Federal Government.\n  We have fallen so far off that mark. There is not anything bipartisan \nabout this package. There is absolutely nothing in here that even \nbegins to appreciate the need for a bipartisan consensus, and here we \nare tonight, 26 days after the fiscal year began, with a veto of a bill \nthat should have been resolved months ago.\n  It is not only unfair, it is incredibly bad management. We can do \nbetter than this, Mr. President. We have to do better than this. We \nhave to do better than this in restoring some sort of comity, some sort \nof cooperation, and some sort of dialog when we take on bills of this \nimport. We have to restore fairness if we are really going to address \ntax legislation this year.\n  Fairness dictates that we have a school construction program of which \nwe can all be proud. Fairness demands that we find a better way to \nsolve the BBA problem than we have in this bill. We need fairness. We \nneed attention to those issues. We need to resolve it before we leave. \nWe need to do it tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, however long it \ntakes. We have to do this before we leave.\n  We will have more to say about this.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the distinguished minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, I think Senator \nDaschle has given an excellent statement tonight and has come back to \nwhat I think is the central concern of our time, and that is that the \npeople of this country want to see bipartisan cooperation on all the \ncentral matters that are before the country.\n  I want to ask the Senator a question about the process. I will be \nvery brief because I know the Senator from Missouri has been anxious to \ntalk and has been very patient.\n  The tax legislation before us directs Federal law enforcement \nofficials to criminalize the pain management decisions of our health \ncare providers in an effort to throw Oregon's assisted-suicide law into \nthe trash can. More than 50 major health organizations have said that \nthey oppose this effort in this legislation because they believe the \nbill before us is going to have a chilling effect on pain management.\n  I am going to have a whole lot more to say about this subject \ntomorrow. Tonight I will be very brief. It seems to me what Senator \nDaschle is saying tonight--and I am interested in his thoughts--is that \non an issue such as this, one of the most important bioethical \ndecisions of our time, what the Senate ought to do is have a real \ndebate, a real discussion, a chance to work in a bipartisan way rather \nthan proceeding as we are now to establish new rules on one of the most \nsensitive, ethical, and social issues of our time without any \nopportunity to review it or modify it.\n  Is the Senator from South Dakota just saying he wants Government to \noperate in a fashion along the lines of what the American people expect \non these central and very difficult issues?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has stated it so \nsuccinctly and so correctly. That is exactly what I am saying. He has \nnoted the extraordinary nature of the provision he has cited. There is \na great deal of controversy involving the issue, and I give credit to \nthose in Oregon who have tried to grapple with the very personal issue \nof suicide and physician-assisted efforts involving suicide.\n  As he has noted, a large number of organizations have publicly stated \ntheir support for the Oregon law, but the real question is not whether \none agrees with the Oregon law or one does not agree. The question is, \nOn a question of this controversy, of this import, of this breadth, \nshould we be forced at 8:15 tonight to be talking about it without \nhaving had the benefit of discussion in the full Senate up until now?\n\n  Not only that, should we take it on a take-it-or-leave-it basis? This \nhas been buried in a bill having nothing to do with physician-assisted \nsuicide. This has a lot to do with taxes. It has a lot to do with \nschool construction. It has a lot to do with health care. It has \nnothing to do with physician-assisted suicide, and at the last minute, \nour Republican colleagues put it in there, buried it in the bill and \nnow want us to vote on it, up or down, no debate.\n  That is incredibly bad management. That is so unfair, not only to \nus--we ought to have the opportunity--but to Oregon, to the country, to \nthe issue. That is what troubles me perhaps most of all: Once again, \nthey have denigrated the institutional process in ways I do not think \nanybody can fully appreciate. Something as important as this should \nhave its day in court. There should be a debate about it. I am sure in \nOregon they spent a lot of time debating, considering, and consulting \nprior to the time they came to any conclusion. We should do no less.\n  The Senator from Oregon is absolutely right. That is in part what \nthis is about.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if the minority leader will yield again \nbriefly, as someone who opposes assisted suicide--and I have talked to \nalmost all of our colleagues--I know there is very strong feeling in \nthe Chamber, just as the minority leader has said in his thoughtful \nstatement. There ought to be a way to oppose assisted suicide without \nsetting in place a Federal law enforcement regime that will harm pain \nmanagement.\n  I ask the minority leader, as we go forward in this debate, because I \nintend to talk for a long time about this tomorrow, is it the Senator's \ndesire that at least we could try tomorrow to have a discussion on this \nextraordinarily important social and ethical question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the Senator from Oregon, since it is part \nof this legislation, I think it dictates that we have a lengthy \ndiscussion about it. Certainly we have to make sure that everybody \nunderstands the ramifications of all the provisions.\n  Again, in the name of fairness, we ought to be providing those \nSenators who have a great deal of interest in this issue and who \ncertainly know more about it than many of us who have not been exposed \nto much of the debate to date, that we have some discussion about it. \nAgain, it goes back to the Speaker's comments in the first place. You \ncan do it the right way or you can do it the way they have done it \ntonight. We have done it wrong tonight. People like the Senator from \nOregon, like the Senator from Nevada--all of us--deserve better. The \npeople deserve better. We are going to insist that they get better than \nwhat they have been given so far.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am going to make some comments about the \nconference report that is before us, but perhaps it would be advisable \nto set the record straight. I agreed to allow the minority leader to go \nfirst as a courtesy to him. There are many things he said that I \nbelieve reflect a viewpoint many of us on this side of the aisle do not \nshare.\n  I would only note that when we talk about bipartisanship, it was our \nunderstanding that the leadership on both sides, for example, agreed we \nwould get 10 appropriations bills passed out of the Senate before the \nJuly recess. Due to the extensive debate and extended dilatory \nactivities engaged in on this floor prior to our August recess, to get \nsomething like the fifth, sixth, and seventh bill before us, we had to \ninvoke cloture.\n  Now, to me, that is not a mark of good bipartisan cooperation. We \nhave been stalled for many months. There have been examples where we \nhave worked on a bipartisan basis.\n  In another role, I express my appreciation to my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle for getting our Veterans Affairs, Housing \nand Urban Development bill passed. I think we have worked on a \nbipartisan basis there.\n  But with the problems we are having with the appropriations bills, \nthe problems we are having throughout, I do not think the other side \ncan say we have been the ones who have refused to operate in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  I heard reports from the majority leader, for example, of the \ncontacts made to him by the President of the United States, a \nDemocratic President, about this bill and about the measures in it.\n  If you look at this bill, a lot on my side of the aisle do not like \nit because it has so many of the priorities that our Democratic friends \nwanted. If this were strictly a Republican or a partisan bill, I do not \nthink you would see\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\nthe minimum wage in its current form; you would not see the community \nrenewal, a massive new Federal Government program.\n  Frankly, with all the spending the President has requested in the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill--and the President is now requesting more \nspending in that bill than his initial budget request--to add, as this \nbill does, some $16 billion for school construction, which is two-\nthirds of the President's request, I think is a major step towards \nhelping in this new area, which traditionally has been the \nresponsibility of the local school districts.\n  We have heard there is a desire for more and more spending. That is \nnot surprising. That is the habit of our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. They have never seen a tax surplus they did not want to \nspend. Tax cuts are very unpalatable to them. But we want to leave some \nof the taxes in the pockets of the people who earn them.\n  I have not seen the figures--I do not know the study the minority \nleader came up with to say that 60 percent only get 5 percent of the \ntax cuts--but I think, if my memory serves me correctly, the lowest \nincome 40 percent of the population do not pay any income taxes. I \nimagine the lowest 60 percent probably pay not more than a couple of \npercent of the total tax burden.\n  Now that is not to say there has not been some fuzzy math with \nrespect to the figures we presented, but only to say that if you are \ngoing to have tax cuts, the people who get the tax cuts are going to be \nthe people who pay the taxes. It sounds logical, sounds simple, but \nthat is the fact of the matter.\n  I might add, also, that small rural school districts will be \nbenefited in school construction because their exemption has been \nraised from $10 million to $15 million.\n  When we hear talk that the Democrats have not had anything to say \nabout this, the tax bill includes bills that have already been voted on \nand passed, been voted out of the House, been voted out of the Finance \nCommittee. Certainly the small business portion of the bill, which I am \ngoing to talk about, has been passed, as usual, out of the Small \nBusiness Committee on a unanimous vote, a bipartisan vote.\n  If I remember correctly, when the bills that are included in the \nsmall business section came before this body, there was only one \ndissenting vote, and that was on my side of the aisle.\n  But if there is ever a bipartisan measure, it is the measures we have \nreported out of the Small Business Committee.\n  On the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, when the House \npassed the pension bill earlier this year, it was a vote of 401-25. It \nwas reported out of the Finance Committee last month by a unanimous \nvote. I was not there for the vote, but I assume there were some \nDemocrats there--there usually are--who voted for it unanimously.\n  So it stretches credulity beyond any acceptable measure to say that \nthis does not incorporate measures adopted and supported by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--certainly measures demanded \nby the President.\n  We had a caucus on our side, and many people thought it would be \ndifficult to vote for a bill because there were so many priorities from \nthe Democratic side. But under the measure that has come before us, \nthere are clearly many important Democratic priorities.\n\n  Excuse me, I misspoke a few moments ago when I indicated what the \npercentage of total taxes was paid by the lowest income taxpayers. The \nlowest income taxpayers, the bottom 56 percent pay 6 percent of the \ntaxes. So that is roughly the figure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11107-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11107-S11111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      H.R. 2614--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Let me move to the bill before us. It has been thoroughly \ncovered with faint praise. Maybe it deserves a hearing in its own right \nbefore this thing gets pasted all over the place. I would like my \ncolleagues and our constituents to know what is in it because I think \nthere are some good things in it.\n  The conference report on H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Program \nImprovement Act, has grown over the past week to include not only a 3-\nyear reauthorization bill for the Small Business Administration, but it \nincludes extensive tax legislation, provisions to reform and improve \nthe Medicare program, and, as I mentioned, pension reform. We might \ncall this bill ``Small Business and Friends.'' A lot of important \nluggage is being carried on the train that our little small business \nbill is pulling.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I will comment first \non the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000. This is, as I said \nbefore, the result of many months of work by the Senate and House \nCommittees on Small Business. The bill is the conference agreement to \nreauthorize most small business programs at the Small Business \nAdministration, and it reauthorizes the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program.\n  To summarize the provisions briefly, this includes an 8-year \nreauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research Program, the \nSBIR Program. This program was initially implemented in 1983 and allows \nFederal agencies to award research grants and contracts to small \nresearch firms. This is vitally important to develop the capacity in \nthe economy as a whole, and the country as a whole, to do high-quality \nresearch needed by the Federal Government.\n  Some 50,000 SBIR awards have been made since the inception of the \nprogram. It contains measures to ensure that small businesses receive \nthe appropriate allocation of Federal R funds, to require that \nagencies retain more comprehensive information on the program's \noperations that will improve its management, and to protect the \nintellectual property of the small businesses that participate in the \nprogram.\n  The conference report also establishes what we call the FAST program, \na matching grant initiative to provide incentives to States to assist \nin the development of high-tech small businesses.\n  We have noted, particularly those of us from the heartland, that \ncompanies on the east and west coasts generally receive the vast \nmajority of SBIR awards, while companies in the South, Midwest, and \nRocky Mountain States receive proportionally very few awards. Out in \nthe heartland, we, too, have technology. We have research capabilities. \nThe FAST program will help even out the concentration of the awards by \nproviding wide latitude to States to provide the type of help their \nhigh-tech businesses need to succeed and create high-paying quality \njobs for their citizens.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 also includes a \ncomprehensive reauthorization of the credit and management assistance \nprograms that are included in the broad umbrella of small business \nprograms administered by the SBA. The omnibus bill includes the \nflagship 7(a) guaranteed business loan program, the Small Business \nInvestment Company program, and the Microloan program. Certain \nimprovements were made to the Microloan program championed by the \nranking member of the Committee on Small Business, the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. John Kerry. The Microloan program has \nbeen expanded. We also included aspects which will be especially \nbeneficial to women-owned small businesses across the United States.\n  In addition, this extensive legislation would reauthorize and make \nimprovements in the management assistance programs, including the SCORE \nand Small Business Development Center program. As a result of the \ncontinuing oversight responsibilities of the Committee on Small \nBusiness, the bill includes a significant improvement package for the \nHUBZone program. This is a program which I was pleased to present and \nhave adopted by Congress, signed by the President, that provides set-\naside contracts to bring jobs and economic opportunity to areas where \nthere has been high unemployment and high poverty. This is a \ngeographically based program, which actually takes the jobs to the \ncommunities that need them to help people get from welfare to work by \nusing the power of the Federal Government as a purchaser to create \nbusiness opportunities.\n  First and foremost, the bill, H.R. 5545, addresses the inadvertent \nexclusion of Indian tribal enterprises and Alaska Native corporations \nfrom the program. These provisions resulted from extensive negotiations \nbetween\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nthe Committee on Small Business, the Committee on Indian Affairs, and \nthe Alaska congressional delegation. The HUBZone section of the bill \nalso seeks to clarify the effects of the HUBZone price evaluation \npreference on commodity procurements in which the range of bid prices \ntends to be small, and the HUBZone price evaluation preference would be \noverwhelmingly decisive.\n  In addition, the legislation makes other improvements and \nclarifications in a variety of SBA programs to make them more \neffective. For example, there has been some confusion among the Federal \nagencies about contract preferences for service-disabled veterans. This \nbill would make it absolutely clear that service-disabled veterans are \non the same preference level as the small disadvantaged businesses and \nwomen-owned small businesses for Federal contracting opportunities.\n  The conference report incorporates the new market venture capital \nprogram of 2000. The purpose of this program is, similarly, to promote \neconomic development, new investment, and job opportunities in low-\nincome areas. It accomplishes this goal by providing incentives to \nencourage small venture capital firms to invest in targeted low-income \ncommunities and economically distressed inner cities and poor rural \ncounties.\n\n  This is a program that has been developed with bipartisan support. \nThis is certainly something that will assist us in this country in \ngetting more people off of welfare, making sure that job opportunities \ngo to the places and the people who most need them.\n  When the Congress enacted my HUBZone legislation 3 years ago, it \nestablished the Federal contracting incentives to lure small businesses \ninto distressed cities and rural counties. I believe this new market \nventure capital program will add an additional building block in our \nstrategy to make sure these economically distressed areas are \nattractive to small businesses and that they will be able to bring job \nopportunities and new vitality to these historically neglected areas of \nthe Nation.\n  As everybody now has heard from the other side, the conference report \ndoes deal with taxes. I believe it is a great victory for the American \ntaxpayers. The tax portion has four sections. First, the legislation \nincludes the Foreign Sales Corporation Repeal and Extraterritorial \nIncome Exclusion Act of 2000. I can see that is going to be a real \nwinner. That title really rolls off your tongue, the FSC Repeal and \nExtraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. That one will be a \nwinner. But it is must-do legislation, seriously. We have to do it by \nNovember 1, if we are to avoid a potential trade war--at least \nsanctions --with the European Union.\n  Second, the conference report includes a House-Senate compromise on \nthe Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2000, which has enormous \nbipartisan support, having passed the House earlier this year by a vote \nof 401-25 and being reported out of the Senate Finance Committee by \nunanimous vote. That legislation includes sweeping changes encouraging \nretirement savings, expanding pension coverage by increasing \ncontribution limits on IRA and other types of pension plans, increasing \nportability, and providing meaningful relief for women who often take \ntime off to raise their families. And it contains a number of \nprovisions to reduce regulatory burdens that are very excessive and \nwill be especially helpful to small businesses, our constituency in the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n  The third part of the tax portion of the conference report is a \nminimum wage increase and a package of small business tax provisions. I \nraised questions about raising the minimum wage when it first came \nhere. I think it can be detrimental to small business. I do not believe \nit is good economics. We know it is good politics. It is always nice to \npromise somebody a raise, particularly when you don't have to come up \nwith the money that they are being paid. This is great election year \npolitics. I know everybody wants to do something. It makes you feel \ngood to give somebody a raise out of someone else's pocket.\n  The problem is, right now it probably won't hurt small businesses too \nmuch because most small businesses I know of, if they are hiring \nreasonably competent workers, have to pay well over the minimum wage. \nThe real downside is that the very people it is supposed to help are \nthe ones who may not get the jobs. Right now we see people who have \nnever had a job before, teenagers, first-time employees, perhaps \npersons with disabilities, often minority students coming out of \ncollege, have trouble getting jobs. If the minimum wage is raised, we \nmay see in the United States, as we do in Europe, high unemployment \namong teenagers.\n  What the minimum wage does is make it very difficult to get on the \nfirst rung of that ladder of economic progress. It is like putting \ngrease on that first rung of the ladder and saying, boy, this is going \nto make it easy to slip onto that first rung. Unfortunately, the grease \non the first rung of the ladder too often slips people off, when \nbusinesses find they just can't make a profit, hiring people at an \ninflated minimum wage.\n  I hope we will continue, as a result of the economic and fiscal \nrestraint of the Republican-led Congress, if we can keep the economy \ngoing as it has since the Republicans took control of the Congress \nbeginning in 1995, we hope that wages will continue to go up and \nproductivity will continue to go up so we don't need the minimum wage. \nIf the time comes when there are tight economic times, the victims of \nthe increased minimum wage will be the small businesses, the smallest \nbusinesses, the ones with the lowest profit margin and the most needy \nworkers, the workers very often not supporting their families but \ntrying to get on the first rung of the economic ladder so they can \nbuild a bank account and make enough money to start a family.\n  In addition to the minimum wage, however, there are small business \nadvantages from this bill. I appreciate the work of Chairman Roth to \ninclude a significant package of small business tax relief items, \nincluding something that has been my top priority since we began in \n1995, and that is 100 percent deductibility of health insurance for the \nself-employed starting in 2001. I have been working on it for over 5 \nyears to ensure that the self-employed are on a level playing field \nwith their corporate competitors.\n  In the past we said, you can have it, but it was 2007 and then 2003. \nA lot of self-employed people said: That is nice, but I can't wait \nuntil 2007 or 2003 to get sick. Well, now I hope we will have it in \n2001, so they will be able to afford the health insurance for \nthemselves and their families. Coupled with a new above-the-line \ndeduction for employees who pay for the majority of their health \ninsurance costs, we will now reach more than a million of the uninsured \nand help them get the coverage they need and deserve.\n  Second is a repeal of the Clinton-Gore installment limitation, which \nhas been an unforeseen barrier to small businesses looking to sell all \nor part of their business assets, in many cases to fund the small \nbusiness owner's retirement.\n  Third, a clear safe harbor for small businesses to use the cash \nmethod of accounting. This has been a real nightmare for the smallest \nbusinesses, to have to come up with accrual accounting. They are in \nbusiness to make widgets or sell hamburgers, not to be accounting \nspecialists who have to come up with an accrual system. Now small \nbusinesses with gross receipts under $2.5 million can continue to use \ncash accounting. It also lets the IRS know that it can stop its \ncampaign to force small businesses into using the more burdensome \naccrual accounting rules.\n  We will increase expensing of equipment up to $35,000 per year, which \nwill reduce compliance costs by allowing small firms to deduct \npurchases rather than setting up elaborate depreciation schedules to \nfigure out how to deduct them over many years.\n  Something we are proud of, particularly in the Ninth Congressional \nDistrict in Missouri, which is represented by my colleague on the House \nside, who has been a champion of this measure, and my Senate colleague \nto the north, Senator Grassley, is the new farmer, fisherman, and ranch \nrisk management accounts --the FFARRM accounts--which permit farmers, \nfishermen, and ranchers to make tax-deductible contributions of up to \n20 percent of the income in good years for use during subsequent \neconomic declines. The bill\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\nalso provides important alternative minimum tax--or AMT--relief for \nfarmers who use income averaging, and it extends the work opportunity \ntax credit through June 30, 2004.\n  The fourth component of the tax package is the Community Renewal and \nNew Markets Act of 2000, which is intended to reinvigorate our \ndistressed communities. This portion of the legislation includes the \nHouse-Administration compromise on empowerment zones/renewal \ncommunities and new markets tax credit, which creates 40 renewal \ncommunities and 9 empowerment zones.\n  This certainly was not my recommended legislation, but this was part \nof the bipartisan compromise we reached with the President and \nincorporated it in the bill. These renewal communities would have a \nzero capital gains rate, and the legislation creates a new-markets tax \ncredit for equity investments in qualified low-income communities. The \ngoal of this program is to bring the innovation and creativity of \nAmerica's businesses--and especially small businesses--into these \nrenewal communities to make real economic change for the future.\n  The legislation also increases the low-income housing tax credit and \nprivate-activity-bonds volume caps, which are key financing features \nfor renewal communities. They included provisions to help clean up \nbrownfields by allowing expensing of brownfield cleanup costs, except \nSuperfund sites, through 2003. That is good for communities and for the \nenvironment.\n\n  These four core components of the tax package provide important tax \nrelief for Americans throughout our economy.\n  The legislation also addresses several other priorities, such as the \nschool construction bond provision which I have already mentioned. This \nis another avenue to address construction and modernization needs \nwithout a Federal stranglehold. It is my belief that local school \ndistricts know best how to address their needs. While providing them \nthis assistance, it keeps the Federal camel's nose out from under the \ntent.\n  The adoption tax credit, which is very important and has been \naddressed previously on the floor, is to encourage loving families to \nadopt children. It also makes other strides toward improving and \nreforming our Tax Code as which we are going to have to rely. The White \nHouse leadership, next year, I believe will complete that work.\n  Medicare. This legislative package addresses the problems caused by \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as implemented with the chronic \nincompetence of the Health Care Financing Administration. I have heard \ntime and time again health care providers talk about what is happening \nto them under the BBA. When you ask the questions, you find out it is \nhow HCFA has implemented the BBA. They have used the BBA to cut far \nmore than Congress ever mandated.\n  What they seem to want to do is to cut out choice for patients--cut \nout the choice they have of going into a Medicare insurance plan such \nas we have or an HMO plan as is available to FEHBP members; it puts out \ntheir choices to use home health care.\n  HCFA has gone about doing everything in its power to collapse the \npresent system. I guess--and I can only surmise --that they would like \nto see the kind of health care plan that was so infamously run up the \nflagpole in 1993 without getting any salutes.\n  I remember hanging around here in August of 1993 as they talked about \nMrs. Clinton's health care plan and kept waiting for somebody to try to \nintroduce it and get a vote on it. But as we looked at that June bug \nlonger and longer, as people got to look at it more and more, the \nminimum amount of enthusiasm I saw initially grew even less. But HCFA \nhas never given up. By killing off parts of our health care system one \nat a time, they hope maybe we can have a totally Government-run health \ncare system.\n  The Vice President on the campaign trail has said he hopes to be able \nto go to a European system within a few years. Well, if you let HCFA in \ncontrol long enough to kill the existing health care system, there may \nnot be anything left.\n  This Medicare bill, just very briefly, provides benefits to patients \nand providers worth $32 billion, benefits for nearly 40 million \nAmericans relying on Medicare. Glaucoma screening, colonoscopy \nscreening, mammography, nutrition therapy services for some patients, \nadditional coverage of immunosuppressive drugs --all have been added to \nthe Medicare program. Help for just about every type of Medicare \nprovider to allow them to continue to provide high-quality care to \nseniors and the disabled. Hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, home \nhealth care, nursing homes, hospice providers, and Medicare HMOs \nthat have been driven out of the field by cuts, and targeted help for \nparticular health care providers that are most in need. As one who \nlives in a rural community, the bill targets $1.7 billion for rural \nhealth care providers to help them deal with the unique challenges of \nrural health care, which I think is very important.\n\n  More than $6 billion to Medicare HMOs will help address the \nwidespread withdrawals from the Medicare program we have seen in the \nlast couple of years.\n  Why have HMOs been leaching Medicare? Not because they are evil \nincarnate, as some would have us believe. If that were the case, the \nseniors losing their HMO coverage would not be so upset. No, these \nproviders left because the payment system for HMOs is seriously flawed \nand in many areas has provided inadequate reimbursement. This new \nfunding will address this issue.\n  Approximately $1.5 billion in assistance to home health care \nproviders. Home health care patients have, by far, borne the greatest \nbrunt of HCFA's maladministration of the BBA. They were supposed to \nsave $16 billion over 5 years, and they are on the path to save $55 \nbillion to $60 billion by eliminating too much of home health care and \nmaking it unavailable. It has been devastating. Tens of thousands of \nseniors previously receiving home health care lost it during the crisis \nof the last few years. The bill postpones for 1 additional year the \npotentially devastating 15 percent cuts which are addressed in this \nlegislation. They would be the death knell of home health care.\n  Next year, we need to get rid of that completely. We need to get a \nbrand new Medicare system, such as the bipartisan deal that was worked \nout in the Breaux-Frist commission before the White House pulled the \nplug on it.\n  Finally, this bill helps community health centers, the clinics that \nexist in more than 3,000 urban and rural medically underserved areas \nnationwide, ensuring that they continue to receive adequate \nreimbursement from the State Medicaid programs so they can pursue their \nmission of providing care to those Americans who would otherwise not \nget any.\n  There is a long list of more than 40 organizations, led by the \nAmerican Hospital Association, supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from the AHA to Chairman \nBill Thomas on the House side listing the letters of support for the \nprovisions printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, overall I believe this is an excellent \npackage that is badly needed by seniors, the disabled, hospitals, \nnursing homes, and other providers.\n  Finally, we have already had a lot of discussion about the Pain \nRelief Promotion Act. Obviously it is controversial. The bill simply \namends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the use of federally \nregulated drugs to help his or her life.\n  Let me be clear about that. Simply put, this would prevent any effort \nto assist in a suicide by using controlled substances such as powerful \npain killers. The bill goes further in its efforts to provide \nappropriate relief to people suffering great pain. It provides a \nvariety of provisions and educational programs to encourage appropriate \npain relief. Indeed, under this legislation for the first time ever the \nControlled Substances Act would explicitly recognize that aggressive \npain relief is an appropriate and fully warranted use of controlled \nsubstances.\n  I believe a vast majority of Americans share a simple belief--that I \nhold very strongly--that doctors we rely on to nurture and extend our \nlives should not be party to efforts actively to promote someone's \ndeath. The bill simply recognizes that consensus.\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n  It looks like we are going to have lots of discussion and have an \nopportunity to hear many different views on this legislation. But \nbefore we paint it as the most ugly duckling coming down the path, I \nthought my colleagues and those who may be watching or listening still \nat this late hour would like to know that there are some beautiful \nlimbs and beautiful facets of this that are very important bipartisan \nmeasures.\n  I hope we can pass this because there are many priorities that the \nPresident has asked for, that leaders on the Democratic side have asked \nfor, and I believe our side wishes as well that are beneficial to a \ngreat number of American people who are waiting for our response.\n  I thank the Chair. I apologize to my colleague from Nevada whom I \nmisled into thinking that it was going to be a short set of remarks.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             AHA, Advancing Health in America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Bill Thomas,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, House Ways and Means \n         Committee, Washington DC.\n       Dear Representative Thomas: On behalf of the 5,000 members \n     of the American Hospital Association (AHA), I am writing to \n     express our views regarding the ``Beneficiary Improvement and \n     Protection Act of 2000'' (BIPA). We believe this legislation \n     will take another step forward in addressing the unintended \n     consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). \n     Consequently, as we approach the remaining hours of the \n     congressional session, we are urging Members to vote in favor \n     of this legislation, and have recommended that the President \n     not veto the legislation.\n       As we understand the provisions of the legislation, it \n     includes a number of provisions that provide much needed \n     relief to hospitals and health systems throughout the \n     country. Such provisions include: a full market basket \n     inflationary update in FY2001, and elimination of half of the \n     reduction in FY2002; temporary elimination of the reductions \n     in Medicaid DSH state allocations in FY 2001 and 2002, and \n     allow the program to grow with inflation in those years; \n     increase the adjustment for Indirect Medical Education to \n     6.5% in 2001 and 6.375% in FY 2002, and establish an 85% \n     national floor for direct Graduate Medical Education \n     payments; equalize payments to rural hospitals under Medicare \n     DSH; increased flexibility for critical access, sole \n     community, and Medicare dependent hospitals; increased bad \n     debt payments from 55% to 70% for all beneficiaries; and a \n     full market basket update for outpatient hospital services.\n       The bill will also provide relief to home health agencies \n     and skilled nursing facilities. As our members operate \n     approximately one-third of the home health agencies and one \n     fourth of the skilled nursing facilities, relief in this area \n     is also vitally necessary, and is an important feature in the \n     bill. In addition, the bill includes important beneficiary \n     protections, particularly the execrated reduction in \n     beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services.\n       At the same time, we are disappointed that certain \n     provisions we have advocated, such a full market basket \n     increase in FY2002 for both inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services, complete elimination of the impact of the BBA's \n     reductions in Medicaid DSH, and maintaining the IME \n     adjustment of 6.5% beyond FY 2001, were not included. We are \n     also concerned that additional reductions in the hospital \n     inpatient market basket in 2003 were included in the bill. We \n     look forward to working with you in the next congress to \n     achieve these additional changes.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts to achieve additional BBA \n     relief this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n\nmedicare, medicaid & schip improvements act of 2000--letters of support\n\n       Federation of American Hospitals,\n       National Association of Community Health Centers,\n       American Medical Rehabilitation Providers Association,\n       HealthSouth,\n       National Association of Long Term Hospitals,\n       Acute Long Term Hospital Association,\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals,\n       Kennedy Krieger Institute,\n       National Association of Rural Health Clinics,\n       National Association of Urban Critical Access Hospitals,\n       American Medical Group Associates,\n       Mississippi Hospital Association,\n       Tennessee Hospital Association,\n       The University of Texas System,\n       National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems,\n       Healthcare Leadership Council,\n       National Association for Home Care,\n       American Association for Homecare,\n       American Federation of HomeCare Providers,\n       Alliance for Quality Nursing Home Care,\n       American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging,\n       Visiting Nurses Associations of America,\n       National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization,\n       National PACE Association,\n       Association of Ohio Philanthropic Homes, Housing and \n     Services for the Aging,\n       John Hopkins Home Care Group,\n       Patient Access to Transplantation Coalition,\n       LifeCare Management Services,\n       American Cancer Society,\n       Alliance to Save Cancer Care Access,\n       Intercultural Cancer Center,\n       The Susan G.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri did not mislead \nme. He never has. The fact is, he didn't contemplate our leader coming \nforward and saying a number of things that the Senator felt deserved a \nresponse. I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Missouri, even though \nI may not have agreed.\n  Mr. President, first of all, just a couple of comments on what my \nfriend from Missouri just said.\n  With the pension provision in the bill--now some $64 billion--it is \ntrue there was some action taken in the Finance Committee. But not a \nsingle second was spent on this floor dealing with the $64 billion \nprovision which is jammed into this bill.\n  On the budget amendment, $80 billion--nothing in finance. In fact, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee said he would allow a vote in the \nFinance Committee if all the Members promised not to bring up \nprescription drugs in any way, or Patients' Bill of Rights. The \nminority would not agree to that. It seems totally reasonable in the \nFinance Committee that this is something that should have been brought \nup. As a result of the chairman's action, the matter was not brought \nbefore the Finance Committee. And again this $80 billion matter \nreceived no floor consideration.\n  New markets initiative: $25 billion--nothing in the Finance \nCommittee; no action taken on the floor.\n  Keep in mind that I have gone over just a few things; in fact, three. \nWe are already up to about $200 billion, and not a single minute spent \non the Senate floor with $200 billion of the taxpayers' money. That \ndoesn't take into consideration foreign sales. That is $4.5 billion. \nThe Finance Committee spent a little time on that; nothing on the \nfloor. Why? Because the outlandish proposition was made that if this \ncame to the floor, someone was going to offer an amendment. Pardon me. \nBut isn't that what the Senate is all about? People have a right to \noffer amendments to pieces of legislation. But because there was this \nterrible threat that on a piece of legislation a Senator will offer an \namendment, we have no floor action on it; again, $4.5 billion.\n  I also say there is going to be plenty of debate tomorrow on a number \nof these issues. But on this bill itself, there has been no conference \nand no Democratic involvement at all in bringing this bill to the point \nwhere it is. The Democrats were not even allowed to see the document \nuntil it came here.\n  These are members of the Finance Committee. One of the most \nbipartisan and, I would say, nonpartisan people I have ever worked with \nis the senior Senator from Louisiana, John Breaux, a senior Member of \nthe Finance Committee. He was not allowed to look at any of the papers. \nHe was not happy about that.\n  Today the bill was dumped in our lap.\n  I would also say about the assisted suicide that there will be lots \nof debate on it tomorrow. The Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, feels \nvery strongly about this, as he should. Why? It doesn't matter how you \nfeel on this\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nissue. The fact is that the voters in the State of Oregon said we feel \nthis way on assisted suicide. As a result of the people of Oregon \npassing a law in the State of Oregon, we now have this action.\n  It seems to me those who keep talking about States rights should \nleave a State alone. People of the State of Oregon voted a certain way. \nIf you disagree with what the people of the State of Oregon did in \nvoting in favor of assisted suicide, then let's at least have the \nability on the Senate floor to debate the issue which we have been \nprevented from doing.\n  My friend from Missouri, for whom I have the greatest respect, talked \nabout health care.\n  They always throw in the 1993 Clinton health care plan. Let's bring \nthis down to reality so people really understand what this is all \nabout.\n  When the health care debate started, 80 percent of the people of \nAmerica favored reforming the health care system. But then comes \nHalloween and the masquerade by the health insurance industry. They \nspent over $100 million trying to abuse and frighten the American \npeople. They succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. They were \nprobably even surprised on how they succeeded in frightening the people \nof America with their Harry and Louise ads and with their clever \nmanipulations.\n\n  As a result of that, we got no health care reform because after they \ndid their television and radio advertising, 80 percent of the people in \nAmerica didn't want health care reform. They were frightened. They were \nconfused.\n  That doesn't take away from the fact that we now have 45 million \npeople with no health insurance. It doesn't take away from the fact \nthat we have many people who have insurance that gives them minimum and \ninadequate rights. That is why we tried to pass the Patients' Bill of \nRights--to give patients certain rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11111-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11111-S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE NOVEMBER ELECTION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Missouri not so subtly \nindicated that he thinks there is going to be a new world out there \nafter the November 7 election. I think he is going to be very \ndisappointed. He is going to be disappointed because the American \npeople understand the record of George W. Bush better each day.\n  For example, the prescription of George W. Bush for health care, I \nthink, is bad medicine for America. Why? Because the State of Texas and \nGeorge Bush have the worst record in the nation on health insurance \ncoverage. That says a lot. But he has won that award; just like Houston \nis the most polluted city in America. He won that award. He also wins \nthe award for the worse health coverage in America. Texas has fallen to \nlast among all States in overall health insurance coverage. Texas ranks \nsecond to last in health insurance coverage for children, and the \npercentage of children without coverage has gone up under the Governor.\n  While nationwide Medicaid enrollment has increased, Medicaid \nenrollment in Texas has declined.\n  George W. Bush retains roadblocks to eligible populations in health \nprograms. Even a judge found Texas guilty of not providing 1.5 million \nchildren with adequate health care. This was August of this year. The \njustice said the State failed not only the 1.5 million children but \n13,000 abused and neglected children. Rather than taking corrective \naction, the State decided to appeal the court's ruling over the \nobjection of State legislators.\n  Texas legislators blame Bush for Texas' poor health insurance \ncoverage.\n  In a letter to the Vice President from Texas State \nrepresentatives, the Governor prioritized oil breaks over children's \nhealth insurance in 1999. In 1999, after Bush deemed a $45 million oil \nindustry tax break an emergency and made it the first signed bill of \nthe session, Democratic legislators questioned his priorities in \nputting the legislation before expanding the CHIP program, or children \nhealth insurance programs. ``It's about priorities,'' Democratic \nrepresentative Dale Tillery said. ``I know a whole lot of uninsured \nchildren, but I don't know a whole lot of poor oilmen.''\n\n  I could go into more detail about Governor Bush's record on health \ncare but this gives us a general idea.\n  The American public is beginning to find out more about George W. \nBush. Yesterday, the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit organization that \nhelps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis, \nan independent, fair, nonpartisan corporation, said that claims \nGovernor Bush has been making about education in Texas and how well \nthey are doing is without foundation, not factual. In fact, the only \nway that Governor Bush is able to take any credit for it is that tests \nare skewed in Texas. The Rand Corporation said if you use Texas math in \nany State, the education scores all over America would be magnified.\n  The fact is, the State of Texas is doing worse that most States. What \nGovernor Bush is claiming about education is simply without foundation.\n  In addition to the independent Rand Corporation, another independent \nnonpartisan body, the American Academy of Actuaries, reported today \nthat Governor Bush's proposed tax cut will basically bankrupt the \ncountry. The American Academy of Actuaries report finds that George W. \nBush's $3 trillion tax cut, combined with his plan to divert money from \nthe Social Security trust fund into individual stock market accounts, \nwould make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held \nnational debt. In fact, one of the people from the American Academy of \nActuaries who worked on this report said: I don't see any way they pay \noff the public debt. Given Bush's large package of tax cuts, the budget \nwill go negative quickly. There won't be a surplus anymore.\n  This is not a partisan report. It has been produced by one of the \nmost widely respected organizations in America. The American Academy of \nActuaries is part of a growing chorus of voices which have discredited \nGovernor Bush's plan to privatize this Nation's most successful Federal \nprogram in our history, Social Security. In August, the Century \nFoundation also concluded that Governor Bush was making a promise to \nseniors and to young people that he couldn't keep with his Social \nSecurity privatization scheme. You can't do it for both.\n  This study, which was written by the respected economist Henry J. \nAaron and former Federal Reserve Board member Alan Blinder, found that \ndiverting just 2 percentage points of the Social Security payroll tax \ninto private accounts would result in a reduction of benefits by as \nmuch as 54 percent and higher payroll taxes to keep the Social Security \ntrust fund solvent.\n  In addition, Larry Summers, the Secretary of the Treasury, who is \nalso a trustee of the Social Security system, and therefore has a \nfiduciary relationship to make sure the system remains solvent, said if \njust 2 percent of the payroll tax is diverted from the Social Security \nrevenue stream, the Social Security trust fund will lack the resources \nto pay benefits by the time someone who is now 40 retires.\n  By today's report, the most damning indictment of the Bush plan to \ndate is this report from the actuary group, the first independent \nreport finding that the Federal budget surplus, a result of hard \nchoices we have made in this country, would be eliminated by Governor \nBush's shaky retirement scheme. To add insult to injury, not only would \nwe return to the bad old days of deficits as far as the eye could see, \nwe would devastate the most popular social program in the Nation's \nhistory, a program which has virtually eliminated the poverty rate \namong the elderly, provides critical benefits to disabled Americans, \nand supports widows, many of whom have little or no retirement \nsecurity.\n\n  Let's review what is at stake in this privatization scheme. We have \nturned a record deficit of $400 billion, counting the Social Security \nsurplus we used to use to hide the deficit, in 1992, to a record \nsurplus this year of $260 billion. We have paid down more than $450 \nbillion in debt. We sparked the longest expansion in economic history, \n22 million new jobs, the fastest and longest real wage growth in three \ndecades, the lowest unemployment in three decades, the highest home \nownership in two decades, and the largest 5-year drop in childhood \npoverty since the 1960s.\n  I was on a debate a week ago last Sunday and two Republican \ncolleagues who I had the pleasure of discussing the issues with started \nsaying it is because the Gingrich Congress that we\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\nwere able to get this House in order. I said: You must have been \ntalking to Frank Luntz who is the pollster who always tells you guys \nwhat to say. I didn't know, but as I was speaking, he was in the room. \nHe had been there discussing with these two Members of Congress what \nthey should say.\n  We should state the facts. The 1993 Clinton Budget Deficit Reduction \nAct passed this body without a single Republican vote, passed the House \nof Representatives without a single Republican vote; the tie was broken \nby Vice President Gore, setting this Nation on a road to economic \nrecovery. That is what happened. There were all kinds of prophecies of \ndoom. I read them in the Record earlier today. That didn't come to be. \nThis legislation has put this country where it should be.\n  There is a real chance we could throw all this away with Governor \nBush's $3 trillion tax cut and his dangerous Social Security \nprivatization plan. For a month, the Vice President has been saying \nthat Bush's plan would hurt Social Security and bring us record \ndeficits. Governor Bush called that fuzzy math. Now the Nation's best \nmathematicians have found that the public's economic plans and Social \nSecurity plans could do just that--bankrupt this Nation and Social \nSecurity.\n  This report validates everything that the minority has been saying \nover here. It tells us that George W. Bush's plan would make Social \nSecurity financially unstable during the lifetime of today's seniors. \nIt shows Governor Bush outspending Al Gore, and Al Gore as the \ncandidate of fiscal responsibility. By comparison, Vice President Gore \nand congressional Democrats want to preserve Social Security's \nfundamental guarantee to America's seniors. We can do that by \ndedicating all of the Social Security surplus to that program.\n  Of course we have to take care of debt reduction. Our plan reduces \npublicly held debt and would strengthen Social Security by using long-\nterm interest savings to keep the system solvent.\n  We talked about tax cuts. But the most important tax cut the American \npeople would ever receive is to reduce the long-held debt this country \nhas. If we reduce that debt, it will save this country $250 to $300 \nbillion a year according to where the interest rate is paid. That is \nwhere every American, no matter if they are rich or poor, will get a \ntax savings because everything they buy will be cheaper.\n  The Vice President also proposes to end the motherhood penalty by \ngiving parents a credit toward Social Security for up to 5 years spent \nraising their children. The widow benefit would be increased. He is \nproposing retirement savings plus, which is not a privatization scheme \nbut would allow Americans to create individual retirement accounts that \nwould supplement their Social Security and help them reap historic \nlong-term gains in the stock market.\n  Yesterday, I came to this floor, approximately 24 hours ago. I talked \nabout this campaign being a campaign, we would hope, of ideas, of \npolicy views, of a vision for what the country should be. Not the \nability to operate a 7-Eleven store but to operate the greatest country \nin the history of the world, the only superpower left in the world.\n  Having said that, I am going to again give some direct quotes and \nthese are all brand new. I did not talk about them last night. I am, \ntonight, going to again read verbatim quotes that have been made by a \nperson, Governor Bush, who wants to be President of the United States. \nHere is what he said.\n  Interview with the New York Times, March 15, 2000:\n\n       People make suggestions on what to say all the time. I'll \n     give you an example; I don't read what's handed to me. People \n     say, ``Here, here's your speech, or here's an idea for a \n     speech.'' They're changed. Trust me.\n\n  Interview with the Associated Press, March 8, 2000:\n\n       It's evolutionary, going from governor to president, and \n     this is a significant step, to be able to vote for yourself \n     on the ballot, and I'll be able to do so next fall, I hope.\n\n  Next direct quote:\n\n       It is not Reaganesque to support a tax plan that is Clinton \n     in nature.\n\n  February 23, 2000, USA Today:\n\n       I don't have to accept their tenants. I was trying to \n     convince those college students to accept my tenants. And I \n     reject any labeling me because I happened to go to the \n     university.\n\n  New York Daily News, February 19, this year:\n\n       I understand small business growth. I was one.\n\n  Florence, SC, February 17, 2000:\n\n       The Senator has got to understand if he's going to have--he \n     can't have it both ways. He can't take the high horse and \n     then claim the low road.\n\n  To Cokie Roberts, February 20, 2000:\n\n       Really proud of it. A great campaign. And I'm really \n     pleased with the organization and the thousands of South \n     Carolinians that worked on my behalf. I'm very gracious and \n     humbled.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I am very gracious and humbled.\n\n  Newsweek, February 28, 2000:\n\n       I don't want to win? If that were the case why the heck am \n     I on the bus 16 hours a day, shaking thousands of hands, \n     giving hundreds of speeches, getting pillared in the press \n     and cartoons and still staying on message to win?\n\n  Same interview:\n\n       I thought how proud I am to be standing up beside my dad. \n     Never did it occur to me that he would become the gist for \n     cartoonists.\n\n  Hilton Head, SC:\n\n       If you are sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and \n     polls and principles, come and join this campaign.\n\n  That was on February 16, 2000. Again, that same day, those in \nBeaufort, SC:\n\n       How do you know if you don't measure if you have a system \n     that simply suckles kids through?\n\n  Here, in Beaufort he was explaining the need for educational \naccountability.\n  In a South Carolina debate, February 15:\n\n       We ought to make the pie higher.\n\n  ``Meet The Press,'' February 13:\n\n       I do not agree with this notion that somehow if I go to try \n     to attract votes and to lead people toward a better \n     tomorrow somehow I get subscribed to some--some doctrine \n     gets subscribed to me.\n\n  ``Meet The Press,'' February 13, 2000:\n\n       I've changed my style somewhat, as you know. I'm less--I \n     pontificate less, although it may be hard to tell it from \n     this show. And I'm more interacting with people.\n\n  Nashua, NH, February 1, New York Times:\n\n       I think we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth to the \n     middle class, I think we should knock down the tollbooth.\n\n  San Antonio Express-News, January 30:\n\n       The most important job is not to be governor, or first lady \n     in my case.\n\n  January 29, 2000:\n\n       Will the highways on the Internet become more few?\n\n  Concord, NH:\n  Los Angeles Times, January 28:\n\n       This is Preservation Month. I appreciate preservation. It's \n     what you do when you run for president. You gotta preserve.\n\n  Chamber of Commerce in Nashua, NH, January 27:\n\n       I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.\n\n  Quoted by Molly Ivins, this is from the San Francisco Chronical, \nJanuary 21:\n\n       What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas, \n     quotas they basically delineate based upon whatever. However \n     they delineate, quotas, I think vulcanize society.

Mr. President, I wish to take some time this evening \nto discuss an issue on which I held a hearing, along with Senator \nGordon Smith, yesterday. It concerns something that is very troubling: \nThe arming of Iran, which occurred recently, and concerns an agreement \nthat was made by Vice President Al Gore with then-Prime Minister of \nRussia Viktor Chernomyrdin on allowing Russia to convey armaments to \nIran and avoid U.S. sanctions law.\n  I do not want to discuss so much that part of the issue, although it \nis an important part of it, but I want to get to the issue of an \nagreement made between the Vice President and then-Prime Minister of \nRussia Viktor Chernomyrdin to allow the conveyance of this equipment, \nmilitary hardware--we are talking submarines, tanks, attack \nhelicopters, a lot of equipment.\n  It was stated by the Vice President in this agreement--and we found \nthis out when it was leaked to the press 14 days ago, in the New York \nTimes--that we will not sanction Russia for allowing this to take \nplace.\n  I asked the administration in the hearing I held yesterday and I \nasked by letter today signed by a number of my colleagues: Let us see \nthe agreement the Vice President entered into with Viktor Chernomyrdin. \nTo date, the administration has refused to convey that document to us. \nWe held a closed session yesterday. We said: Convey it to us in closed \nsession. They refused.\n  This afternoon, a group of Senators and myself sent a letter to the \nSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright, restating our position that the \nadministration should share with the Congress the documents relating to \nthe Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement which allowed Russia to sell \nconventional weaponry to Iran and not be sanctioned under U.S. law.\n  If we have not received the documents by noon on Monday, the Foreign \nRelations Committee will be forced to issue--and pursue issuing--a \nsubpoena to receive those documents from the administration.\n  This letter was signed by Senator Gordon Smith; myself, who chaired \nthe hearing yesterday; along with Chairman McCain of the Commerce \nCommittee; Senator Lugar; Chairman Shelby of the Intelligence \nCommittee; Chairman Warner of the Armed Services Committee; Chairman \nThompson of the Governmental Affairs Committee; and Senators Nickles \nand Lott of leadership.\n  In it we express our disappointment with the administration's \ncontinued stonewalling and refusal to provide documents related to the \nGore-Chernomyrdin agreement. They refused to even allow us to see \ndocuments which have been published in the press, which is how we \nlearned about them. These were published in the New York Times. That is \nhow we learned about this taking place.\n  Essentially, now, the administration is asking us to trust them. But \nthe fact that almost everything we have learned about this secret deal \nhas come from the New York Times and the Washington Times--and not the \nadministration--makes such trust difficult.\n  Congress has the right and the responsibility to review all the \nrelevant documents and to judge for itself whether the transfers the \nVice President signed off on were covered by U.S. nonproliferation \nlaws.\n  Unfortunately, until the New York Times broke the story 14 days ago, \nCongress had not seen this written, signed agreement between the Vice \nPresident and the Russian Prime Minister. In open session hearing \nyesterday, I asked them to deny this, that this had been conveyed to \nthe Congress. What we heard was that the administration had \n``telegraphed'' the contents of the agreement, that they had \n``briefed'' but they were unable to say that they had transmitted this \ndocument to the Congress, as they were required to do.\n  In essence, they said to us: Look, we were telling you that the Vice \nPresident was meeting with Mr.\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\nChernomyrdin. We told you that they were discussing a number of issues. \nThat should be good enough.\n  Well, it isn't. Now we are saying to the administration: Show us the \ndocuments that have now been--some of them have been leaked to the \npress. Tell us what the agreement was. Because we want to determine \nwhether or not laws were violated.\n  To date, they have continued to stonewall and to refuse to provide \nthe documents to us. We provided, as I stated, a closed session for \nthem to provide it to us in case there were national security concerns. \nThey refused to do so.\n  The decision to allow Russia to escape the consequences of providing \nIran with conventional weapons is one which affects not only the \nsecurity of the American military personnel in the gulf but also the \nsecurity of our allies in the region. This is not the type of agreement \nwhich should have been kept from the American people, and it certainly \nis not something that Members of Congress should have learned about \nfirst in the press.\n  The Vice President is saying this deal with Russia slowed down and \nprevented more weapons transfers from Russia to Iran. The fact is that \nthe Russians did not keep their side of the bargain.\n  I have held a number of hearings on Russian arms transfers to Iran \nover the last 4 years. As a matter of fact, I held six hearings on the \ntopic of Iran's weaponry buildup. At each of these hearings we have \nseen and have had experts cite the level and the amount of weaponry \nthat has been transferred from Russia to Iran. At almost all these \nhearings--as a matter of fact, I think all of them--we had an \nadministration witness there. We said to them: Stop this flow of \nweaponry from Russia to Iran. We are going to face this weaponry or our \nallies in the region are going to face this weaponry.\n\n  At each of these hearings the administration would say: Yes, it is \nterrible that Russia is conveying this weaponry to Iran. We are trying \nto stop it. Then I would ask: Are you sanctioning Russia for doing \nthis? They would say: Well, no, we are not doing this. We are not sure \nit rises to that level. We are not sure we should do this. And all \nalong, there was this secret agreement in the background that they had \nagreed to--the Vice President had--that they would not sanction Russia. \nAnd they did not disclose that at any of these hearings nor even allude \nto the fact that that existed. Until we found out about it 14 days ago \nin the New York Times, I did not know this existed.\n  This should have been conveyed to the Congress. We should have been \nbrought in so we could appraise whether or not these sanctions should \nhave happened with this level of weaponry that has been flowing from \nRussia to Iran.\n  I have a compilation now, from open sources, of some of the weapons \nthat have been transferred. These are all weapons which pose a direct \nthreat to our forces in the gulf as well as to our allies. This is a \nlist gleaned from various press sources and other open sources. And we \ndo not have the list of the weapons the administration agreed to let \nRussia supply to Iran.\n  Yes, the press is reporting there was an annex to the Gore-\nChernomyrdin agreement that listed the level of weaponry, the amount of \nweapons that could be conveyed from Russia to Iran, and that this would \nnot be sanctioned. We need to see that annex. We need to see what was \nagreed to be allowed to be conveyed. We know some of what has been \nconveyed because of open sources in the press. We do not know what was \nin the agreement between Vice President Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin. So \nthe Congress is continuing to be left in the dark about what laws, if \nany, have been broken.\n  The administration claims that the weaponry is not destabilizing and \ntherefore not subject to sanctions anyway. When you look at the list, \nthe public list, I submit that any and all of these weapons pose a \ndirect threat to our soldiers and sailors in this region. They include \nsubmarines. They include attack helicopters. They include attack \naircraft, mines, and torpedoes. I think that would be and is \ndestabilizing in the region. It is destabilizing. It is clear that this \nso-called deal did not stop these transfers from occurring.\n  The main problem here, that I am complaining about this evening, is \nnot the weaponry, although I think that is a terrible problem and one \nwe are going to have to face. It is going to be very problematic for us \nand our allies to face in the future. The main problem is we are not \nbeing given the opportunity to look at these documents--the agreement--\nourselves, to determine the legality of this deal and whether or not it \nfalls into the categories of an agreement that should have been \ntransmitted to Congress by law, and then whether, in fact, this deal \nallowed Russia to circumvent the law.\n  By stonewalling on providing us with the material to allow us to see \ntheir side of this issue, the administration is raising even more \nquestions than were raised by the initial New York Times article. Why \nare they refusing to provide these documents? Is there something they \nare hiding? Provide it to us in closed session. Yet they have continued \nto refuse to do that.\n  The administration has an obligation to submit these agreements to \nthe Congress. They never revealed there was a written and signed \nagreement which binds both sides and binds the United States into \nskirting U.S. laws.\n  Now, a couple of laws I think are in play here, whether or not they \nhave been violated. We have not heard from the administration about \nthese. They say they have not, overall, been violated. But the Gore-\nMcCain Act is one, I believe--as we look at it and study it, if we are \nable to get the information--that was probably violated. Allowing Iran \nto have this sort of weaponry is one that would violate this law.\n  Mr. President, I want to go through a series of charts here to maybe \nput down clearly what has taken place to date.\n  Fourteen days ago, there was an article that appeared in the New York \nTimes. I am summarizing here about what took place. Fourteen days ago, \nan article appeared in the New York Times stating that a secret \nagreement had been reached between Vice President Gore and then-Russian \nPrime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin allowing Russia to avoid sanctions \nrequired under U.S. weapons proliferation laws for selling arms to \nIran. This is what was in the newspaper, signed by Al Gore and Viktor \nChernomyrdin. There is attached to this--we have not seen it, but it \nhas been reported--an annex listing weaponry that can be conveyed.\n  They are saying here: In light of the undertakings contained in this \njoint statement--in the aide-memoire--the United States is prepared to \ntake appropriate steps to avoid any penalties to Russia that might \notherwise arise under domestic law with respect to the completion of \nthe transfers disclosed in the annex for so long as the Russian \nFederation acts in accordance with these commitments.\n  So here is the Vice President of the United States signing an \nagreement with Mr. Chernomyrdin saying we are going to not enforce U.S. \ndomestic law on these transfers.\n  Now my question to you, to all of the people, and to the \nadministration, is: Does the Vice President have this authority to \nwaive these sanctions? No, he does not have the authority to waive \nthese sanctions. Under the law, they have to issue the sanctions.\n  Now they can choose later to find a way out, to waive them \nafterwards, but they cannot just waive these sanctions. The Vice \nPresident does not have the authority to do this. He enters into an \nagreement saying: We will take appropriate steps to avoid any penalties \nto Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law with respect to \nthe completion of the transfers disclosed in the annex for so long as \nthe Russian Federation acts in accordance with these commitments.\n  I want to go to Secretary Albright's letter to Ivan Ivanov, the \nForeign Minister of Russia, about this aide memoire where she says:\n\n       Without the aide memoire which we just looked at--\n\n  This is the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement--\n\n     Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been \n     subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.\n\n  This is her letter to the Russian Foreign Minister, January 13 of \nthis year. The Secretary of State is saying, if we hadn't agreed in \nthis signed secret agreement that we would not sanction you, you would \nhave been subject to\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nsanctions. The Secretary of State is saying it. You would ``have been \nsubject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.''\n  This is the other part that was in the secret agreement with \nChernomyrdin, that ``we are prepared to take steps'' that I previously \nread. The administration itself is saying, look, we agreed with you not \nto sanction you, but if we hadn't agreed to it, you would have been \nsubject to U.S. sanctions law. Does the Vice President have the \nauthority to waive U.S. sanctions? He doesn't have that authority to do \nthis. Yet that is what he did.\n  I want to show you some of what we are talking about, the weaponry \nthat has been conveyed. This is one piece of equipment, Russian attack \nsubmarines for Iran, three Kilo-class attack submarines have been \nconveyed under this agreement. We have, as I mentioned, attack \nhelicopters, airplanes. The administration was saying, look, we are not \ngoing to sanction you because we have secretly agreed not to sanction \nyou.\n  I don't want to go on a long time about this. I just want to continue \nto raise this issue because I am deeply troubled about a couple of \nthings.\n  No. 1, for 4 years I have been holding hearings about conveyance of \nweaponry from Russia to Iran and pressing the administration, what are \nyou doing to stop this conveyance of weaponry from Russia to Iran, \nbecause our allies will face this equipment in the future. They wring \ntheir hands and say, it is terrible what is going on. And then nothing \nwould happen.\n  Now, 14 days ago, I found out the reason nothing is going to happen--\na secret agreement was agreed to that they weren't going to sanction \nRussia. They were going to let it go ahead and continue to happen. Now \nwe face heightened danger in the Persian Gulf. This equipment is there, \nand some of it is still being conveyed.\n  No. 2, we have asked the administration, show us the agreement. You \nshould have shown it to us when it took place so we could understand \nwhat this is. I believe there was a violation of the law then. We need \nto see these documents now. They say nothing illegal has taken place. \nOK, then, fine. Show us the documents.\n  A letter was sent today. We want to see the documents of this \nagreement. We don't want to continue to read about it in the newspaper. \nWe want to see the documents. Convey them to us; send it in a closed \nsession. If there is national security interests, we want to see these \ndocuments. That is what we are saying now.\n  What I am also saying is, what I have stated this evening, if we \ndon't have these by noon on Monday, we will seek a subpoena to receive \nthese documents and get them from the administration.\n  I think this is highly suspect, what has taken place by the \nadministration. We are only now finding out about it. We need to see \nwhat it was that the administration agreed to, what it is that is still \ntaking place between Russia and Iran, and why the United States is not \nstepping in to stop this.\n  I believe you will be hearing more about this unless the \nadministration comes forward and comes clean. I hope they do. I hope \nthey tell us: Here it is, and here is all of what we agreed to. Here is \nwhy we agreed to all of this. Here is why we think this is working, \nrather than it isn't.\n  But right now, all we have are secret deals that somehow are getting \nleaked out to the newspapers, and we don't even know what the agreement \nis. We don't know what it is. We deserve to know what that agreement \nis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11115-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, the Founding Fathers intended that the \nlegislative process work through strongly held policy differences to \nestablish the law of the land. They saw open dialogue as central to our \ndemocracy, and their vision has served the American people well for \nover 200 years. It is regrettable, therefore, when policy disagreements \ndegenerate into acts of retribution against individual public servants \nwhose only transgression is to execute the directives of the President \nthey serve.\n  That is exactly what happened recently when a provision was inserted \ninto the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill stripping the \nUSDA Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, Jim Lyons, \nof his authority to administer the Forest Service and the Natural \nResources Conservation Service until his term in office expires in \nJanuary 2000. This provision is not only unfair to Mr. Lyons, it \nundermines the separation of powers doctrine because it is designed \nsolely to intimidate administration officials who are faithful to the \npolicies of the President.\n  What has Mr. Lyons done, you might ask, to warrant such rebuke? The \nsimple answer is: he has done a difficult job conscientiously.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Lyons was confirmed as the Under Secretary for \nNatural Resources and Environment by the Senate in May of 1993. As \nUndersecretary, he administers two important agencies--the Forest \nService and the Natural Resources Conservation Service--that include \nnearly half the employees in the Department.\n  I have worked closely with Mr. Lyons over the past 8 years and \nrespect greatly his work ethic, his understanding of the issues within \nhis agencies' jurisdiction and his commitment to the public policy \nmaking process. We have had policy disagreements, but I have never had \nreason to question Mr. Lyons' dedication to his job or fitness to serve \nas Undersecretary.\n  Mr. Lyons has provided steady and clear leadership during his tenure \nat USDA, tackling many complex and controversial issues that have \nplagued the conservation and forestry communities for years. While many \nof these policy challenges defy easy solution, Jim Lyons never shirked \nhis responsibility to address them. Further, it has been his hallmark \nto solicit and discuss the views of all parties in a search of common \nground in the pursuit of Administration objectives. That approach was \nparticularly evident in the policy dispute that culminated in the \nAgriculture Appropriations rider relieving Mr. Lyons of line authority \nfor the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n  The Office of the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and \nEnvironment, NRE, has responsibility within USDA for working with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, on issues affecting clean water \nand air, agriculture, forestry and other environmental concerns. It was \nin this role that Mr. Lyons entered into negotiations with the EPA to \nreduce the impact of EPA's proposed Total Maximum Daily Load, TMDL, \nrule on agriculture and forestry, while helping to ensure our continued \nprogress in improving the quality of the waters of the United States.\n  After months of negotiation with the EPA, Mr. Lyons helped construct \na rule that would provide for measured progress in reducing non-point \nsource pollution through the use of voluntary, incentive-based programs \nadministered largely through the Natural Resources Conservation \nService. Many of the provisions objectionable to commodity groups and \nthe Farm Bureau were dropped from the final rule or significantly \nmodified. The provisions affecting silvicultural activities and \nforestry were dropped altogether.\n  In August, the President announced the final TMDL rules, and, in \nresponse to concerns expressed by Members of Congress, delayed their \nimplementation for one year. Nonetheless, some who were upset that EPA \nhad elected even to proceed with the rules decided to take their \nfrustration out on Mr. Lyons, charging that he had not done enough to \nfight this rulemaking. As a consequence, language was added to the \nHouse version of the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill \ndefunding Mr. Lyons' office.\n  At the urging of Senator Cochran and his colleagues on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, the House agreed to restore funding for the \nUndersecretary's office, but eliminate Mr. Lyons' authority to manage, \nsupervise or direct his agencies--the job he had sworn to do and for \nwhich this\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\nbody had confirmed him nearly 8 years ago. While policy differences \ncertainly are an important and accepted part of the legislative \nprocess, acts of retribution against individual public servants--which \nthis rider is--should not be tolerated.\n  Mr. Lyons does not deserve this treatment. During his USDA career, he \nhas faithfully pursued the President's policies, spearheading major \nreforms in the management of both the Forest Service and the Natural \nResources Conservation Service, NRCS, and helping to develop the Forest \nService's new natural resources agenda, which is focused on watershed \nprotection, recreation, road management reform and sustainable \nforestry.\n  Under Mr. Lyons' leadership, the Natural Resources Conservation \nService has assumed a leadership role for the Administration in \npromoting conservation of the nation's private lands and has taken on \nan expanded role in protecting clean water and fish and wildlife \nhabitats. Mr. Lyons has advocated establishing riparian buffers to \ncapture nutrient and pesticide runoff, promoted efforts to protect farm \nand forest lands threatened with development, and encouraged strategies \nto protect drinking water supplies at their source.\n  Mr. Lyons was also the principle architect of the President's \nNorthwest Forest Plan conserving old-growth forests and promoting \nsustainable forestry. He has initiated efforts to assess forest \necosystem health in the Columbia River Basin, the Sierra Nevada and the \nsouthern Appalachians. He directed key acquisitions and additions to \nthe National Forest System, and has overseen purchase of lands \nincluding New Mexico's Baca Ranch and the New World Mine near \nYellowstone National Park. He was instrumental in the establishment of \nthe Giant Sequoia National Monument.\n  Mr. Lyons continues to lead USDA efforts on the presidential \ninitiative to protect remaining national forest roadless areas. He \nhelped craft the President's report on this year's devastating \nwildfires and then worked to shape the emergency funding package that \nwill be used to restore fire-damaged forest lands and reduce the risks \nto communities from future wildfires. Mr. Lyons has promoted outdoor \nrecreation on the national forests and created new programs and \npartnerships to improve urban forestry and conservation activities.\n  In the Black Hills of South Dakota, Mr. Lyons worked with me to \nresolve differences between the timber industry and environmentalists \nthat allowed timber harvesting to proceed in a responsible and \nenvironmentally sensitive manner. This experience demonstrated Mr. \nLyons' ability to work with diverse interests in the pursuit of sound, \ncommon sense policies that reconcile multiple use objectives.\n  President Clinton's approach to the stewardship of our national \nresources is clear, and Mr. Lyons has been faithful to that vision. His \npublic record over the past eight years identify him as a leading \nconservationist and an effective agent of change, not only within the \nDepartment of Agriculture, but also within the Administration.\n  Mr. President, I regret that, as the end of the Clinton \nAdministration approaches, one of its longest serving subcabinet \nofficials has been targeted for retribution as a result of a \ndisagreement over policy. Personal attack should never become an \naccepted method for settling policy differences. I hope that the \npolitics of personal intimidation can be removed from our policy \ndebates.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print a recent New York Times \neditorial on this subject in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Pettiness on Capitol Hill\n\n       Marion Berry, a Democratic Representative from Arkansas, \n     has raised Congressional arrogance to a new level.\n       Gripped by ideological fury in June, Mr. Berry added a \n     provision to the agricultural spending bill stripping funds \n     from the office of James Lyons, an under secretary of \n     agriculture who oversees the Forest Service and the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service. Mr. Lyons' Republican critics \n     later modified the amendment so that it left the funding \n     intact but stripped him of his authority to run the agencies. \n     Either way, it was clear that Mr. Lyons had been singled out \n     for special abuse, and that Mr. Berry had started the \n     crusade.\n       What had Mr. Lyons done to deserve this? According to Mr. \n     Berry himself, the under secretary's main sin was to side \n     with the Environmental Protection Agency when it decided to \n     enforce a long-dormant provision of the Clean Water Act to \n     get a better grip on polluted runoff from so-called ``non-\n     point'' sources like farms, city streets and golf courses. \n     Mr. Lyons helped the E.P.A. establish a timetable that would \n     enable farmers to comply with the law on a reasonable \n     schedule. But he never challenged the agency's authority to \n     enforce the law, as some agricultural lobbyists had hoped he \n     would, nor was he, in Mr. Berry's view, sufficiently pro-\n     farmer in his negotiations.\n       A conservationist, Mr. Lyons has angered members of \n     Congress before, not least for his support of President \n     Clinton's plan to put millions of acres of the national \n     forests off-limits to new roads, as well as his efforts to \n     enlarge protections for Alaska's Tongass National Forest. But \n     nobody had gone so far as to undermine his job. The White \n     House, already worn out from its efforts to block anti-\n     environmental riders in other bills, is unlikely to fight \n     this one, in part because it will have no serious effect on \n     the two agencies or even on Mr. Lyons himself. The provision \n     expires Jan. 20, when Mr. Lyons will leave Washington to \n     teach at Yale. But it is still a petty gesture that brings no \n     honor on Mr. Berry or the other congressmen who have \n     willingly gone along with his vendetta.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11116-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11116-S11117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE PAIN RELIEF PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on October 25, 2000, Representative Henry \nHyde introduced H.R. 5544, the Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000. The \ntext of the legislation is based on the Senate Judiciary committee \nsubstitute to H.R. 2260, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, ordered \nreported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 27, 2000.\n  For the information of all Members of Congress, I offer the following \nsection-by-section analysis of the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Section-by-Section Analysis--Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000, H.R. \n                                  5544\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       Entitles the act the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000.''\n     Section 2. Findings\n       Makes a series of findings about the importance of \n     emphasizing pain management and palliative care in the first \n     decade of the new millennium, the regulation of drugs with a \n     potential for abuse under the Controlled Substances Act, the \n     use of such drugs by practitioners for legitimate medical \n     purposes, especially the purpose of relieving pain and \n     discomfort even if it increases the risk of death, the need \n     for improved treatment of pain, and the fact that dispensing \n     and distributing such drugs affects interstate commerce.\n\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n     Section 101. Activities of Agency for Healthcare Research and \n         Quality\n       This section amends the Public Health Services Act by \n     authorizing a program responsibility for the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality in the Department of Health \n     and Human Services to promote and advance scientific \n     understanding of palliative care. The Agency is directed to \n     collect and disseminate protocols and evidence-based \n     practices for pain management and palliative care with \n     priority for terminally ill patients.\n       The section is specifically made subject to subsections (e) \n     and (f) of section 902 of the Public Health Service Act [42 \n     U.S.C. 299a(e) and (f)], added by the Healthcare Research and \n     Quality Act of 1999, Public Law 106-129, which prevent the \n     mandating of national standards of clinical practice. This \n     section has a definition of pain management and palliative \n     care which is a modified version of the World Health \n     Organization's definition of palliative care.\n     Section 102. Activities of Health Resources and Services \n         Administration\n       This section amends the Public Health Services Act by \n     authorizing a program for education and training in pain \n     management and palliative care in the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. This section allows the Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality to award grants, cooperative agreements and contracts \n     to health professions schools, hospices, and other public and \n     private entities to develop and implement pain management and \n     palliative care education and training programs for health \n     care professions.\n       This section requires the applicant for the award to \n     include three educational informational components in the \n     program: (1) the program must have a component that addresses \n     a means for diagnosing and alleviating pain and other \n     distressing signs and\n\n[[Page S11117]]\n\n     symptoms of patients, especially in terminally ill patients, \n     including the use of controlled substances; (2) the program \n     must provide information and education on the applicable laws \n     on controlled substances, including those permitting \n     dispensing or administering them to relieve pain even in \n     cases wheresuch efforts may unintentionally increase the risk \n     of death, and (3) the information and education must provide \n     recent findings and developments in the improvement of pain \n     management and palliative care. Health professions schools, \n     residency training programs, continuing education, graduate \n     programs in the health professions, hospices, and other sites \n     as determined by the Secretary will be used as program sites.\n       This section also requires the Secretary to evaluate the \n     programs directly or through grants or contracts and mandates \n     that the Secretary include individuals with expertise and \n     experience in pain management and palliative care for the \n     population of patients whose needs are to be served in each \n     peer review group involved in the selection of the grantees.\n       Five million dollars annually are authorized to carry out \n     these programs.\n     Section 103. Decade of pain control and research\n       This section designates the decade beginning January 1, \n     2001, as the ``Decade of Pain Control and Research.''\n     Section 104. Effective date\n       This section makes title I effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n     Section 201. Reinforcing existing standard for the legitimate \n         use of controlled substances\n       This section amends the Controlled Substances Act to \n     establish that physicians and other licensed health care \n     professionals holding DEA registrations are authorized to \n     dispense, distribute, or administer controlled substances for \n     the legitimate medical purpose of alleviating a patient's \n     pain or discomfort in the usual course of professional \n     practice even if the use of these drugs may increase the risk \n     of death.\n       Essentially, this provision makes clear that there exists a \n     ``safe harbor'' for those who dispense controlled substances \n     for pain relief and palliative care, even if such treatment \n     increases a patient's risk of death. The Department of \n     Justice (DOJ) has taken the position that the Pain Relief Act \n     ``would eliminate any ambiguity about the legality of using \n     controlled substances to alleviate the pain and suffering of \n     the terminally ill by reducing any perceived threat of \n     administrative and criminal sanctions in this context.''\n       Without creating any new Federal standard, this section \n     also ensures that the new safe harbor is not construed to \n     change the proper interpretation of current law that the \n     administration, dispensing, or distribution of a controlled \n     substance for the purpose of assisting a suicide is not \n     authorized by the Controlled Substances Act. Individuals \n     covered by the CSA would not be subject to any new liability \n     under the statute--with the exception of those who would \n     attempt in the future to rely on the Oregon Act as a defense \n     to alleged violations of the CSA.\n       This section further provides that the Attorney General in \n     implementing the Controlled Substances Act shall not give \n     force or effect to any State law permitting assisted suicide \n     or euthanasia. This effectively overturns the June 5, 1998 \n     ruling of the Attorney General insofar as that ruling \n     concluded ``the CSA does not authorize DEA to prosecute, or \n     to revoke the DEA registration of, a physician who has \n     assisted in a suicide in compliance with Oregon law [or the \n     law of any other state that might authorize assisting suicide \n     of euthanasia.''\n       This section provides that the provisions of the bill are \n     effective only upon enactment with no retroactive effect. \n     This means that the Oregon statute will serve as a defense \n     for any actions taken in complaince under the Oregon law \n     prior to the enactment of H.R. 5544.\n       This section further provides that nothing in it shall be \n     construed to alter the roles of the Federal and State \n     governments in regulating the practice of medicine, affirming \n     that regardless of whether a practitioner's DEA registration \n     is deemed inconsistent with the public interest, the status \n     of the practitioner's State professional license and State \n     prescribing privileges remain solely within the discretion of \n     State authorities.\n       This section also provides that nothing in the act is to be \n     construed to modify Federal requirements that a controlled \n     substance may be dispensed only for a legitimate medical \n     purpose nor to authorize the Attorney General to issue \n     national standards for pain management and palliative care \n     clinical practice, research, or quality, except that the \n     Attorney General may take such other actions as may be \n     necessary to enforce the act.\n       This section provides that in any proceeding to revoke or \n     suspend a DEA registration based on alleged intent to cause \n     or assist in causing death in which the practitioner claims \n     to have been dispensing, distributing, or administering \n     controlled substances to alleviate pain or discomfort in the \n     usual course of professional practice, the burden rests with \n     the Attorney General to prove by clear and convincing \n     evidence that the practitioner's intent was to cause or \n     assist in causing the death.\n     Section 202. Education and training programs\n       This section directs educational and research training \n     programs for law enforcement to include means by which they \n     may better accommodate the necessary and legitimate use of \n     controlled substances in pain management and palliative care.\n     Section 203. Funding authority\n       This section designates the source of funds for carrying \n     out duties created under some provisions of the Controlled \n     Substances Act, as amended by H.R. 5544.\n     Section 204. Effective date\n       This section establishes that the effective date of the act \n     is that of its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11117-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11117-S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE COUNTERTERRORISM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Kyl spoke on the floor yesterday \nabout the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, S. 3205, which he introduced \ntwo weeks ago on October 12, 2000. I had planned to speak to him \ndirectly about this legislation when I got into the office yesterday, \nbut before I had the opportunity to speak to him, even by telephone, my \ncolleague instead chose to discuss this matter on the Senate floor.\n  I have worked with Senator Kyl to pass a number of matters of \nimportance to him in past Congresses and in this one. Most recently, \nfor example, the Senate passed on November 19, 1999, S. 692, the \nInternet Gambling Prohibition Act, and on September 28, 2000, S. 704, \nthe Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. Moreover, in the past \nfew months, we have worked together to get four more judges in Arizona. \nI was happy to help Senator Kyl clear each of those matters.\n  Unlike the secret holds that often stop good bills from passing often \nfor no good reason, I have had no secret hold on S. 3205. On the \ncontrary, when asked, I have made no secret about the concerns I had \nwith this legislation.\n  An earlier version of this legislation, which Senator Kyl tried to \nmove as part of the Intelligence Authorization bill, S. 2507, prompted \na firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights \norganizations, as well as the Department of Justice. I will include \nletters from the Department of Justice, the Center for Democracy and \nTechnology, the Center for National Security Studies and the American \nCivil Liberties Union for the Record at the end of my statement. I \nshared many of the concerns of those organizations and the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I learned late last week that Senator Kyl was seeking to clear S. \n3207 for passage by the Senate, even though it had been introduced only \nthe week before. I do not believe the Senate should move precipitously \nto pass a bill that has garnered so much serious opposition before \nhaving the opportunity to review it in detail and ensure that earlier \npitfalls had been addressed. Let me say that having reviewed the bill \nintroduced by Senator Kyl, it is apparent that he has made efforts to \naddress some of those serious and legitimate concerns.\n  Senator Kyl has suggested that if the Justice Department was \nsatisfied with his legislation, I or my staff had earlier indicated \nthat I would be satisfied. I respect the expertise of the Department of \nJustice and the many fine lawyers and public servants who work there \nand, where appropriate, seek out their views, as do many Members. That \ndoes not mean that I always share the views of the Department of \nJustice or follow the Department's preferred course and recommendations \nwithout exercising my own independent judgment. I would never represent \nthat if the Justice Department were satisfied with his bill, I would \nautomatically defer to their view. Furthermore, my staff has advised me \nthat no such representation was ever made.\n  That being said, I should note that the Department of Justice has \nadvised me about inaccurate and incorrect statements in Senator Kyl's \nbill, S. 3205, which are among the items that should be fixed before \nthe Senate takes up and passes this measure.\n  I have shared those items and other suggestions to improve this \nlegislation with the cosponsor of the bill, Senator Feinstein, whose \nstaff requested our comments earlier this week. My staff provided \ncomments to Senator Feinstein, and understood that at least in the view \nof that cosponsor of this bill, some of those comments were well-taken \nand would be discussed with Senator Kyl and his staff. Indeed, my staff \nreceived their first telephone call about S. 3205 from Senator Kyl's \nstaff just yesterday morning, returned the call without finding Senator \nKyl's\n\n[[Page S11118]]\n\nstaff available, and hoped to have constructive conversations to \nresolve our remaining differences. Yet, before these conversations \ncould even begin, Senator Kyl chose to conduct our discussions on the \nfloor of the Senate. There may be more productive matters on which the \nSenate should focus its attention, but I respect my colleague's choice \nof forum and will lay out here the continuing concerns I have with his \nlegislation.\n  First, the bill contains a sense of the Congress concerning the \ntragic attack on the U.S.S. Cole that refers to out-dated numbers of \nsailors killed and injured. I believe that each of the 17 sailors \nkilled and 39 sailors injured deserve recognition and that the full \nscope of the attack should be properly reflected in this Senate bill. I \nhave urged the sponsors of the bill to correct this part of the bill. I \nnote that last week the Senate passed at least two resolutions on this \nmatter, expressing the outrage we all feel about the bombing attack on \nthat Navy ship.\n  Second, this sense of the Congress urges the United States Government \nto ``take immediate actions to investigate rapidly the unprovoked \nattack on the'' U.S.S. Cole, without acknowledging the fact that such \nimmediate action has been taken. The Navy began immediate investigative \nsteps shortly after the attack occurred, and the FBI established a \npresence on the ground and began investigating within 24 hours. The \nDirector himself went to Yemen to guide this investigation. That \ninvestigation is active and ongoing, and no Senate bill should reflect \ndifferently, as this one does. We should be commending the \nAdministration for the swift and immediate actions taken to this attack \nand the strong statements made by the President making clear that no \nstone will be left unturned to find the criminals who planned this \nbloody attack.\n  Third, as I previously indicated, the Department of Justice has \nsuggested several corrections to the ``Findings'' section of this bill. \nFor example, the bill suggests there are ``38 organizations'' \ndesignated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) when there are \ncurrently 29. The bill also states that ``current practice is to update \nthe list of FTOs every two years'' when in fact the statute requires \nredesignation of FTOs every two years. The bill also states that \ncurrent controls on the transfer and possession of biological pathogens \nwere ``designed to prevent accidents, not theft,'' which according to \nthe Justice Department is simply not accurate.\n  Fourth, the bill requires reports on issues within the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee without any direction that those \nreports be submitted to that Committee. For example, section 9 of the \nbill would require the FBI to submit to the Select Committees on \nIntelligence of the Senate and the House a feasibility report on \nestablishing a new capability within the FBI for the dissemination of \nlaw enforcement information to the Intelligence community. I have \nsuggested that this report also be required to be submitted to the \nJudiciary Committees. As the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, I \nwould have expected that Senator Kyl would support this suggested \nchange.\n  Fifth, the bill would require reports, with recommendations for \nappropriate legislative or regulation changes, by the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of Health and Human Services on safeguarding \nbiological pathogens at research labs and other facilities in the \nUnited States. No definition of ``biological pathogen'' is included in \nthe bill and the scope could therefore cover a vast array of biological \nmaterials. I have suggested that the focus of these requested reports \ncould be better directed by more carefully defining this term.\n  Finally, the bill would require reimbursement for professional \nliability insurance for law enforcement officers performing official \ncounterterrorism duties and for intelligence officials performing such \nduties outside the United States. I have asked for an explanation for \nthis provision. I have scoured the record in vain for explanatory \nstatements by the sponsors of this bill for this provision. It is \nunclear to me why law enforcement officers conducting investigations \nhere in the United States need such insurance, let alone intelligence \nofficers acting overseas. There may be a good reason why these officers \nneed this special protection, beyond the limited immunity they already \nhave and beyond what other law enforcement and intelligence officers \nare granted. I need to know the reason for this special protection \nbefore any of us are able to evaluate the merits of this proposal.\n  I stand ready, as I always have, to work with the sponsors of S. 3205 \nto improve their bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the two letters to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 25, 2000.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart \n         Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC,\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart \n         Senate Office Bldg, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: We are writing to \n     express our opposition to the ``Counterterrorism Act of \n     2000,'' which we understand Senators Kyl and Feinstein are \n     seeking to add to the intelligence authorization bill. At \n     least three provisions of the Act pose grave threats to \n     constitutional rights, and others raise serious questions as \n     well.\n\n\n                               Section 10\n\n       Section 10 of the Counterterrorism Act would amend the \n     federal wiretap statute (``Title III'') to allow law \n     enforcement agencies conducting wiretaps within the United \n     States to share information obtained from such surveillance \n     with the intelligence agencies. The provision breaches the \n     well-established and constitutionally vital line between law \n     enforcement and intelligence activities. The provision has no \n     meaningful limitations. It allows the CIA and other \n     intelligence agencies to acquire, index, use and disseminate \n     information collected within the US about American citizens. \n     It is not subject to any meaningful judicial controls.\n       Efforts have been underway for a number of years to improve \n     the sharing of information between law enforcement and \n     intelligence agencies, particularly in areas concerning \n     terrorism and trans-national criminal activity. Significant \n     improvements have been achieved. However, it has been \n     recognized consistently in all these efforts that the \n     fundamental distinction between intelligence and law \n     enforcement serves important values and must be maintained.\n       Paramount among the reasons why we distinguish between law \n     enforcement and intelligence agencies, and confine them to \n     their separate spheres, is to protect civil and \n     constitutional rights. The intelligence agencies operate in \n     secret without many of the checks and balances, the judicial \n     review and the public accountability that our Constitution \n     demands for most exercises of government power. The \n     secretive data gathering, storage and retention practices \n     of the intelligence agencies are appropriate only when \n     conducted overseas for national defense and foreign policy \n     purposes and only when directed against people who are not \n     US citizens or permanent residents.\n       Therefore, we have always maintained strict rules against \n     intelligence agency activities in the US or directed against \n     US citizens and residents. From the outset, the National \n     Security Act of 1947 has specifically provided that the \n     Central Intelligence Agency shall ``have no police, subpoena \n     or law enforcement powers or internal security functions.'' \n     This was intended to prevent the CIA from collecting \n     information on Americans. Likewise, the National Security \n     Agency has very strict rules about the collection or \n     dissemination of information concerning Americans.\n       This prohibition against intelligence agencies collecting \n     and disseminating information about people in the US would be \n     rendered meaningless if the FBI could give personally \n     identifiable information about US citizens to the CIA or NSA, \n     which then could retain the information in files retrievable \n     by name. Yet that is what the proposed amendment does. The \n     proposed amendment contains no meaningful limitations. It \n     does not say that the information to be shared can relate \n     only to non-US persons. It does not say that the information \n     could be kept by the receiving intelligence agencies only in \n     non-personally retrievable form (a restriction that \n     increasingly loses meaning anyhow as agencies develop the \n     capability to search the full next of their files).\n       Moreover, this breach would involve one of the most \n     intrusive of law enforcement techniques--electronic \n     interception of telephone conversations, e-mail and other \n     electronic communications. In recognition of the especially \n     intrusive nature of wiretapping, section 2.4 of E.O. 12333 \n     expressly states that the CIA is not authorized to conduct \n     electronic surveillance within the United States. All Title \n     III interceptions take place in the US. The overwhelming \n     majority of targets of law enforcement wiretapping are US \n     persons. In this information age, when so much sensitive \n     personal information is exchanged electronically, the \n     American public is increasingly concerned about the breadth \n     and intrusiveness of government wiretapping.\n\n[[Page S11119]]\n\n       The problems posed by the proposed Section 10 are \n     compounded by the secrecy with which the intelligence \n     agencies operate. There is little likelihood that a person \n     who was the subject of a file at the CIA would ever learn \n     about it, and even less likelihood that they would ever learn \n     that information in the file was obtained by a law \n     enforcement wiretap. So there would be little opportunity for \n     uncovering abuses and little recourse to the judiciary for \n     misuse of the information.\n       The provision stands in fundamental contradiction to the \n     specificity and minimization requirements of Title III, which \n     are central to the privacy protection scheme of that law. The \n     minimization rule requires every wiretap to be ``conducted in \n     such a way as to minimize the interception of communications \n     not otherwise subject to interception'' under Title III. \n     18 U.S.C. 2518(5). Every order under Title III must \n     include ``a particular description of the type of \n     communication sought to be intercepted and a statement of \n     the particular offense to which it relates,'' 18 U.S.C. \n     2518(4)(c). Together, these provisions make it illegal to \n     intercept under Title III communications that do not \n     relate to a criminal offense. Yet the proposed amendment \n     would seem to mean either that officials conducting Title \n     III wiretaps would be intercepting communications \n     involving foreign intelligence that is not relevant to \n     crimes in the U.S. or the CIA would be compiling \n     information about crimes, including crimes inside the \n     U.S., in violation of the National Security Act.\n\n\n                               section 9\n\n       Section 9 of the Counterterrorism Act of 2000 also \n     threatens to erase the dividing line between law enforcement \n     and intelligence agencies that protects individuals in the \n     U.S. against secret domestic intelligence activity. Section 9 \n     would require the Director of the FBI to submit to Congress a \n     report on the feasibility of establishing within the Bureau a \n     comprehensive intelligence reporting function having the \n     responsibility for disseminating to the intelligence agencies \n     information collected and assembled by the FBI on \n     international terrorism and other national security matters.\n       But Section 9 calls for far more than an objective study. \n     It requires the FBI to submit a proposal for such an \n     information sharing function, including a budget, an \n     implementation proposal and a discussion of the legal \n     restrictions associated with disseminating law enforcement \n     information to the intelligence agencies. This is putting the \n     cart before the horse. With the emphasis in recent years on \n     cooperation between the FBI and the CIA, the factual \n     predicate has not been established for even concluding that \n     the FBI is not already properly sharing intelligence \n     information. Further, only recently the FBI adopted a \n     strategy that stresses intelligence collection and analysis--\n     it would be prudent first to examine the effectiveness and \n     civil liberties implications of that strategy before \n     directing the FBI to design a new intelligence sharing \n     mechanism. Then it would be prudent to draw distinctions \n     among the various types of information that the FBI is \n     collecting, to ensure that information sharing does not \n     infringe on the rights of Americans and does not involve the \n     intelligence agencies in domestic law enforcement matters. \n     All of these nuances are missing from Section 9. All of them \n     could be accomplished by the relevant Congressional \n     committees in a neutral and objective fashion without the \n     need for this amendment.\n       The provision does not draw a distinction between \n     information collected by the FBI under its \n     counterintelligence authority and information collected by \n     the Bureau in criminal matters. While there are overlaps \n     between foreign intelligence and criminal investigations, \n     especially in international terrorism matters, there are \n     nonetheless important and long-standing rules intended to \n     enforce the distinction. Since the period of COINTELPRO and \n     the Church Committee, it has been recognized that the \n     rights of American are better protected (and the FBI may \n     be more effective) when international terrorism and \n     national security investigations are conducted under the \n     rules for criminal investigations. Section 9 is flawed for \n     failing to recognize this distinction and seeming to \n     encourage its obliteration.\n\n\n                               Section 11\n\n       Section 11 of the bill is essentially a direction to the \n     Executive Branch to be more aggressive in investigating \n     ``terrorist fundraising'' of an undefined nature. Fundraising \n     to support violent activities is properly a crime. But in the \n     1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Congress \n     also made it a crime to support the legal, peaceful political \n     activities of groups that the Executive Branch designates as \n     terrorist organizations. The 1996 Act was supposed to allow \n     the government to respond to fundraising in the US on behalf \n     of terrorist groups. At the time, opponents of the law argued \n     that there was no evidence that extensive fundraising of this \n     nature occurred and worried that the law would be used as an \n     excuse to launch intimidating investigations into the \n     political activities of Arab immigrants and other ethnic \n     communities. We opposed the 1996 Act on the ground that it \n     unconstitutionally criminalized support activities that were \n     protected under the First Amendment. The proposed amendment \n     to the intelligence authorization bill reaches even more \n     broadly than the 1996 Act.\n       Section 11 of the bill essentially tells the Executive \n     Branch to go out and punish fundraising conduct where little \n     or none has been found. The recent case of Wen Ho Lee \n     highlights the dangers of Congress telling the Executive \n     Branch to be more aggressive in investigating and prosecuting \n     a particular crime. The last time something like this \n     happened was in the 1980s, when some in Congress urged the \n     FBI to be more aggressive in investigating what they believed \n     to be a Communist-supported conspiracy in the US to support \n     terrorism in El Salvador. The resulting ``CISPES'' \n     investigation intruded on the First Amendment rights of \n     thousands of Americans peacefully opposed to US policy in \n     Central America, turned up no evidence of wrongdoing, and \n     proved a major embarrassment for the FBI. This danger is \n     exacerbated by the proposed amendment, which encourages the \n     Executive Branch to use Civil and administrative remedies, \n     including the tax laws, that are not subject to the \n     protections of criminal due process. It is further \n     exacerbated since the amendment encourages the commingling of \n     criminal information and intelligence information collected \n     with the most intrusive of techniques and such secrecy that \n     the targets of any adverse action may have a hard time \n     defending themselves.\n       We also have concerns with other sections of the proposed \n     amendment: (1) Section 6, concerning the guidelines on \n     recruitment of CIA informants, implicitly questions the \n     historical lessons and value judgments reflected in the \n     guidelines and is clearly intended to be seen as a signal \n     from Congress that the CIA should be freer in recruiting \n     informants who are human rights abusers. This practice has \n     embarrassed our country in the past and would embarrass us \n     again if the practice were renewed, undercutting American \n     foreign policy support for the rule of law and our efforts \n     to discourage and resolve violence in emerging democracies \n     and other transitional societies. (2) Section 12 would \n     require IHIS to take ``actions'' to make standards for the \n     physical protection and security of biological pathogens \n     ``as rigorous as the current standards'' for critical \n     nuclear materials.'' The questions posed by the threat of \n     biological weapons require a far more carefully designed \n     policy than a blanket direction to establish for \n     ``biological pathogens'' the same protections that apply \n     to critical nuclear materials. Take the case of West Nile \n     virus, or the AIDS virus. Are these ``biological \n     pathogens?'' Does section 12 mean that all medical \n     research and all medical facilities handling research and \n     treatment of the West Nile or AIDS viruses must institute \n     the security clearance checks, polygraphs, and pre-\n     publication review requirements (all of which raise \n     serious constitutional due process, privacy and civil \n     liberties concerns) that apply to workers at nuclear \n     weapons facilities?\n       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose the addition of \n     the Counterterrorism Act to the intelligence authorization \n     bill.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                              Laura W.

Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter expresses the views of the \n     Justice Department on the proposed counterterrorism amendment \n     (the ``Counterterrorism Act of 2000'') to S. 2507, the \n     ``Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.'' The \n     Department opposes the amendment.\n       Section 10 would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517 to permit the \n     sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence \n     information, collected by investigative or law enforcement \n     officers under title III, with the intelligence community. We \n     oppose this provision, Although we recognize the arguments \n     for allowing title III information to be shared as a \n     permissive matter, this would be a major change to existing \n     law and could have significant implications for prosecutions \n     and the discovery process in litigation. Any consideration of \n     the sharing of law enforcement information with the \n     intelligence community must accommodate legal constraints \n     such as Criminal Rule 6(e) and the need to protect equities \n     relating to ongoing criminal investigations. While we \n     understand the concerns of the Commission on Terrorism, we \n     believe that law enforcement agencies have authority under \n     current law to share title III information regarding \n     terrorism with intelligence agencies when the information is \n     of overriding importance to the national security.\n       Section 10 also raises significant issues regarding the \n     sharing with intelligence agencies of information collected \n     about United States persons. Such a change to title III \n     should not be made lightly, without full discussion of the \n     issues and implications.\n       Section 9 of the amendment presumptively would give the FBI \n     60 days to resolve these and other concerns in a report to \n     Congress on the feasibility of establishing a dissemination \n     center within the FBI for information collected and assembled \n     by the FBI on international terrorism and other national \n     security matters. In our view, the issues involved\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\n     in the dissemination of this information do not avail \n     themselves of resolution in this very short time frame. In \n     addition, we note that law enforcement officials \n     conducting operations that result in the collection or \n     assembly of this kind of information often will not be in \n     a position to discern whether the information they have \n     gathered actually qualifies as pertinent to foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence. Accordingly, to the \n     extent that disclosure becomes mandatory, we anticipate \n     that a substantial and costly effort would be necessary to \n     create the necessary screening process.\n       Section 11 of the amendment would require the creation of a \n     joint task force to disrupt the fundraising activities of \n     international terrorist organizations. We believe that this \n     type of rigid, statutory mandate would interfere with the \n     need for flexibility in tailoring enforcement strategies and \n     mechanisms to fit the enforcement needs of the particular \n     moment.\n       Section 12 of the amendment would require the Attorney \n     General to submit a report on the means of improving controls \n     of biological pathogens and the equipment necessary to \n     produce biological weapons. Subsection 12(a)(2)(A) would \n     require that the report include a list of equipment critical \n     to the development, production, and delivery of biological \n     weapons. We question the utility of such a list because it is \n     our understanding that much of this equipment is dual-use and \n     widely used for peaceful purposes. Section 12(b) directs the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to undertake certain \n     actions relating to protection and security of biological \n     pathogens described in subsection (a). In keeping with the \n     concerns regarding Executive branch authority, as discussed \n     above, and the complexity and scope of this matter, the \n     Administration believes that any authority should be vested \n     in the President.\n       Moreover, section 12(a)(2)(B) would purport to require that \n     the Attorney General submit a report to Congress on \n     biological weapons that ``shall include'' the following:\n       (B) Recommendations for legislative language to make \n     illegal the possession of the biological pathogens;\n       (C) Recommendations for legislative language to control the \n     domestic sale and transfer of the equipment so identified \n     under subparagraph A;\n       (D) Recommendations for legislative language to require the \n     tagging or other means of marking of the equipment identified \n     under subsection A.\n       We believe that these provisions are invalid under the \n     Recommendations Clause, which provides that the President \n     ``shall from time to time . . . recommend to [Congress] . . . \n     such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'' \n     U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 3. Legislation requiring the \n     President to provide the Congress with policy recommendations \n     or draft legislation infringes on powers reserved to the \n     President by the Recommendations Clause, including the power \n     to decline to offer any recommendation if, in the President's \n     judgment, no recommendation is necessary or expedient. \n     Legislation that requires the President's subordinates to \n     provide Congress with policy recommendations or draft \n     legislation interferes with the President's efforts to \n     formulate and present his own recommendations and proposals \n     and to control the policy agenda of his Administration.\n       The constitutional concerns raised by the proposed \n     amendment would be addressed by revising these provisions in \n     either of the following ways: (1) provide that the reports \n     the Attorney General submits may, instead of shall, include \n     recommendations or (2) provide that ``the Attorney General \n     shall, to the extent that she deems it appropriate,'' submit \n     such recommendations to Congress.\n       More generally, we understand that this amendment may \n     bypass the hearing and referral process and be appended \n     immediately to S. 2507, the Intelligence Authorization bill, \n     now headed for consideration on the floor of the Senate. \n     Given the complexity of the issues, we would welcome a more \n     considered dialogue between the branches of Government.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. The \n     Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the \n     perspective of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Robert Raben,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11120-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS \n                          COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of \nthe greatest public servants among us: Daniel Patrick Moynihan. For 24 \nyears he has lent us the wisdom of his experience, the insights of his \nkeen mind, and above all, the honor of his friendship. Senator Moynihan \nreminds all of us what a Senator was intended to be. He is a leader who \nnot only addresses the needs of his state, but who wrestles with the \nchallenges facing the nation. Senator Moynihan has been a great servant \nto the people of New York, but the legacy of accomplishments he leaves \nreach beyond New York's borders to touch the lives of every American.\n  With a brilliant intellect and an unwavering dedication, Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan has helped us think through some of the toughest \nissues before this body, from welfare reform to taxation policy. He has \nworked to return secrecy to its limited but necessary role in \ngovernment, an effort which I applaud. And he has lent his support to \n``The Fisc,'' the annual compilation of the balance of payments between \nthe states and the federal government, which brings needed attention to \nthe ``donor'' status of New York, Wisconsin and other states. He has \ndone a great service to our understanding of federal spending with his \nlongtime support of this effort.\n  Recently, I was proud to work with Senator Moynihan on the Mother-to-\nChild HIV Prevention Act of 2000, S. 2032, the substance of which was \nincorporated into the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, \nand signed into law in August. It was an honor to work with him to get \nthis legislation to the President's desk. Senator Moynihan's keen grasp \nof foreign affairs, as well as his mastery of domestic and urban \nissues, will be missed as he retires from the Senate.\n  Senator Moynihan's lifetime of public service, his wisdom and \nexperience, have been a wonderful gift to this body. I know my \ncolleagues join me in my admiration for Senator Moynihan as a public \nservant, my respect for him as a colleague, and my appreciation for him \nas a friend. It has been a distinct honor for me to serve with Senator \nMoynihan since I came to this body in 1993. Pat, I wish you all the \nbest as you retire from the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to your \ncontinued contributions to the nation as one of the greatest political \nthinkers of our age.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11121-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n                TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncareer of Connie Mack as he retires from the Senate. Senator Mack has \nserved the people of Florida with distinction during his two terms in \nthe Senate, as well as during his three terms in the House of \nRepresentatives. Throughout his career in public service, Senator Mack \nhas been willing to address complex issues and help move the debate \nforward.\n  On matters of fiscal policy, Senator Mack and I have not often \nagreed, but I have admired his willingness to engage these issues in a \nserious way that fosters the kind of discussion we need in the Senate \nto deliberate on the difficult questions before us.\n  Senator Mack has been a steadfast advocate for increased NIH funding, \nand I have been proud to support his efforts, including his proposal, \npassed as an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, to \ndouble funding for NIH over the next five years. I share his belief \nthat increasing funding for biomedical research is one of the most \nimportant ways we can improve the quality of life for America's \nfamilies. Groundbreaking research, development of drug therapies and \nnew medical procedures, all of these steps move us closer to life-\nsaving medical breakthroughs that can detect, prevent, and eliminate \nlife-threatening disease.\n  I have also been pleased to support Senator Mack's effort, along with \nSenator Graham, to restore the Everglades. His work to preserve and \nrestore this unique and beautiful area, home to fragile habitats and \nmany endangered species, will undoubtedly be one of his greatest \nlegacies.\n  It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator Mack over the last seven \nyears.

Mr. President, when I first heard that Bob Kerrey had \ndecided not to run again, I knew the Senate was losing a true American \noriginal, and a big part of what makes the Senate special.\n  From my first moments in the Senate back in 1993, there was one thing \nI could tell right away--Bob Kerrey is a true leader. In an age of \npoll-driven politics, Bob Kerrey isn't afraid to ruffle a few feathers \nto raise the level of debate and work for the greater good. He has \nsparked debate on the big issues: saving Social Security, controlling \nfederal spending, guaranteeing the right to health insurance, and \nhelping the poor, just to name a few.\n  I was proud to work with him on the bipartisan deficit reduction \npackage he spearheaded with former Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, and \nI'm proud to have a colleague with such a sincere commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility. He fought to balance the federal budget when others \nsaid it could not be done. As Chair of the Bipartisan Commission on \nEntitlement and Tax Reform, Bob Kerrey directed our attention to the \nlong-term challenges that we need to heed.\n  Bob Kerrey is a pleasure to work with, but he is also a courageous \npublic servant who is willing to stand alone when it is necessary. In \naddition to his heroic record of public service, he is a hero who \nserved his country valiantly in the Vietnam War. Bob Kerrey brings \ngreat honor to the Senate as only the fifth Medal on Honor winner to \nserve in this body, and while he never makes a big deal about the \nhonors he has received, every day he has served in the U.S. Senate, Bob \nKerrey has exhibited the strength of character that befit those \ntributes.\n  And while all those things are important, it is also essential to \nhave a sense of humor, and we all know that Bob possesses that quality \nin spades. He is a pleasure to be around, and a good friend. I wish him \nall the best as he moves on to head the New School, and in everything \nhe does.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11121-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FRANK LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as this Congress draws to a close, I \nwant to take a moment to thank my friend Frank Lautenberg for his 18 \nyears of service in the body. The people of New Jersey are losing a \nskilled legislator and a gifted advocate. Whether he is fighting racial \nprofiling or taking on the tobacco industry, Frank Lautenberg has \nconsistently fought for a healthier, safer, more just world for all of \nus.\n  After a successful career in the private sector, Frank ran for the \nU.S. Senate motivated to give something back to his state and the \nnation. And never has he had greater success than during his 18 years \nin public service. It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator \nLautenberg on the Budget Committee, where he has provided outstanding \nleadership as the committee's ranking member. Senator Lautenberg played \na crucial role in crafting the bipartisan budget agreement of 1997 \nwhich led to the balanced budget, and putting this body back on the \nroad to fiscal responsibility.\n  I stood side by side with Senator Lautenberg in the fight to \nimplement the gift ban in 1995. And I've been especially proud to work \nwith him to end racial profiling--the abhorrent law enforcement \npractice that targets African Americans, Hispanic Americans and other \nminorities for traffic stops based on the color of their skin. Together \nSenator Lautenberg and I introduced S. 821, the Traffic Stops Study \nAct, to require the Attorney General to conduct an initial analysis of \nexisting data on racial profiling and then design a study to gather \ndata from a nationwide sampling of jurisdictions. We've worked together \non this issue for more than two years, and I believe our legislation \nwill prevail, if not in this Congress, then in the next one.\n  I will proudly continue the fight to pass the Traffic Stops Study Act \nin the next Congress, but I will miss greatly Frank's leadership on \nthis issue. When we do finally pass this simple bill to get an accurate \npicture of racial profiling on our nation's roadways, we'll owe a big \npart of that victory to Senator Lautenberg.\n  Today I thank Frank Lautenberg for his leadership on racial profiling \nand so many other issues that matter to the people of this nation. I \nwish him and his family all the best in his retirement, and thank him \nfor his many contributions to the U.S. Senate, and to the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11121-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11121-S11122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH'S RURAL OUTREACH PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about giving small \nbusinesses the tools they need to be successful in today's competitive \nmarketplace. I am committed to providing those tools by fully \nsupporting the continuation of the Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) Rural Outreach Program. Congressional commitment to small \nbusiness development has created a network of people nationwide, \nespecially in Wyoming, that is excited and knowledgeable about the SBIR \nRural Outreach Program.\n  The SBIR Rural Outreach Program provides an excellent funding \nopportunity for individuals and small businesses in rural areas that \nhave a passion to explore, develop and commercialize their innovative \nideas. Created in 1982, the SBIR Program is a highly competitive \nprogram that encourages small business to explore their technological \npotential and provides the incentive to profit from its \ncommercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the \nNation's research & development arena, high-tech innovation is \nstimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it \nmeets its specific research and development needs.\n  The SBIR Program is designed to target the entrepreneurial sector \nbecause that is where most innovation and innovators thrive. However, \nthe risk and expense of conducting serious R efforts are often beyond \nthe means of many small businesses. By reserving a specific percentage \nof federal R funds for small business, the SBIR Program protects the \nsmall business and enables it to compete on the same level as large \nbusinesses. The SBIR Program funds the critical startup and development \nstages and it encourages the commercialization of the technology, \nproduct, or service, which, in turn, stimulates the U.S. economy.\n  Each year, ten federal departments and agencies are required by the \nSBIR\n\n[[Page S11122]]\n\nProgram to reserve a portion of their R funds for award to small \nbusiness. Such agencies include the Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Commerce, Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, and National Science Foundation.\n  Following submission of proposals, agencies make SBIR awards based on \nsmall business qualification, degree of innovation, technical merit, \nand future market potential. Small businesses that receive awards or \ngrants then begin a three-phase program. Phase I is the startup phase, \nawarding up to $100,000 for approximately 6 months support exploration \nof the technical merit or feasibility of an idea or technology. Phase \nII awards of up to $750,000, for as many as 2 years, expanding Phase I \nresults. During this time, the R work is performed and the developer \nevaluates commercialization potential. Only Phase I award winners are \nconsidered for Phase II. Phase III is the period during which Phase II \ninnovation moves from the laboratory into the marketplace. The small \nbusiness must find funding in the private sector or other non-SBIR \nfederal agency funding.\n  In 1997, Senator Burns and I cosponsored legislation and Congress \nestablished the SBIR Rural Outreach Program to increase the SBIR \nparticipation of small businesses located in the states that receive \nthe fewest SBIR awards. The program is limited to funding activities \nwhich encourage small firms in those states to participate in the SBIR \nRural Outreach Program. The Outreach Program is targeted toward the 25 \nunder-represented jurisdictions in the SBIR program in an effort to \nprovide a secure funding mechanism to states so that they could develop \nan effective five-year effort to assist small businesses to take \nadvantage of the SBIR program.\n  As you may know, western small businesses have some special \nimpediments to overcome. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program provides an \nexcellent funding opportunity for individuals and small businesses that \nhave a passion to explore, develop and commercialize their innovative \nideas. This is especially true in rural states like Wyoming. The \nWyoming small business community is one of the cornerstones of our \nstate's economy. Wyoming is the smallest state, with a large number of \nsmall businesses. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program is one way for \nWyoming's small businesses to access federal funding.\n  Rural states need technology-based businesses that the SBIR program \nnurtures. The SBIR Rural Outreach Program is one of the few \nopportunities for Wyoming's small businesses to access federal R \nfunding. I believe more innovative and aggressive approaches are needed \nto help rural states achieve greater participation in this, especially \nat those agencies that have proved difficult for small businesses to \naccess.\n  There are several outreach activities that have been effective in \nhelping small businesses in rural states compete successfully in the \nSBIR Rural Outreach Program. For example, the Wyoming SBIR Initiative \noutreach efforts have led to substantial gains in both the number of \nproposals submitted, the quality of proposals submitted, and the number \nselected for award. For example, Wyoming received one Phase I award in \n1994. Wyoming, however, received 8 Phase I awards by 1995 and has \nreceived a total of 43 Phase I awards by 2000. To date, Wyoming has \nreceived approximately $9 million since 1987 for both Phase I and II \nawards, but there is still more that should be done to assist small \nbusinesses in the West.\n\n  I want to share the dramatic impact that SBIR awards have made on one \nWyoming company--Wyoming Sawmills, Incorporated. The company's first \nPhase I SBIR award was from U.S. Department of Agriculture in May 1997, \nand it won the follow-on Phase II program in September 1998. The \nproject aims to convert low-grade lumber into construction quality \nlumber through an innovative laminating technique. Wyoming Sawmills \nwill begin commercial sales of the new product in 1999, and it already \nhas captured related R funding based on this SBIR project. In January \n1999, the company won a National Science Foundation Phase I award on \nanother laminated wood product concept.\n  Another success story is CC Technology. CC Technology, a Laramie-\nbased small business, has been notified of a $400,000 SBIR Phase II \ngrant award from the National Science Foundation, NSF. During Phase I, \nthe business did research on measuring cyanide levels in gold mining \nleach pads. For Phase II, a team consisting of CC Technology, Detection \nLimit, and Aspect Consultant Group has been built to monitor cyanide at \nboth the mining solution levels and at trace levels for environmental \ncompliance.\n  I want to express a special thank you to Chris Busch, from Senator \nBurns' home state of Montana and who coordinated SBIR efforts in \nWyoming for the past five years. Chris Busch did a remarkable job \nworking with people in Wyoming to raise the awareness and participation \nof small businesses in the SBIR program. Working with small businesses, \npublic organizations, and others in Wyoming and nationwide, Chris got \npeople involved, helped them through the grant management process, and \nguided them in market development and commercialization. His commitment \nto small business development has created a network of people in \nWyoming that is excited and knowledgeable about SBIR. Chris has helped \nto plant the seeds of economic diversity in communities that really \nneed it. Chris' activities and commitment of this program are making \nSBIR work.\n  In closing, SBIR programs work for small businesses in rural states, \nespecially Wyoming. Fortunately, we have several dedicated westerners \nin the Congress who have committed their time and legislative efforts \nto expand the successes of SBIR to all parts of the country. It is my \nhope that my colleagues will see the importance of this particular \ngovernment program that is truly assisting small businesses nationwide. \nI look forward to continued bipartisan efforts to benefit our nation's \nsmall businesses by strongly supporting the SBIR Rural Outreach \nProgram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11122-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11122-S11123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REAUTHORIZATION OF THE STATE AGRICULTURAL MEDIATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr President, I rise today to applaud Senate adoption of \nlegislation I introduced to re-authorize and expand a popular program \nwhich provides mediation services between agricultural producers and \nthe various credit and United States Department of Agriculture agencies \nwho family farmers and ranchers work with to maintain their farming and \nranching operations.\n  On June 15, 2000, I introduced S. 2741, legislation to re-authorize, \nexpand, and clarify the state agricultural mediation program. Nine \nSenators cosponsored this legislation, including Senators Daschle, \nRoberts, Conrad, Grassley, Kerrey, Craig, Harkin, Dorgan, and Levin. I \nthank these colleagues for their bipartisan support for my bill, which \nwas included as part of the Grain Standards Act adopted by the Senate \nearlier this week.\n  Extension of this mediation program was adopted with wide bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate as part of the Grain Standards Act \nReauthorization. The present state agricultural mediation law was set \nto expire this year, but our reauthorization extends it through 2005.\n  This step was significant because family farmers and ranchers in my \nstate of South Dakota and all across this country continue to suffer \nfrom a depressed rural economy and rock-bottom commodity prices. \nAgriculture is the backbone of our economy, and we must not fail to \nprovide support to our family farmers and ranchers who are coping with \nthese difficult times.\n  During the 1980's farm crisis, Congress approved federal funds and \nparticipation in a state-by-state operated farm mediation program. \nAuthorized in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, this mediation \nprogram helps farmers and ranchers, and their creditors, in resolving \ncredit disputes in a confidential and non-adversarial setting, which is \noutside the traditional process of litigation, appeals, bankruptcy, and \nforeclosure. The mediators are neutral facilitators and they do not \nmake decisions for the disputing parties.\n  Each year Congress provides funding for state mediation, and these \nfunds are matched with state funds to carry out the mediation program. \nCurrently,\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\ntwenty-five states participate in this mediation program, including \nAlabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, \nKansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, \nNew Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, \nWashington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  I am pleased we were able to clarify and expand the scope of \nmediation in this reauthorization. With the support and direction of \nthe Coalition of Agricultural Mediation Programs (CAMP), mediation now \nclearly can aim to resolve disputes such as wetland determinations, \ngrazing issues, and USDA farm program matters, in addition to the \ntraditional credit role of mediation. CAMP represents the individuals \nand entities across the nation who administer the state agricultural \nmediation programs, and I thank that organization for their leadership \non this issue.\n  I want to specifically offer my thanks and gratitude to Linda Hodgin, \nDirector of Mediation and Ag Counseling, with the South Dakota \nDepartment of Agriculture. Linda's knowledge, input, and ability to \nwork with CAMP enabled Congress to enact the mediation reauthorization \nthis year. Under her direction in the last two years, around 500 family \nfarmers and ranchers in South Dakota have benefitted from the services \nof mediation and counseling. The mediators and counselors who work with \nLinda in South Dakota are to be commended for their time and commitment \nto family farm agriculture.\n  We live in a day and age where nearly every farmer and rancher must \nsecure financing from some source in order to take care of production \ncosts associated with agricultural production. This mediation program \nallows agricultural producers to settle their credit and farm program \ndisputes in a fair way without digging themselves into legal debt. I \nwish to thank my colleagues who supported this important initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11123-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the ``Protecting Seniors \nfrom Fraud Act'' passed the Senate. I was an original cosponsor of this \nbill, S. 3164, which Senator Bayh introduced on October 5, 2000, with \nSenators Grams and Cleland. I have been concerned for some time that \neven as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the \npast eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained \nunchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, \nwith Senators Daschle, Kennedy, and Torricelli over a year ago.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from \nthe Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs \nthe Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against \nseniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and \nproperly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of \nseniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are \nimportant steps, and they should be made law.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important \nproposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, \nespecially fraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, \nthis bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make \ngrants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and \neducate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information \nabout telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and \nthrough State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions \nthat will help seniors protect themselves against crime.\n  I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the \nSeniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for \nour seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach \nthat would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, \npension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with \na record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has \nsaid that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number \nof ways.'' I have urged the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nto hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as October 1999, \nand again this past February, but my requests have not been granted. \nNow, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of time for \nhearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and significant \nparts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee as part of the unfinished business of this Congress.\n  Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the \nmajority in the Congress declined to consider. First, the Seniors \nSafety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. \nNursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, \nmore than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need \nnursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a \nwonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks \nto protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in \noperation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority \nto investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that \nengage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is \nall the more important given the study prepared by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York \nTimes showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet \nthe Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The \nstudy also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than \nnecessary to provide optimal care.\n  Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from \ntelemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This \nlegislation would give the Attorney General the authority to block or \nterminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud \nseniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can \ntake away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your \nmoney, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their \nphone away. In addition, this proposal would establish a Better \nBusiness Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints \nmade about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors \ncould find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the \nphone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\nor been convicted of fraud. Senator Bayh has recently introduced \nanother bill, S. 3025, the Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which \nincludes the part of the Seniors Safety Act that establishes the \nclearinghouse for telemarketing fraud information.\n  Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who \nhave worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-\nearned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The \nbill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who \ndefraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft \nin connection with employee benefit plans.\n  Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability \nto fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute \nfor Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately \ntarget vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's \npatients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law \nenforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional \ninvestigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute \nhealth care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also \nprotects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples \nof health care fraud.\n  I commend Senators Bayh, Grams and Cleland for working to take steps \nto improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We have done \nthe right thing in passing this bipartisan legislation and beginning \nthe fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also urge my \ncolleagues to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken together, \nthese two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving \nlaw enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent \ncrime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11124-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LOCAL 1945, AFGE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

Of the seventy-eight charter members that established Local \n1945, only nine survive today.\n  These nine leaders in government service, through their courage and \ndedication, were instrumental in the development of a proud and \nprofessional workforce for Anniston Army Depot and the Department of \nDefense. The workforce these individuals cared for and inspired has \nsupported United States soldiers around the world during times of \nconflict, crisis and war. In the jungles of Vietnam, along the thirty-\neighth parallel, and in the sands of Kuwait have been evidenced the \ndedication of the Anniston Army Depot employees to their nation's \nsoldiers.

I am so proud of their \nperformances and the dignity with which they carried themselves.\n  This year, the United States had another spectacular Games, and I am \nparticularly pleased that Californians had much to do with our success. \nSome of this year's most memorable moments involved athletes from \nCalifornia: Marion Jones was the first woman ever to medal in five \ntrack and field events, Sean Burroughs helped our baseball team snatch \ngold from a heavily favored Cuban Team, Eric Fonoimoana and Dain \nBlanton won gold in the beach volleyball tournament, Venus Williams was \nthe second woman ever to win gold medals in both singles and doubles \ntennis, and Lisa Leslie led the women's basketball team to its 34th \nOlympic championship.\n  The Olympics have long been the world's premiere stage where athletes \ncompete; their performances are inspiring and, sometimes, heart-\nbreaking. And while the world enjoys two weeks of drama and intense \ncompetition, we must remember that these athletes have chased their \nOlympic dreams for years, even decades, with perseverance and courage. \nI thank each athlete--qualifier and medal winner alike--for giving us \nthe privilege of witnessing their triumphs. Each performance was a very \npersonal moment in these athletes' lives, and I am inspired by their \ncourage and resolve to pursue their Olympic dreams. These athletes \ncompeted with all their heart and they make California proud.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following names of the medal winning \nathletes from California be printed in the Record.\n       Aaron Peirsol, Silver medal, Swimming--Men's 200 Meter \n     Backstroke.\n       Amanda Beard, Bronze Medal, Swimming--Women's 200 Meter \n     Breaststroke.\n       Venus Williams, Gold Medal, Tennis--Women's Singles;

Every year these Marines \nget together for the Marine Corps Birthday Ball in Bozeman to honor the \ntradition of the Marines as well as recognize one of their own. Bob \ncertainly deserves to be the one honored.\n  Bob enlisted in the Marines in December 1941, even though he worked \nin an essential industry--meat packing--and could have accepted a \ndeferment. After training in San Diego, he left for the South Pacific. \nThere he helped guard the Samoa Islands and took part in the fierce \ncombat in the Allied efforts to take Guadalcanal and the Marshall and \nGilbert Islands.\n  Later in the war, Bob used his combat experience to train other \ninfantry before they headed to the front lines. No doubt his work \nhelped save hundreds of lives and contributed to the victory that saved \nthe world from tyranny.\n  There really are no words that I can say to adequately thank Bob \nEllerd, but I can express my appreciation from a grateful nation. Bob \nis one reason we now call it the Greatest Generation, and they couldn't \nhave a picked a better Marine of the Year. Thank you Bob, and Semper \nFi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11125-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO JOHN F. GARDE UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto a constituent from Illinois, John F. Garde. Mr. Garde will soon be \nretiring as the Executive Director of the American Association of Nurse \nAnesthetists, AANA, after 17 years of service. I am very pleased to \nhonor the distinguished career of John F. Garde for his contributions \nto the practice of anesthesia from my state of Illinois.\n  The AANA is the professional association that represents over 27,000 \npracticing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Founded in \n1931, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists is the \nprofessional association representing CRNAs nationwide. As you may \nknow, CRNAs administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics given to \npatients each year in the United States. CRNAs provide anesthetics for \nall types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia provider in \ntwo-thirds of all rural hospitals, affording these medical facilities \nobstetrical, surgical and trauma stablization capabilities. They work \nin every setting in which anesthesia is delivered including hospital \nsurgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical \ncenters, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, and plastic \nsurgeons.\n  John received his anesthesia training in 1957 from St. Francis \nHospital School of Anesthesia in LaCrosse, WI and began practicing at \nthe U.S. Public Health Hospital in Detroit, Michigan the following \nyear. Having been a provider of anesthesia for numerous years he became \nan Associate Professor and Chairman of the Department of Anesthesia at \nWayne State University, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health in 1975. \nUsing this experience, he then became the Education Director of the \nAANA in Park Ridge, IL in 1980 before taking his current role as \nExecutive Director in 1983. He accolades range from propelling nurse \nanesthesia programs into a graduate framework resulting in 50 per cent \nof them moving into the College of Nursing, as well as establishing the \nInternational Federation of Nurse Anesthetists (IFNA) during his tenure \nwith the AANA. John has served the AANA as a member, board member, past \npresident, and now will be retiring as a very celebrated executive \ndirector among his peers.\n  Mr. Garde has many honors to follow his list of career \naccomplishments. John was inducted as a fellow of the American Academy \nof Nursing in 1994. In 1999 the Association of Chicagoland recognized \nhim for his outstanding contributions to the Association community, \npresenting him with the John C. Thiel Distinguished Service Award.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. John F. \nGarde, CRNA, MS, FAAN, for his notable career and outstanding \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11125-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VAUGHAN TAYLOR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Mr. Vaughan Taylor, a Jacksonville, North Carolina, attorney \nand his wife Linda for their heroic efforts to help save the lives of \nthree of the crew members aboard the Frisco, a Virginia Beach fishing \nvessel.\n  Avid sailors, Vaughan and Linda are no strangers to the perils of the \nsea. As Vaughan navigated their 40 foot sailboat, Legacy, off the \nshores of North Carolina, he encountered a pile of floating wreckage. \nWhat he did not expect to find were three members of the Lynnhaven \nbased scalloper, Frisco. It had been more than eight hours since a \nfreighter had emerged from the fog, crushing the Frisco and leaving its \ncrew of four clinging to debris in the dead of night.\n  Knowing that their boat was not only low on fuel in bad weather, but \nalso dangerously testing the limit to his radio's frequency, Vaughan \nand Linda pushed ahead, determined to rescue these men. After radioing \nfor help from anyone who could hear his plea, Vaughan sprang to action \naboard the sailboat and began to haul the first member of the crew out \nof the water. Time was of the essence as he struggled to pull the other \ncrew member from the water. Unable to fight against the weight of his \nwater logged survival suit, Vaughan secured the survivor to the boat \nwith a life preserver and tight line.\n  Using their years of experience at sea, Vaughan and his wife risked \ntheir own safety to save the lives of these men. By treating them for \nhypothermia, they were able to avoid a fatal tragedy for these men. \nConcentrating on getting the men the five miles back to shore safely, \nVaughan hoisted the sails, kept in touch with the U.S. Coast Guard and \nbegan cruising at top speeds towards the Chesapeake Bay. Ending the \nheroic crusade with the credit of saving these lives, and only a mere \n.8 gallons of gas to spare, Vaughan Taylor serves as a positive role \nmodel for all those who venture into the high seas.\n  In all that Vaughan Taylor approaches, he gives unbridled efforts, \nand stops at nothing short of success. As has been the case in his work \nfor U.S. personnel missing in action and their families, Vaughan \ncontinuously fights for the rights of others. He is also one of the \nmost well-respected attorneys representing military personnel who need \nhelp, and his knowledge of the uniform code of military justice is \nsecond to none. It comes as no surprise that he would risk his own life \nwith his wife by his side, to save his fellow man. I am proud to call \nVaughan Taylor a close friend of mine, and I applaud his devotion to \nhumanitarian causes.\n  Mr. President, also let me express my sympathy to the family of \nCaptain Charlie Peel, the owner of the Frisco, who, unfortunately was \nnever found. He was very much respected by all of the waterman in \nLynnhaven Inlet, and was like a father to the others aboard the Frisco. \nI am sure he will be missed, and is in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11126-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11126-S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11126]]\n              UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE AT ISLIP, NEW YORK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on October 16 the new United \nStates Courthouse at Islip, New York, was dedicated in a splendid \nceremony at which the distinguished architect Richard Meier spoke, in \nthe company of Robert A. Peck, the singularly gifted Commissioner of \nthe Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration.\n  The ceremony was splendid for the simple reason that the courthouse \nis magnificent. Perhaps the finest public building of our era. \nCertainly the finest courthouse. And it could never have happened save \nfor the Design Excellence Program Commissioner Peck has put in place \nwith his characteristic compound of genius and persistence.\n  Major Peck, as he is known to his friends (he was a Green Beret \nofficer), is a public servant of unexampled ability and achievement. \nHis record is known to all. Some number of years ago when he was \ncounsel to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, he put \ntogether for the Committee a slide show consisting of photographs of \nearly public buildings in early America. He did not plead his case; he \nmade it. The buildings exude a confidence and expectation that clearly \nexplain the endurance of American democracy. I recall in particular a \nwhite wooden-frame courthouse in Rhode Island. Graceful, serene, \nunthreatening yet equally forceful. Of a sudden it came to us. As \nnowhere else on earth, the courthouse is a symbol of government in the \nUnited States. Go to London, go to Paris. There are courthouses, or at \nleast courtrooms there. If you can find them. Amidst the cathedrals and \nthe palaces, and to be sure, the buildings of the legislature. Here it \nis different. The courthouse square is where folk gather.\n  The Nation owes Robert A. Peck more than it will ever know. But this \nwould hardly matter to him. As the time approaches when he will leave \ngovernment, he takes with him the knowledge of his singular public \nservice.\n  I ask that Major Peck's address on the occasion of the courthouse \ndedication be included in the Record at this point, along with a brief \nsummary of his service.\n  The material follows:\n\n Robert A. Peck, Commissioner, GSA Public Building Service, 16 October \n                                  2000\n\n       Building partners, GSA colleagues, and distinguished \n     guests; may it please the court: This is a fine day, a great \n     day for this Court, for New York, for Long Island and for us \n     in the General Services Administration. But more important \n     still, we might well someday regard this as the day that \n     marked the full flowering of a renaissance in public building \n     in America.\n       At the turn of another century, at this season exactly two \n     hundred years ago, the White House and the Capitol were \n     occupied, if not quite completed, in Washington. It is not by \n     chance that they quickly became the architectural icons of \n     American democracy. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson \n     intended them to be just that. They conscientiously sought to \n     erect Federal buildings of a scale, style and quality that \n     would reflect the noble origins and intentions of the new \n     government.\n       And so began a tradition of American public building that \n     would, for a century and a half, produce some of the finest \n     buildings in America. The federal government built \n     courthouses, post offices, land offices and custom houses all \n     over the expanding nation. You can see photos of Federal \n     buildings of imposing stature, constructed of enduring \n     materials and elegantly detailed, sitting on unpaved streets \n     in what were literally one-horse towns. The buildings \n     simultaneously planted the flag and put the towns on the map. \n     The government was proud to build them and the townspeople \n     were proud to have them. States and cities followed suit with \n     stately civic buildings, malls, and memorials.\n       Then, after World War II, something happened. As the scale \n     of government increased, public buildings diminished. Not in \n     size, but in accomplishment. Just as GSA was being founded, \n     fifty-one years ago, public architecture fell into decline \n     and, quickly, into deserved disrepute.\n       As in so many other things, there was a brief shining \n     moment for public architecture in the Kennedy Administration. \n     Drafted by a then-special assistant to the Secretary of \n     Labor, one Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a set of Guiding \n     Principles for Federal Architecture appeared from nowhere. \n     Certainly no one had asked for them. The Principles called \n     for federal architecture which is ``distinguished and which \n     will reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of \n     the American National Government.'' But the Kennedy era \n     produced few buildings and, in any event, the spark didn't \n     ignite.\n       GSA would try on occasion. I was witness to one noteworthy \n     hearing in the first or second year of Senator Moynihan's \n     first term in which a GSA official, pointing to a tepid \n     design, said the government was trying to put the poetry back \n     in its architecture. Senator Moynihan advised, ``better try \n     to learn the prose first.''\n       Look at this building. Walt Whitman does come to mind, or \n     perhaps Mozart or Copland, if architecture is indeed frozen \n     music.\n       GSA is now some forty buildings into the largest public \n     buildings program since that of the 1930's. We are turning \n     out building after building, mostly courthouses but also \n     office buildings, border stations and even laboratories, that \n     meet the test of the Guiding Principles.\n       GSA's Design Excellence Program has changed our \n     expectations for public architecture. Members of Congress \n     from both parties and local community leaders now demand \n     quality from us. Many cities are following suit and are \n     hiring the best designers they can find to build new civic \n     structures, in so doing reviving their own traditions born in \n     the City Beautiful movement of a century ago.\n       Inside GSA, Design Excellence has spurred us to demand \n     higher quality of ourselves, not just in architecture but in \n     all that we do. We aspire to build historic landmarks for the \n     next generation. Just as so many Federal buildings of the \n     19th and early 20th century have become local landmarks that \n     citizens rally to defend, so we are determined that our new \n     buildings will stir affectionate and passionate defenders in \n     the years to come.\n       Richard Meier's accomplishment here sets a mark that will \n     be hard to surpass but that challenges us to accept nothing \n     short of the inspirational when we build.\n       GSA in this Administration made a bold decision to pursue \n     design excellence. All praise is due to GSA's chief \n     architect, Ed Feiner, a native of New York City and his GSA \n     colleague, Marilyn Farley, who persevered through years of \n     indifferent response inside GSA to become the architects of \n     our Design Excellence process. In his New Yorker review of \n     this building, Paul Goldberger said the GSA was a much more \n     enlightened client for Richard Meier than was at least one \n     other well-known client of his. To Ed and Marilyn go much of \n     the credit for this.\n       We are fortunate to have as our clients in this, as in so \n     many of our projects, the federal judiciary. They are not \n     easy clients, as you might expect of those with lifetime \n     tenure who are used to having the final say. But they are the \n     best clients, because they care about the quality of the \n     buildings in which they carry out perhaps the most sensitive \n     function in our society. Judge Wexler has lived and breathed \n     this building for a long, long time and we are all in his \n     debt.\n       At these dedications, those of us who speak--the judges and \n     the architects excluded--often have had little to do with the \n     day to day agonies and triumphs of seeing a project like this \n     to completion. So thanks to the GSA project managers, the \n     construction managers, the architect's team and the builders, \n     those who sat here in the construction trailers, who hammered \n     out the details and who worked in the prose of budgets and \n     schedules. And thanks to the construction workers, too often \n     overlooked as we congratulate each other.\n       Again, thank you to Richard Meier. Your building is at once \n     a structure that stirs emotion and embodies reason, a \n     building that at once demonstrates the power of large ideas \n     and proves, as Mies van der Rohe said, that god is in the \n     details.\n       May I sound a few cautionary notes and, in this political \n     season, petition for help? We have retained our way on public \n     architecture only recently, to the enduring benefit of our \n     people, our communities and our policy. But we could regress.\n       There are still some, not many, thankfully, who would limit \n     budgets to such a degree that we would be putting up throw-\n     away buildings. GSA has combined judicious and vigorous \n     budget-setting with our design excellence procedures to make \n     sure that we build with prudence as well as with grace.\n       There are some, again not many, who think GSA should build \n     in a ``traditional'' style, whatever that means. At the turn \n     of the last century, the federal government did decree an \n     official style. As happens too frequently in government, what \n     started out as a declaration in favor of a fresh idea \n     remained in force so long that it prevented the government \n     from keeping up with changing times. The Guiding Principles \n     wisely forbade the government from having an official style \n     and directed instead that the government take architectural \n     direction from the best practitioners in the private design \n     community. We need support in building buildings like this \n     one, a striking and ennobling structure of and for the 21st \n     century.\n       And finally, there is the nation's understandable concern \n     with security. We must build buildings like this one, that \n     intelligently and rationally counter likely and deterrable \n     risks. We must not and need not wall off our public buildings \n     and our public servants from the public they are intended to \n     serve. We must not let the terrorists become our most \n     influential architects.\n       Everyone in GSA who has had anything to do with this \n     project will be proud as long we he or she lives that we had \n     even a small role in giving New York and the nation this \n     temple of democracy. We are proud to be building buildings \n     worthy of the American people--none so worthy as this.\n\n[[Page S11127]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                             Robert A.

He was also a Special Forces (Green Beret) officer \n     in the U.S. Army Reserve.\n       Mr. Peck received his B.A., cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, with \n     distinction in economics, from the University of Pennsylvania \n     in 1969 and his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1972.

Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to join \nthe Secretary of Defense in recognizing General Peter Schoomaker, a man \nwhose lifetime of service commemorates the very spirit on which our \ngreat country was founded. General Schoomaker's distinguished military \ncareer will draw to a close on October 27, 2000, when he steps down \nfrom his position as Commander in Chief of the United States Special \nOperations Command.\n  General Schoomaker has always demonstrated a commitment to excellence \nand service. Since being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1969, \nupon graduation from the University of Wyoming, his commitment to serve \nhas provided him with the foundation of a lifetime of success. He has \nserved at all levels in conventional and special operations and \nparticipated in numerous contingency operations, ranging from Desert \nOne in Iran through Uphold Democracy in Haiti. He currently shoulders \nthe responsibility for all special operations of the Army, Navy, and \nAir Force, both active and reserve.\n  Clearly, General Schoomaker has been a pivotal and talented player on \nthe national security stage, but his measure as a man goes beyond the \nprofession at which he excels. General Schoomaker's quest for \nexcellence began early when he was a defensive lineman for the \nUniversity of Wyoming football team which won the 1967 Sugar Bowl. \nThese memories rank high on his list of notable achievements, primarily \nbecause of the teamwork it took to succeed. Fostering a spirit of \nteamwork continues to be the guiding force in General Schoomaker's \nleadership philosophy, and his enduring legacy for the service \nepitomizes the concepts he learned long ago on the gridiron.\n  Mr. President, the people of Wyoming have been blessed with a long \nlist of servicemen and women who are willing to put the needs of other \nin front of their own. Today, I have the opportunity to celebrate an \nadopted son of my home state, General Peter Schoomaker, a man who \nembodies the qualities of determination, self-sacrifice, and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11127-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN RECOGNITION OF DEBORAH V.H.

As members of the Glen Ridge community, Ms. Cook and \nMs. Buekema have demonstrated an extraordinarily high level of \ncommitment and selflessness to which we should all strive to achieve.\n  However, the impact of their service reaches far beyond the \nclassroom. Both Ms. Cook and Ms. Buekema have dedicated themselves to \ncreating a supportive and productive environment for the youth of Glen \nRidge. They have helped to shape the minds and encourage the spirit of \nthese young individuals during a crucial stage of development in their \nlives.\n  Ms. Cook's and Ms. Buekema's accomplishments, throughout their years \nof service, reflect only a small portion of the many contributions they \nhave made to the people of Glen Ridge. Their efforts have touched the \nlives of their students as well as those throughout their community.\n  They are an example of the professionalism that we look for in our \neducators, and the type of citizens that we hope to find in our \nneighborhoods, which is why their dedication is to be recognized and \ncommended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11127-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING OF PHYLLIS E. THOMPSON\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a remarkable \nNevadan, Phyllis Thompson. Phyllis has been a resident of Henderson, \nNevada since 1951. On November 1, 2000, she will be receiving the \nPhilanthropy Day Award from St. Rose Dominican Hospital. The \nPhilanthropy Day Award honors individuals who embody volunteerism and \nhave made significant civic and charitable contributions. There is no \none more deserving of this honor than Phyllis Thompson.\n  Phyllis Thompson is a talented and tenacious businesswoman. She \nentered the construction business in the early 1970s, an all-male field \nat the time. She and her husband Charles started Basic Ready Mix with \none truck, and she had to work nights as a waitress to make ends meet. \nEventually, she was able to expand the business to 175 trucks. She sold \nthe company in 1991, but she could not stay retired for long. In 1996, \nshe founded Phyllis E. Thompson Companies, a commercial real estate \nfirm, which she has built into an unequivocal success.\n  Not only has Phyllis Thompson accomplished a great deal in the \nbusiness world, but she has also enjoyed success as a sportsman. She \nhas been hunting trophy deer for twenty years and is a professional \noff-road racer. In 1997, she won the Nevada Prim 250, a 250 mile off-\nroad race.\n  Throughout her extraordinary life, Phyllis Thompson's true devotion \nhas been to family. She is the proud mother of two children, Lonny and \nTerri, and has been blessed with six grandchildren. In addition, her \ncharitable work has been focused on helping families. St. Rose \nDominican Hospital, the Salvation Army, Boys & Girls Clubs of \nHenderson, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Safe House, and Child Seekers \nare among the many organizations to which she has given so much. In \nfact, she was recognized in 1999 as Board Member of the Year by the \nBoys & Girls Clubs of Henderson.\n  Philanthropy Day, established in 1986, is observed every November to \nrecognize the importance of philanthropy in our communities. It is a \ntime to acknowledge the entire spectrum of services provided by the \nnon-profit community, and recognize the profound effect that \nvolunteerism and giving have on the fabric of society.\n  Phyllis Thompson embodies the spirit of Philanthropy Day. She has \nshared her success and good fortune through volunteerism and \nphilanthropy. She sets a wonderful example for all of our citizens, \nselflessly giving of her time, talent and financial means to help \nothers make the most of their lives. I thank her for their friendship \nand all that she has done for the citizens of Nevada.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11128-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11128]]\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11128-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11128-S11129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS \n  TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 136\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n                                     The White House, October 26, 2000.\n\n President's Periodic Report on the National Emergency With Respect to \n         Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia\n\n       I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since \n     my last concerning the national emergency with respect to \n     significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia that \n     was declared in Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995 \n     (the ``Order''). This report is submitted pursuant to section \n     401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), \n     and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act (``IEEPA''), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c). Sanctions imposed \n     against significant narcotics traffickers centered in \n     Colombia pursuant to Executive Order 12978 are separate from, \n     and independent of, sanctions imposed pursuant to the Foreign \n     Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Act (Pub. L. 106-120, Title \n     VIII). This report covers sanctions imposed and persons named \n     as specially designated narcotics traffickers pursuant to \n     Executive Order 12978, but does not cover those persons \n     identified pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \n     Designation Act, who are addressed in a separate report as \n     provided in that Act.\n       1. On October 21, 1995, I signed Executive Order 12978, \n     ``Blocking Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with \n     Significant Narcotics Traffickers'' (the ``Order'') (60 Fed. \n     Reg. 54579, October 24, 1995). The Order blocks all property \n     and interests in property that are or hereafter come within \n     the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the \n     possession or control of U.S. persons, in which there is any \n     interest of four individuals named as significant foreign \n     narcotics traffickers. These traffickers, two of whom are now \n     decreased, were listed in the Annex to the Order and \n     identified as principals in the so-called Cali drug cartel \n     centered in Colombia. The Order also blocks the property and \n     interests in property of foreign persons determined by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of State, (a) to play a significant \n     role in international narcotics trafficking centered in \n     Colombia, or (b) materially to assist in or provide financial \n     or technological support for, or goods or service in support \n     of, the narcotics trafficking activities of persons \n     designated in or pursuant to the Order. In addition, the \n     Order blocks all property and interests in property of \n     persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     State, to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on \n     behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to the Order \n     (collectively ``Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers'' \n     or ``SDNTs'').\n       The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a \n     U.S. person or within the United States in property or \n     interests in property of SDNTs, and any transaction that \n     evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or \n     attempts to violate, the prohibitions contained in the Order.\n       Designations of foreign persons blocked pursuant to the \n     Order are effective upon the date of determination by the \n     Director of the Department of the Treasury's Office of \n     Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') acting under authority \n     delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice of \n     blocking is effective upon the date of filing with the \n     Federal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n       2. On October 24, 1995, the Department of the Treasury \n     issued a Notice containing 76 additional names of persons \n     determined to meet the criteria set forth in the Order. \n     Additional Notices expanding and updating the list of SDNTs \n     were published on November 29, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 61288), \n     March 8, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 9523), and January 21, 1997 (62 \n     Fed. Reg. 2903).\n       Effective February 28, 1997, OFAC issued the Narcotics \n     Trafficking Sanctions Regulations (``NTSR'' or the \n     ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 536, to further implement \n     the President's declaration of a national emergency and \n     imposition of sanctions against significant foreign narcotics \n     traffickers centered in Colombia (62 Fed. Reg. 9959, March 5, \n     1997).\n       On April 17, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 19500, April 22, 1997), \n     July 30, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 41850, August 4, 1997), September \n     9, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 48177, September 15, 1997), and June 1, \n     1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 29608, June 1, 1998), OFAC amended the \n     appendices to 31 C.F.R. chapter V, revising information \n     concerning individuals and entities who have been determined \n     to play a significant role in international narcotics \n     trafficking centered in Colombia or have been determined to \n     be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, or \n     to be acting as fronts for the Cali cartel in Colombia.\n       On May 27, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 28896, May 27, 1998), OFAC \n     amended the appendices to 31 C.F.R. chapter V by expanding \n     the list for the first time beyond the Cali cartel by adding \n     the name of one of the leaders of Colombia's North Coast \n     cartel Julio Cesar Nasser David, who has been determined to \n     play a significant role in international narcotics \n     trafficking centered in Colombia, and 14 associated \n     businesses and four individuals acting as fronts for the \n     North Coast cartel. Also added were six companies and one \n     individual that have been determined to be owned or \n     controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, or to be acting \n     as fronts for the Cali cartel in Colombia. These changes to \n     the previous SDNT list brought it to a total of 451 \n     businesses and individuals.\n       On June 25, 1999, OFAC amended the appendices to 31 C.F.R. \n     chapter V by adding the names of eight individuals and 41 \n     business entities acting as fronts for the Cali or North \n     Coast cartels and supplementary information concerning 44 \n     individuals already on the list (64 Fed. Reg. 34984, June 30, \n     1999). The entries for four individuals previously listed as \n     SDNTs were removed from appendix A because OFAC had \n     determined that these individuals no longer meet the criteria \n     for designation as SDNTs. These actions were part of the \n     ongoing interagency implementation of the Order. The addition \n     of these 41 business entities and eight individuals to \n     appendix A (and the removal of four individuals) brought the \n     total number of SDNTs to 496 (comprised of five principals, \n     195 entities, and 296 individuals) with whom financial and \n     business dealings are prohibited and whose assets are blocked \n     under the Order.\n       3. On March 29, 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 17590, April 4, 2000), \n     OFAC amended the appendices to 31 C.F.R. chapter V by \n     expanding the SDNT list beyond the Cali cartel for the second \n     time by adding the names of two of the leaders of Colombia's \n     North Valle drug cartel, Ivan and Julio Fabio Urdinola \n     Grajales, who have been determined to play a significant role \n     in international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia, \n     and six associated businesses and two individuals acting as \n     fronts for the North Valle cartel. Also added were 14 \n     companies and 7 individuals that have been determined to be \n     owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, the \n     Cali cartel in Colombia. The entry for one individual \n     previously listed as an SDNT was removed from appendix A \n     because OFAC had determined that the individual no longer met \n     the criteria for designation as an SDNT. These changes to the \n     previous SDNT list brought it to a total of 526 businesses \n     and individuals.\n       On June 1, 2000, OFAC announced the removal of two \n     individuals previously listed as SDNTs because OFAC had \n     determined that the two individuals no longer met the \n     criteria for designation as SDNTs. These changes to the \n     previous list brought it to a total of 524 businesses and \n     individuals.\n       On August 18, 2000, OFAC expanded the SDNT list beyond the \n     Cali cartel for the third time by adding the names of \n     Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya, a leader of one of the most \n     powerful drug trafficking groups that comprise Colombia's \n     North Valle drug cartel, and Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia, who \n     have been determined to play a significant role in \n     international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia, and \n     five associated businesses and one individual acting as \n     fronts for the North Valle cartel. These changes to the \n     previous SDNT list brought it to a total of 532 (comprised of \n     nine principals, 220 entities, and 303 individuals) with \n     whom financial and business dealings are prohibited and \n     whose assets are blocked under the Order. The list of \n     SDNTs now includes kingpins, associates, and businesses \n     from Colombia's Cali, North Valle, and North Coast drug \n     cartels. The SDNT list will continue to be expanded to \n     include additional drug trafficking organizations centered \n     in Colombia and their fronts.\n       4. OFAC has disseminated and routinely updated details of \n     this program to the financial, securities, and international \n     trade communities by both electronic and conventional media. \n     In addition to bulletins to banking institutions via the \n     Federal Reserve System and the Clearing House Interbank \n     Payments System (CHIPS), individual notices were provided to \n     all relevant state and federal regulatory agencies, automated\n\n[[Page S11129]]\n\n     clearing houses, and state and independent banking \n     associations across the country. OFAC contacted all major \n     securities industry associations and regulators. It posted \n     electronic notices on the Internet and numerous computer \n     bulletin boards, fax-on-demand services, and provided the \n     same material to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota for distribution \n     to U.S. companies operating in Colombia.\n       5. During the reporting period, as of September 6, 2000, \n     seven financial transactions totaling more than $203,000 were \n     reported to OFAC as having been blocked. These funds will \n     remain in that status pending investigation by OFAC. As of \n     September 6, 2000, OFAC had issued 18 specific licenses \n     pursuant to the Order since the inception of the program. \n     These licenses were issued in accordance with established \n     Treasury policy authorizing the completion of pre-sanctions \n     transactions, the receipt of payment of legal fees for \n     representation of SDNTs in proceedings within the United \n     states arising from the imposition of sanctions, and certain \n     administrative transactions. In addition, a license was \n     issued to authorize a U.S. company in Colombia to make \n     certain payments to two SDNT-owned entities in Colombia \n     (currently under the control of the Colombian government) for \n     services provided to the U.S. company in connection with the \n     U.S. company's occupation of office space and business \n     activities in Colombia.\n       6. The narcotics trafficking sanctions have had a \n     significant impact on the Colombian drug cartels. SDNTs have \n     been forced out of business or are suffering financially. Of \n     the 220 business entities designated as SDNTs as of September \n     6, 2000, nearly 60, with an estimated aggregate income of \n     more than $230 million, had been liquidated or were in the \n     process of liquidation. Some SDNT companies have attempted to \n     continue to operate through changes in their company names \n     and/or corporate structures. OFAC has placed a total of 27 of \n     these successor companies on the SDNT list under their new \n     company names.\n       As a result of OFAC designations, Colombian banks have \n     closed nearly 500 SDNT accounts, affecting more than 200 \n     SDNTs. One of the largest SDNT commercial entities, a \n     discount drugstore with an annual income exceeding $136 \n     million, has been reduced to operating on a cash basis. \n     Another large SDNT commercial entity, a supermarket with an \n     annual income exceeding $32 million, entered liquidation in \n     November 1998 despite changing its name to evade the \n     sanctions. An SDNT professional soccer team was forced to \n     reject an invitation to play in the United States, two of its \n     directors resigned, and the team now suffers restrictions \n     affecting its business negotiations, loans, and banking \n     operations. An SDNT radio station has had difficulty in \n     getting advertisers since its inclusion on the SDNT list. \n     These specific results augment the less quantifiable but \n     significant impact of denying the designated individuals and \n     entities of the Colombian drug cartels access to U.S. \n     financial and commercial facilities.\n       Various enforcement actions carried over from prior \n     reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \n     violations are being aggressively pursued. Since the last \n     report, OFAC has collected no civil monetary penalties but is \n     continuing to process three cases for violations of the \n     Regulations.\n       7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the \n     six-month period from April 21, through October 20, 2000, \n     that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and \n     authorities conferred by the declaration of the national \n     emergency with respect to Significant Narcotics Traffickers \n     are estimated at approximately $570,000. Personnel costs were \n     largely centered in the Department of the Treasury \n     (particularly in the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the \n     U.S. Customs Service, and the Office of the General Counsel), \n     the Department of Justice, and the Department of State. This \n     data does not reflect certain costs of operations by the \n     intelligence and law enforcement communities.\n       8. Executive Order 12978 provides this Administration with \n     a tool for combating the actions of significant foreign \n     narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the \n     unparalleled violence, corruption, and harm that they cause \n     in the United States and abroad. The Order is designed to \n     deny these traffickers the benefit of any assets subject to \n     the jurisdiction of the United States and the benefit of \n     trade with the United States by preventing U.S. persons from \n     engaging in any commercial dealings with them, their front \n     companies, and their agents. Executive Order 12978 and its \n     associated SDNT list demonstrate the United States' \n     commitment to end the damage that such traffickers wreak upon \n     society in the United States and abroad. The SDNT list will \n     continue to be expanded to include additional Colombian drug \n     trafficking organizations and their fronts.\n       The magnitude and the dimension of the problem in \n     Colombia--perhaps the most pivotal country of all in terms of \n     the world's cocaine trade--are extremely grave. I shall \n     continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply \n     economic sanctions against significant foreign narcotics \n     traffickers and their violent and corrupting activities as \n     long as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to \n     report periodically to the Congress on significant \n     developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/26/senate-section/article/S11129-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11129-S11130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 2812.

A bill to enhance fair and open competition in the \nproduction and sale of agricultural commodities; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\n              agricultural producer protection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Agricultural Producer \nProtection Act of 2000, a bill which will help ensure an open \ncompetitive agricultural marketplace. There is no issue raising more \nconcerns in agriculture today than the rapid increase of economic \nconcentration and vertical integration. The structure of agriculture \nand the entire agribusiness and food sector is being massively \ntransformed--and the pace is accelerating. Large agribusinesses through \nmergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances are controlling more and \nmore of the production and processing of our agricultural commodities. \nBeyond this horizontal concentration, these large firms are relying on \nproduction and marketing contracts to hasten the trend toward vertical \nintegration in agriculture.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, the top four fed cattle \npackers control 80 percent of the market, while the top four pork \nprocessors control almost 60 percent of the market. In the grain \nindustry, the top four firms control 73 percent of the wet corn \nmilling, 71 percent of soybean milling, and 56 percent of flour \nmilling. This conglomeration of power is limiting producers' marketing \nchoices and adversely affecting the prices they receive. While the \nmarket basket of food has only increased by 3 percent since 1984, the \nfarm value of that market basket has plummeted 38 percent. In fact, the \nfarmer's share of the retail food dollar has dropped from 47 percent in \n1950 to 21 percent in 1999. In addition, the farm-to-wholesale price \nspreads for pork increased by 52 percent and for beef by 24 percent in \nthe past five years.\n  But farmers are not the only ones at risk because of the \nconglomeration of economic power by a few large agribusinesses and the \nreductions in competition. Consumers are also at risk. I liken \narrangement to an hourglass, with many farmers on one side and many \nconsumers on the other side. In the middle is a choke point with just a \nfew large agribusiness firms. We, as consumers, should not become \nreliant on an every dwindling number of companies for our food.\n  Agribusiness is changing the way they play the game and it is \nbecoming increasingly clear that enforcement of the antitrust and \ncompetition laws--including the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the \nFederal Trade Commission Act, and the Packers and Stockyards Act--is \nnot enough by itself to ensure healthy competition in agriculture. \nCongress must step in and clarify the rules of the game before the big \nconglomerates push the independent producers out entirely. That is what \nmy legislation is designed to do.\n  Consolidation and vertical integration in the agricultural sector is \nresulting in a great disparity in bargaining power and a gross \ninequality in economic strength between agribusinesses and producers. \nThe impacts of this disparity are being most dramatically seen in the \nincreased use of contracting in agriculture. I recognize that it is \nprobably inevitable that there will be more contracting for a number of \nreasons. However, as recognized by several state Attorneys General who \nhave proposed model state contract legislation, contracting with large \nagribusinesses pose serious problems that our current laws do not \nreach.\n  First, large companies are increasingly leveraging their economic \nmuscle and control of market information to dictate contract terms to \nthe detriment of producers. Large companies often offer contracts to \nproducers on a ``take it or leave it'' basis. The company tells the \nfarmer to sign a form contract with no opportunity to negotiate \ndifferent terms and with little or no ability to take time to think \nabout whether or not to sign the contract.\n  Second, large agribusinesses are transferring a disproportionate \nshare of the economic risks to farmers through contracts. The \ncontractual risks producers will face under a contract are usually \nburied in pages of legalese and fine print. Producers are often stuck \nwith unfair contract terms they did not even know existed because of \nthe lack of opportunity to consult with an attorney or an accountant.\n  Third, increasing use of contracts threatens market transparency. \nPrevailing prices for agricultural commodities have traditionally been \nreadily available through public transactions. The use of strict \nconfidentiality clauses in contracts veil transactions in secrecy. \nThese clauses prohibit farmers from comparing contracts and negotiating \nfor a fair deal. Farmers are often prohibited from discussing their \ndeals with other producers, let alone with a financial or market \nadvisor, an attorney, or an accountant.\n  Fourth, once a producer enters into a contractual relationship with a \ncompany there is virtually no realistic protection from unfair \npractices, abuses, or retaliation. Most production contracts require \nproducers to make substantial long term capital investments in \nbuildings and equipment prior to ever getting a contract. Once a \nproducer makes the financial commitment, they are offered short term \ncontracts that must be continually renewed. Because of these financial \nobligations, producers often have no other alternative than to sign \nwhatever contract is offered to them. This situation not only makes it \neasier for a company to retaliate against those who try to speak up for \ntheir rights but also eliminates virtually any bargaining power the \nproducer may have had. They often have no other alternative than to \ntake a contract which further exploits them with unfair terms and which \nfurther shifts the economic risks to producers. In addition, if a \nproducer has to litigate individually against an agribusiness \nconglomerate it is very expensive and they are at a huge disadvantage.\n  The Agricultural Producer Protection Act of 2000 provides reasonable \noversight of agricultural contracting that will address these problems \nand promote fair, equitable, and competitive markets in agriculture. \nThe Act would: (1) require contracts to be written in plain language \nand disclose risks to producers; (2) provide contract producers three \ndays to review and cancel production contracts; (3) prohibit \nconfidentiality clauses in contracts; (4) provide producers with a \nfirst-priority lien for payments due under contracts; (5) prohibit \nproducers from having contracts terminated out of retaliation; and (6) \nmake it an unfair practice for processors to retaliate or discriminate \nagainst producers who exercise rights under the Act.\n  My legislation also recognizes that there must be a balance between \nproviding oversight of contracting and addressing the root of the \nproblem--the growing disparity in bargaining power between large \nagribusinesses and independent producers. Independent farmers can \ncompete and thrive if the competition is based on productive efficiency \nand delivering abundant supplies of quality products at reasonable \nprices. But no matter how efficient farmers are, they cannot survive a \ncontest based on who wields the most economic power.\n  Because of the increased levels of concentration and vertical \nintegration in agriculture, it is imperative that Congress facilitate a \nmore competitive and balanced marketplace for negotiations between \nlarge agribusinesses and producers. The Agricultural Producer \nProtection Act of 2000 provides farmers with the tools necessary to \nbargain more effectively with large agribusiness conglomerates for fair \nand truly competitive prices for the commodities they grow.\n  Congress passed the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 to ensure \nthat farmers could join together to market their commodities without \nfear of interference or retribution from processors. Unfortunately, the \nlaw has several weaknesses which prevent it from truly helping \nproducers generate enough market power to bargain effectively with \nlarge processors. The law: (1) does not require that processors bargain \nwith association members; (2) contains a loophole allowing \nagribusinesses to refuse to bargain with producers for any reason \nbesides belonging to an association, which makes it much easier to \nmanufacture an excuse for why they refuse to deal with association \nmembers; and (3) does not give the Secretary of Agriculture authority \nto impose penalties for violations of the Act, which greatly reduces \nthe incentive for processors to obey the law.\n  My legislation addresses these shortcomings. The Agricultural \nProducer Protection Act of 2000 sets up a procedure where farmers can \nvoluntarily\n\n[[Page S11133]]\n\nform an association of producers and petition to the Secretary to \nbecome accredited. Once accredited, agribusinesses are required to \nbargain in good faith with the association of producers. This \nrequirement will help producers organize in order to negotiate fairly \nand effectively on the price and marketing terms for their commodities. \nIn addition, my legislation gives the Secretary increased investigative \nand enforcement authority to ensure that these large processors follow \nthe law.\n  Finally, my legislation amends the Packers and Stockyards Act of 2000 \nto give the Secretary administrative enforcement authority to stop \nunfair practices in the poultry industry. Unlike the livestock \nindustry, the Secretary does not currently have authority to take \nadministrative actions, including holding hearings and assessing civil \nand criminal penalties for violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act \nin the poultry industry. My legislation addresses this discrepancy and \nresponds to the Administration's repeated requests for this authority.\n  Unfortunately, current law has resulted in little being done to stop \nthe rapid consolidation and vertical integration in agriculture which \nis threatening both farmers and consumers. We must address this trend \nnow before it builds more momentum, making independent farmers a \nfootnote in the history books and putting consumers at the mercy of \nlarge agribusiness companies.\n  My legislation attacks the problems resulting from agribusiness \nconcentration and vertical integration in two very fundamental ways. \nFirst, it provides reasonable oversight of contracting practices in \norder to stop the current inequalities and unfair practices farmers are \nfacing due to the lack of bargaining power. But, I also recognize that \nwe must address the increasing disparity in bargaining power head on. \nMy legislation gives producers the tools necessary to enhance their \nbargaining position in order to negotiate fairly and equitably on the \nprice and marketing terms for their commodities. I believe both must be \ndone in order to ensure a fair, open agricultural marketplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3246. A bill to prohibit the importation of any textile or apparel \narticle that is produced, manufactured, or grown in Burma; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               Burma Apparel and Textile Import Ban Bill\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while we are encouraged by democratic \ngains in Serbia, the people of Burma continue to suffer at the hands of \nthe world's most brutal military dictatorship--a regime which, \nperversely, calls itself the State Peace and Development Council \n(SPDC). Now more than ever, as a nation committed to democracy, \nfreedom, and universal human and worker rights, America must dissociate \nitself from Burma's repressive regime. We must do all we can to deny \nany material support to the military dictators who rule that country \nwith an iron fist. Amidst the most recent crackdown on pro-democracy \nforces launched in mid-August, we must demonstrate anew to the Burmese \npeople our recognition of their nightmarish plight and our support for \ntheir noble struggle to achieve democratic governance.\n  A few yeas ago, Congress enacted some sanctions and President Clinton \nissued an Executive Order in response to a prolonged pattern of \negregious human rights violations in Burma. At the heart of those \nmeasures is the existing prohibition on U.S. private companies making \nnew investments in Burma's infrastructure. Pre-1997 investments were \nnot affected.\n  Nevertheless, the ruling military junta in Burma has hung on to power \nand continues to blatantly violate internationally-recognized human and \nworker rights. The most recent State Department Human Rights Country \nReport on Burma cites ``credible reports that Burmese Army soldiers \nhave committed rape, forced porterage, and extrajudicial killing.'' It \nmentions arbitrary arrests and the detention of at least 1300 political \nprisoners.\n  Human Rights Watch/Asia reports that children from ethnic minorities \nare forced to work under inhumane conditions for the Burmese Army, \ndeprived of adequate medical care and sometimes dying from beatings.\n  The UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, just released a chilling and \nalarming account which puts the number of child soldiers at 50,000--the \nhighest in the world. Sadly, the children most vulnerable to \nrecruitment into the military are orphans, street children, and the \nchildren of ethnic minorities.\n  The same UN report also discussed how minorities in Burma continue to \nbe the targets of violence. It deals vicious human rights violations \naimed at minorities including extortion, rape, torture and other forms \nof physical abuse, forced labor, ``portering'', arbitrary arrests, \nlong-term imprisonment, forcible relocation, and in some cases, \nextrajudicial executions. It also cites reports of massacres in the \nShan state in the months of January, February and May of this year.\n  A 1998 International Labor Organization Commission of Inquiry has \ndetermined that forced labor in Burma is practiced in a ``widespread \nand systematic manner, with total disregard for the human dignity, \nsafety, health and basic needs of the people.''\n  In one recent high-profile court case, California District Court \nJudge Ronald Lew found ``ample evidence in the record linking the \nBurmese Government's use of forced labor to human rights abuses.''\n  In sum, gross violations of human rights and systematic labor \nrepression inside Burma go on and on, outside the purview of CNN and \nthe rest of the international media.\n  But despite the onslaught of the Burmese military regime and their \nvow to destroy the National League for Democracy (NLD) by the end of \nthis year. Aung San Suu Kyi, a remarkably courageous leader, stands \nsteadfast--like a living Statue of Liberty--in her work with the \nBurmese people for democracy. We must never forget that she and her NLD \ncolleagues won 392 of 485 seats in a democratic election held in 1990. \nBut they have never been allowed to take office.\n  Still, Aung San Suu Kyi--the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner--and \ncountless others are denied freedom of association, speech and movement \non a daily basis. During the past two and a half months, she has come \nunder renewed threats and intimidation. Last August, her vehicle was \nforced off the road by Burmese security forces when she tried to travel \noutside Rangoon to meet with her NLD colleagues. She sat in her car on \nthe roadside for a week until a midnight raid of 200 riot police forced \nher back to her home and placed her under house arrest until September \n14, 2000. Nevertheless, she tried again on September 21st, but she was \nprevented from boarding a train. The latest pathetic excuse from the \nauthorities for abridging her freedom to travel within Burma on that \noccasion, was that all tickets had been sold out.\n  Mr. President, we must answer anew the cry of the Burmese people and \ntheir courageous leaders. That is why I wrote to President Clinton on \nSeptember 12th and I ask that my letter be included in the Record at \nthis time. In that letter, I spelled out in detail all of the reasons \nwhy a ban on apparel and textile imports from Burma makes good sense. \nAs yet, I don't have a formal reply from the White House.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation today with Senators Leahy, \nWellstone, Hollings, Feingold, Lautenberg, and Schumer to ban soaring \nimports of apparel and textiles from Burma. I am pleased that U.S. \nCongressman Tom Lantos from California is introducing the companion \nbill in the U.S. House of Representatives at the same time.\n  Most Americans think that a trade ban with Burma already exists. This \nis simply not true.\n  In fact, imports of apparel and textiles from Burma are increasing, \nsending hundreds of millions of US dollars straight into the coffers of \nthe Burmese military dictatorship. These ruthless military dictators \nand their drug-trafficking cohorts are spending this hard currency to \npurchase more guns and to buy loyalty among their troops to continue \ntheir policy of repression and cruelty.\n\n  According to the National Labor Committee, U.S. apparel imports from \nBurma between 1995 and 1999 increased\n\n[[Page S11134]]\n\nby 272%. The World Trade Atlas shows that in just one year (1998-1999), \napparel imports more than doubled, dramatically rising from $61 million \nto $131 million. In particular, knit and woven apparel accounted for \nover 80% of US imports from Burma during 1999.\n  In other words, every time American consumers buy travel and sports \nbags, women's underwear, jumpers, shorts, tank tops and towels made in \nthe Burmese gulag, they are unwittingly helping to sustain and tighten \nthe repressive military junta's grip on power.\n  US apparel imports from Burma provide the SPDC with critically-needed \nhard currency because the military dictators directly own or have taken \nde facto control of production in many apparel and textile factories. \nThey profit even more from a 5% export tax. As I said earlier, this \nhard currency is used to buy new weapons and ammunition from China and \nelsewhere, thus underwriting the perpetuation of modern-day slavery, \nforced labor and forced child labor in Burma.\n  But you don't have to take my word for it. At a recent news \nconference in Washington, DC, U Maung Maung, the General Secretary of \nthe Federation of Trade Unions in Burma stated that ``the practice of \npurchasing garments made in Burma extends the continued exploitation of \nmy people, including the use of slave labor by the regime, by further \ndelaying the return of democratic government in Burma.'' At grave \npersonal risk, he and other NLD leaders have disclosed that apparel and \ntextile exports to America and other foreign markets are increasingly \nimportant in helping sustain the Burmese military junta in power.\n  Some may ask whether a ban on Burmese apparel and textile imports \nmight harm American companies and consumers. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Currently, U.S. apparel and textile imports from Burma \naccount for less than one-half of one percent of total US apparel and \ntextile imports.\n  Other may assert that enactment of this legislation would violate WTO \nrules. But if and when the Government of Burma should file a WTO \ncomplaint, I don't think we should shy away from such a case. It would \npresent the opportunity to argue the view that WTO member nations \nshould have the right, at a minimum, to enact laws to block imports of \nproducts made by forced labor or in flagrant violation of other \ninternationally-recognized worker rights. In effect, if national \ngovernments cannot take a stand against trafficking in products made \nwith forced labor in international trade, then under what human rights \nconditions or by what standards of civility will it ever be possible in \nthe WTO system?\n  Mr. President, America must take a stronger stand in solidarity with \nthe Burmese people and in defense of universal human rights and worker \nrights in that besieged nation. Banning apparel and textile imports \nfrom Burma reflects the belief of the American people that increased \ntrade with foreign countries must promote respect for human rights and \nworker rights as well as property rights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2000.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President, Office of the White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express concern that \n     developments in trade between the U.S. and Burma may be \n     strengthening the Burmese military junta. To support the \n     duly-elected democratic government of Burma and promote \n     internationally recognized human and worker rights, and to \n     remedy this inconsistency in U.S. policy toward Burma, a ban \n     on U.S.-Burmese trade in apparel seems warranted.\n       Since the U.S. instituted a ban on new investment in Burma \n     at your initiative in May, 1997, little has changed. The \n     authoritarian regime continues to actively violate human \n     rights and tacitly condone narcotrafficking. A 1998 \n     International Labor Organization (ILO) Commission of Inquiry \n     detailed the military's ``widespread and systematic'' use of \n     forced labor (Attachment 1). The most recent State Department \n     Human Rights Country Report on Burma also addresses forced \n     labor practices and other human rights violations; according \n     to the Report, in March 2000, about 1300 political prisoners \n     remained in detention (Attachment 2). Democratically-elected \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and eight other leaders of the National \n     League for Democracy have been confined to their homes since \n     this Saturday, September 2, in yet another standoff with the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Furthermore, \n     Burma continues to be the world's second leading producer of \n     opium (Attachment 2).\n       I am concerned that allowing rapidly increasing apparel \n     imports from Burma by U.S. importers implicitly supports the \n     SPDC and may undermine the effects of divestment. Between \n     1995 and 1999, Burmese apparel imports by the U.S. \n     skyrocketed by 272% and the trend continues (Attachment 8). \n     Compared with last year's data, apparel imports rose 121% in \n     the first five months of 2000 alone (Attachment 9). As U.S. \n     apparel companies attracted by low production costs increase \n     their apparel orders, critically-needed hard currency \n     earnings in the form of U.S. dollars flow in ever-greater \n     amounts into the coffers of the Burmese military. This \n     revenue is spent on arms from China and elsewhere, further \n     oppressing the Burmese people. We cannot ignore the impact \n     that our dollars are having on the human rights and core \n     labor standards of the people of Burma. Furthermore, a ban on \n     apparel imports would not significantly hurt U.S. businesses \n     or consumers, since Burma accounts for only 0.46% of U.S. \n     apparel imports (Attachment 10).\n       As Burma's economy continues to deteriorate, the apparel \n     industry serves as a valuable lifeline for the SPDC. Both \n     labor and human rights organizations, and prominent leaders \n     of the democratic Burmese government in exile, have \n     emphasized the connection between apparel and Burma's \n     military (Attachment 3 and 4). U Bo Hla Tint, Minister for \n     North and South American Affairs of the National Coalition \n     Government for the Union of Burma, stated in a recent press \n     conference that ``it is the Burmese military that directly \n     owns most of the garment and textile manufacturing facilities \n     in Burma'' (Attachment 5). Furthermore, U Muang Muang, the \n     General Secretary of the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma \n     and the President of the Burma Institute for Democracy and \n     Development, argued in a recent speech that ``the military \n     regime and Burma's drug lords control most commercial \n     activities in Burma and this is especially true of the \n     garment and textile industry. By purchasing garments made in \n     Burma, American companies are directly enriching and \n     strengthening those most brutal and un-democratic elements in \n     Burma that continue to oppress the people'' (Attachment 6). \n     Not only does the SPDC benefit from direct ownership of \n     apparel factories, but also from an export tax of 5% on all \n     apparel leaving Burma (Attachment 7). We should act to curb \n     this significant source of hard currency earnings to the \n     SPDC.\n       A ban on apparel imports from Burma would further \n     demonstrate U.S. opposition to the Burmese military junta and \n     reinforce our commitment to universal human rights and \n     internationally recognized worker rights. In addition, \n     cutting back revenue for the SPDC may help lead to a more \n     rapid demise of that brutal military regime and allow Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy to assume \n     their positions of power in a duly-elected democratic \n     government.\n       I look forward to your reply. Thank you for your attention \n     and thoughtful consideration of my concerns and proposal for \n     a complete ban on apparel imports from Burma.\n           With best regards.\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 3247. A bill to establish a Chief Labor Negotiator in the Office \nof the United States Trade Representative; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           legislation to establish a chief labor negotiator\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am also introducing legislation today \nthat would ensure working men and women the representation they deserve \nin future trade negotiations.\n  The Trade and Labor Negotiation Fairness Act would create a new, \nPresidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed position of Chief Labor \nNegotiator at the United States Trade Representative's USTR office. The \nChief Labor Negotiator would represent the interests of workers during \ntrade negotiations.\n  Nearly three years ago, farmers and others in the U.S. agriculture \nsector felt they needed stronger representation and greater attention \nby USTR. So I called for the creation of a new position at USTR having \nambassadorial rank and devoted solely to representing the U.S. in \nagricultural trade matters. I met with Ambassador Barshefsky and \npursued my proposal in the Administration. Peter Scher was appointed \nearly in 1997 to the new USTR position and was succeeded by Greg \nFrazier. Both of them have done a good job representing U.S. farmers \nand our agriculture sector.\n  Earlier this year, in the Trade and Development Act of 2000, Congress \nspecified in statute that USTR shall\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\nhave a Chief Agricultural Negotiator. That position will exist \nregardless of who is in the White House or USTR. This position would \nhave equal status to that of the Chief Agricultural Negotiator at USTR.\n  Why do we need a Chief Labor Negotiator at USTR? Because the crucial \nrole that worker rights play in the global economy has been ignored for \ntoo long. Enforceable labor standards have been left out of the trade \nagreements the U.S. has negotiated.\n  U.S. working men and women are placed at a disadvantage by this \nunfair competition. If this trend continues, U.S.-based companies will \nface continuing pressure to lower their standards to compete in the \nglobal economy.\n  The result will be depressed wages, fewer benefits, unsafe working \nconditions for American workers, and little or no improvement in other \ncountries.\n  We need to use trade negotiations to raise standards around the \nworld--not drag down standards here at home. We must ensure that labor \nrights are a key consideration in future trade negotiations and an \nintegral part of future trade agreements. The Chief Labor Negotiator's \nprimary job would be to make this happen by ensuring that the interests \nof workers are represented in future trade negotiations.\n  I've heard the argument that other countries don't want to talk about \nlabor rights in trade discussions. USTR needs to take the lead and \ninsist labor standards are an essential part of future trade \nnegotiations. Our own economy and the well being of our families depend \non it. And if trade is truly going to improve living standards around \nthe world, it is essential that labor standards are included in future \ntrade agreements.\n  USTR needs someone who represents workers' interests--not on the \nsidelines, but in the room during discussion of future trade \nagreements. Because the Chief Labor Negotiator at USTR will have \nambassadorial rank, that person will be able to meet with the highest-\nlevel trade officials of other countries--and to insist that labor \nstandards are on the table and are included in future agreements.\n  Vice President Gore recognizes that. He has repeatedly said that as \nPresident, he would work to ensure workers' rights are included in \nfuture trade agreements. Establishing a Chief Labor Negotiator position \nat USTR would help him and future Presidents keep that commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill over the coming weeks \nbecause I will be re-introducing it next year with the hope of getting \nit passed in the Senate and signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 3249. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailway Labor Act to prevent discrimination based on participation in \nlabor disputes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n              workplace fairness act--striker replacement\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I along with 15 of my colleagues are \nintroducing a bill today that addresses an issue we haven't talked \nenough about in the Senate in recent years--but it's a critically \nimportant issue that we cannot continue to ignore.\n  I am talking about workers rights--specifically the erosion of a \nworker's fundamental right to strike, to protect that right.\n  Today, we are introducing the Workplace Fairness Act. This may sound \nfamiliar to many of my colleagues here in the Senate. It was a bill my \ngood friend and former colleague Senator Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio \nintroduced in the 102d and 103d Congress.\n  The Workplace Fairness Act would amend the National Labor Relations \nAct and the Railway Labor Act by prohibiting employers from hiring \npermanent replacement workers during a strike. It would also make it an \nunfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to allow a striking \nworker who has made an unconditional offer to return to go back to \nwork.\n  Why do we need this legislation?\n  Because right now, a right to strike is a right to be permanently \nreplaced--to lose your job. Every cut-rate, cutthroat employer knows \nthey can break a union if they are willing to play hardball and ruin \nthe lives of the people who have made their company what it is. In my \nown state of Iowa--Titan Tire Company out of Des Moines, is trying to \ndrive out the union workers with permanent replacements--the union has \nbeen on strike for two and a half years now.\n  Over the past two decades, workers' right to strike has too often \nbeen undermined by the destructive practice of hiring permanent \nreplacement workers. Since the 1980s, permanent replacements have been \nused again and again to break unions and to shift the balance between \nworkers and management.\n  Titan Tire just outside is just one of many examples.\n  On May 1, 1998, the 650 members of the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica, Local 164, who work in Des Moines Titan Tire plant, were \nforced into an Unfair Labor Practice Strike.\n  During the contract negotiations preceding this strike, Titan \nInternational Inc. President and CEO, Morry Taylor, attempted to \neliminate pension and medical benefits and illegally move jobs and \nequipment out of the plant. He also forced employees to work excessive \nmandatory overtime, sometimes working people as many as 26 days in a \nrow without a day off.\n  Well, the membership decided that Titan's final offer was impossible \nto accept, and they voted to strike. Two months later, in July, 1998, \nTitan began hiring permanent replacement workers.\n  During the past two and a half years, approximately 500 permanent \nreplacement workers have been hired at the Des Moines plant. And little \nor no progress has been made toward reaching a fair settlement. In \nfact, on April 30, 2000, the day before the second anniversary of the \nTitan strike, Morrie Taylor predicted that the strike would never be \nsettled.\n  Workers deserve better than this. Workers aren't disposable assets \nthat can be thrown away when labor disputes arise.\n  When we considered this legislation in 1994, the Senator Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee heard poignant testimony about the emotional \nand financial hardships caused by hiring permanent replacement workers. \nWe heard about workers losing their homes; going without health \ninsurance because of the high costs of COBRA coverage; feeling useless \nwhen they were permanently replaced after years of loyal service.\n  The right to strike--which we all know is a last resort since no \nworker takes the financial risk of a strike lightly--is fundamental to \npreserving workers' right to bargain for better wages and better \nworking conditions. Without the right to strike, workers forego their \nfair share of bargaining power.\n  Permanent striker replacement not only affects the workers who were \nreplaced. It affects other workers in competing companies. When one \nemployer in an industry breaks a union, hires permanent replacements, \nand cuts salaries and benefits, it affects all the other companies in \nthe industry. Now they either have to find a way to compete with the \nlow-wages and shoddy benefits of a cut-rate, cut-throat business--or \nthey have to follow suit.\n  Also, workers faced with being replaced are forced to make a choice. \nThey can either stay with the union and fight for their jobs, or they \ncan cross the picket line to avoid losing the job they've held for ten \nor twenty or thirty years.\n  Is this a free choice, as some of our colleagues would suggest? Or is \nthis blackmail that takes away the rights and the dignity of the \nworkers of this country? What does it mean to tell workers, ``you have \nthe right to strike''--when we allow them to be summarily fired for \nexercising that right?\n  In reality, there is no legal right to strike today. And because \nthere is no legal right to strike, there is no legal right to bargain \ncollectively. And since there is no legal right to bargain \ncollectively, there is no level playing field between workers and \nmanagement.\n  In other words, Management gets to say that you must bargain on their \nterms--or find some other place to work. If you're permanently \nreplaced,\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\nthat means you're out of work; you lose all your pension rights; you \nlose your seniority; you lose your job forever.\n  How did this happen? We've got to go back to the 1930's for the \nanswer.\n  In response to widespread worker abuses--and union busting--Congress \npassed the National Labor Relations Act--the Wagner Act--in 1935 and it \nwas signed into law by President Roosevelt. The Wagner Act guarantees \nworkers the right to organize and bargain collectively and strike if \nnecessary. It makes it illegal for companies to interfere with these \nrights. In fact, it specifies the right to strike and states: `Nothing \nin this act--except as specifically provided herein--shall be construed \nso as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to \nstrike.'\n  In 1938, the Supreme Court dealt the Wagner Act a mortal blow in the \ncase National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) versus Mackay Radio and \nTelegraph Co. In that case, the Court said that Mackay Radio could hire \npermanent replacement workers for those engaged in an economic strike.\n  There are two types of strikes: economic and unfair labor practices. \nEmployers must rehire employees in unfair labor practice strikes. The \nNLRB determines if the strike is economic or based on unfair labor \npractices. Union cannot know in advance whether NLRB will rule that \ntheir employer has engaged in unfair labor practices. So any employee \nparticipating in a strike runs a risk of permanently losing his or her \njob.\n  What's interesting is that following the Court's ruling, companies \ndid not take advantage of this loophole until the 1980s. Before then, \nthey recognized that doing that would upset this level playing field. \nFor almost 40 years, management rarely hired permanent replacements.\n  That began to change in the 1980s. Since then, hiring permanent \nreplacements has become a routine practice to break unions and shift \nthe balance between workers and management.\n  Again Mr. President, the Workplace Fairness Act would restore the \nfundamental principle of fair labor-management relations--the right of \nworkers to strike without having to fear losing their jobs.\n  Permanent striker replacement keeps us from moving forward as a \nnation into an era of high-wage, high-skilled, highly productive jobs \nin the global marketplace. Without the right to strike, workers' rights \nwill continue to erode. The result will be fewer incentives and less \nmotivation to produce good work, and companies will also suffer with \nless quality in their products.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, this legislation won't be adopted this \nyear. But we are introducing it today to begin the debate and to signal \nour intent on raising it and other fundamental labor law reforms in the \nnext session of Congress. Its time for us to level the playing field \nfor hard-working Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 3251. A bill to authorize the Secretary of State to provide for \nthe establishment of nonprofit entities for the Department's \ninternational educational, cultural, and arts programs; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n assistance for international educational, cultural, and arts programs \n                       of the Department of State\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would \nauthorize the establishment of nonprofit entities to provide grants and \nother assistance for international educational, cultural and arts \nprograms through the Department of State. This is an initiative I have \ndiscussed with officials of the Department of State and introduce today \nto initiate discussion on how to best stimulate a vibrant exchange of \ninternational educational, cultural and arts programs.\n  We are in a era in which cultural issues are increasingly central to \ninternational issues and diplomacy. Trade disputes, ethnic and regional \nconflicts and issues such as biotechnology all have cultural and \nintellectual underpinnings.\n  Cultural programs are increasingly necessary to promoting \ninternational understanding and achieving U.S. national objectives. \nAmerican multinational companies and other Americans doing business \noverseas welcome opportunities to show their support for the unique \ncultures of nations in which they do business, as well as their \ninterest in telling the story of America's diversity in other \ncountries.\n  One way they could do this is by helping to sponsor cultural exchange \nprograms arranged through the Department of State. The problem is that \nthere is apparently no clear easy way to do that--no point of contact \nfor corporations or others interested in supporting cultural \ndiplomacy--no clear avenues to assist cultural programs supported by \nour government. There also are concerns about possible conflicts of \ninterest. Moreover, many people in our own government are uncertain \nwhether they should engage in presenting the creative, intellectual and \ncultural side of our nation.\n  Under this legislation Congress would authorize the establishment of \nprivate nonprofit organizations for the support of international \ncultural programs, making it both easy and attractive for private \norganizations to support cultural programs in cooperation with the \nDepartment of State. In so doing, we would affirm support for the \npromotion and presentation of the nation's intellectual and creative \nbest as part of American diplomacy.\n  This initiative would support a broad range of cultural exchange \nprograms--projects that send Americans abroad and that bring people \nfrom other countries to the United States. Its priority would be to \nsupport the organization and promotion of major, high-profile \npresentations of art exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances \nwhich represent the finest quality of creativity our nation produces. \nThese should be presentations that reach large numbers of people, which \ncontribute to achieving our national interests and which represent the \ndiversity of American culture.\n  There would be authority to solicit support for specific cultural \nendeavors, offering individuals, foundations, multinationals \ncorporations and other American businesses engaged overseas the \nopportunity to publicly support cross-cultural understanding in \ncountries where they do business.\n  The nonprofit entity would work with the Bureau of Educational and \nCultural Affairs as well as the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy \nand Public Affairs at the Department of State.\n  Mr. President, that is the overall purpose of this legislation. I am \nsure we will be able to improve on how to encourage a vibrant exchange \nof cultural programs, and I welcome suggestions on how best to do that. \nIt is for that purpose that I introduce this legislation at the end of \nthis Congress, with the intention of reintroducing it next year with \nthe benefit of those suggestions.\n  I ask consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n     promote mutual understanding between the people of the United \n     States and other nations.\n       (2) Among the means to be used in achieving this objective \n     are a wide range of international educational and cultural \n     exchange programs, including the J. William Fulbright \n     Educational Exchange Program and the International Visitors \n     Program.\n       (3) Cultural diplomacy, especially the presentation abroad \n     of the finest of America's creative, visual and performing \n     arts, is an especially effective means of advancing the U.S. \n     national interest.\n       (4) The financial support available for international \n     cultural and scholarly exchanges has declined by \n     approximately 10 per cent in recent years.\n       (5) Funds appropriated for the purpose of ensuring that the \n     excellence, diversity and vitality of the arts in the United \n     States are presented to foreign audiences by and in \n     cooperation with our diplomatic and consular representatives \n     have declined dramatically.\n       (6) One of the ways to deepen and expand cultural and \n     educational exchange programs is through the establishment of \n     nonprofit entities to encourage the participation and \n     financial support of multinational companies and other \n     private sector contributors.\n       (7) The U.S. private sector should be encouraged to \n     cooperate closely with the Secretary of State and her \n     representatives to expand and spread appreciation of U.S. \n     cultural and artistic accomplishments.\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH NONPROFIT ENTITIES.\n\n       Section 105(f) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural \n     Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, (22 U.S.C. 2255(f)) is \n     further amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(f)''; and by adding at \n     the end the following new paragraphs:\n       (2) The Secretary of State is authorized to provide for the \n     establishment of private, nonprofit entities to assist in \n     carrying out the purposes of the Act. Any such entity shall \n     not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the United \n     States government, nor shall its employees be considered \n     employees of the United States government for any purposes.\n       (3) The entities may, among other functions, (a) encourage \n     participation and support by U.S. multinational companies and \n     other elements of the private sector for cultural, arts and \n     educational exchange programs, including those programs that \n     will enhance international appreciation of America's cultural \n     and artistic accomplishments; (b) solicit and receive \n     contributions from the private sector to support these \n     cultural arts and educational exchange programs; and (c) \n     provide grants and other assistance for these programs.\n       (4) The Secretary of State is authorized to make such \n     arrangements as are necessary to carry out the purposes of \n     these entities, including the solicitation and receipt of \n     funds for the entity; designation of a program in recognition \n     of such contributions; and designation of members, including \n     employees of the U.S. government, on any board or other body \n     established to administer the entity.\n       (5) Any funds available to the Department of State may be \n     made available to such entities to cover administrative and \n     other costs for their establishment.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Clinical Research \n     Enhancement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n     scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n     improved treatment for disease.\n       (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n     insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n     creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n       (3) Clinical research includes translational research which \n     is an integral part of the research process leading to \n     general human applications. It is the bridge between the \n     laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and \n     prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer \n     and other diseases.\n       (4) The United States will spend more than \n     $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal \n     budget for health research at the National Institutes of \n     Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.\n       (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n     Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have \n     all addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n       (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n     recognized the current problems in clinical research and \n     appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support \n     for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research \n     programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and \n     retain clinical investigators.\n       (7) The current level of training and support for health \n     professionals in clinical research is fragmented, \n     undervalued, and underfunded.\n       (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n     positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and \n     ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the \n     scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of \n     life-science research are raised by the following:\n       (A) The number of young investigators applying for grants \n     dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n       (B) The number of physicians applying for first-time \n     National Institutes of Health research project grants fell \n     from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction.\n       (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise \n     funds to support their new research programs and a \n     substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n       (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n     decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and \n     those choosing this career path:\n       (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of \n     $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation \n     Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges \n     (AAMC).\n       (B) The prolonged period of clinical training required \n     increases the accumulated debt burden.\n       (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.\n       (D) The perceived instability of funding from the National \n     Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.\n       (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research \n     training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.\n       (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties \n     in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly \n     competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by \n     the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover \n     health care costs for patients engaged in research studies \n     and research procedures.\n       (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n     established under the Office of the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n     $3,000,000.\n       (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n     in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.\n       (12) Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical \n     research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to \n     1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.\n       (13) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical \n     research centers in operation, supplying patients in the \n     areas in which such centers operate with access to the most \n     modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n     technologies.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     additional support for and to expand clinical research \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Twenty-First Century \n     Research Laboratories Act''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the principal \n     source of Federal funding for medical research at \n     universities and other research institutions in the United \n     States;\n       (2) the National Institutes of Health has received a \n     substantial increase in research funding from Congress for \n     the purpose of expanding the national investment of the \n     United States in behavioral and biomedical research;\n       (3) the infrastructure of our research institutions is \n     central to the continued leadership of the United States in \n     medical research;\n       (4) as Congress increases the investment in cutting-edge \n     basic and clinical research, it is critical that Congress \n     also examine the current quality of the laboratories and \n     buildings where research is being conducted, as well as the \n     quality of laboratory equipment used in research;\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\n       (5) many of the research facilities and laboratories in the \n     United States are outdated and inadequate;\n       (6) the National Science Foundation found, in a 1998 report \n     on the status of biomedical research facilities, that over 60 \n     percent of research-performing institutions indicated that \n     they had an inadequate amount of medical research space;\n       (7) the National Science Foundation reports that academic \n     institutions have deferred nearly $11,000,000,000 in \n     renovation and construction projects because of a lack of \n     funds; and\n       (8) future increases in Federal funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health must include increased support for the \n     renovation and construction of extramural research facilities \n     in the United States and the purchase of state-of-the-art \n     laboratory instrumentation.\n\n     SEC. 303.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 700 lives are lost every day to sudden cardiac \n     arrest in the United States alone.\n       (2) Two out of every three sudden cardiac deaths occur \n     before a victim can reach a hospital.\n       (3) More than 95 percent of these cardiac arrest victims \n     will die, many because of lack of readily available life \n     saving medical equipment.\n       (4) With current medical technology, up to 30 percent of \n     cardiac arrest victims could be saved if victims had access \n     to immediate medical response, including defibrillation and \n     cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n       (5) Once a victim has suffered a cardiac arrest, every \n     minute that passes before returning the heart to a normal \n     rhythm decreases the chance of survival by 10 percent.\n       (6) Most cardiac arrests are caused by abnormal heart \n     rhythms called ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular \n     fibrillation occurs when the heart's electrical system \n     malfunctions, causing a chaotic rhythm that prevents the \n     heart from pumping oxygen to the victim's brain and body.\n       (7) Communities that have implemented programs ensuring \n     widespread public access to defibrillators, combined with \n     appropriate training, maintenance, and coordination with \n     local emergency medical systems, have dramatically improved \n     the survival rates from cardiac arrest.\n       (8) Automated external defibrillator devices have been \n     demonstrated to be safe and effective, even when used by lay \n     people, since the devices are designed not to allow a user to \n     administer a shock until after the device has analyzed a \n     victim's heart rhythm and determined that an electric shock \n     is required.\n       (9) Increasing public awareness regarding automated \n     external defibrillator devices and encouraging their use in \n     Federal buildings will greatly facilitate their adoption.\n       (10) Limiting the liability of Good Samaritans and \n     acquirers of automated external defibrillator devices in \n     emergency situations may encourage the use of automated \n     external defibrillator devices, and result in saved lives.\n\n     SEC. 403.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the \n     United States.\n       (2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 \n     Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.\n       (3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 \n     percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart \n     is returned to normal rhythm.\n       (4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in \n     ventricular fibrillation, and the only treatment for \n     ventricular fibrillation is defibrillation, prompt access to \n     defibrillation to return the heart to normal rhythm is \n     essential.\n       (5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external \n     defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay \n     rescuers to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple \n     device to shock the heart into normal rhythm.\n       (6) Those people who are likely to be first on the scene of \n     a cardiac arrest situation in many communities, particularly \n     smaller and rural communities, lack sufficient numbers of \n     automated external defibrillators to respond to cardiac \n     arrest in a timely manner.\n       (7) The American Heart Association estimates that more than \n     50,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators \n     were more widely available to designated responders.\n       (8) Legislation should be enacted to encourage greater \n     public access to automated\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\n     external defibrillators in communities across the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 413.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Lupus Research and Care \n     Amendments of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune \n     disease of particular concern to women;\n       (2) lupus affects women nine times more often than men;\n       (3) there are three main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a \n     serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the \n     body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects \n     mainly the skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain \n     medications;\n       (4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;\n       (5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of \n     the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and \n     can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus \n     are similar to those of many other diseases;\n       (6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American \n     women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is \n     three times the prevalence among white women, and an \n     estimated 1 in 250 African-American women between the ages of \n     15 and 65 develops the disease;\n       (7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and \n     2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and \n     that many more have undiagnosed cases;\n       (8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, \n     but may lead to damaging side effects;\n       (9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain \n     and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and \n     lead normal lives; and\n       (10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the \n     National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was \n     $33,000,000, which is less than one-half of 1 percent of the \n     budget for such Institutes.\n\n                     Subtitle A--Research on Lupus\n\n     SEC. 511.

DESIGNATION OF GIVE THANKS, GIVE LIFE DAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families to \n     take time out of their busy lives to come together and to \n     give thanks for the many blessings in their lives;\n       (2) approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the \n     United States are given the gift of life each year through \n     transplantation surgery, made possible by the generosity of \n     organ and tissue donations;\n       (3) more than 66,000 Americans are awaiting their chance to \n     prolong their lives by finding a matching donor;\n       (4) nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13 \n     patients each day) die while waiting for a donated heart, \n     liver, kidney, or other organ;\n       (5) nationwide there are up to 15,000 potential donors \n     annually, but families' consent to donation is received for \n     less than 6,000;\n       (6) the need for organ donations greatly exceeds the supply \n     available;\n       (7) designation as an organ donor on a driver's license or \n     voter's registration is a valuable step, but does not ensure \n     donation when an occasion arises;\n       (8) the demand for transplantation will likely increase in \n     the coming years due to the growing safety of transplantation \n     surgery due to improvements in technology and drug \n     developments, prolonged life expectancy, and increased \n     prevalence of diseases that may lead to organ damage and \n     failure, including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C \n     infection;\n       (9) the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a \n     variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will continue to \n     grow in the coming years;\n       (10) the final decision on whether a potential donor can \n     share the gift of life usually is made by surviving family \n     members regardless of the patient's initial intent;\n       (11) many Americans have indicated a willingness to donate \n     their organs and tissues but have not discussed this critical \n     matter with the family members who are most likely to make \n     the decision, if the occasion arises, as to whether that \n     person will be an organ and tissue donor;\n       (12) some family members may be reluctant to give consent \n     to donate their deceased loved one's organs and tissues at a \n     very difficult and emotional time if that person has\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\n     not clearly expressed a desire or willingness to do so;\n       (13) the vast majority of Americans are likely to spend \n     part of Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members \n     who would be approached to make such a decision; and\n       (14) it is fitting for families to spend a portion of that \n     day discussing how they might give life to others on a day \n     devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings.\n       (b) Designation.--November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, is \n     hereby designated as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and \n     to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family \n     members so that informed decisions can be made if the \n     occasion to donate arises.\n\n         TITLE VIII--ALZHEIMER'S CLINICAL RESEARCH AND TRAINING\n\n     SEC. 801.

and\n       (16) providing quality representation to defendants facing \n     loss of liberty or life is essential to fundamental due \n     process and the speedy final resolution of judicial \n     proceedings.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should condition forensic science-related \n     grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's \n     agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in \n     appropriate cases; and\n       (2) Congress should work with the States to improve the \n     quality of legal representation in capital cases through the \n     establishment of standards that will assure the timely \n     appointment of competent counsel with adequate resources to \n     represent defendants in capital cases at each stage of the \n     proceedings.\n       Amend the title to read as follows: ``A bill to improve the \n     quality, timeliness, and credibility of forensic science \n     services for criminal justice purposes, and for other \n     purposes.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     BIRMINGHAM PLEDGE LEGISLATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   SESSIONS AMENDMENTS NOS. 4346-4347\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for Mr. Sessions) proposed two amendments to the joint \nresolution (H.J.

Rotch, is sponsored by the Community \n     Affairs Committee of Operation New Birmingham, and is \n     promoted by a broad cross section of the community of \n     Birmingham;\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge reads as follows:\n         ``I believe that every person has worth as an individual.\n         ``I believe that every person is entitled to dignity and \n     respect, regardless of race or color.\n         ``I believe that every thought and every act of racial \n     prejudice is harmful; if it is in my thought or act, then it \n     is harmful to me as well as to others.\n         ``Therefore, from this day forward I will strive daily to \n     eliminate racial prejudice from my thoughts and actions.\n         ``I will discourage racial prejudice by others at every \n     opportunity.\n         ``I will treat all people with dignity and respect; and I \n     will strive to honor this pledge, knowing that the world will \n     be a better place because of my effort.'';\n       Whereas commitment and adherence to the Birmingham Pledge \n     increases racial harmony by helping individuals communicate \n     in a positive way concerning the diversity of the people of \n     the United States and by encouraging people to make a \n     commitment to racial harmony;\n       Whereas individuals who sign the Birmingham Pledge give \n     evidence of their commitment to its message;\n       Whereas more than 70,000 people have signed the Birmingham \n     Pledge, including the President, Members of Congress, \n     Governors, State legislators, mayors, county commissioners, \n     city council members, and other persons around the world;\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge has achieved national and \n     international recognition;\n       Whereas efforts to obtain signatories to the Birmingham \n     Pledge are being organized and conducted in communities \n     around the world;\n       Whereas every Birmingham Pledge signed and returned to \n     Birmingham is recorded at the Birmingham Civil Rights \n     Institute, Birmingham, Alabama, as a permanent testament to \n     racial reconciliation, peace, and harmony; and\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge, the motto for which is \n     ``Sign It, Live It'', is a powerful tool for facilitating \n     dialogue on the Nation's diversity and the need for people to \n     take personal steps to achieve racial harmony and tolerance \n     in communities: Now, therefore, be it\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           AMERICAN MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND ENERGY LEGISLATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               MURKOWSKI (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4348\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for Mr. Murkowski (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. \nBingaman)) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 4940) to designate \nthe museum operated by the Secretary of Energy in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, \nas the ``American Museum of Science and Energy,'' and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

Conforming provision regarding definitions.\nSec. 603. Effective date.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Despite notable progress in the overall health of the \n     Nation, there are continuing disparities in the burden of \n     illness and death experienced by African Americans, \n     Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Asian \n     Pacific Islanders, compared to the United States population \n     as a whole.\n       (2) The largest numbers of the medically underserved are \n     white individuals, and many of them have the same health care \n     access problems as do members of minority groups. Nearly \n     20,000,000 white individuals live below the poverty line with \n     many living in non-metropolitan, rural areas such as \n     Appalachia, where the high percentage of counties designated \n     as health professional shortage areas (47 percent) and the \n     high rate of poverty contribute to disparity outcomes. \n     However, there is a higher proportion of racial and ethnic \n     minorities in the United States represented among the \n     medically underserved.\n       (3) There is a national need for minority scientists in the \n     fields of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health \n     services research. Ninety percent of minority physicians \n     educated at Historically Black Medical Colleges live and \n     serve in minority communities.\n       (4) Demographic trends inspire concern about the Nation's \n     ability to meet its future scientific, technological and \n     engineering workforce needs. Historically, non-Hispanic white \n     males have made up the majority of the United States \n     scientific, technological, and engineering workers.\n       (5) The Hispanic and Black population will increase \n     significantly in the next 50 years. The scientific, \n     technological, and engineering workforce may decrease if \n     participation by underepresented minorities remains the same.\n       (6) Increasing rates of Black and Hispanic workers can help \n     ensure strong scientific, technological, and engineering \n     workforce.\n       (7) Individuals such as underepresented minorities and \n     women in the scientific, technological, and engineering \n     workforce enable society to address its diverse needs.\n       (8) If there had not been a substantial increase in the \n     number of science and engineering degrees awarded to women \n     and underepresented minorities over the past few decades, the \n     United States would be facing even greater shortages in \n     scientific, technological, and engineering workers.\n       (9) In order to effectively promote a diverse and strong \n     21st Century scientific, technological, and engineering \n     workforce, Federal agencies should expand or add programs \n     that effectively overcome barriers such as educational \n     transition from one level to the next and student \n     requirements for financial resources.\n       (10) Federal agencies should work in concert with the \n     private nonprofit sector to emphasize the recruitment and \n     retention of qualified individuals from ethnic and gender \n     groups that are currently underrepresented in the scientific, \n     technological, and engineering workforce.\n       (11) Behavioral and social sciences research has increased \n     awareness and understanding of factors associated with health \n     care utilization and access,-patient attitudes toward health \n     services, and risk and protective behaviors that affect \n     health and illness. These factors have the potential to then \n     be modified to help close the health disparities gap among \n     ethnic minority populations. In addition, there is a shortage \n     of minority behavioral science -researchers and behavioral \n     health care professionals. According to the National Science \n     Foundation, only 15.5 percent of behavioral research-oriented \n     psychology doctorate degrees were awarded to minority \n     students in 1997.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2780, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2780) to authorize the Attorney General to \n     provide grants for organizations to find missing adults.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting Kristen's Act. Representative Sue Myrick  introduced this \nessential crime prevention legislation on the House side, and I \nintroduced the Senate companion. With the Senate's action today, this \nmeasure will be set to become law. I am grateful to Representative \nMyrick for her tireless efforts towards ensuring that Kristen's Act \nbecomes law. The legislation will help public agencies and nonprofit \norganizations provide desperately needed assistance to law enforcement \nand families in locating involuntarily missing adults.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Leahy and Hatch. They deserve \nspecial praise for their constant support of victim advocacy \ninitiatives and their fight to put a stop to crime in our Nation.\n  Kristen's Law was inspired by the story of a young woman from North \nCarolina, Kristen Modafferi. On June 23, 1997, just three weeks after \nher 18th birthday, Kristen disappeared. Despite tireless efforts by law \nenforcement to locate Kristen, she has not been seen since. And \ntragically, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was \nunable to assist with the search, all because Kristen had passed the \nage of 18.\n  Unfortunately, Kristen's story is not unique. Numerous other cases \ninvolving the disappearance of young adults are reported to authorities \nevery year. During 1999, in North Carolina, the Mecklenburg County \nSheriff's Office received reports of 132 missing persons ages 18 \nthrough 21. That's the number for just one age group, in just one \ncounty, in just one state in the country. When we look at nationwide \nstatistics for missing adults, what we find is staggering. For example, \nas of February 1999, the FBI reported that there were more than 38,000 \nactive missing person entries for adults over the age of eighteen. This \nis frighteningly large number.\n  That is why I believe that Kristen's Act is a necessary protective \nmeasure. It will not only provide some comfort to the millions of \nparents who send their children to college every year and worry about \ntheir safety, but it will help ensure that when an adult of any age is \ndetermined missing due to foul play, a national effort will be \nmobilized to help.\n  When a person involuntarily disappears, time is of the essence. \nSearch efforts must begin quickly, and they must reach across \njurisdictions. Abducted individuals are often taken across state lines. \nIn order to effectively coordinate a search, the groups conducting the \nsearch must have an easy way to share information with each other, no \nmatter how far away from one another they may be. Kristen's Act will \nhelp facilitate communication between search parties through the \nestablishment of a national database to track involuntarily missing \nadults.\n  The greater the number of agencies helping in the search, the more \nlikely it is that the person will be found. But there is no central \norganization that exists to aid law enforcement in their efforts to \nlocate missing adults. Unfortunately, Kristen's tragic story \nillustrates the need for such an organization. Kristen's Act will help \nenable this to happen by providing funds to help establish a national \nclearinghouse for missing adults.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is important to mention that it is \ntrue that some individuals may disappear because they want to. Some of \nthese individuals may live in abusive households. Others may want to \nstart a new life. And because they are considered legal adults, they \nhave the choice to remain missing. In these cases, it may not make \nsense of law enforcement, the Center, or anyone else to launch a \nsearch.\n  That is why I believe the Attorney General should ensure that under \nKristen's Act, grants will be given out only to organizations that have \ndemonstrated they have in place clear, effective methods of \ndistinguishing between disappearances that are voluntary and those that \nmay involve foul play. And that is why Kristen's Act specifies that if \na national database is set up, it will be used to track only those \nmissing adults who have first been determined by law enforcement to be \nendangered due to age, diminished mental capacity or suspicious \ncircumstances.\n  There are many individuals who really do need help. In those \ninstances, Kristen's Act sends a message to families that they deserve \nwhatever assistance is necessary to locate endangered and involuntarily \nmissing loved ones. The bill will help ensure that all involuntarily \nmissing adults--regardless of age--will receive not only the benefit of \nsearch efforts by law enforcement, but also by experienced, specialized \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must do everything we can to prevent \nsituations like the one that Kristen Modafferi and her family have \nsuffered through. The bill we passed today goes a long way toward \nachieving this goal. Again, I commend my colleagues for recognizing its \nimportance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, for his support in getting this bill passed. Our Armed \nForces and their families are in desperate need of this legislation and \nit has been a long time coming. This legislation\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\ncloses a legal loophole which prevented effective prosecution of \ncertain crime committed by civilians accompanying the Armed Forces \noverseas. When civilian dependents, contractors, and Federal employees \ngo overseas with the military, the Uniform Code of Military Justice and \nthe Federal criminal code generally do not apply to them. Therefore, if \none of these civilians commits a criminal act--even a serious one such \nas rape or child molestation--then he or she could be beyond the reach \nof Federal law if the foreign authorities refuse or neglect to \nprosecute. Surprisingly, host countries often choose to not prosecute \nAmerican civilians, especially where the crime was committed against \nanother American or against property owned by an American or the U.S. \nGovernment. That is why this legislation is needed.\n  Since this legislation initially passed the Senate on July 1, 1999, \nthe House of Representatives, under the leadership of Representative \nMcCollum of Florida, took the bill and further refined it based upon \nconcerns that arose after Senate Consideration. In addition, Mr. \nMcCollum submitted House Report 106-778 to accompany the House version \nof the bill--H.R. 3380. This report does an outstanding job of \noutlining the background and need for this legislation. The report also \nincludes a section-by-section analysis and discussion of the \nlegislation. We have agreed to incorporate the text of H.R. 3380 into \nthis final bill. I have reviewed House Report 106-778, and I agree with \nit. I believe that report reflects the intentions of the Senate. At \nthis time, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Mr. President, I too, want to \ncongratulate and commend my distinguished colleague from Alabama for \nhis leadership and perseverance in getting this legislation passed. I \nfully support S. 768, which I believe was significantly improved with \nthis most recent substitute amendment. The due process considerations \nregarding appearances before U.S. Magistrates before removing civilians \nfrom overseas were added after earlier Senate consideration and, I \nbelieve, improve the bill. This important legislation will close a gap \nin Federal law that has existed for many years. With foreign nations \noften not interested in prosecuting crimes against Americans, \nparticularly when committed by an American, the result is a \njurisdictional gap that allows some civilians to literally get away \nwith murder. The House Report 106-778, which Senator Sessions just \nreferred to a moment ago, outlines many of the problems resulting from \nthis loophole. I agree with Senator Sessions with respect to the \nreport. I am glad this legislation will pass this Congress because the \ngap that has allowed individuals accompanying our military personnel \noverseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. That is \nwhy I have been a strong proponent and co-sponsor of this legislation. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is voting on \nfinal passage of S. 768, the Military and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction \nAct. I have worked on this issue for some time now and believe that the \nCongress should promptly move forward with this important legislation.\n  Specifically, in the last Congress, I originally introduced most of \nthe provisions in this bill as part of the comprehensive crime bill, S. \n2484, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998. On \nthe first day of this Congress, I again included these provisions in S. \n9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999. Last \nyear, I was pleased to join Senators Sessions and DeWine in supporting \nthe Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute amendment to S. 768, which was \nreported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and then passed \nunanimously by the Senate on July 1, 1999, over a year ago. The bill \nthen sat in a House subcommittee for almost one year until the House of \nRepresentatives finally took action in late July, 2000 to consider and \npass an amended version of S. 768.\n  S. 768 closes a gap in federal law that has existed for many years \nand permitted individuals who accompanied military personnel overseas \nto ``get away with murder.'' Foreign nations often have no interest in \nvindicating crimes against American servicemen stationed overseas, \nparticularly when committed by Americans, The lack of Federal \njurisdiction over such crimes has allowed the perpetrators to go \nunpunished. This bill establishes authority for, and sets up procedures \nto implement the exercise of, Federal jurisdiction over felony crimes \ncommitted by certain people overseas.\n  I had some concerns with certain aspects of S. 768, as originally \nintroduced, and worked to address those concerns and improve the bill \nin the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute amendment. For example, the \noriginal bill would have extended court-martial jurisdiction over DOD \nemployees and contractors whenever they accompanied our Armed Forces \noverseas. I was concerned that this extension of court-martial \njurisdiction ran afoul of the Supreme Court's decisions in Reid v. \nCovert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) \nand Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955). Those rulings made clear that \ncourt-martial jurisdiction may not be constitutionally applied to \ncrimes committed in peacetime by persons accompanying the armed forces \noverseas, or to crimes committed by a former member of the armed \nservices.\n  We made progress in the Sessions--Leahy-DeWine substitute amendment \npassed by the Senate to limit the proposed extension of court-martial \njurisdiction to DOD employees and contractors, and ensure its \napplication only in times when the armed forces are engaged in \n``contingency operation'' involving a war or national emergency \ndeclared by the Congress or the President. While his correction would, \nin my view, have comported with the Supreme Court rulings on this issue \nand cured any constitutional infirmity with the original language, I \nappreciate the action of the House to remove altogether this section of \nthe bill, which had originally given me concern.\n  In addition, the original bill contained a provision that would have \ndeemed any delay in bringing a person before a magistrate due to \ntransporting the person back to the U.S. from overseas as \n``justifiable.'' I was concerned that this provision could end up \nexcusing lengthy and unreasonable delays in getting a civilian, who was \narrested overseas, before a U.S. Magistrate, and thereby raise due \nprocess and other constitutional concerns.\n  The Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute cured that potential problem by \neliminating the ``justifiable'' delay provision in the original bill. \nThus, the general standard from Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5 \nabout avoiding unnecessary delays in bringing an arrested person before \na magistrate would apply to the removal of a civilian from overseas to \nanswer charges in the United States.\n  The House has made further improvements to the removal and detention \nprocedures in the bill, and I support them. In particular, the House \nhas clarified the procedures necessary to protect the rights of the \naccused in both removal and detention hearings, and to facilitate and \nexpedite the conduct of initial appearances by the accused before \nfederal magistrate judges.\n  Finally, S. 768 as introduced authorized the Department of Defense to \ndetermine which foreign officials constitute the appropriate \nauthorities to whom an arrested civilian should be delivered. I urged \nthat DOD make this determination in consultation with the Department of \nState, and the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute amendment adopted such \na consultation requirement. I am pleased that the House maintained this \npart of the substitute amendment in House-passed version of the \nlegislation and requires consultation with the Department of State.\n  The inaction of the Congress on closing the jurisdictional gap that \nhas existed over the criminal actions of civilian on military \ninstallations overseas has been the source of terrible injustice. For \nexample, most recently the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was \ncompelled to reverse a conviction and dismiss an indictment of sexual \nabuse of a minor committed by a civilian at a military base in Germany. \nThe Court took the ``unusual step of directing the Clerk of the court \nto forward a copy this opinion'' to the relevant Committees of the \nCongress. We have gotten our wake-up call and should waste no more time \nto send this legislation to the President.\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \n3045, and the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3045) to improve the quality, timeliness, and \n     credibility of forensic science services for criminal justice \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 9, 1999, our departed friend and \ncolleague, the former senior Senator from Georgia, introduced the \nNational Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 1999. This important \nlegislative initiative called for an infusion of Federal funds to \nimprove the quality of State and local forensic science services. I am \npleased that Senator Sessions has revived the bill, and that we are \npassing it today as the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences \nImprovement Act of 2000, S. 3045.\n  The use of quality forensic science services is widely accepted as a \nkey to effective crime-fighting, especially with advanced technologies \nsuch as DNA testing. Over the past decade, DNA testing has emerged as \nthe most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when \nbiological material is left at a crime scene. Because of its scientific \nprecision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish a \nsuspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing may not \nconclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant \nprobative value for investigators.\n  While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law \nenforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's \nmistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and \nconvicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 75 cases in \nthe United States and Canada, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration \nof innocent men and women who were wrongfully convicted. This number \nincludes at least 9 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came \nwithin days of being executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, \npost-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has \nalso enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the \napprehension of the real perpetrator.\n  Clearly, forensic science services like DNA testing are critical to \nthe effective administration of justice in 21st century America.\n  Forensic science workloads have increased significantly over the past \nfive years, both in number and complexity. Since Congress established \nthe Combined DNA Index System in the mid-1990s, States have been busy \ncollecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and \nindexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement \nprograms has resulted in more and better trained police officers who \nare collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be \nsubjected to crime laboratory analysis.\n  Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and \nState crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have \nimpeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases \nwithout suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong \nclaims of innocence--as laboratories are required to give priority \nstatus to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the \ncountry, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more \nthan a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime \nevidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains \nuntested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to \nanguish, and statutes of limitation on prosecution expire.\n  Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital \nbuilding in Waterbury, Vermont. Though it is proudly one of only two \nfully-accredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st \ncentury science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space \nand no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise \nforensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested \nDNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads \nbesides the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed \nbecause the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower.\n  I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult \ncircumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better. \nThis is our chance to provide them with the facilities and equipment \nthey deserve.\n  Passage of the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement \nAct will give States like Vermont the help they desperately need to \nhandle the increased workloads placed upon their forensic science \nsystems. It allocates $738 million over the next six years for grants \nto qualified forensic science laboratories and medical examiner's \noffices for laboratory accreditation, automated equipment, supplies, \ntraining, facility improvements, and staff enhancements.\n  I have worked with Senator Sessions to revise the bill's allocation \nformula to make it fair for all States. We have agreed to add a minimum \nallocation of .06 percent of the total appropriation for each fiscal \nyear for smaller states and have increased the maximum percentage of \nfederal funds available for facility costs from 40 percent to 80 \npercent for these smaller states. This is only fair for smaller States \nwith limited tax bases and other finite resources, such as my home \nState of Vermont.\n  The bill we pass today also authorizes $30 million for fiscal year \n2001 for the elimination of DNA convicted offender database sample \nbacklogs and other related purposes. I support this provision, although \nI regret that it does not go further. Senator Schumer and I have \nproposed increasing this authorization by $25 million, which is the \namount needed to eliminate the backlog of untested crime scene evidence \nfrom unsolved crimes. This backlog is as serious a problem as the \nconvicted offender sample backlog, and we should take the opportunity \nto address it now.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that S. 3045 fails to address the \nurgent need to increase access to DNA testing for prisoners who were \nconvicted before this truth-seeking technology became widely available. \nProsecutors and law enforcement officers across the country use DNA \ntesting to prove guilt, and rightly so. By the same token, however, it \nshould be used to do what is equally scientifically reliable to do--\nprove innocence.\n  I was greatly heartened earlier this month when the Governor of \nVirginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests \nconfirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. He \nwas the 88th wrong guy discovered on death row since the reinstatement \nof capital punishment. His case only goes to show that we cannot sit \nback and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thing\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nwhen it comes to DNA. It took Earl Washington years to convince \nprosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, \nand more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today.\n  States like Virginia continue to stonewall on requests for DNA \ntesting. They continue to hide behind time limits and procedural \ndefault rules to deny prisoners the right to present DNA test results \nin court. They are still destroying the DNA evidence that could set \ninnocent people free. These sorts of practices must stop. We should not \npass up the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our \nadversarial system that DNA evidence offers.\n  By passing S. 3045, we substantially increase funding to improve the \nquality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement purposes. \nThat is an appropriate use of Federal funds. But we at least ought to \nrequire that this truth-seeking technology be made available to both \nsides.\n  I proposed a modest Sense of Congress amendment to S. 3045, which the \nSenate is passing today. It describes how DNA testing can and has \nresulted in the post-conviction exoneration of scores of innocent men \nand women, including some under sentence of death, and expresses the \nsense of Congress that we should condition forensic science-related \ngrants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement \nto ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases. Because \npost-conviction DNA testing has shown that innocent people are \nsentenced to death in this country with alarming frequency, and because \nthe most common constitutional error in capital cases is egregiously \nincompetent defense lawyering, my amendment also calls on Congress to \nwork with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in \ncapital cases through the establishment of counsel standards.\n  I introduced legislation in this Congress that would have \naccomplished both of these things. The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 \ncontains meaningful reforms that I believe could save innocent lives. \nAs the 106th Congress winds down, we have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, \nand about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican \ncosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President \nClinton, Vice-President Gore, and Attorney General Reno have all \nexpressed support for the bill.\n  Tragically, real reform of our nation's capital punishment system \nfoundered on the shoals of election-year politics. But with the Sense \nof Congress provision that we pass today, at least we have agreed on a \nblueprint for effective reform legislation in the 107th Congress.\n  Finally, I want to discuss another amendment that I proposed, \ntogether with Senator Sessions, and that the Senate passes today. It \nconcerns the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, which the \nSenate passed on March 27, 2000.\n  The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act was an important step forward, \nand I want to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers and Senators Sessions, \nSchumer, Biden, and all others who worked with us in good faith to \nenact these long overdue reforms. At the same time, there was some \nunfinished business in connection with this legislation that my \namendment completes.\n  The bill that the Senate passed by unanimous consent on March 27th \nwas supposed to be a substitute amendment to H.R. 1658. I had been led \nto believe that the substitute was word-for-word that which I had \npainstakingly worked out over the preceding weeks for approval by the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary the previous Thursday, March 23, \n2000. Imagine my surprise to see reprinted in the Record the next day a \nsubstitute amendment at variance with the version to which I had agreed \nto and at variance with the language that had been circulated to and \napproved by the Committee.\n  Specifically, the agreed upon version of the bill would amend section \n983(a)(2)(C) of title 18, United States Code, to describe what a \nclaimant in a civil asset forfeiture case must state to assert a claim. \nThe amendment to which I agreed and which the Judiciary Committee \n``ordered reported'' requires that a ``claim shall--(i) identify the \nspecific property being claimed; (ii) state the claimant's interest in \nsuch property; and (iii) be made under oath, subject to penalty of \nperjury.''\n  By contrast, the version of the amendment submitted to the Senate for \npassage contained the following additional clause in subparagraph (ii): \n``state the claimant's interest in such property (and provide customary \ndocumentary evidence of such interest if available) and state that the \nclaim is not frivolous''. I did not approve the language inserted in \nthe version considered by the Senate and this language was not approved \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  The inserted language is superfluous at best, since even without it, \na claimant must provide evidence of his interest in the property early \nin the proceeding or face summary dismissal for lack of standing. \nMoreover, a claim already must be made under oath and penalty of \nperjury.\n  At worst, the inserted language is an invitation for mischief in an \narea where the record has already amply demonstrated overreaching by \nlaw enforcement agencies. At the claim stage, most claimants do not \nhave counsel. Many are uneducated and unsophisticated. They may not \nknow what ``customary documentary evidence'' means, and even if they \ndo, they may not know how to get it. It is not so simple for such \nindividuals to obtain a bank statement or a title document, much less \nto obtain such documents within the 30 days afforded by the Act. They \nmay be deterred from filing a claim simply because they cannot produce \ndocumentary evidence--even if no documentary evidence exists.\n  Take for example an all cash seizure. What constitutes ``customary \ndocumentary evidence'' of an interest in cash? An ATM receipt? A bank \nrecord? What about money that is received from legitimate sources other \nthan financial institutions. A waiter would be hard pressed to produce \ndocumentary evidence of his interest in tip money.\n  Beyond this, the inserted language gives seizing agencies too much \ndiscretion to reject claims because the documentary evidence is \nincomplete or otherwise unsatisfactory, and prior experience tells us \nthat agencies may exercise their discretion to deny claims arbitrarily.\n  The requirement that claims be certified as non-frivolous is also \nproblematic. If an uncounseled claimant certifies in good faith that \nhis claim is not frivolous, and a court ultimately determines \notherwise, would the claimant be put at risk of a perjury prosecution? \nEven the threat of such risks puts additional burdens on claimants and \nmay dissuade claimants from filing claims.\n  In sum, the inserted language has the potential to deter valid claims \nas well as frivolous claims, and it is unnecessary: Frivolous claims \nwill be dismissed anyway, when the claimant is unable to meet his \nburden of establishing standing.\n  For these reasons, I had objected to insertion of this language and \napproved a substitute amendment that did not contain this problematic \ninsert. Moreover, the version of that substitute amendment ``ordered \nreported'' by the Judiciary Committee and in the Committee's official \nfiles simply does not contain that problematic insert.\n  We rely every day on each other and on the professionalism of our \nstaffs. Having raised my concern about the change as soon as it was \ndiscovered, I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and Senator Sessions have \nworked with me to pass a correction to the law that strikes the \nlanguage that was added without agreement.\n  I hope that the House will move quickly to pass the Paul Coverdell \nNational Forensic Sciences Improvement Act, as amended, before it winds \nup its work for the year.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4345\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Rotch, is sponsored by the Community \n     Affairs Committee of Operation New Birmingham, and is \n     promoted by a broad cross section of the community of \n     Birmingham;\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge reads as follows:\n         ``I believe that every person has worth as an individual.\n         ``I believe that every person is entitled to dignity and \n     respect, regardless of race or color.\n         ``I believe that every thought and every act of racial \n     prejudice is harmful; if it is in my thought or act, then it \n     is harmful to me as well as to others.\n         ``Therefore, from this day forward I will strive daily to \n     eliminate racial prejudice from my thoughts and actions.\n         ``I will discourage racial prejudice by others at every \n     opportunity.\n         ``I will treat all people with dignity and respect; and I \n     will strive to honor this pledge, knowing that the world will \n     be a better place because of my effort.'';\n       Whereas commitment and adherence to the Birmingham Pledge \n     increases racial harmony by helping individuals communicate \n     in a positive way concerning the diversity of the people of \n     the United States and by encouraging people to make a \n     commitment to racial harmony;\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n       Whereas individuals who sign the Birmingham Pledge give \n     evidence of their commitment to its message;\n       Whereas more than 70,000 people have signed the Birmingham \n     Pledge, including the President, Members of Congress, \n     Governors, State legislators, mayors, county commissioners, \n     city council members, and other persons around the world;\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge has achieved national and \n     international recognition;\n       Whereas efforts to obtain signatories to the Birmingham \n     Pledge are being organized and conducted in communities \n     around the world;\n       Whereas every Birmingham Pledge signed and returned to \n     Birmingham is recorded at the Birmingham Civil Rights \n     Institute, Birmingham, Alabama, as a permanent testament to \n     racial reconciliation, peace, and harmony; and\n       Whereas the Birmingham Pledge, the motto for which is \n     ``Sign It, Live It'', is a powerful tool for facilitating \n     dialogue on the Nation's diversity and the need for people to \n     take personal steps to achieve racial harmony and tolerance \n     in communities: Now, therefore, be it\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute to H.J. Res. 102, recognizing the \n``Birmingham Pledge'' and its author, Birmingham attorney James E. \nRotch, for the contributions it and he have made to healing wounds of \nracial prejudice that still, unfortunately, divide segments of our \nsociety. The Birmingham Pledge is a powerful declaration that has had a \nprofound impact on those who have heard or seen it. It uses words of \nconviction and purpose that promote racial harmony by helping people \ncommunicate about racial issues in a positive way and by encouraging \npeople to make a commitment to racial harmony. By affixing our \nsignatures to the message conveyed by these words, we are, in effect, \nsaying to the world that we stand for freedom and equality for all, \nregardless of race or color. Further, we are saying that we will not \ntolerate discrimination leveled at anyone simply because of their race \nor color. The words of the Pledge are as follows:\n\n       I believe that every person has worth as an individual. I \n     believe that every person is entitled to dignity and respect, \n     regardless of race or color. I believe that every thought and \n     every act of racial prejudice is harmful; if it is in my \n     thought or act, then it is harmful to me as well as to \n     others. Therefore, from this day forward I will strive daily \n     to eliminate racial prejudice from my thoughts and actions. I \n     will discourage racial prejudice by others at every \n     opportunity. I will treat all people with dignity and \n     respect; and I will strive to honor this pledge, knowing that \n     the world will be a better place because of my effort.\n\n  These words do not reflect any new science or ground-breaking theory, \ninstead they reflect the time-honored principles, not always followed, \nthat have made this country the greatest example of individual liberty \nand freedom the world has ever known.\n  The words of the Birmingham Pledge are reflective of those used by \nThomas Jefferson in penning the Declaration of Independence so may \nyears ago. Jefferson wrote that ``all Men are created equal, [and] that \nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.'' \nThat language is clear. Thousands of citizens in Birmingham and Alabama \nand throughout this country and the world have recommitted themselves \nto these principles, and by offering this Pledge to the rest of the \ncountry, we ask everyone else to be rededicated to them, too. By \nsigning this pledge, people make an outward showing of that commitment. \nAgain, that is why I, on behalf of my constituents, offer this Joint \nResolution. In addition to calling us to our uniquely American \nheritage, the words of the Birmingham Pledge also recognize \nBirmingham's unfortunate history as a site of significant civil rights \nconfrontation. The Pledge conveys, as does the city's political and \neconomic reality, that Birmingham has moved forward from that difficult \ntime in its history to a more complete embrace of the principles \nembodied in this Pledge. Indeed, the city has experienced an \nastonishing measure of social, political, and economic progress in \nrecent years.\n  More than 70,000 people around the world have seen the merit of the \nBirmingham Pledge and signed it because they thought it was the right \nthing to do. Those signing it include the President, Members of \nCongress, Governors, state legislators, mayors, county commissioners, \ncity council members, clergymen, students, and the list goes on. The \npoint is, a broad cross-section of our society has embraced the high \nprinciples conveyed in the Birmingham Pledge because they see it as a \npowerful tool to facilitate dialogue on racial issues and additionally \nas a way for people to take personal steps to achieve racial harmony \nand tolerance in the communities in which they live. This Resolution \nsimply recognizes the good work that the Birmingham Pledge has already \naccomplished, and the potential it has for further progress in this \nimportant area of our national and international life. In order to \nincrease awareness of the Birmingham Pledge and to further its message, \nthis resolution calls for the establishment of a National Birmingham \nPledge Week. Setting aside such a period of time to further the message \nof the Birmingham Pledge and to celebrate the marked progress we have \nmade in the area of racial harmony would be a fitting way to recognize \nthe influence the Pledge is having on race relations in communities all \nacross America and around the world.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Without objection, reading of the amendment is \ndispensed with.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. Every day, through personal experience or \nthe news, we are reminded of the tremendous scientific advances that \nhave been made in medicine; but unfortunately, millions of Americans \nstill experience serious disparities in health outcomes as a result of \nethnicity, race, gender, or a lack of access to health care services.\n  Recent studies have demonstrated that minority populations, in \naddition to having lower rates of health care access, exhibit poorer \nhealth outcomes and may have higher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, infant \nmortality, death from cancer and heart disease, and other health \nproblems. For example, when compared to whites, the mortality rate for \nprostate cancer is nearly twice that for black men; and while African \nAmericans make up only 13 percent of our nations's population, they \nrepresented 49 percent of AIDS deaths in 1998. Further, compared to \nwhites, the prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic individuals is nearly \ndouble. In my home state of Tennessee, African Americans have an infant \nmortality rate nearly three times that of white Tennesseans, and \nTennessee's African Americans suffer from heart disease at one and a \nhalf times that rate of whites and are twice as likely to suffer a \nstroke.\n  The Jackson Sun recently published an investigative report, ``What's \nKilling Us?: The Color of Death 10 Years Later,'' which analyzes health \ndata specific to West Tennessee. The report highlighted that, \n``[African Americans] in West Tennessee die at a much higher rate--370 \npercent higher for hypertension for example--than whites with the same \ndiseases,'' and made it clear that we have failed to close the gap \nbetween death rates for black and white citizens over the last ten \nyears. West Tennessee is a snapshot of what is happening around the \ncountry, and the lessons apply broadly. The report provides key lessons \nto improve health that are applicable to all Americans including the \nneed for targeted research, improved education and public awareness, \nincreased prevention measures, and better access to care.\n  However, health disparities are not limited to minority communities. \nMedically underserved populations located in rural Appalachia, which \ninclude significant portions of my home state of Tennessee, exhibit \nhealth disparities consistent with minority populations. In rural \nAppalachia, where only one doctor exists for every 1,025 patients, \nwhite males between 35 and 64 are 19 percent more likely to die of \nheart disease than their counterparts elsewhere in the country, and \nwhite Appalachian women are 21 percent more likely to die of heart \ndisease. Moreover, barriers to care are undermining thee health of many \ncommunities, including rural areas where poverty and the lack of a \nhealth care infrastructure often inhibit the ability to prevent or \ntreat health care conditions.\n  In order to address the issue of health disparities, in June of this \nyear the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it began \nthe administrative process to elevate the current NIH Office of \nResearch on Minority Health to a center. In July, I held a Public \nHealth Subcommittee hearing, ``Health Disparities: Bridging the Gap,'' \nto focus on how to address minority health disparities and what \nmeasures we should take to improve minority health.\n\n  During this hearing, the Subcommittee examined health care \ndisparities among minorities, rural and underserved populations, and \nwomen. Witnesses ranging from the Administration to experts \nrepresenting the minority and underserved communities testified that a \nCenter on Minority Health and Health Disparities is needed to focus \nnational attention on this unrelenting problem. My friend and fellow \nTennessean, Dr. John Maupin, President of Meharry Medical College of \nNashville, said it best when he testified that ``ethnic minority and \nmedically underserved populations continue to suffer disproportionately \nfrom virtually every disease and we can no longer sit idly by without \naddressing this national crisis.''\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Minority Health and Health \nDisparities Research and Education Act of 2000, with Senators Kennedy \nand Jeffords. The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and \nEducation Act will expand research and education for the biomedical, \nbehavioral, economic, institutional, and environmental factors \ncontributing to health disparities in minority and medically \nunderserved populations.\n  This legislation establishes a National Center on Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities at NIH; a grant program through the new Center to \nfurther biomedical and behavioral research, education, and training; an \nendowment program to facilitate minority and other health disparities \nresearch at centers of excellence; and an extramural loan repayment \nprogram to train members of minority or other health disparities \npopulations as biomedical research professionals.\n  This bill also directs the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n(AHRQ) to conduct and support research to identify populations for \nwhich there is a significant disparity in the quality, outcomes, cost, \nor use of health care services or access, as well as the causes and \nbarriers to reducing health disparities. Additionally, AHRQ is able to \nidentify, test, and evaluate strategies for reducing or eliminating \nhealth disparities; develop measures and tools for the assessment and \nimprovement of the outcomes, quality, and appropriateness of health \ncare services; and increase the number of researchers who are members \nof health disparity populations, or the health services research \ncapacity of institutions that train such researchers.\n  Furthermore, this Act provides resources under the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for research and demonstration projects for \nthe training and education of health professionals in reducing \ndisparities in health care outcomes. A national campaign to inform the \npublic and a plan for the dissemination of information and findings \nunder all Titles of the Act is also established under the bill.\n  Health disparities may be the result of many factors, including \nlimited access to prevention and treatment services, poverty and \nsocioeconomic factors, exposure to environmental toxins, and even \ncultural factors. Turning our back on these disparities would be a \nnational failure. Every Tennessean and every American deserves the best \nquality of health regardless of their race, ethnicity, sex, or where \nthey live. With the concerted efforts of those supporting this bill, \nI'm certain that we can take the necessary steps to reverse our \nnation's health disparities.\n  I am pleased that the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research \nand Education Act is supported by Meharry Medical College in Nashville, \nTennessee; East Tennessee State University (ETSU) in Johnson City, \nTennessee; Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia; and the \nAssociation of Minority Health Professions Schools. Dr. Ronald Franks \nof ETSU wrote of his support for this legislation because it identifies \n``health populations as a priority in the nation's health agenda and \nthe recognition of the health disparities in the Appalachian region.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. John \nMaupin of Meharry Medical College, and Dr. Ronald Franks and Dr. Bruce \nBehringer of East Tennessee State University for their dedication to \nhelping the minority and medically underserved populations in Tennessee \nand for their counsel and assistance on this legislation. I would also \nlike to thank my colleagues for their work and dedication to this \nissue, and I look forward to the enactment of the bill this year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the \nMinority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of \n2000. I commend Senator Frist for his leadership on the issue of health \ndisparities in our minority and underserved communities. I also commend \nthe many Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked hard to ensure \nthat the principles of equal justice and opportunity apply to health \ncare. Health care\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\nshould be a basic right. With our current economic prosperity and the \nextraordinary recent advances in medicine, we should be able to \nguarantee that right to all Americans.\n  The extraordinary advances in health care in recent decades have not \nbeen shared by all our citizens. Minority communities suffer \ndisproportionately from higher rates of death from cancer, stroke, and \nheart disease, as well as from higher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and \nother severe health problems. Africa American men who contract prostate \ncancer are more than twice as likely to die from it as white men. \nVietnamese American women are five times more likely than white women \nto contract cervical cancer. Hispanic women are twice as likely to \ncontract cervical cancer. Native Hawaiian men are 13 percent more \nlikely to contract lung cancer. Alaskan Native women are 72 percent \nmore likely to contract colon cancer and rectal cancer. In addition, \nAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be \ndiagnosed with cancer after the disease has reached an advanced stage. \nFor African Americans, the result is a 35 percent higher death rate.\n  The reality of poverty clearly affects the nation's health. Nearly 20 \nmillion white Americans live below the poverty line and many live in \nrural areas such as Appalachia, where 46 percent of counties are \ndesignated as health professions shortage areas and high rates of \npoverty contribute to health disparity outcomes. The lack of a health \ncare facilities or benefits often means poor health care and often a \npoor prognosis for what might have been a preventable or curable \ncondition. In the Appalachia regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and West \nVirginia, the rates of the five top causes of death in the U.S. all \nexceeded the national, average in 1997. Lack of availability and access \nto health care for poor and underserved regions often goes hand in hand \nwith higher morbidity and mortality rates. Higher rates of heart \ndisease in white males between the ages of 35 and 64 and cervical \ncancer in white females are also found in Appalachia. We must find \nbetter answers to identify and overcome the barriers to care that lead \nto dire outcomes in underserved communities.\n  While we have continued to make progress in the reduction of child \npoverty, child mortality, teenage pregnancy, and juvenile violence, we \ncontinue to see wide disparities by race and income, with communities \nof color and those in poverty lagging behind others. Infant mortality \nrate has declined nationally from 10.9 infant deaths for every 1,000 \nlive births in 1983 to 7.2 in 1998. But among African Americans, the \nrate is 13.7--more than twice the rate of any other group. In addition, \nfar too many people across this nation lack the health insurance that \nis necessary for access to basic health care. Over one-third of \nHispanic Americans are uninsured, the highest rate among all ethnic \ngroups and two and a half time the rate of 14% for whites. Nearly one-\nfourth of African Americans, and about one-fifth of Asian Americans are \nalso uninsured.\n  In Massachusetts, significant progress has been made in improving the \noverall health status and access to health care. We are one of a \nhandful of states in the country to devote the tobacco settlement money \nentirely to health care. Yet our significant commitment to health care \nis not translating into equal access or improved health status for all \nof our citizens. Health status differs by racial/ethnic group and by \nincome group and the differences are reflected in the alarming \ndiscrepancy in mortality rates. The infant mortality rate for African-\nAmericans is 11.7--over twice as high as the overall statewide rate of \n5.3.\n  The same pattern exists for the HIV/AIDS-related mortality rate, \nwhich is more than six times greater for African-Americans and more \nthan four times greater for Hispanics. African American women are more \nlikely to lose their lives to breast cancer, and nearly six times a \nmany Asian-American women and nearly two times as many Hispanic women \nhave never taken a Pap test, which is essential in detection cervical \ncancer. Clearly, too many citizens are not benefitting from the \nadvances made in science, medicine, and the economy.\n  The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act \naddresses the biomedical, behavioral, economic, institutional, and \nenvironmental factors that have caused health disparities in \ncommunities of color and in undeserved communities around our nation. \nIt provides needed resources for research, data collection, medical \neducation, and public awareness, in order to understand the root causes \nof diseases and poor health outcomes and to develop strategies to meet \nthe health needs of these vulnerable communities. Each of these aspects \nhas an important role to play in the reduction and eventual elimination \nof the unacceptable disparities that now exist.\n  Title I of the bill establishes a Center for Research on Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of Health. It \nalso provides resources to educational institutions to train minority \nindividuals as biomedical research professionals.\n  Title II focuses on identifying, evaluating, and disseminating \ninformation on the factors that contribute to health disparities.\n  Title III addresses the critical need for trained and culturally \ncompetent health care professionals by providing resources to develop \neffective educational support.\n  Title IV enhances the collection of data on race and ethnicity to \ndetermine what steps the federal government should take to ensure that \nall necessary information is collected.\n  Title V provides funding for a public awareness and information \ncampaign to inform minority communities of the health conditions that \nare affecting them disproportionately and of the programs and services \navailable to them.\n  Passage of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and \nEducation Act demonstrates our strong commitment a healthier future for \nall our citizens. America has the resources to accomplish this goal and \nI urge the Senate to achieve it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
