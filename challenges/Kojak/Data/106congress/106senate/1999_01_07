Your righteous \njudgment is irreducible and your grace irrefutable.\n  Holy God, as this sacred Chamber becomes a court and these Senators \nbecome jurors, be omnipresent in the pressures of these impeachment \nproceedings. Grant the Senators the ability to exercise clear judgment \nwithout judgmentalism. Today, unite the Senate in nonpartisan \ncommitment to the procedures that will most effectively resolve the \ngrave matters before them and our Nation. Bind the Senators together as \nfellow patriots seeking Your best for our beloved land.\n  Oh, dear Father, author of this Republic and divine authority from \nwhom the Senators' powers flow, we trust You.

Contrary to that \n     oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury \n     concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and \n     details of his relationship with a subordinate Government \n     employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading \n     testimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he \n     allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that civil \n     rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the \n     testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of \n     evidence in that civil rights action.\n       In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the \n     integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.\n\n                               Article II\n\n       In his conduct while President of the United States, \n     William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional \n     oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the \n     United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, \n     and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, \n     and impeded the administration of justice, and has to that \n     end engaged personally, and through his subordinates and \n     agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, \n     impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.\n       The means used to implement this course of conduct or \n     scheme included one or more of the following acts:\n       (1) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to execute a sworn \n     affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, \n     false and misleading.\n       (2) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to give perjurious, false \n     and misleading testimony if and when called to testify \n     personally in that proceeding.\n       (3) On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a \n     scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in a \n     Federal civil rights action brought against him.\n       (4) Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing \n     through and including January 14, 1998, William Jefferson \n     Clinton intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job \n     assistance to a witness in a Federal civil rights action \n     brought against him in order to corruptly prevent the \n     truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a \n     time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have \n     been harmful to him.\n       (5) On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and \n     misleading statements to a Federal judge characterizing an \n     affidavit, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by \n     the judge. Such false and misleading statements were \n     subsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a communication \n     to that judge.\n       (6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of \n     events relevant to a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him to a potential witness in that proceeding, in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witness.\n       (7) On or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading statements to \n     potential witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of those \n     witnesses. The false and misleading statements made by \n     William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to \n     the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and \n     misleading information.\n       In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined \n     the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.\n       Passed the House of Representatives December 19, 1998.

Carle, Clerk.\n\n  Mr. President, that completes the exhibition of the articles of \nimpeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \nStates. The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial. \nThe managers now request leave to withdraw.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you, Mr. Manager Hyde.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend those brave \nAmericans who served aboard the U.S.S. Phaon.\n  During World War II, the Phaon compiled an outstanding record as a \nbattle damage repair ship. She was part of three major battles and \nhelped the U.S. fleet to remain in action throughout the Central \nPacific campaign.\n  The Phaon was an important part of mobile Service Squadron Ten, whose \nbattle role was to remain within the battle area and conduct repairs--\nkeeping fighting vessels in action, preventing the loss of damaged \nvessels by making them seaworthy, and returning repaired vessels to \naction as soon as possible. To accomplish this, the Navy converted tank \ntransports into battle damage repair ships.\n  The Phaon was one of the original mobile service squadron vessels \nthat arrived in the Central Pacific in late 1943 to test new concepts \nin naval logistics and mobile repair. Their work began under fire at \nMajuro with restoration of all types of craft from the invasion of \nTarawa and repairs to the battleships Washington and Indiana.\n  By early 1944, the Phaon's crew was skilled, experienced, and ready \nto participate in the campaigns to advance across the Pacific. In March \nshe was with the fleet at Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In June she joined \nthe invasion of Saipan. In July she was at Tinian. She was subject to \nmore than 60 air raids while working.\n  Time and again, the Phaon heroically entered the fray to repair a \ndamaged ship. At Saipan, the destroyer Phelps was hit while engaged in \nground support shore bombardment. She called the Phaon, and the two \nships tied bow to stern. While the Phelps continued to bomb the shore, \nthe Phaon repaired her damage and replenished her ammunition. At the \nsame time, the Phaon dispatched several off-ship repair crews to other \nvessels and had alongside for repairs a tank landing craft, a \nminesweeper, and the destroyer U.S.S. Shaw. One month later, at Tinian, \nthe Phaon performed similar feats to repair the destroyer Norman Scott \nand the battleship Colorado.\n  By the war's end, the Phaon had repaired at least 96 ships and more \nthan 2000 vessels and crafts of all types. She played a major role in \nthe success of Service Squadron 10, of which Rear Admiral W.R. Carter \nsaid:\n\n       Had it failed, the war would have lasted much longer at \n     much greater cost in blood and dollars. . . . It was a never-\n     ending job, and the men and officers . . . were as much a \n     part of the fleet which defeated Japan as were  . . . any \n     battleship, carrier, cruiser, or destroyer.\n\n  Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Commander of the Central Pacific Force, \ncalled the record of the Phaon and Service Squadron 10 ``achievements \nof which all Americans can be justly proud, but about which most of \nthem have little or no knowledge.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that these remarks increase our knowledge and \nrespect for the critical role that damage repair ships played in the \nPacific campaigns. I know you will join me and every American in \nsaluting the brave crew of the U.S.S. Phaon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/07/senate-section/article/S46-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING WILLIAM F. HEIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to acknowledge \nthe hard work and dedicated public service of Mr. William F. Hein, \ndeputy executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan \nTransportation Commission (MTC). Mr. Hein retired in December, 1998.\n  Mr. Hein served as a deputy executive director of the MTC for 20 \nyears, capping a distinguished four-decade career in the transportation \nfield. The MTC is the transportation planning and finance agency for \nthe nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, and Mr. Hein helped build the \nMTC into a regional transportation planning and finance agency that is \na model for our nation. His expertise and leadership over the last two \ndecades has brought about a transformation of the Bay Area's \ntransportation system, resulting in an integrated, multimodal network \nof highways, local streets and roads, rail, car pool lanes, ferry \nservices, bicycle and pedestrian access, and bus routes.\n  During his tenure with the MTC, William Hein has earned the respect \nand gratitude of numerous local elected officials, representing the \ndiversity of the Bay Area, who have been fortunate enough to serve on \nthe MTC.\n  Mr. Hein enjoyed a rich and distinguished career in public service \nprior to joining the MTC, including his work as director of planning \nfor the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), bureau chief for the \nNew Jersey Department of Transportation, analyst for the California \nLegislative Analyst's Office, and engineer for the California Bridge \nDepartment and the City of Santa Clara. Mr. Hein has also served his \ncountry as a Peace Corps volunteer in Bangladesh.\n  Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues in this United States \nSenate, the Bay Area transportation community will miss Mr. Hein and \nhis valuable contributions to the quality of life in the Bay Area. I \nhope you will join me to wish a warm and fond farewell and to thank him \nfor a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/07/senate-section/article/S46-5", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S46]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
