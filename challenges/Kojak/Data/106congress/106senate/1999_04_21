Mr. President, the Congress is about to be asked to \nappropriate $10 billion, and perhaps more, in emergency funds to \nfinance a war in the Balkans and to help the refugees that war has \ncreated. We will be asked to do so after a brief debate and with no \nopportunity to impose conditions or to add reservations. That is the \nwrong way to deal with so grave an issue.\n  On March 23, the Senate authorized air attacks on Yugoslavia in the \nhope that they would motivate the Government of Yugoslavia to grant \nautonomy to the Kosovars, a status far less than the independence they \nseek, enforced by the presence of American and other NATO troops for an \nundefined period of time, and thus to prevent a refugee crisis. We have \nbeen spectacularly unsuccessful at attaining either goal.\n  I voted against the March resolution. I did so because I believe that \nthe United States should engage in armed conflict only when its vital \ninterests are at stake, and that the then Serb repression of the \nKosovar Albanians did not involve any of our vital national interests.\n  My vote was also motivated by the belief that the limited bombing \nproposed would be unlikely to help us reach the dubious goal of \noccupying Kosovo. When we do engage our Armed Forces in conflict, we \nshould do so decisively and with overwhelming force aimed at the cause \nof the conflict--in this case, the Milosevic government in Belgrade.\n  This conflict, to the contrary, was begun in too limited a fashion to \nbe likely to bring the Serbs to heel, with no contingency plans should \nthe early bombing not work, and with no anticipation of the brutal Serb \nreaction in driving hundreds of thousands of Kosovars out of home and \ncountry.\n  It is that failure that brings us to our present state. The President \nwill not acknowledge our failure to reach his goals, will not speak \nseriously to the American people about both ends and means, and will \nnot ask Congress to authorize him to act decisively and to support him \nin doing so. Instead, we\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nare engaged in a conflict in which the primary goal seems to be to \navoid American casualties, the secondary goal to avoid Serbian \ncasualties. So the only real casualties are among the Kosovar \nAlbanians, the people the conflict was designed to protect.\n  The President will not, and should not, send our troops into Kosovo \nand won't arm the Kosovo rebels so they can defend themselves. We bomb \nbuildings that we are certain are empty but not television towers or \nairports. We bomb oil storage depots but allow oil tankers to unload \nreplacement oil within sight of our fleet.\n  At this point, of course, a conflict over an issue that was not vital \nto our national security in the beginning has now escalated to one that \nis, both with respect to the refugees and to the survival of NATO \nitself, all due to the frivolous and half-hearted nature of our \nmilitary operations. In the abstract, this fact lays weight to the \narguments of Senators Lugar and McCain, among others, to lift the \nartificial and self-defeating renunciation of ground operations.\n  But their arguments flounder disastrously with the first whiff of \nreality. This is a war run by committee. A dozen politicians from \nalmost as many countries must sign off on targets even with respect to \nthe air war. The United States has not even sought NATO consent to arm \nthe Kosovars and to blockade Yugoslavia.\n  Does any Senator believe for a moment that this administration will \nwage or is capable of waging a real war with victory as its goal? No.\n  We have only four realistic alternatives, all unpalatable. First, \nthere is the remote hope that Milosevic will surrender and agree to our \ndemands. Under those circumstances, we would get to occupy Kosovo for \nperhaps 25 years. Second, we may quit and go home, leaving chaos in our \nwake. Third, the most likely outcome now is a settlement brokered by \nthe Russians in which the 90 percent of Albanian Kosovars get the \npoorest half of a devastated province and the 10 percent Serb Kosovars \nget the best half. We will then be asked to rebuild Kosovo, Albania, \nMacedonia, and probably Serbia as well. President Clinton will proclaim \nthis a victory.\n  The fourth and last alternative is a gradual escalation of the air \nwar, followed by gradual escalation on the ground, without any prospect \nof real victory but at a very real cost in American lives and the \nexpenditure of billions of American dollars.\n  Each of these alternatives, Mr. President, is a terrible disservice \nto the brave American men and women who are loyally fighting this war \nand who deserve better from our leaders. Each is a tragedy for the \nhundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians rooted out of destroyed \nhomes, turned into impoverished refugees or killed outright.\n  It is those prospects that the Senate should be debating, using such \ntime as is proportionate to the seriousness of the issues.\n  But we are now faced with the prospect of a $12 billion add-on to a \n$2 billion supplemental appropriations bill, with little opportunity \nfor debate and no opportunity to amend or condition that appropriation. \nWhat should have been an occasion for a serious debate will become \ninstead a venture in avoiding the responsibility to ask and to answer \nhard questions.\n  That is a game the Senate should not play. At the very least, we \nshould allow those who propose intervention on the ground an \nopportunity to make their case, and those of us who wish to arm the \nrebels a chance to make ours.\n  An appropriation covering the cost of this conflict until October \nwithout seriously debated conditions is a blank check to the President \nto conduct the conflict as he pleases. It is all the authorization for \nwar on the ground he is ever likely to seek. It is a total abdication \nof our responsibilities. I cannot support such an action. I will do all \nI can to defeat it.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S3972-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3972-S3975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRAGIC SCHOOL SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is grieving for one \nof our communities that has suffered a tragic school shooting. We are \nall profoundly saddened today by the news out of the State of Colorado.\n  For those of us from my home State of Oregon, this feeling is, \nunfortunately, too familiar. It was just about a year ago that this \nsame form of evil visited Thurston High School in Oregon. And I want to \nsay, first and foremost, to the people of Colorado that Oregon's heart \ngoes out to all of you today. The people of Colorado are in our \nprayers.\n  If our experience can be any measure of comfort, I would offer the \nobservation that in Colorado, just as it was in Oregon, the parents and \nstudents will find that their neighbors can be an incredible resource \nof support. There is more strength in our communities than we realize. \nAnd while nothing--nothing--can ever ease this sort of pain, that \nstrength does possess a tremendous healing power.\n  Mr. President, why are we seeing these tragedies in our country? We \nfeel so good about the very strong economy. We play a preeminent \nleadership role in the world. There are so many good things in our \nNation. But we send our children off to school in the morning and so \noften we have to worry that they might be gunned down by a classmate. \nWhat has produced this horrible evil?\n  I do not come to the floor of the Senate today to say I have the \nanswers, but I know that we are not doing our job in this body if we do \nnot try to find them. And it seems to me those of us from the States \nthat have seen this horrible scourge--the Senators from Colorado and \nArkansas and Kentucky and my own of Oregon--need to sit down together--\nand soon--and begin a meaningful conversation about the practical and \nconcrete steps that can be taken to prevent these tragedies. We ought \nto talk with everyone, we ought to talk with Sarah Brady, who has one \npoint of view, talk with the National Rifle Association, who has \nanother point of view. We need to have a concrete dialogue with all who \nhave been part of this national discussion to find a way to stop these \ntragedies.\n\n  In the wake of what happened in Springfield, OR, Senator Gordon Smith \nand I worked, on a bipartisan basis, to make sure that if a kid brought \na gun to school, action would be taken to treat that as a five-alarm \nwarning. Looking at yesterday's tragedy, it seems to me that our \nbipartisan bill would not have been enough, because these students had \nnever been caught with guns in school before. But the facts appear to \nbe that the students there knew that this group was involved with \nweapons and that they had been engaged in potentially dangerous \nactivities. We need to find ways to translate this knowledge into \nconcrete approaches so the authorities can take steps to protect our \nyoungsters in our schools.\n  Mr. President, so many Members of this body are parents. Many of our \ncolleagues have been blessed with grandchildren. It chills all of us to \nthe bone to think that this can happen in our communities, and that it \nhas happened too often.\n  The people have elected us to lead. This is a problem which cannot be \navoided. I am going to do everything I can, in a bipartisan fashion, \nwith colleagues from other States that have seen these tragedies, to \nfind those practical steps so parents across this country can have the \ncertainty that when they send their youngsters to school they will come \nhome safely at the end of the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I also thank my \ngood friend from Vermont, the chairman of the committee that I serve on \nwith him. I wanted to just take a few minutes to focus the attention of \nthe Senate on this terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday in our \nschools. We all now know two students of Columbine High School in \nLittleton, CO, stormed into their school and began shooting at students \nand teachers, yesterday. The last that I heard, police believed that 16 \npeople have been killed. Many of them were either just beginning their \nlunch or were studying in the library at the time they were assaulted. \nThe details behind the violence are overwhelming, and the motivations \nleading to it are incomprehensible to all of us. But we are left \nwondering how this could happen in a suburban community like Littleton, \nCO.\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\n  I know we all grieve with the parents of those students and the \nfamilies of the faculty who were killed yesterday.\n  Our Nation has witnessed five violent events in our schools during \nthe past 17 months and we need to focus on that pattern of activity. \nFive communities have experienced this violence firsthand:\n  In Paducah, KY, in December of 1997, December 1, 1997, a 14-year-old \nboy shot and killed three girls at Heath High School in Kentucky and \nthe shooter wounded five others.\n  On March 24, 1998, in Jonesboro, AR, two young boys hiding in the \nwoods began shooting at their classmates and their teachers.\n  At Edinboro, PA, on April 25 of 1998 another 14-year-old student of \nParker Middle School shot and killed a teacher and two other boys were \nwounded.\n  In Fayetteville, TN, less than a year ago, on March 19 of 1998, a \nsenior at Lincoln County High School in Tennessee shot and killed a \nfellow student. And then in Springfield, OR, 2 days after the Tennessee \nincident, on May 21 of 1998, a 15-year-old student opened fire at \nThurston High School in Oregon and killed two students and wounded 22 \nothers.\n  We should not wait for another incident to happen before we take some \naction here in the Congress. These tragedies are the reason that last \nyear I introduced a bill entitled ``The Safe Schools Security Act.'' \nThe bill passed the Senate unanimously, I believe. Unfortunately, it \nwas dropped in the conference. This year, a little over a month ago, on \nMarch 17, I again introduced the Safe Schools Security Act. In my view, \nwe need to move ahead with that legislation. We have waited too long.\n  Yesterday the importance of this bill was made more evident by what \nwe observed in Colorado. Recent studies show that our children fear \nthey will be the victims of crime in school. Mr. President, 29 percent \nof our elementary schoolchildren fear that, 34 percent of our junior \nhigh, and 20 percent of our high school students fear they will be a \nvictim of a crime while at school, according to a recent poll.\n  The schoolyard fight which I was familiar with when I was growing up \nis no longer the worst fear that students have. Mr. President, 75 \npercent of children ages 7 through 10 say they do worry about being \nshot or stabbed, and 13 percent of high school seniors report being \nthreatened by a weapon between 1995 and 1996.\n  In 1997, a high school in my home State, Belen High School in Belen, \nNM, decided to improve school security. They did so in an effort to \nprotect their students and their teachers and the school property. \nBelen partnered with Sandia National Laboratories, one of our \nDepartment of Energy Labs in Albuquerque, to try to accomplish this \nsecurity upgrade. The results have been impressive. After 2 years, \nBelen High School experienced a 75-percent reduction in school \nviolence, a 30-percent reduction in truancy, an 80-percent reduction in \nvehicle break-ins in the school parking lot, and a 75-percent reduction \nin vandalism.\n\n  Most noteworthy, Belen realized a 100-percent reduction in the \npresence of unauthorized people on school grounds. This is an issue in \nmore and more of our schools today. They implemented several security \nmeasures, including placing security officers on permanent patrol on \nthe campus, fencing the property, and restricting access to a single \nentrance where students and visitors could be monitored. They installed \ncameras in the parking lots to monitor vehicles and student activities. \nThrough cooperation with the local police, the high school in Belen \nsecured a police officer to work with the campus security officers and \nto patrol the school grounds after school to prevent unauthorized \naccess.\n  This Safe Schools Security Act, which I have introduced again this \nyear, S. 638, will also establish a security technology center that \nSandia would operate to provide security assessments of middle schools \nand high schools, and to offer advice to schools about the security \nmeasures that are needed to be implemented and improved. The act would \nprovide money and grants to local schools so they could purchase the \nappropriate technology and hire the necessary personnel to beef up \nsecurity.\n  Obviously, improving school security will not guarantee that violence \nceases in our schools.\n  It is a start. By restricting access, we can reduce unauthorized \npersons coming onto school grounds. By installing cameras on some of \nour school campuses, schools can be forewarned of problems in certain \nareas of the campus, and law enforcement can utilize those cameras in \nsituations like the hostage situation that occurred yesterday in \nColorado.\n  By planning the construction of schools with security in mind, we can \nbegin to minimize the risks of violence occurring in our schools. \nTeachers and administrators need to identify their schools' security \nweaknesses. The personnel who have been working on this issue at Sandia \nLabs, with Federal money I should point out, have developed some \nexpertise that can be helpful to some of our schools in this regard. \nBecause of yesterday's tragedy, parents, teachers, and community \nleaders are asking, what can be done to protect our schools, and all of \nus in America are debating what can be done.\n  This bill cannot ensure that our children will be safe in school, but \nit will provide schools with a course of action to follow and with some \nresources to begin addressing this problem in a meaningful way.\n  We all know that most schools do not have the financial resources to \npurchase security technology, and high schools and middle schools often \nlack the technical expertise to know what kind of technology will best \nserve their school. This bill could help to provide that expertise and \nhelp to give good advice, expert advice to schools on appropriate \ntechnology and on appropriate actions that could be taken to make our \nschools more secure.\n  Mr. President, with this terrible tragedy still very much in front of \nus, I urge that we consider the proposals that I  have set forth in \nthis bill. I urge that we think about what action we can take to lessen \nthe likelihood of these types of incidents in the future. Obviously, \nour children are our most important resource in this country, and I \nbelieve some additional effort in this regard would be well advised and \nstrongly supported by all my colleagues.\n\n  I hope we can move ahead on this bill. I appreciate very much the \nchance to speak on it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this morning we all have to return to \nbusiness, but it is an especially difficult day to do so.\n  It is difficult to think of anything other than the terrible tragedy \nin Littleton, CO yesterday.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Columbine High \nSchool--the students and staff injured; the families of those who were \nkilled; and everyone who suffered the terrifying ordeal there.\n  Our nation is suffering, too--at the thought that such horrifying \nevents are taking place all too often in our country.\n  It was heartening to see so many parents reunited with their children \nyesterday. Still, those joyful hugs were bittersweet reminders of the \nfamilies waiting for students and staff who didn't come home.\n  These families and the community of Littleton have lost their loved \nones, and their lives will never be the same again. Their losses cannot \nbe replaced. They, and everyone affected by yesterday's events, have \nlost their innocence, too.\n  We all want to believe that our schools will be places where children \ncan learn in a safe, supportive environment, where they will learn not \nonly what they need to go on to college or vocational school or work, \nbut also what they need to become well-balanced, emotionally secure \npeople.\n  Certainly schools cannot be expected to do the job by themselves. It \ndoes take a village to raise a child.\n  It takes, first and foremost, parents who love and respect and talk \nto and spend time with their children. Parents must be prepared to meet \nthe daunting challenge of rearing children in a society that seems to \nmove too fast. As important as schools are, parents are their \nchildren's first and most compelling teachers. Parents must realize \nthat, even when they aren't conscious of it, they are teaching their \nchildren constantly. Their example is the most powerful teaching tool \navailable, and it\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\ncan be used to constructive or destructive ends. Our children's values \noriginate from their parents' values--those taught, and those \nexemplified, those that are negative and those that are positive.\n  It also takes a child care system that pays its workers more than the \nminimum wage. It takes schools that truly educate and do their best to \ngive every student the attention he or she needs. It takes qualified \nteachers who value their students and, in turn, are valued by us. It \ntakes friends and neighbors who get involved in supporting parents, \nschools, and children. It takes a juvenile justice system that protects \nsociety from violent criminals and strives to intervene in youthful \noffenders' lives before they are beyond our help. It takes a society \nthat shows children the way without alienating them.\n  It takes all of us.\n  Our schools are populated by a talented, committed generation of \nyoung people. I am optimistic about our future, their future. It is a \nsad reality that just a few people can cause such great devastation--in \nour schools and on our streets. The problem is not our children--it is \nour failure to deal adequately with their needs. Too many of today's \nchildren face intense fear, anger, and confusion. They need our time \nand attention. They need us to teach them how to deal with those \nemotions in constructive ways.\n  Even children who have good values--and are good kids--face \nincredible emotional and societal challenges and pressures that most \nchildren of my generation never had to worry about. And they need our \nhelp. I never had to worry about assault weapons or pipe bombs when I \nwent to school. I wasn't confronted with drug pushers. And I had two \nloving parents who were involved in my education and my life.\n  We can't go back in time, and we shouldn't undercut our basic \nfreedoms. But we do have to work together--every one of us--to address \nthe problems that threaten the fabric of our society.\n  We can--and should--have a thoughtful discussion about how to shape a \ncomprehensive national response to the problem of violence in our \nschools and our communities. We should have that discussion soon.\n  But today is about grieving the loss of those killed, sending \npositive thoughts to those who were injured, and praying for everyone \ninvolved in this terrible tragedy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday's tragedy in Littleton, \nColorado has brought the nation together in our sense of shock and \nhorror. I want the people of Littleton to know that they are in our \nthoughts and our hearts. We cannot know the devastation they must feel, \nand we can only imagine, ``what if that were my child?'' In this time \nof terrible sorrow, your nation sends its profound sympathy.\n  Yesterday, two heavily-armed students went into Columbine High School \nin Littleton, in what has been described as a suicide mission, to bring \nviolence and death on their classmates, their teachers, and themselves.\n  One student last night, a girl from another high school who visited \nColumbine to show her support, made a very important observation: \n``People always say `it couldn't happen here; it couldn't happen to \nme,' well, it did happen here; it did happen to us.'' We must ask \nourselves what we can to stop this senseless violence from happening \nagain in another town, another community, another school.\n  As we begin to sort through the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, \ninevitably we will arrive at the question ``why?'' It is too easy for a \nyoung person these days to feel anonymous--to go unseen. Too many young \npeople in America will wake up today, walk through the neighborhood, \nattend a crowded school, walk through the shopping mall, and return \nhome--without ever getting acknowledgment or recognition or support \nfrom even one adult.\n  As a nation, we must make a determined effort to change this \nunfortunate fact. We have a responsibility to the nation's young people \nto do better. I have talked to too many young people who say that \n``adults just don't seem to care about me.'' Sometimes just a \nconversation or even a smile can send an important message to a young \nperson--``You matter. I want things to go well for you. If you need \nhelp, I'm here.''\n  Young people today are different in many ways than when we were \nyoung, but one thing hasn't changed. They still need our understanding, \nand our compassion. And they need to know that someone cares about them \nso that they don't see violence as a solution. Violence is not an \noption. We cannot tolerate violence in our schools.\n  Tragically, these two students at Columbine High School, who so \ndesperately wanted someone's attention have finally succeeded. In their \ncry to be heard, they have done irreparable damage to the families and \ncommunity of Littleton. And as we search for an explanation, we find \nourselves struggling to understand who those two boys were and how they \ncould commit such an awful crime.\n  There is not a legislative solution to the problem of violence in our \nschools. Instead, we must begin a national dialogue about what we all \ncan do to let children know that violence is simply not acceptable. As \nwe all reflect on yesterday, each one of us should ask ourselves what \nwe can do to make a difference. We each must take responsibility to do \na better job in letting all children know that adults care about them . \n. . that there are other ways to make their voice heard . . . that they \nmatter.\n  For the last three years, I have cosponsored, with former Senator \nKempthorne, a resolution establishing the Day of Concern About Young \nPeople and Gun Violence. Every year we have received dozens of Senate \ncosponsors--56 last year--and widespread support from the Parent-\nTeacher Association, Mothers Against Violence in America, the National \nAssociation of Student Councils, and others.\n  But more importantly, last year more than a million students signed a \npledge promising they would never take a gun to school, would never use \na gun to settle a dispute, and would use their influence to prevent \nfriends from using guns to settle disputes. I hope all of my Senate \ncolleagues will join me this year in cosponsoring and passing this \nimportant resolution establishing the Day of Concern on October 21, \n1999.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my wife Joan and I were shocked and \ndismayed at the violence and bloodshed at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, Colorado yesterday.\n  Words cannot do justification to the deep sense of loss all of us are \nfeeling today following the tragedy. But words--these words, and the \nwords of our prayers--are what we have to offer now.\n  I offer my condolences to all those who lost loved ones, and to those \nwhose loved ones have been wounded, hurt, and terrified.\n  I would like to ask America for their prayers as well. They are \nneeded. The Columbine High School community is in shock, the State of \nColorado is in shock, and America is in shock.\n  Before I left my office just now, I heard the final number of \ncasualties--15. Fifteen lives, most of them young, ended yesterday by \nsavage violence.\n  This is a wound, a scar, that will not be removed, and for those who \nbear the worst of this burden my wife and I offer all our compassion, \nour sympathy and our prayers.\n  We should recognize the heroism of the local police, the emergency \npersonnel, and others who responded, as well as the heroism of the \nstudents and teachers caught in the attack. Many put their lives on the \nline to rescue students and escort them to safety.\n  The simple, unplanned bravery and courage of those who did whatever \nthey could--in the midst of mayhem and terror--to avert further tragedy \nmight never be fully known but should be fully acknowledged.\n  There are far too many of my colleagues who have had this \nexperience--who have watched as news of school shootings and teen \nviolence spread across the media. This tragedy erupted in Colorado, but \nit is part of a nationwide concern.\n  In the coming months there will be time, and there will be a need, \nfor us to commit ourselves to finding a solution to this tragic \nproblem. We must ask ourselves how this could happen, and what can be \ndone to prevent it from ever happening again. There is, I am sure, no \nsimple solution. But we must pledge ourselves to doing what we can.\n  Right now, however, I think the best response in the aftermath of \nthis horror is, as Governor Bill Owens said, to\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nhug our children. To hug them, and think about providing a better, more \nsecure future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think, be it Senator Allard or his wife \nor myself or my wife or any American, we woke up this morning to watch \nthe morning news to be saddened by the situation in Kosovo but to be \nbrought to tears by the situation in Littleton, CO. It is a tragic time \nand a very sad day for America. I concur with my colleague from \nColorado, there are no easy answers. There were brave people and there \nwere wonderful young people who lost their lives. So let me join with \nmy colleague from Colorado in expressing our concern, our sympathy, and \nour condolences to all involved in this tragic issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Boxer \nand I have been given 30 minutes in morning business today. Is that \ntrue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is a lot going on in the world today. \nWe have the conflict in Kosovo. We have, as the Senator from Oregon \npointed out, the calamity that has taken place in the State of \nColorado, dealing with the death of 16 children, or maybe even more.\n  In spite of these very dramatic events taking place around the world, \nI think it is appropriate that we pause and reflect on one of the most \nimportant days we have each year, and that is Earth Day, which is \ntomorrow.\n  As we know, tomorrow will be the culminating day of this week \nlegislatively because of the events that will take place with the 50th \nanniversary of NATO. So tomorrow we will be unable to celebrate Earth \nDay here in the Senate. So Senator Boxer and I felt it was appropriate \nthat we spend some time with some of our colleagues talking about Earth \nDay and the importance of Earth Day.\n  There are a number of ways we can celebrate Earth Day, but I think \nthere is no way that is more appropriate than talking about one of the \nthings which sets the United States apart from any other nation, and \nthat is our great National Park System. We are the envy of the rest of \nthe world. When people talk about successes in Government, I think they \nmust reflect upon our National Park System.\n  We have 54 national parks in the United States. In addition to that, \nwe have a number of other entities within our National Park System that \nare important. But today I want to talk about our national parks.\n  We are very fortunate in Nevada; we have one of the 54 national \nparks. It is a unique setting. The Great Basin National Park is the \nbaby of our National Park System. There is only one national park that \nis newer than the Great Basin National Park. And we are so happy to \nhave the Great Basin National Park. It was 60 years in its coming.\n  I can remember when I introduced legislation to have this beautiful \nfacility become a national park. This chart shows part of our national \npark. It is Wheeler Peak, which is about 13,000 feet high. You can see \nthe majesty of this great mountain.\n  When I introduced this legislation, President Reagan was President of \nthe United States. There were times that were very partisan then, as \nnow, and the Secretary of Agriculture was asking the President to veto \nthe creation of the national park.\n  I called in the Director of the National Park System, William Penn \nMott, and I said, I am really worried that the President is going to \nveto the legislation creating this national park. He looked at me and \nsaid, There is no way President Reagan is going to veto this national \npark. He said, I have been with President Reagan; I worked with him \nwhen he was Governor of the State of California, and he has assigned me \nto be the superintendent of the parks for our country. He said, It was \nin the 1930s when I was a park ranger that I was called upon by Senator \nKey Pittman, a Senator from Nevada, to travel to Nevada to find a \nlocation for a national park. I went there, and I found that location. \nIt is this exact spot that you have chosen to designate as a national \npark.\n  And he said, for political reasons, it has never come to reality. He \nsaid that possibility is now, and there is no way that President Reagan \nwould veto the creation of this gem that we have in the State of \nNevada.\n  He was right. The President gladly signed the bill, and we now have \nas part of our National Park System the Great Basin National Park. We \ncould pick any one of the 54 units in our National Park System, and I \nam sure people from those States would be just as proud of that park as \nI am of the Great Basin National Park. This park has Wheeler Peak, \nwhich I show you here, but in addition to that, we have in the Great \nBasin National Park the only glacier in the State of Nevada.\n  In addition to that, you cannot see them here, but in this park we \nhave bristlecone pine trees, the oldest living things in the world, \nmore than 5,000 years old. We are going to celebrate a new millennium, \n2,000 years. Well, 3,000 years before Christ was born, these trees \nstarted growing. That is an old tree, oldest living thing in the world \nlocated in this national park.\n  In addition to that, we have the Lehman Caves. The Lehman Caves are \ninteresting because they were discovered unintentionally by a cowboy \nout doing whatever cowboys do. Suddenly he finds he and his horse have \ndropped into this subterranean cavern that became the Lehman Caves, \nwhich has been visited by hundreds of thousands of people over the \nyears.\n  I am very proud of our National Park System. I am proud of the Great \nBasin National Park. Senator Graham and I introduced legislation \nyesterday that will take $500 million a year from a fund that is \nalready created, not new taxes, and put it into the National Park \nSystem where we are $4 billion in arrears just maintaining our national \nparks, maintaining the trails, the bathrooms, the information centers, \nthe things that are so necessary to maintain this great program we have \ncalled our National Park System.\n  Certainly as part of Earth Day, we must recognize the fact that part \nof celebrating Earth Day has to be our National Park System. One last \nthing, because I see my colleagues on the floor, we are so honored in \nthe State of Nevada, Dale Antonich, who is the chief park ranger of the \nLake Mead recreation area, which is part of our National Park System, \nwas chosen as this year's recipient of the Harry Yount National Park \nRanger Award for excellence in rangering. This is important because he \nhas been chosen by his peers to be the top park ranger. This says a \nlot. We are very proud of Lake Mead. It receives about 12 million \nvisitors a year. He is the chief ranger there. I am sure that people \nwho come to the park, to Lake Mead, receive a good experience. I want \nto give this resident of Boulder City, NV, all the accolades that he \ndeserves as being selected as the top park ranger in our country.\n\n  As I indicated, we have set aside 30 minutes. That is all the time we \ncould get today to celebrate Earth Day. I did see in the Chamber my \nfriend from California. I wonder if I could get the attention of my two \ncolleagues. We have 30 minutes that we have set aside to talk about the \nparks. I am wondering if I could yield time to my friend from \nCalifornia. We are very proud of Nevada, but there is no State in the \nUnion that has more natural beauty than California. I think Nevada has \nas much natural beauty, but there is no State that has any more natural \nbeauty than the great State of California, which is the neighboring \nState of the State of Nevada.\n  I am very happy that the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is \nhere to talk about some of the beauties of the State of California. I \nam sure that is what she is going to do; is that not true?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will speak about global warming.\n  Mr. REID. Global warming is perfect. That deals with Earth Day, and \nthat is why we are here to talk. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it possible to have 10 to 15 minutes?\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I am sure we have 10 minutes. I yield the Senator from \nCalifornia 10 minutes to talk about global warming and the importance \nof Earth Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Colorado is on the floor. \nI really want to extend to him and to all of the people of Colorado my \ndeepest sympathy and sorrow for the events yesterday. After I finish a \nbrief global warming statement, I would like to make a more inclusive \nstatement about the events that took place in Colorado, but I want him \nto know that my heart and thoughts are with him and the people of \nColorado today.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate Earth Day tomorrow, I \nwanted to speak for a few minutes about what I consider to be the \nsingle greatest environmental threat facing our planet: the threat of \nglobal warming.\n  The phenomenon of global climate change really hit home for me in \nJanuary of 1997. That year, devastating floods killed seven people and \ncaused nearly $2 billion in damage in California. California is famous \nfor its weather extremes, but the 1997 floods were unusual in terms of \ntheir ferocity, the loss of life they caused, and the tremendous \nproperty damage that occurred.\n  Even more striking, the 1997 flood was only one of four 100-year \nfloods that occurred in California in the 1990s. Therefore, it \ncertainly got my attention when I read that the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Agency believes that major changes in the El Nino and La \nNina ocean currents, which brought so much rain to California, may be \nlinked to changes in the ocean's temperature.\n  Last fall, I received an in-depth briefing from Dr. John Holdren, the \nTeresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy and Director of \nthe Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at Harvard \nUniversity. Dr. Holdren presented clear and compelling evidence to me \nthat global warming is real. It is happening, and it will have \nsignificant impacts on human health, our environment, and our economy.\n  Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, however, literally \nevery week my office receives bulletins from groups that continue to \ndispute the reality of global warming. Today I would like to lay out \nthe evidence that global warming is indeed occurring.\n  There is overwhelming scientific consensus about the following facts: \nThe natural greenhouse effect (which is primarily a product of water \nvapor, carbon dioxide, and methane) makes the earth habitable, keeping \nthe average surface temperature about 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it \nwould otherwise be.\n  Large increases in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human \nactivities produce significant further global warming, accompanied by \nother changes in climatic patterns.\n  Today's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is about 30 percent \nhigher than pre-industrial levels. The methane concentration is over \n100 percent higher. These levels are higher than at any time in the \nlast 160,000 years.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an assembly of 2,000 \nof the world's leading experts on climate and related disciplines, has \nfound that human activities are increasing the greenhouse effect, and \ntherefore raising the temperature of the planet. It is important to \nnote that the IPCC includes scientists from all member states of the \nWorld Meteorological Association and the United Nations.\n  To quote the IPCC:\n\n       The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, and \n     among them, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have \n     grown significantly since pre-industrial times . . . These \n     trends can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly \n     fossil fuel use, land-use change and agriculture. \n     Concentrations of other anthropogenic greenhouse gases have \n     also increased. An increase of greenhouse gas concentrations \n     leads on average to an additional warming of the atmosphere \n     and the Earth's surface. Many greenhouse gases remain in the \n     atmosphere--and affect climate--for a long time.\n\n  The IPCC estimates that carbon dioxide concentrations in the \natmosphere have risen from 280 parts per million before the Industrial \nRevolution, to 360 parts per million today. By the end of the next \ncentury, the carbon dioxide level will be somewhere between 480 and 800 \nparts per million.\n  According to the IPCC, this change is ``unlikely to be entirely \nnatural in origin. The balance of evidence, from changes in global mean \nsurface air temperature and from changes in geographical, seasonal, and \nvertical patterns of atmospheric temperature, suggest a discernible \nhuman influence on global climate.''\n  Already, these increased greenhouse gas emissions are changing the \nearth's climate. Here are the facts:\n  The average temperature of the earth has risen 1.3 degrees in the \nlast 100 years.\n  Ten of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last 12 \nyears. 1998 was the hottest year on record.\n  The last 50 years appear to have been the warmest half century in \n6,000 years, according to evidence from ice core samples.\n  Scientific evidence convincingly shows increased rates of evaporation \nand rainfall, glacier retreat, sea ice shrinkage, and rising sea \nlevels.\n  The IPCC estimates that by 2100, the earth's temperature will have \nrisen by two to six degrees. This rate of warming, if it were to occur, \nwould be the fastest warming rate in the last 10,000 years.\n  Even if an overwhelming body of scientific evidence regarding global \nwarming did not exist, the weather map alone would tell us something is \nwrong. According to the National Climatic Data Center, weather extremes \nare becoming more and more frequent: hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, \nflooding, droughts. So far this century, extreme weather events have \nincreased by 20 percent. Annual precipitation is up 6 percent since \n1900, and total winter precipitation is up 8 percent.\n  Just look at the period from November 1997 through July 1998, when a \nseries of extreme weather events hit this nation. Northern California \nhad its wettest May ever in 1998, with precipitation in at least one \narea hitting 800 percent of normal. Meanwhile, Texas suffered under a \ndevastating drought, with San Antonio getting only 8 percent of its \nnormal rainfall in May. In Florida last summer, the U.S. Forest Service \nestimated that 80 percent of the State was at a drought level \nequivalent to a desert. Ohio, the Upper Midwest, and New England had no \nshortage of rain, however; floods in those areas claimed 13 lives.\n\n  While individually none of these events can be linked directly to \nglobal warming, collectively they show a troubling pattern consistent \nwith what the best science tells us global warming will look like.\n  Things could get worse. According to the IPCC, one third to one half \nof all mountain glacier mass could disappear in the next century. \nMelting glaciers, combined with melting of the antarctic ice shelves, \ncould raise sea level by as much as three feet in the next 100 years. \nThis could cause severe flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area, New \nOrleans, the Everglades, and the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The weather changes caused by global warming also could wreak havoc \nupon the environment and human health. The University of California \nestimates that global warming could render 20 to 50 percent of the \nState's natural areas unsuitable for the current species who live \nthere. Major vegetation changes are occurring over one-eighth of the \nplanet. The effects of global warming on human health, including \noutbreaks of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever, are so \nsignificant that I plan to discuss those separately in a floor \nstatement soon.\n  Global warming is not a problem that we can afford to ignore or \ndismiss. The scientific evidence is overwhelming and persuasive, and we \nneed to take steps now to reduce global warming. That is why I am \ncirculating a letter, along with Senators Gorton and Bryan, that \nencourages the President to work with Congress to implement improved \nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standards. Cars and light trucks, \nincluding sport utility vehicles, are responsible for 20 percent of all \ncarbon emissions in the United States, and emit more carbon than all \nsources in Great Britain combined.\n  By raising fuel efficiency standards, we can reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions by over 240 million tons per year. This\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nwill help curb global warming, improve air quality, save consumers at \nthe gas pump, and reduce our reliance on imported oil.\n  Stronger fuel efficiency standards alone will not solve the global \nwarming problem, but they are a very good place to start. I am pleased \nto say that a bi-partisan group of 22 Senators have already signed the \nletter to the President, and I am hopeful that more will sign soon.\n  I also urge all of my colleagues--especially those who may remain \nskeptical about the existence of global warming--to attend a briefing \nthat I am hosting on May 11 with scientists from the University of \nCalifornia, including Nobel Laureate Sherwood Rowland. These scientists \nwill discuss recent satellite measurements concerning global climate \nchange; disturbing new evidence that climate change may be occurring \nmore abruptly than scientists had earlier forecast; and possible \nsolutions to the problem.\n  Global warming is an extremely complicated issue, and I understand \nthat a number of policy alternatives are currently on the table--from \nthe Kyoto Protocol supported by President Clinton, to the ``Credit for \nEarly Action'' bill sponsored by Senator Chafee, to the bill currently \nbeing drafted by Senator Murkowski. I do not presume to stand here \ntoday with a master plan for how to stop global warming.\n  But I do feel strongly that global warming's existence cannot be \ndisputed. It is real. It could cause the greatest environmental crisis \nof our time. I hope that we can at least recognize the threat, and \nbegin working together to address it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S3977-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3977-S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

After that, I tell the Chair that the final approximately 10 \nminutes that is left for Senators Boxer and Reid would be given to the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, our mission this morning is to discuss the \nenvironment, and to celebrate the birth of Earth Day, which takes place \ntomorrow. I will use my time for that purpose.\n  But I want to take just a minute, because I, like everyone else in \nthis country, am heartbroken by what we saw take place yesterday. In my \nconversation with the Senator from Colorado, I expressed my sympathies. \nBut I want to point out something. Those children were killed by \nderanged young people of their own class. But they used guns, and they \nused weapons that are, frankly, I think out of control in our society. \nThis isn't just happening in Colorado. It is a terrible happening in \nColorado. But look at the other days. It happened in Utah. It has \nhappened in Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, Oregon, and Illinois. Just \nsearch your mind and you can find almost every State having had a \nproblem. It is a plague in our society. It is a blight across our \ncountry.\n  There is a bit of a paradox as we talk about Earth Day and the \npositive aspects of what Earth Day can mean so that children can bathe \nin the waters, fish in the streams, play on the Earth, and breathe the \nair--all positive things looking toward an improvement in their \nhealth--just under the shadow of the murderous rampage that took place \nyesterday.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lisa Haage, a detailee in \nmy office, be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of \nthe 106th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues to \ndiscuss the Democratic environmental agenda on the eve of Earth Day.\n  We have an ambitious agenda to protect open spaces, reduce sprawl and \nrelieve congestion.\n  While Congressional Democrats have an excellent agenda for the \nfuture, we also have a proud history of accomplishment since the first \nEarth Day in 1970. Our nation's major environmental laws were written \nand passed under Democratic leadership.\n  Democrats passed the first Clean Water Act. Democrats wrote the first \nSuperfund law. Democrats authored the Clean Air Act.\n  And the Clinton Administration has an impressive record of enforcing \nthese laws. The EPA has an outstanding record of cleaning up toxic \nwaste sites under the Superfund program.\n  For example, by the end of this Fiscal Year, September 30, 95 percent \nof all Superfund sites will have remedies selected and cleanups \nbeginning or underway.\n  Overall, the Clinton Administration has cleaned up more Superfund \nsites in the past two years than in the first 12 years of program.\n  Administrator Browner has also had success protecting our nation's \ndrinking water, reducing smog so that children breathe healthier air, \nand cleaning up our lakes and rivers for swimming and fishing.\n  Mr. President, today, I would specifically like to talk about my \nbrownfields bill and its promise to reduce sprawl and protect our \nenvironment.\n  My common sense brownfields bill, S. 20, will help accomplish all of \nthese goals.\n  My bill will help turn a contaminated, abandoned parcel of land into \na new school, an new business or a new playing field. And the benefits \nwill multiply from there. Cleaning up brownfields protects open spaces \nby keeping commercial development inside our cities, where it creates \njobs and can lower property taxes.\n  With more reuse and redevelopment in our cities, there will be less \npressure to develop farmland and parkland outside our cities.\n  How do we make this happen? By making grant money available for \nStates and cities to start the redevelopment of brownfields, and using \ntheir own zoning codes and no Federal regulations with that so that \nthey can make sure people who are interested in buying and developing \nthese sites aren't sued for the contamination that was never their \nfault.\n  Brownfields need not be a blight on our communities but an \nopportunity for smart growth.\n  Mr. President, fortunately, brown- \nfields is not a partisan issue. In fact, many Republican Senators have \nsupported the thrust of my legislation. This means, on this Earth Day, \nwe have a chance to do something that will protect our environment and \nopen spaces, and leave a better world for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  We should not miss the opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, we have pending before us the reauthorization of \nSuperfund. It is now 2 years since the Superfund bill expired, and we \nstill continue to operate. But we don't derive any of the revenues that \nwere supposed to be part of the bill. We can't get a Superfund bill \nthat is decent that doesn't protect the polluters, which is what \nSuperfund was all about. It says, let the responsible parties pay for \ntheir damage. It has worked pretty well.\n  I was at a site in New Jersey that was the No. 1 Superfund site in \nthe country. A company there agreed, finally, to pay $100 million \ntoward the restoration of this site. I was there on Saturday to \ncommemorate this new development. It was a spectacular day. I was there \nwith the Little League. They even let me throw out the first pitch. \nThat is the only first pitch I have thrown out. I haven't been invited \nby the Yankees, or otherwise. But to be able to throw out a pitch to \nthe Little League, to see a softball field next to that, a hardball, a \nregular baseball field next to that, a soccer field next to that, all \ndeveloped out of what was a horrible toxic waste site. The lake is \nclean. Before, there were signs for the children to avoid getting too \nnear the lake because there was poisonous material in there. No fish \ncould live--nothing.\n  When he celebrated the cleanup of that lake 2 years ago, the mayor of \nPitman, NJ, a fellow named Bruce Ware, stood next to me, and, he said, \n``I am going to fulfill a promise that I made years ago that if this \nlake ever got\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\ncleaned up I am going in it.'' With that, he turned, fully dressed, \nwith his tie and his jacket and his suit, and he jumped in the lake. He \nwas so ecstatic about the fact that this community was going to be rid \nof this blighted parcel of land--about 100 acres, a big piece of land.\n  It is fantastic. I believe it will result in not only more revenues \nfor the community but also a lifting of the spirit in that community.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. We ought not tinker with \nSuperfund, to reduce it, to emasculate it such that it has no power and \nno strength.\n  I hope we are going to be able to do that in the next few days. I \nhope the American people will insist that as we attempt to clean up our \nland and avoid the sprawl that we are living with that we will pay \nattention to what we have as a society in terms of an obligation to \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to have the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S3978-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRAGEDY IN LITTLETON, COLORADO\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \ntragedy in Colorado. I want to express my sincere sympathies for the \nfamilies and victims of yesterday's events.\n  Once again, we have witnessed a deadly school shooting in America's \nheartland. Yesterday's events, although greater in magnitude than other \nshootings in recent years, have, it seems, become part of a growing \ntrend in this country, and particularly among young people, and that is \nto solve everyday problems with deadly violence.\n  Now, some of us have heard firsthand the gruesome effects of gun \nviolence. But we can't imagine what the classmates and families of \nthose Colorado children must be going through today. The senseless \nloss, the graphic memories, the fear of violence, the lack of \nexplanation.\n  Who among us can imagine how we would feel if two dozen of our \nfriends and classmates were gunned down in a matter of minutes? Who \namong us knows what we would say to our own children if something like \nthis happened at their school? And who among us wants to imagine what \nit would be like to receive that phone call telling us that our child \nis no more.\n  Mr. President, this is a time for grieving, but it is also a time for \nsincere reflection on the direction of this country and the nature of \nchild on child violence. Sadly, this nation has experienced an ever \nincreasing number of these incidents in the last two years. We saw it \nhappen in Pearl, Mississippi where two students were killed. We saw it \nhappen in West Paducah, Kentucky where three students were killed. We \nsaw it in Jonesboro, Arkansas where five were killed and in \nSpringfield, Oregon where two were killed.\n  We saw a five-year-old Memphis, Tennessee kindergartner last year \nbring a gun to school because the teacher had given him ``timeout'' the \nday before. Now Littleton, Colorado joins that tragic list.\n  We are still learning the specifics of this latest tragedy. But while \nthis most recent incident may have been executed with more deadly \nresults, it is all too familiar. We must struggle to learn why these \nincidents are happening with ever increasing frequency. Are children \nmore troubled than they have been in the past? Do parents need to pay \nmore attention to danger signals within their own homes? Do parents \neven have the ability to recognize danger signs? And do they know what \nto do when they see the signs of trouble?\n  I am certain that we will all continue to ask these questions in the \ncoming days and weeks. I hope we don't stop asking until we find some \nanswers.\n  One area in which I have been working for many years is the problem \nof gun access. I realize that bringing up gun control at this time \nmight be viewed by some as trying to capitalize on yesterday's tragedy. \nI am sure the NRA will criticize those of us who connect this violence \nwith the easy access of guns in America. But sadly, times of tragedy \nlike this are often the only times people pay attention to the problems \nplaguing our society. If we do not speak up now, we may not prevent \nfuture Littletons from occurring.\n  Children have easy access to guns of every sort and every caliber--\nincluding assault weapons and high capacity clips that make it all too \nsimple to strike fellow students down in mere seconds. Whereas in the \npast a grievance might be settled in a brief fist-fight, today our \nchildren often turn to firearms.\n  Yesterday, two masked gunmen killed as many as 25 people with \nsemiautomatic gunfire and explosive devices. Other students hid under \ndesks and in rooms throughout the school, watching the gruesome scene \ndevelop on televisions within the classrooms, and in some cases calling \nthe media to report crying, gunfire, and the sound of running feet from \nwithin the school walls. One student reported to police that he saw two \nof his classmates carrying shotguns, automatic weapons, and pipe bombs.\n  We may never be able to stop children from feeling alone and wanting \nto strike out. But we can certainly stop them from gaining the use of \nhigh capacity weapons with which to strike. And we should.\n  In 1994, we passed a ban on assault weapons and high capacity \nammunition clips, with the intent to get these guns off the streets, \nout of the hands of criminals, and away from our kids. But because of \nstrong NRA opposition, we were forced to allow pre-existing guns and \nclips to remain on the shelves of stores across this country. And \nalthough the President has stopped the importation of most assault \nweapons to this country, millions of high capacity ammunition magazines \ncontinue to flow onto our shores and into the hands of criminals and, \nindeed, our children.\n  In fact, between March and August of last year alone, BATF approved \nmore than 8 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. \nThe clips approved during this one short period accounted for almost \n128 million rounds of ammunition--and every round represents the \npotential for taking one human life.\n  Mr. President, 75, 90, and even 250-round clips have no sporting \npurpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--\nthe purposeful killing of other men, women and children.\n  I have introduced legislation, supported by the President, that will \nstop the flow of these clips into this country. I know that we cannot \neliminate these clips from existence. But we must--we must--do our best \nto make it harder and harder for children to find these clips and to \nuse these guns.\n  It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to \nsell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often \nused for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from \nselling. It is time to plug this loophole and close our borders to \nthese tools of death and destruction. Our domestic manufacturers are \ncomplying with the law, and we must now force foreign manufacturers to \ncomply as well.\n  In closing our borders to these high capacity clips, we will not put \nan end to all incidents of gun violence. But we will limit the \ndestructive power of that violence. We will not stop every troubled \nchild who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we \ncan limit the tools that a child can find to carry out that act.\n  Each of us has been touched in some way by the devastating effects of \ngun violence. Each of our states has faced unnecessary tragedy and \nsenseless destruction as a result of the high-powered, high-capacity \nweapons falling into the hands of gangs, drive-by shooters, cop \nkillers, grievance killers, and yes, even children. My own state of \nCalifornia has too often been the subject of national attention due to \nincidents of gun violence.\n  We must work to console the victims of this crime and the families of \nthose who have been injured. My thoughts and prayers go out to those \nwho have been affected by yesterday's events. We must now rededicate \nour efforts to prevent future tragedies from developing. I for one want \nto stop the easy access juveniles have to weapons of war, reduce this \nviolence we see every night on TV, and help strengthen and nurture a \nnew family ethic that says ``enough'' to this kind of violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S3978-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3978-S3979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRAGEDY IN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friends, the Senator from\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nNevada, Mr. Reid, and the Senator from California for the condolences \nand well wishes they have offered.\n  Yesterday, the parents in Jefferson County, CO, said goodbye to their \nchildren on their way to school as they have done on countless \nmornings, and as I have done, and as you have also done as a parent \nover the years. But for some, that goodbye must now be their final \nfarewell. As a parent and grandparent and the husband of a person who \ntaught school for over 10 years, I can't imagine the agony those \nfamilies are feeling this morning. Today, my whole State is paralyzed \nwith grief, as you might know.\n  Hundreds of families in Colorado endured a life-or-death lottery--\nknowing students at Columbine High School were dead, but not knowing if \ntheir youngsters were among those killed. It is tragic that on Earth \nDay the remains of those students will be returned to the Earth while \ntheir souls go to heaven.\n  The community of Littleton is a very nice town. I visit there often. \nMr. President, Columbine High School is a fine school, with a fine \nstaff, a good curriculum and nice youngsters. It has no history of \nracial violence or gang trouble or anything of that nature. It was not \na school you would ever expect something like this to happen in. \nCertainly, there is a story in that and a tragedy. For those families, \nthere will be no more hurried breakfasts, no more arguments over \ncurfews when they send the youngsters to school, no more report cards, \nno more money for trips to the malls, and no more plans for after they \nleave high school.\n  What really frightens me is that, despite our best intentions to \nprevent this from happening, these horrors find a way to continue. In \nfact, Colorado has had a law on the books since 1994 that prevents any \nweapons from going into a public school. But they still do. With a gun, \na bomb, a knife, a club, or whatever, young people are using violence \nas a way to resolve disagreements.\n  I don't know how we got there. Perhaps nobody does. I can remember \nthe days when young people decided it was OK to have disagreements in \nthe streets and they might have fist fights after school, or drag \nraces, things of that nature. Those means were not right or acceptable, \nbut those days are long gone. Now, too often they tend to kill their \nway to solutions. The disputes in those days were between two \nindividuals, and they ended up shaking hands. Somebody lost and \nsomebody won. In those days, we all lived through it. Now, all too \noften some of the parties to a conflict lose their lives. I don't know \nwhen we traded pugilism for pipe bombs. Frankly, I don't think they \nhave found all the bombs at Littleton High School. They are still \nsearching.\n  In fact, one went off at 2 o'clock this morning.\n  I don't know when these youngsters got accustomed to killing each \nother. But I know we often blame television, we blame movies, we blame \nvideo games, and we blame a number of other things.\n  But those children in Jefferson County and their families ache every \nday. I just wanted to tell the people of Colorado that my colleagues, \nSenator Wyden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Reid, Senator Lautenberg, and \na number of others have all offered their sympathies, and want people \nin Colorado to know that our hearts in the United States Senate are \nwith all of the families through this terrible and tragic time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I prepared these remarks yesterday in \nanticipation that we would be debating the budget reform bill today. It \nis my understanding that subsequent to yesterday's offering of an \namendment, which was referred to as the lockbox amendment, in lieu of \nthe budget reform bill, that now the budget reform bill has been \nwithdrawn.\n  But anticipating that that is a relatively temporary step, because we \ncannot avoid having to deal with the issues of budget reform if we are \nserious about our goal of preserving the momentum that is currently \nunderway towards a surplus in the Federal Government fiscal accounts, I \noffer some comments today which I hope will be useful as we prepare for \nthat return to the budget reform discussion.\n  I am very pleased that we are focusing on this issue, because it is \nan indication of our commitment to retain the fiscal discipline that \nhas gotten us to the point where we have the opportunity to talk about \na Federal budget surplus and how it should be appropriately used.\n  I want to discuss two interrelated issues. One I will call the issue \nof the ``vault'': How will we protect the surplus that we have once it \nhas been attained? But the even more significant predicate issue is, \nHow do we achieve the surplus?\n  I am concerned by some of the actions that were taken in 1998 which \nindicate a lack of resolve to protect the surplus. It is no good to \nhave the securest vault in the bank possible if we fritter away the \nmoney we would like to place in that vault. If we do not address the \nunderlying issues of fiscal discipline, responsibility, the Social \nSecurity trust fund will be endangered no matter how strong our lockbox \nis to protect it.\n  This Congress is in a unique position to reaffirm the stated \ncommitment to fiscal discipline and to cure the previous willingness of \nCongresses to undermine that discipline through budget trickery.\n  As recently as 1993, the Federal budget deficit was at a record high \nof $290 billion. Last year, we learned that 5 years of effort, fiscal \nausterity, and a strong economy had transformed that staggering deficit \ninto the first budget surplus in more than a generation. While we \ncelebrated that success--it was a cause for celebration--it did not \ngive Congress carte blanche authority to return to its spendthrift ways \nof the past. Especially daunting was the reality that 100 percent of \nthe surplus was the result of surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfund.\n\n  We have a responsibility to our current generation, as well as to \ntheir children and grandchildren, to save that extra money until Social \nSecurity's long-term solvency is assured. Unfortunately, the 105th \nCongress stumbled in its commitment to that goal. Though it resisted a \nproposal to spend surplus funds on a catch-all omnibus list of tax \ncuts, and it similarly rejected suggestions that the surplus could be \nused for increased spending, it did not exercise similar good judgment \nduring the end-of-the-year rush to adjourn. The same Congress that \nclaimed to be saving the surplus for Social Security participated in \nraids on that same surplus through the back door.\n  In the waning hours of last year's budget negotiations, we passed a \n$532 billion omnibus appropriations bill. Inserted in that $532 billion \nspending bill was $21.4 billion of so-called emergency spending. As we \nknow, the fact that that $21.4 billion was designated as an\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nemergency meant that it did not have to be offset by spending \nreductions elsewhere in the budget or by additional revenue. Rather, it \nwas funded by reducing the surplus, that 100-percent Social Security-\nderived surplus.\n  Let me illustrate with these charts what has been happening.\n  In 1998, the stated Social Security surplus, that is the amount of \nrevenue into the Social Security trust fund in excess of the checks \nthat were written to the beneficiaries of Social Security, was $99 \nbillion. But before that $99 billion could be realized, there was a \npredicate called for in it, and that was for $27 billion in order to \noffset the deficit that the Federal Government was running in its non-\nSocial Security accounts. And then we added to that $27 billion an \nadditional $3 billion in the fiscal year 1998 expenditures through that \nemergency appropriation that did not have to be offset by reductions in \nspending or additional revenue but came directly out of the surplus \nfund. So instead of having a surplus of $99 billion, we ended up with a \nsurplus of $69 billion.\n\n  What is the projection for fiscal year 1999? This year, the Social \nSecurity surplus has grown to $127 billion, but, again, the first call \nis going to be to offset the deficit which will be projected for the \nnon-Social Security portion of the budget, which is $3 billion, the \nnext $13 billion, which is this year's component of last year's \nemergency spending bill, and in addition to that, we are now discussing \nthe possibility of additional funding for the Kosovo emergency of $6 \nbillion. That is the most modest number which has been suggested thus \nfar. Others are suggesting that number might be doubled or tripled in \nterms of its cost.\n  Instead of a Social Security surplus of $127 billion, we are now at \n$105 billion in Social Security surplus, with that number itself being \nsubject to further dilution if there are additional emergency outlays \nallocated.\n  For fiscal year 2000, we are looking at a Social Security surplus of \n$138 billion, minus $5 billion to pay for deficits other than Social \nSecurity in the Federal budget, $5 billion, which is the final \ninstallment on that 1998 emergency appropriation bill, and, again, the \npossibility of additional emergency spending for Kosovo or other \npurposes.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we exercise constraint in terms of \nhow we use the emergency spending power available to Congress, or we \nwill substantially dilute the funds that are going to be locked up in \nthis lockbox vault protected for Social Security beneficiaries. I think \nthere are several steps we need to take.\n  The first is that Congress needs to commit itself to reexamining that \n$21.4 billion we spent last year and determine what portions of that \n$21.4 billion did not meet the standards for an emergency \nappropriation. With that commitment, we should restore those funds to \nthe Social Security surplus during this year's budget consideration. I \nam pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment to our budget \nresolution which committed us to that objective. That should be a \ncommitment in which we should be joined by the House and the President.\n  Over the long haul, it is critical that we institute some additional \nspending procedures which will allow us to respond to true emergencies \nwithout, as we did in 1998, opening the door to misuse.\n  Senator Snowe of Maine, Senator Voinovich of Ohio, and I have \nintroduced legislation to permanently close these loopholes in our \ncurrent budget procedure. These procedures would basically provide for \na 60-vote supermajority of the Senate to be required in the event there \nwas a challenge that items which were listed as emergencies in an \nemergency spending bill were not true emergencies and did not meet the \nstatutory definition; also, a 60-vote supermajority for the passage of \nany bill which contained emergency spending so we could not have a \nrepetition of what happened last year in that emergency spending was \ninserted into a large omnibus spending bill and, therefore, not \neffectively subject to removal.\n  Those are some of the procedural steps that should be taken in order \nto assure we do not have a continued repetition of a dilution of the \nSocial Security surplus before it has a chance to get into the lockbox.\n  Now let me make a few points about the lockbox itself, the vault into \nwhich we intend to place these surpluses that, hopefully, we have \nprotected with greater vigilance than we did in the fall of 1998.\n\n  I strongly support developing measures which will create a \nfinancially solvent Social Security system for current and future \nbeneficiaries. This is not only a fiscal goal, but it is a moral \nresponsibility, a moral responsibility to carry out the contract that \nexists between the American people and the American Government for \ntheir financial security in retirement. I am pleased the Senate is \ndebating this issue, since the trustees of the Social Security system \nare predicting that in the year 2034 the current Social Security system \nwill not be solvent. It is critical that we take steps now to protect \nlong-term solvency.\n  However, the proposed lockbox, which was a part of the budget reform \nlegislation, in my opinion, is not sufficient to accomplish this \nobjective.\n  What are its deficiencies?\n  First, it allows the Social Security surplus, in addition to paying \ndown the national debt, to be used for unspecified ``Social Security \nreform.''\n  Now, Social Security reform can mean different things, but not all of \nthose things are related to achieving solvency in the Social Security \nsystem. Would Social Security reform include increasing the benefits \nwhich would make the program potentially even more subject to \ninsolvency at an earlier date? Would it mean reducing revenue into the \nsystem, including such proposals as returning to a pay-as-you-go system \nor diverting a portion of the current revenue out of the Social \nSecurity system into some individual retirement accounts? All of those \nideas may or may not have merit, but they should not be accomplished at \nthe expense of our commitment to solvency in the current Social \nSecurity system.\n  I propose to offer an amendment at such time as it is appropriate \nthat would have the Social Security surplus used solely to pay off \nnational debt, specifically that component of the debt which is held by \nthe public. Only this action will ensure the Social Security surplus is \nused for its intended purpose of meeting our obligations to the \nAmerican people and, in so doing, contribute to a stronger American \neconomy, which is the fundamental basis upon which the Federal \nGovernment will be able to meet its future obligations to Social \nSecurity beneficiaries.\n  There will be a cascading series of positive effects on the economy \nif we commit the Social Security surplus to paying down the national \ndebt. Paying down the debt will lower long-term interest rates. These \nlower rates will make it less expensive for Americans to borrow money, \nand this lower cost of borrowing will encourage business ventures to \nexpand, to increase their productivity, to increase their hiring.\n  It will encourage increased investment in long-term fundamental areas \nsuch as education. The new economic activity and increased labor \nproductivity will lead to increased economic growth. This growth will \nlead to the strengthened capacity of the National Government to meet \nits Social Security obligations.\n  These points were best expressed by the chairman of the Federal \nReserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, when he said,\n\n       . . . in light of these inexorable demographic trends, I \n     have always emphasized that we should be aiming budgetary \n     surpluses and using the proceeds to retire outstanding \n     Federal debt. This would put further downward pressure on \n     long-term interest rates, which would enhance private capital \n     investment, labor productivity, and economic growth.\n  If I were allowed, I would also have offered a second amendment that \nwould not tie the Government's ability to borrow debt from the public \nto a 10-year budget projection. In the legislation that was before us, \nthere was a proposal to use future estimates of our national debt as \nthe benchmark for determining whether we had protected the Social \nSecurity surplus. I think there is merit in that approach, but I \nbelieve this legislation had carried that merit beyond its reasonable \nlimits.\n  I would provide, through the amendment I had intended to offer, for a \nmore reasonable and credible debt ceiling target. It also would have \nprovided enhanced flexibility to accommodate\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nunanticipated events, both domestic and foreign. I would suggest that \nit is an impossible task for any person to estimate the budget and to \nestimate the national debt on a 10-year basis. I would offer as my \nbasis for that statement a look-back just 5 years, not 10 years, which \nthis legislation proposed.\n  In January of 1993, the Congressional Budget Office estimated what \nthe national debt would be 5 years hence, in the fiscal year 1998, \nwhich ended September 30, 1998. Their projection was that the national \ndebt on that date would be $4.863 trillion. At the same time, in \nJanuary of 1993, the administration made an estimate of what they \nthought the national debt would be 5 years hence. Their projection was \n$4.576 trillion. The actual number was $3.720 trillion. So the CBO was \noff by over a trillion dollars. The administration was off by $856 \nbillion. That was a 5-year projection.\n  What we are proposing in this legislation is to use 10-year \nprojections and to give those the sanctity of almost biblical \ncorrectness, because they would become the basis upon which our future \nbudgets would be predicated.\n  Mr. President, seeing my time is about to expire, I offer these \namendments as an indication of the direction which I think we should be \nproceeding in as we strive together to achieve a very important goal, \nwhich is to protect the Social Security surplus for its intended \npurpose of meeting the obligations that we have for this and future \ngenerations of Americans. I believe the amendments I will offer will \nhelp both assure that the money is protected before it goes into the \nvault, and that the vault itself is a reasonable and secure place in \nwhich we can place those funds.\n  Protecting Social Security for our children and grandchildren is one \nof the highest goals of the Federal Government. We can make the lockbox \nstronger, and we can and should control emergency spending so there \nwill be money to put in the lockbox for future generations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to make comments about the very \nunfortunate situation that occurred in Denver, CO, yesterday at \nColumbine High School. I know that our entire Nation mourns and grieves \nfor the students and the teachers who lost their lives in the very \ntragic occurrence that happened just yesterday.\n  I, and I know all of my colleagues, hope for a day when the young \npeople, our Nation's children, will never again have to fear for their \nsafety anywhere in this country--but especially in their own schools \nthat they attend each day. I certainly want to join with others who \nhave extended their sympathies and condolences to the families and \nfriends of those children who lost their lives. We hope for the very \nbest for their families as they deal with this very tragic situation. I \nexpress my desire that they know our prayers are with them and their \nfamilies.\n  As I, along with millions of Americans, watched on television \nyesterday the carrying out of something that used to be only in \ntheatrical performances and in the movies--the tragic situation--I was \ndrawn to the men and women of the Denver Police, Colorado law \nenforcement officials, members of the SWAT team, and the emergency \nmedical personnel who were all working so diligently to spare people \nfrom suffering grave damages that were being inflicted on the victims \nin that community. They were doing everything they could to minimize \nthe loss of life and human suffering and misery that was being brought \nabout by the tragic actions of two apparently very disturbed and \nderanged young students who carried out these dastardly deeds.\n  I was also reminded of all of the people in my home State of \nLouisiana who, at the same time, have been working every day, night, \nweek, and month to try to do something about the abnormal crime rate \nthat has affected my own State of Louisiana. I report to my colleagues \nand to the people of our State that there is, indeed, some good news. \nThe good news is contained in a report I saw just yesterday while this \ntragic event was going on in Colorado. The good news was that violent \ncrime in the city of New Orleans, for example, has fallen 21 percent \njust since the month of January. This is the 11th consecutive quarter \nin which total crime--and particularly violent crime--was down.\n  This is not something that just happened. It happened because of the \njoint efforts of Mayor Marc Morial and the city council, along with the \npolice force and, in particular, the superintendent of police in New \nOrleans, Superintendent Richard Pennington, and all the men and women \nof the New Orleans police force who have been working very diligently \nin a joint and cooperative effort to try to reach the success that now \nis becoming more and more apparent.\n  Since Chief Pennington took over the New Orleans Police Department, \nviolent crime has dropped 55 percent. Overall, crime has fallen 33 \npercent. Murders are down 30 percent. Armed robberies, which numbered \n1,200 every quarter, are now down to the 390s. Assaults are down 15 \npercent compared to the first quarter of 1998.\n  The New Orleans story is truly a real success story in confronting \nviolent crime and doing something about it and doing something that has \nbeen enormously successful. Chief Pennington has said this success is a \nresult of ``saturating the streets with more officers and putting them \nin key places'' and improving the investigations of repeat offenders.\n  I remember, for many months, we talked about President Clinton's \nproposal that the Congress adopted regarding community policing. This \nis a real example of the fact that community policing does in fact get \nthe job done when you have people who believe in it. This \nadministration can be justifiably proud of their proposal, and the \nStates that implemented it and benefited from it can justifiably be \npleased with the results. Chief Pennington has not only worked with \nMayor Marc Morial and the city council to hire more people, he has been \nable to use the COPS program to hire 200 additional officers. New \nOrleans has received $8.6 million through this Federal program, dollars \nthat have paid the salaries of extra and new police officers--\nobviously, money that has been well spent. Also, Chief Pennington has \ninstalled Comstat, which uses block-by-block data to track crime and \nfind so-called hot spots in the community.\n  Using this data, the chief and his enforcement officials can move his \noffices from quiet areas to those areas that need more attention and \nneed more police presence.\n  Obviously, the bottom line is these strategies and community policing \nprograms are working. We now see actual indications and statistics \nwhich say that New Orleans is today a much safer place than it used to \nbe, so that the thousands and thousands of people who regularly visit \nour cities for the numerable festivals, activities and celebrations \nwhich are part of our Louisiana culture, and particularly part of the \nNew Orleans culture, can come to our city knowing it is a much safer \nplace than it used to be.\n  I am particularly reminded of the next two weekends. We celebrate the \njazz festival in New Orleans, and literally thousands of people from \nall over this country and literally from all over this world will be \nvisiting our city. The good news is that they now know that when they \nvisit these cities it is much safer than it has been in the past \nbecause of the actions of so many people who are dedicated, just as the \npeople in Denver, to making their communities a safer place.\n  While we remember the tragedies in one city today in our Nation, we \ncan also take great pride in knowing that activities by dedicated \npeople are making a difference and that things in most communities are \ngetting better. New Orleans is one example of that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we approach the 50th anniversary Summit\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nof NATO this weekend, I rise today to share with my colleagues my \nconcerns about a key document that will be considered at this summit. \nIt is entitled ``Strategic Concept for NATO.''\n  Mr. President, I have been privileged to be in the Senate 21 years. \nThroughout those years of time, there has often been a need to speak on \nbehalf of NATO in this Senate. I say humbly and most respectfully that \nI have been at the forefront of Senate support for NATO. I can remember \nthe early years of my time in the Senate. There was Member after Member \nthat assaulted the need for the United States to remain in NATO. \n``Let's cut back. Let's save the money. Let's bring our men and women \nhome. We have done our job.'' I was among that group that had the long-\nrange vision for NATO. It must remain. It must be strong, and U.S. \nleadership in NATO is absolutely essential.\n  So the remarks that I contribute today, here on the floor, are the \nresult of a series of consultations I have had with the administration, \nand I hope will be taken in a constructive light and not as an \nexpression in any way of criticism of this great organization, NATO.\n  With that in mind, I wrote to the President of the United States on \nApril 7 to urge him to initiate, among the other 18 nations and the \nheads of state and government of NATO, the thought that at this 50th \nsummit we should not try and write the final draft of the ``Strategic \nConcept.'' I repeat, ``the final draft.'' Certainly at this important \ngathering, a draft should be considered. Maybe several drafts should be \nconsidered, but we should not etch in stone the final draft of the \n``Strategic Concept.'' That document spells out the future strategy and \nmission of the alliance. It states the parameters by which the alliance \ndecides whether it should or should not send forward military units to \nengage in operations, possibly combat operations.\n  Why do I take this position? Because the old ``Strategic Concept,'' \nenacted in 1991, was largely oriented towards the Soviet Union and the \nthreats from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. So obviously it is \ntime to change it. But it can remain in effect for an additional, brief \nperiod of perhaps 6 months so that we can evaluate the lessons learned \nfrom the Kosovo operation.\n  Periodically in the 50-year history of NATO, NATO has changed its \nmission statement, or ``Strategic Concept.'' But that can remain in \neffect for 8, 9 sometimes 10 years.\n  So this document to be revised at this summit could well control NATO \noperations for the next decade.\n  I do not see the urgency to put it, as I say, in stone at this time. \nThe urgency is to consider it, to put out a draft, and let the nations \nof NATO and their respective legislators and the Congress of the United \nStates consider those drafts and consider them--this is the key reason \nthat I rise--``consider'' them in the light of the lessons learned in \nKosovo.\n  This 50th anniversary Summit is taking place against the background \nof perhaps the most serious conflict we have seen on the European \ncontinent--indeed, the most serious, in my judgment, since the \nconclusion of World War II. It is the first actual combat of a great \nmagnitude in which NATO has been involved.\n  We are operating on what is known as the ``consensus'' of the 19 \nnations--any one of which has a veto power--directing the military \noperations, which are under the command of General Clark, the Supreme \nAllied Commander.\n  I am not here to in any way criticize these operations. But I will \nsimply say, Mr. President, that there will be many, many lessons \nlearned at such time as this operation--and the sooner the better--is \nconcluded with NATO having succeeded in reaching the objectives that \nhave been made very clear by the NATO alliance and addressed many times \nby our President, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Chancellor \nof Germany, and others.\n  Mr. President, the alliance must have time to evaluate the lessons \nlearned from the Kosovo operations before, again I say, setting in \nstone for possibly the next decade documents which will guide future \nNATO military operations.\n  While everyone recognizes the ``Strategic Concept'' of 1991 must be \nupdated, it has not impeded the current Kosovo operation. Indeed, this \noperation is going forward with that ``Strategic Concept'' still in \nplace. So it could stay in place another 6 months.\n  That is the only period of time I am asking for--an additional 6 \nmonths before the ``Strategic Concept'' is finalized. A short delay has \nadvantages, if for no other reason than to show respect for the \nCongress of the United States and the people of this country will have \ntheir own evaluation of how well the Kosovo operation went, what was \ndone right and what could have been improved.\n  The Secretary of Defense, when he was before the Armed Services \nCommittee last week, said in response to questioning, ``We are guided \nby the consensus of the alliance.'' We need all 19 voices to say yes. \nAnd then he made a very important addition, ``Had we been there alone \nor with a coalition similar to what we had in 1991 in the Persian Gulf \nwe might have done it another way.''\n  This is a lesson learned. We should not be allowed to deny to the \nCongress and to other legislatures the opportunity to study lessons \nlearned and to make our contribution as a member nation to the future \n``Strategic Concept for NATO.''\n  As I speak today, the draft of the ``Strategic Concept'' continues to \nbe reworked, during this very hour, by the staffs of the 19 nations \nbefore it will be submitted to the NATO heads of state this weekend at \nthe summit. There are press reports today that key elements of the \n``Strategic Concept'' might not be completed by the summit--due to be \ncontinued--because of disagreement among the allies. The key element \nthere is the relationship between NATO and the United Nations--a very, \nvery important relationship. At no time should the United Nations have \na veto over a decision by the NATO powers to use force. That is this \nSenator's view.\n  My main concern is, to what extent does the draft ``Strategic \nConcept'' reflect the views expressed in a May 15, 1998, speech in \nBerlin that President Clinton made? I am addressing the draft being \nreworked against a background of a statement by the President of the \nUnited States a year ago. President Clinton stated:\n\n       Yesterday's NATO guarded our borders against direct \n     military invasion. Tomorrow's Alliance must continue to \n     defend enlarged borders and defend against the threats to our \n     security from beyond them [meaning borders]--the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction, ethnic violence, regional \n     conflict.\n\n  That thought expresses a desire to broaden and go beyond the 1991 \nconcept. Is that being worked in this final draft? I know not; \ncollectively, we in this Chamber do not know.\n  Other administration officials, most notably the Secretary of State, \nMs. Albright, have been outspoken in the belief that the revised \n``Strategic Concept'' should place increased emphasis on NATO's future \nrole in non-Article 5--she said ``out of area''--threats to our \n``common interests,'' threats such as Kosovo. The definition of these \ncommon interests and the various military missions NATO is prepared to \nundertake in defense of these interests will establish the foundation \nfor NATO military operations, possibly for the next decade.\n  Against the backdrop of the uncertainties in Kosovo, NATO should \npause, in this Senator's judgment--I repeat, take a breath, a long deep \nbreath and pause--before rendering judgment on these important issues. \nLet us review, over the next 6 months, the lessons learned as a \nconsequence of the Kosovo operation.\n  Unfortunately, the NATO summit will take place against the background \nof continuing, unfolding events relating to Kosovo which we cannot \npredict at this moment. The United States and our allies may have many \nlessons to be learned from Kosovo to assess as we look to NATO's future \nfor the next decade and its military missions. That assessment must be \na pivotal part of any new strategic concept. NATO is simply too \nimportant to the United States, to our allies in Europe, and indeed to \nthose nations who seek admission to NATO. NATO is essential for the \nfuture of the European continent and our relationships with that \ncontinent.\n  We are just beginning to learn important lessons now in the Kosovo \nsituation. For example, it is obvious to all that the U.S. military is \nthe primary source of attack aircraft. We are flying 60 percent of the \nmissions of the high-\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nperformance aircraft. Most of the ordnance being used is high-tech, \nprecision-guided ordnance, an arsenal of which the United States \npossesses in far greater numbers than the other nations of NATO. They \nsimply do not have in their military inventories this equipment.\n\n  I add to that, the airlift; that is, the cargo planes that must put \nin place the necessary resupply, the necessary equipment; for example, \nthe helicopters, the Apaches which are moving in at this very moment, \nto be positioned in Albania for future use in the Kosovo operation. The \nother nations simply do not have that airlift. They do not have the \ntanker aircraft. Airplanes going into Kosovo now take off from Italy or \nother places. They move in, they have to get refueled in most instances \nbefore the strikes, they are refueled coming out of the strikes, and \nindeed refueled over the area so they can remain over the target area. \nIt is the U.S. tanker aircraft that are carrying on the greater \nproportion of that essential part of this mission. The other nations of \nNATO do not have in their inventories that equipment.\n  Until other nations do acquire or at least have in place firm \ncontractual commitments to acquire such equipment, the United States \nwill likely be the only source of that equipment for any future \noperation other than Kosovo. It is our taxpayers, it is our men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, who support and maintain this equipment. As \nwe write the future concept for operations in NATO, we have to \nrecognize that much of the equipment for modern warfare is possessed by \nthe United States. Are we ready to sign that in stone now, recognizing \nparticularly that the new nations do not have that equipment? A lesson \nto be learned, a lesson to be thought through very carefully.\n  The American people will soon be asked to support an emergency \nsupplemental budget request to pay for the costs of the Kosovo \noperation. Are Americans ready to sign up to a new strategic concept \nthat could well commit the U.S. military to other such operations \nrequiring the same type of weaponry?\n  There are other lessons to be learned. It is now becoming apparent \nthat our military planners are being subjected to many levels of \nreview--this is a consensus military operation by 19 nations--for it is \na fact that NATO can only operate by consensus; 19 nations must agree \nbefore a military action can be taken. A single nation can stop the \nplanners--indeed, even stop the operation.\n  The result can be a military planning operation of the ``lowest \ncommon denominator.'' Are we now making military decisions not on the \nbasis of the professional military judgment or on the basis of what \nwill be most effectively done to achieve our objectives on the \nbattlefield but, rather, on what agreement we can get among the 19 \nnations to carry out the recommendations of the professional military? \nThese are issues which are to be examined as lessons learned in the \nfuture of Kosovo.\n  On April 7 I wrote the President a letter expressing the various \nconcerns that I have related here on the floor. The President responded \nto my letter, on April 14, indicating his position that, ``the right \ncourse is to proceed with a revised `Strategic Concept' '' at this \nconference, and sign it into stone.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nexchange of letters; my letter sent to the President and his response.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Administration, in consultation \n     with our NATO allies, is now finalizing various documents to \n     be submitted to the Heads of State for ratification at the \n     upcoming 50th anniversary NATO Summit to be held in \n     Washington later this month. A key decision, in my view the \n     most important one, is the revision of the Strategic Concept \n     for the future--perhaps a decade--that will guide NATO in its \n     decision making process regarding the deployment of military \n     forces.\n       I am recommending, Mr. President, that a draft form of this \n     document be reviewed by the principals, but not finalized, at \n     this 50th anniversary Summit. Given the events in Kosovo, a \n     new Strategic Concept for NATO--the document that spells out \n     the future strategy and mission of the Alliance--should not \n     be written ``in stone'' at this time. Instead, NATO leaders \n     should issue a draft Strategic Concept at the Summit, which \n     would be subject to further comment and study for a period of \n     approximately six months. Thereafter, a final document should \n     be adopted.\n       NATO is by far the most successful military alliance in \n     contemporary history. It was the deciding factor in avoiding \n     widespread conflict in Europe throughout the Cold War. \n     Subsequent to that tense period of history, NATO was, again, \n     the deciding factor in bringing about an end to hostilities \n     in Bosnia, and thereafter providing the security essential to \n     allow Bosnia to achieve the modest gains we have seen in the \n     reconstruction of the economic, political and security base \n     of that nation.\n       Now NATO is engaged in combating the widespread evils of \n     Milosevic and his Serbian followers in Kosovo.\n       I visited Kosovo and Macedonia last September and witnessed \n     Milosevic's repression of the Kosovar Albanians. Thereafter, \n     I spoke in the Senate on the essential need for a stabilizing \n     military force in Kosovo to allow the various international \n     humanitarian organizations to assist the people of Kosovo--\n     many then refugees in their own land, forced into the hills \n     and mountains by brutal Serb attacks. Since then, I have \n     consistently been supportive of NATO military action against \n     Milosevic.\n       Unfortunately, it is now likely that the NATO Summit will \n     take place against the background of continuing, unfolding \n     events relating to Kosovo. At this time, no predictions can \n     be made as to a resolution.\n       We are just beginning to learn important lessons from the \n     Kosovo conflict. Each day is a new chapter. For example, NATO \n     planners and many in the Administration, and in Congress, \n     have long been aware of the disparities in military \n     capabilities and equipment between the United States and our \n     allies. Now, the military operation against Yugoslavia has \n     made the American people equally aware and concerned about \n     these disparities. The U.S. has been providing the greatest \n     proportion of attack aircraft capable of delivering \n     precision-guided munitions. Further, the United States is \n     providing the preponderance of airlift to deliver both \n     military assets (such as the critically needed Apache \n     helicopters and support equipment) and humanitarian relief \n     supplies, the delivery of which are now in competition with \n     each other.\n       Until other NATO nations acquire, or at least have in place \n     firm commitments to acquire, comparable military \n     capabilities, the United States will continually be called on \n     to carry the greatest share of the military responsibilities \n     for such ``out of area'' operations in the future. This issue \n     must be addressed, and the Congress consulted and the \n     American people informed.\n       It is my understanding that the draft Strategic Concept \n     currently under consideration by NATO specifically addresses \n     NATO strategy for non-Article 5, ``out of area'' threats to \n     our common interests--threats such as Bosnia and Kosovo. \n     According to Secretary Albright in a December 8, 1998 \n     statement to the North Atlantic Council, ``The new Strategic \n     Concept must find the right balance between affirming the \n     centrality of Article V collective defense missions and \n     ensuring that the fundamental tasks of the Alliance are \n     intimately related to the broader defense of our common \n     interests.'' Is this the type of broad commitment to be \n     accepted in final form, just weeks away at the 50th \n     anniversary Summit?\n       During the Senate's debate on the Resolution of \n     Ratification regarding NATO expansion, the Senate addressed \n     this issue by adopting a very important amendment put forth \n     by Senator Kyl. But this was before the events in Kosovo. The \n     lessons of Kosovo could even change this position.\n       The intent of this letter is to give you my personal view \n     that a ``final'' decision by NATO on the Strategic concept \n     should not be taken--risked--against the uncertainties \n     emanating from the Kosovo situation.\n       The U.S. and our allies will have many ``lessons learned'' \n     to assess as a pivotal part of the future Strategic Concept. \n     Bosnia and Kosovo have been NATO's first forays into \n     aggressive military operations. As of this writing, the \n     Kosovo situation is having a destabilizing effect of the few \n     gains made to date in Bosnia. This combined situation must be \n     carefully assessed and evaluated before the U.S. and our \n     allies sign on a new Strategic Concept for the next decade of \n     NATO.\n       A brief period for study and reflection by ourselves as \n     well as our Allies would be prudent. NATO is too vital for \n     the future of Europe and American leadership.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your thoughtful letter on \n     the upcoming NATO summit and the revised Strategic Concept. I \n     appreciate your attention to these important issues, and I \n     agree strongly with your view that NATO's continued vitality \n     is essential to safeguarding American and European security.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n       I have thought carefully about your proposal to delay \n     agreement on the revised Strategic Concept in light of NATO's \n     military operations in Kosovo. While I share your deep \n     concern about the situation in Kosovo and the devastating \n     effects of Serb atrocities, I am convinced that the right \n     course is to proceed with a revised Strategic Concept that \n     will make NATO even more effective in addressing regional and \n     ethnic conflict of this very sort. Our operations in Kosovo \n     have demonstrated the crucial importance of NATO being \n     prepared for the full spectrum of military operations--a \n     preparedness the revised Strategic Concept will help ensure.\n       The Strategic Concept will reaffirm NATO's core mission of \n     collective defense, while also making the adaptations needed \n     to deal with threats such as the regional conflicts we have \n     seen in Bosnia and Kosovo as well as the evolving risks posed \n     by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It will \n     also help ensure greater interoperability among allied forces \n     and an increased European contribution to our shared \n     security. The Strategic Concept will not contain new \n     commitments or obligations for the United States but rather \n     will underscore NATO's enduring purposes outlined in the 1949 \n     North Atlantic Treaty. It will also recognize the need for \n     adapted capabilities in the face of changed circumstances. \n     This approach is fully consistent with the Kyl Amendment, \n     which called for a strong reaffirmation of collective defense \n     as well as a recognition of new security challenges.\n       The upcoming summit offers a historic opportunity to \n     strengthen the NATO Alliance and ensure that it remains as \n     effective in the future as it has been over the past fifty \n     years. While the situation in Kosovo has presented difficult \n     challenges, I am confident that NATO resolve in the face of \n     this tyranny will bring a successful conclusion.\n       Your support for the NATO Alliance and for our policy in \n     Kosovo has been indispensable. I look forward to working \n     closely with you in the coming days to ensure that the summit \n     is an overwhelming success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate today because I have \ndone my very best as one Senator to bring this to the attention of our \nPresident, and hopefully, through this floor speech, to the attention \nof the other heads of state and government who will come to Washington. \nAgain, I continue to urge my plea not to put this ``Strategic Concept'' \nin final form in this forthcoming Summit. I encourage my colleagues who \nmay share my views on this critical issue to likewise speak out before \nit is too late, in an effort to prevent a rush to judgment on NATO's \nfuture. NATO is simply too important to our national security to do any \nless.\n  On a related issue, I am distressed to hear statements by my \ncolleagues, and some in the administration, which tie NATO's future to \na successful--I repeat successful--outcome in Kosovo. I personally \nsupport the objectives that have been stated time and time again by the \nNATO ministers, and indeed our President, our Secretaries of State and \nDefense. We all know we have to create a situation so the refugees can \nbe returned. We know we have to have in place a military force, the \ncomposition of which I think should be flexible. It does not have to be \nall United States--absolutely not. Maybe other nations not in NATO will \njoin. We need flexibility there to allow these people to return in a \nsecure environment and to have a measure of self-government, of \nautonomy. They deserve no less. Those are the basics.\n  But to say unless everything we lay down today has succeeded, we have \nsuccess and we have victory, and if we do not achieve it, it is the end \nof NATO--I urge my colleagues not to make such a statement. NATO must \ngo on. NATO must go on and survive the Kosovo operation. It is the \nresponsibility of those of us here in the Senate, of the President of \nthe United States, and the other heads of state and government to make \ncertain that is achieved, because we know not at this moment what the \noutcome will be in Kosovo. Yes, we have to achieve the basic goals, but \nin my humble judgment, diplomacy will reenter at some point. So I \nsuggest we pledge ourselves to the future of NATO and be more cautious \nin our statements.\n  Kosovo-like operations are not NATO's reason for being. They are \n``out-of-area'' operations that NATO does if it can. We should not be \nmaking pronouncements on NATO's future based on the outcome of these \n``out-of-area'' operations.\n  This alliance has withstood the test of time for 50 years. It has \nexceeded the expectations of those minds that gathered 50 years ago to \nconceive it. It is the most significant military alliance in the \nhistory of mankind, and it has to continue to be for the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their patience in allowing \nme to deliver these remarks, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I believe under the special order, the \nconference report on the Ed-Flex bill should be brought forward at this \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S3984-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3984-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 800) to provide for education flexibility \npartnerships and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The Legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     800), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 20, 1999.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, we are considering the conference \nreport to the only outstanding education issue remaining from the last \nCongress--the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. Today, we will \ncomplete last year's unfinished business.\n  Over a year ago, the President told the Nation's Governors that \npassage of this legislation ``would dramatically reduce the regulatory \nburden of the federal government on the states in the area of \neducation.''\n  The National Governors' Association has strongly urged the Congress \nto pass Ed-Flex this year and today we will act on their request.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act, H.R. 800, will give States \nthe ability, if they so choose, to make limited resources go further \ntoward the goal of improving school and student performance. It offers \na deal no one can refuse--results rather than red tape.\n  Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State authority to \ngrant waivers within a State, affording each State the ability to make \ndecisions about whether school districts may be granted waivers \npertaining to certain Federal requirements.\n  It is very important to note that States cannot waive any Federal \nregulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and safety, \ncivil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, \nequitable participation of students and professional staff in private \nschools, parental participation and involvement, and distribution of \nfunds to state or local education agencies.\n  Currently 12 States have Ed-Flex authority which was created through \na Federal demonstration program, originally created in 1994.\n  My home State of Vermont is one of the twelve using Ed-Flex \nauthority. Vermont has used Ed-Flex to improve and maximize Title I \nservices for those students participating in Title I programs in \nsmaller rural school districts. In addition, my home state has also \nused their Ed-Flex authority to provide greater access to professional \ndevelopment, which is essential to educational reform and improvement.\n  Two weeks ago, the Independent Review Panel, which was created under \nthe 1994 Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the purpose of \nreviewing federally funded elementary and secondary education programs, \nissued its report.\n  One of the sections of the report focuses on waivers including the \nuse of waiver authority by the current 12 Ed-Flex States. The report \nstates:\n\n       Waivers also encourage innovation; they allow educators to \n     focus first on identifying the most promising strategies for \n     improving academic achievement and then on requesting waivers \n     to remove obstacles to their efforts.\n  I believe H.R. 800 is structured to ensure that the primary function \nof\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nissuing waivers is to positively impact overall school and student \nperformance.\n  The bill before us today, H.R. 800, under the sponsorship of Senator \nBill Frist and Senator Ron Wyden, has significantly improved the \naccountability aspects of the 1994 Ed-Flex demonstration program. This \nlegislation emphasizes that flexibility is a tool in helping States and \ndistricts achieve education goals and standards. It also highlights the \nimportance of States having, in place, first-rate accountability \nsystems that will track the progress of schools and students impacted \nby the waivers granted under Ed-Flex.\n  I believe passage of this legislation also gives us an excellent \nintroduction to the debate we must have on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the law which contains most of the federal programs \ndesigned to assist students and teachers in our elementary and \nsecondary schools. This law must be renewed in this Congress.\n  Through the Ed-Flex debate, we have discussed the importance of \naccountability, the roles that the various levels of Government play in \nthe elementary and secondary education system, professional development \nactivities for teachers and other school personnel, and most \nimportantly, student achievement. All of these issues are essential \nelements to the structure of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization effort.\n  As we embark on a new century, it is the perfect opportunity for us \nto examine the federal role in our education delivery system. At the \nbeginning of this current century, the biggest education challenge \nfacing this country centered around increasing the number of \nindividuals graduating from high school. In the early 1900s, fewer than \nseven percent of seventeen year-olds graduated from high school. In \n1999, that percentage has risen to slightly over eighty percent.\n  Although continuing our efforts on increasing high school graduation \nrates is still important, our biggest challenge at the close of the \n20th century is to ensure that our Nation's schools are all high \nquality academic institutions. The bill before us today gives states \nand towns greater flexibility in meeting that challenge.\n  This legislation is not meant to serve as the sole solution for \nimproving school and student performance.\n  However, it does serve as a mechanism that will give states the \nability to maximize various education initiatives through flexibility \nwith real accountability. I urge my colleagues to support the passage \nof the conference report to H.R. 800, the Education Flexibility \nPartnership Act.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Bill Frist for \nhis leadership in this area. He has worked tirelessly over the last \nyear on this legislation with Senator Wyden. I thank both of them for \ntheir dedication and efforts.\n  I would also like to thank the ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Kennedy. He has been especially helpful in adding many of the \naccountability provisions contained in the conference bill before us. I \nthank him for his cooperation and leadership.\n  I also thank all of the Senate conferees for their assistance and \ncooperation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of the chairman of the \nHouse Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Bill Goodling and \nthe House sponsors of this legislation, Representatives Mike Castle and \nTim Roemer. They have worked very hard on this legislation.\n  I would also like to thank Wayne Riddle with the Congressional \nResearch Service and Mark Sigurski with the Senate Legislative Counsel \nOffice. They have been very helpful with their technical advice and \nassistance.\n  I also extend my appreciation to Gail Taylor and Bob McNamara with \nthe Vermont Department of Education. They have been extraordinarily \nhelpful with their technical assistance.\n  Mr. President, we are now considering the Ed-Flex conference report \nwhich passed the House 368-57 about an hour and a half ago, so we are \non our way, at this moment, to getting the bill down to the President, \nso that he can sign it. And, the President has agreed to sign this \nbill.\n  This is the last unfinished business that we had on a number of \neducation bills that we passed last year. This one passed the education \ncommittee, but did not go any further.\n  The major changes that were made in conference dealt with the \nquestion of how much flexibility we should give the States in the \nutilization of funds for the purpose of the 100,000 teacher provisions \nthat were attached to the bill.\n  When the bill left here, the Senate gave the towns the flexibility to \nuse the teacher hiring funds for IDEA if they felt it would be better \nutilized. That was objected to by the President, who felt it was more \nimportant to have the funds elsewhere other than to help with special \neducation.\n  We did reach an agreement, however, which was satisfactory, obviously \nfrom the vote in the House. This agreement is that those States which \nare already at the 1-teacher-to-18-students ratio would not have to \nutilize the funds to hire teachers. Rather, those States that have \nalready reached the goal of 1 teacher per 18 students would be able to \nuse the funds for professional development.\n  We have, I think, a good compromise, though I am sure the Senate, as \nindicated by its previous vote, would prefer to help special education. \nAnother very high priority is the question of improving teacher \nperformance.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Frist such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the sponsor of this critical education \nbill that we have before us, I would like to thank Senator Jeffords, \nwho is Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, for his hard work on this bill that began well over a year \nago. He really undertook the initiative and expressed his willingness \nto take this bill, a bill that will benefit millions of children in \npublic schools all across this country, through his committee, not once \nbut actually two different times, and then to shepherd it through the \nprocess of floor consideration and, most recently, the debate and \ndiscussion in the conference committee.\n  Last Congress, the chairman had a truly remarkable record of passing \nnumerous education bills through Congress and having them signed into \nlaw. Most people in America are not aware of the significant number of \nbills, all of which get translated down to investing in the future by \ninvesting in our youth today.\n  Ed-Flex was the only one of all of those bills that we did not \ncomplete last year. It was unfinished last year and fell over into this \nyear. I am glad the chairman took the initiative of saying this is the \nfinal building block from the last Congress and shepherded it through \nthe legislative process to where we are today. Today we will have \nseveral hours of debate and ultimately a vote that I am confident will \nresult in adoption of this conference report. It will ultimately be \nsigned by the President of the United States, again to be translated \ninto an investment in our children.\n  I think we all hope that the passage of Ed-Flex bodes well for \nanother 2 years of positive education accomplishments in the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  Mr. President, I started working on this bill to expand Ed-Flex with \nSenator Ron Wyden, who will address this body in a few minutes, along \nwith Governors Voinovich and Carper at the National Governors' \nAssociation a little over a year ago. That occurred just following \ncompletion of a task force which was set into motion by the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee who felt very strongly that an important \nrole for us in the Senate Budget Committee is to provide oversight of \nexisting programs.\n  Senator Domenici basically said: What I would like to do in the \nBudget Committee is look at some of the programs that we have out there \nin education. That task force resulted in us looking at a number of \nprograms, one of which was a demonstration project called Ed-Flex.\n  Shortly after that oversight process, we began to ask more and more \nquestions. We went to the Governors, and the Governors came to us. It \nbecame very clear that Governors--Democrat, Republican and \nIndependent--felt very strongly that one of the most important things \nthat we could do, if our\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\ngoal in this body is really to improve our public schools, is go back \nand look at some of the problems. And one of the obvious problems the \nGovernors pointed out was the excessive regulations--not the intended \ngoals but the excessive regulations. The Governors addressed this, at \nthe level of the National Governors' Association, and they came out \nwith numerous statements. This is one of their statements from February \n23 of this year in which they said:\n\n       Congress should grant all states this important tool that \n     will accelerate the pace of school reform and move the nation \n     closer to meeting its goal of raising student achievement. \n     Congress should pass Ed-Flex now.\n\n  I am delighted that now is the time, that we will all have the \nopportunity to cast that final vote in this body, so that not just 12 \nStates but all States in this country can have the opportunity to have \nincreased flexibility, maintaining strong accountability with Ed-Flex.\n  In the task force in the Budget Committee, as many of my colleagues \nknow, what we learned is not necessarily good news as we look at \neducation. We spend billions of dollars every year on a system that, \nunfortunately, if we look at the final product--and that is an educated \nstudent--is failing our students miserably. Achievement levels are \nstaggering at almost every age group in almost every subject matter. \nAnd if we compare our students to students in other countries, it \nappears that the longer a child is in an American school, the worse off \nhe or she is when compared to their international counterparts. That is \nin the United States of America today.\n  At the same time, we see, as we look at this global comparison, that \nthe world is getting smaller, barriers are falling down. Our students \ntoday are and will be competing internationally. New technologies and \nan increasingly global marketplace are fueling a growing need for well-\neducated workers who are able to compete with their peers worldwide. \nUnfortunately, we are equipping too few American students with the \nability to compete in those jobs.\n  Ed-Flex is not a panacea; it is a first step. What this particular \npiece of legislation will do is take a demonstration project that is \ncurrently underway in the 12 States--which appear in yellow on this \nchart--and expand that opportunity of flexibility with accountability \nto all 50 States. We have a really clear-cut demonstration in States \nlike Texas, where Ed-Flex programs have been implemented, that they \nhave been successful in increasing student achievement. It is not a \npanacea though; again, in my mind, it is a first step. But it does \nshout certain things. It shouts that we can do better. It shouts the \nimportance of elimination of unnecessary regulations. It shouts \nflexibility coupled with accountability. It shouts efficiency. And it \nshouts state and local control of education.\n  As we look forward, I suspect that we will devote a large portion of \nour legislative session to considering other education issues, many of \nwhich were discussed on the floor in our debate of Ed-Flex. These \neducation reform measures will be addressed in the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But Ed-Flex, the bill \ntoday, is, I believe, the first step in that process.\n  The success stories we have heard again and again come from \ninnovation at the state and local level. I am sure all my colleagues in \nthis body could share an example of one sort or another from their \nparticular State of an innovative school, an innovative principal, \ninnovative teachers.\n  One such in my own State of Tennessee is the Cason Lane Academy in \nMurfreesboro. Another example we have all heard about again and again \nin this body is the Chicago Public School System which went from being \nthe--I quote--``worst school system in America,'' as deemed by then-\nSecretary of Education Bill Bennett, to a model for reform and \ninnovation.\n  Part of the reason that both Cason Lane back in Murfreesboro, TN, and \nChicago have been successful is that they have been free from some of \nthe heavyhanded or shackling Government recommendations at both the \nState and the Federal level. Once they are freed from these \nregulations, clearly having a well-defined plan, having strong \naccountability built in, they have been able to creatively address some \nof the problems they face and give their students that opportunity to \nachieve a better education.\n  What our Ed-Flex bill does is give that same opportunity to States \nwhich do not have that opportunity today. It will give it to those \nstates, and local schools and those local school districts so they will \nhave the opportunity to meet the stated goals of Federal legislation, \nbut how they meet those goals will be determined and based on local \nneed. And that is what our Ed-Flex bill does.\n  We have heard a lot from Texas about the success there. Test scores \nhave been on the rise for all students, even for those categorized as \n``educationally disadvantaged'' who receive title I services. Paperwork \ndemands on teachers and principals were dramatically reduced. The \nbureaucratic demands on their administrators were greatly reduced. \nTexas even claims that a whole new environment has been created that \nis--and I quote--``free of any real or perceived barriers to education \nreform.'' All States will be able to have that flexibility and that \naccountability.\n  I am pleased that Congress came together in a truly bipartisan way \nfor what really should be and is a nonpartisan effort to enact this \neducation reform. I was disappointed, however, that the Administration \nwas very threatened by the provision which offered states greater \nflexibility in using appropriated dollars to either reduce class size \nor for individuals with disabilities in our school systems. That \nparticular amendment is not part of the legislation we are debating \ntoday.\n  That Lott amendment would have given States yet another option how \nthey would use that money. That was important, I believe, in the debate \nthat came forward because Ed-Flex is about that fundamental principle \nof untying the hands of those people who are closest to our students, \nthose people who are in the best position to identify what needs there \nmight be--whether it is construction or class size or more computers or \nhooking up to the Internet.\n  The Lott amendment was very much in this same vein. I am disappointed \nthat the President came forward and threatened to veto this particular \nvision to give States more choice. The Administration's veto threat, \nwhich we dealt with last week in the Conference Committee, I believe \nunderlies the President's rhetoric about increased flexibility--which \nhe made in this building during the State of the Union Message--but \nthat in truth is more limited than what we see in reality. \nNevertheless, I am delighted with the outcome of this particular bill \nto cut redtape, to increase flexibility in education.\n  I have enjoyed working with a number of Governors. Later in the \nafternoon I hope to be able to recognize some of them by name, a number \nof Members in the House of Representatives, and a number of Senators. I \nam pleased that the 106th Congress has started out on such a positive \nnote in addressing one of America's most pressing issues, and that is \nthe education of our children. I am proud to have been a coauthor of \nthis bill and look forward to seeing millions of schoolchildren benefit \nfrom an expanded Ed-Flex program.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I know he is \nwaiting to speak as well. I thank him for the chance to follow my \ncolleague, Senator Frist.\n  For too long the major political parties in this country have been at \nwar on the education issue. Today, with this bipartisan legislation, we \nare beginning to make the peace and to do it in a way that is good for \nAmerica's children.\n  I especially thank my colleague, Senator Frist. He and I have worked \ntogether on this legislation for many months. The heart of this \nlegislation is that now we will be able to take the dollars away from \nvarious bureaucratic Federal requirements and pour those dollars into \nour classrooms to help our kids.\n  This legislation involves eight Federal programs and more than $12 \nbillion. What we have found in the course\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nof our hearings is that again and again across this country we are \nwasting a substantial portion of that money on various duplicative \nFederal rules that essentially put our local school districts through \nwhat one called to me ``bureaucratic water torture,'' when what they \nwant to do is put those dollars into our classrooms.\n  I happen to think both political parties have made an important \ncontribution in this discussion about education. A number of my \ncolleagues have said, before we spend additional money, we are going to \nhave to spend billions and billions of dollars that the Federal \nGovernment allocates today in a more effective way.\n  The Ed-Flex legislation does that. That is why Senator Frist and I \nhave made it a priority, and that is why we have told our colleagues in \nthe Senate we want that to be the first education bill to come to the \nfloor of the Senate: Before you go to the American people and ask for \nadditional funds, demonstrate clearly you are spending the dollars that \nare allocated today effectively. That is what this legislation does.\n  I also think a number of our colleagues, led by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, are absolutely right in saying \nthat additional money is going to be needed for education. It is going \nto be needed to ensure we have the technology we need for youngsters. \nIt is going to be needed to reduce class size in America, and I think \nthat is an important part of this debate as well. When this legislation \nis signed into law by the President of the United States, we are going \nto go on to consider that legislation. I submit to our colleagues, we \nare in a lot better shape going to the American people to ask for \nadditional funds when we have proven with legislation like Ed-Flex that \nwe can squeeze more value out of the existing dollars that are being \nallocated.\n  Make no mistake about it, existing funds are going to be liberated \nwith Ed-Flex and are going to help us achieve some objectives that \nMembers of this body feel very strongly about.\n  For example, Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle very \nmuch want to reduce class size in America. Existing dollars using the \nEd-Flex program can do that. In fact, in a school a short distance from \nhere, in Howard County, MD, the Phelps Luck Elementary School used the \nEd-Flex program to reduce the average student/teacher ratio in math and \nreading from 25 to 1 to 12 to 1.\n  Some of us believe we are going to need additional dollars to reduce \nclass size in America, but make no mistake about it; under the \nlegislation that Senator Frist and I have brought to the Senate today, \nwe can use existing dollars to reduce class size in America. I think \nthat is something of value to our colleagues.\n  I will pass on one example from my home State of Oregon from The \nDalles High School that I think sums it all up. We found at one of our \nhigh schools in rural Oregon that low-income students were unable to \ntake advanced computer courses at a local community college because the \nhigh school lacked the necessary equipment and instructors. Yet there \nwas a community college very close by, and we were not able to use the \ndollars that had to be spent at the high school at that nearby \ncommunity college without going through all kinds of redtape and \nbureaucracy. With Ed-Flex, we were able to use those dollars earmarked \nfor the high school at the local community college without any \nadditional cost to the taxpayers. The students were able to go to the \ncommunity college. They got the training they needed. Ed-Flex, again, \nshowed that with just a modest change in Federal regulation, we could \ndo a better job of educating young people in America.\n  We have had this program, as my colleague from Tennessee has noted, \nin 12 States. We have debated this on the floor of the Senate for some \ntime. And through that debate, there has not been offered one example, \nnot one in any community or any State, of low-income students being \nexploited in any way. I cannot recall another Federal program where it \nhas not been possible to show some problem somewhere, but in the course \nof this debate, which has gotten a bit contentious, as we know, over \nthe last few months, not one example has been produced with respect to \nhow this program in 12 States has been abused.\n  The fact is, it has worked. It has worked everywhere. The scores are \nup in the State of Texas where they are using it. Class size is down in \nHoward County where they are using it. Students are getting access to \nadvanced technologies in my home State of Oregon. It has worked \nvirtually everywhere, but it is going to work even better when we pass \nthis legislation.\n  I will close this part of the debate by saying I am especially \npleased, and I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his help on this, \nwith the changes in this legislation to ensure that the role of Ed-Flex \nwill be expanded in a variety of areas involving interactive computer \ntechnology in our schools. When this Ed-Flex legislation becomes law in \nmy State, which was the very first in the country to pioneer this, it \nis going to start a new program using Ed-Flex authority so that every \nsecond grader in the State of Oregon will be able to use interactive \ncomputer technology to learn and improve their reading skills.\n  I am especially pleased that we have been able to add this technology \nwaiver program. This is a good day for the Senate.\n  My colleague, Senator Frist, thanked so many people when we were on \nthe floor before, but I especially thank Ms. Lindsay Rosenberg of my \nstaff who is with us here today.\n  Bipartisan legislation such as this does not happen by osmosis. It \nhappens because a lot of our staff have spent a lot of weekends and \nevenings working on this legislation. Today the first bipartisan \neducation bill is coming to the floor of the Senate. It offers a fresh, \ncreative approach to Federal/State relations, one with enormous \npotential for improving education for all our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, I want to thank my cosponsor, \nSenator Wyden, as we have taken this bill forward, for all of his \ntremendous assistance on the task force last year, as well as today.\n  Also, because I mentioned the National Governors' Association, I want \nto very briefly point out how important was their participation in this \nlegislation. Again, it was bipartisan from the outset. I think much of \nwhat we do in the future will be with the Governors, as we work \ntogether, recognizing the local control of education being so vital and \nimportant. Governor Carper, chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation; Governor Ridge, chairman of the Republican Governors \nAssociation; Governor O'Bannon, chairman of the Democrat Governors \nAssociation; former Governor and now Senator Voinovich, who has been so \ninstrumental in this legislation; and Governor Leavitt, vice chair of \nthe NGA, as well.\n  At this juncture, I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from the great \nState of Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the passage of the Ed-Flex \nPartnership Act, which I believe will liberate schools and teachers \nfrom the costly burden of Federal mandates and regulations. It is very \nimportant that we free our teachers to teach and that we free the \nresources of the educational system to meet the needs of students, \nrather than to satisfy directives of the bureaucracy.\n  I believe this bill will give America's teachers more freedom to \nteach. It will release them from countless hours spent filling out \nforms from Washington, DC. The State of Missouri's 525 school districts \nwill have more time to educate their children and a greater ability to \ndecide how best to use the precious resource of taxpayer dollars, and \nhow to use those to devote them to the best interests of students and \nstudent achievement, and not for a sort of edification of the \nbureaucracy in Washington.\n  So I want to thank Senator Wyden, Senator Frist, and Senator \nJeffords: Senator Jeffords as chairman of the relevant committee, and \nSenators Frist and Wyden, who are the lead cosponsors of this important \nlegislation. They have done wonderful work here.\n  This is work designed to find its way all the way to the student in \nthe school system. So much of what is done in the name of education \nnever finds its way\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nto the student. So often it edifies the bureaucracy, or builds it, or \nstrengthens it. So often it applies to some hierarchical part of the \nState educational system. But Ed-Flex is designed to carry the benefit \nall the way to the student. There is one thing that we care about more \nthan anything else, and that is the student in the school system. \nSometimes we lose sight of that. I commend Senators Frist, Wyden, and \nJeffords for their having kept the student in focus in this particular \nmeasure.\n  I am also pleased to support this conference report because it \ncontains an amendment that I proposed, which makes an important change \nto a discipline provision within the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. Now, this provision, which the Senate approved by a vote \nof 78-21, gives school authorities the opportunity and the right to \ndiscipline any student who possesses a weapon on school premises. This \nprovision allows a school to place a student--even a student with a \ndisability--in an interim alternative educational setting if the \nstudent carries or possesses a gun on school premises. This action \ncloses a loophole in the IDEA law that only permitted a school to take \ndisciplinary action if the child carried the weapon to school, but not \nif he or she possessed the weapon at school.\n  My intent in offering this provision over a month ago was to empower \nschools to maintain a safe and secure learning environment for \nstudents, teachers, and for other school personnel.\n  America is saddened today, and we all grieve at yesterday's tragic \nsituation in the Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. That situation \nunderscores the need for us to continue to find ways to help teachers, \nparents, and school officials maintain safer schools. We need to be \ncreating a learning environment that is free of undue disruption or \nviolence. We should give local school officials the authority to \nenforce zero tolerance of weapons brought to school. That is a step in \nwhich this bill goes when it includes the ability to discipline \nstudents who bring guns to school or possess guns at school.\n  I know all of us here offer our condolences, heartfelt sympathies, to \nall of the families, the loved ones, the teachers, and to the \ncommunities that surround or are involved in the tragedy in Colorado.\n  We don't know all the facts of this incident. We don't know the \ncomplete background on the students who are allegedly involved in this \nsituation. But this incident should prompt in us a desire to examine \nour current Federal laws and to make whatever necessary changes there \nare, if there can be changes made to prevent tragedies like this from \noccurring.\n  Since I became a Member of the Senate in 1995, I have had concerns \nabout school safety. I have already worked to make improvements in \nFederal law to create a safer learning environment for students and \nteachers. My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of \nthe 15-year-old in St. Louis named Christine Smetzer. She was killed in \nthe restroom of a high school in St. Louis County.\n  Now, the male special education student convicted of murdering \nChristine had a juvenile record and had been caught in women's \nrestrooms at a previous school. However, the teachers and the \nadministrators at McCluer High School where he was transferred say they \nwere not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their \nschool. So here you have a student who should have been identified, \ncould have been identified as a student who had a special potential for \nthe kind of violence and danger that transpired. The student was \ntransferred, but the information that would have alerted school \nofficials to make the school a safer environment, to help that student \navoid the commission of the crime, and certainly to prevent the kind of \ntragic outcome, the killing of another student, our Federal laws were \npart of the problem that kept that from happening.\n  So in response to that, I secured a provision in the law requiring \nthat student disciplinary records transfer to a new school when the \nstudent transfers to a new school. That was just a small step taken in \nresponse to that 1995 problem with student discipline requirements that \nthe Federal Government imposes.\n  Now, the discipline provision in the bill that we are discussing here \ntoday was something that I, frankly, came to understand as a result of \ndiscussing concerns with Missouri schools. A suburban Missouri school \ndistrict told me it found a disabled student to be in possession of a \nweapon at school, but the school could not be sure that the student had \nactually carried the weapon to the school premises. This school told me \nit needed this loophole closed to ensure that it could act swiftly and \nwith confidence to an obviously dangerous situation.\n  You can imagine the inability to discipline somebody because they \nsaid, ``I didn't carry the gun on to the premises, I just got it after \nI was here,'' or ``I found it in my locker or on the floor,'' or ``You \ncan't prove that I brought it into the school. Therefore, you can't \ndiscipline me for having a gun at school.''\n  What a terrible situation that is. So when I sought to offer this \namendment--which was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate and remains in \nthe conference committee report--it was in response to this need to \nmake sure that the Federal Government doesn't have rules that make it \nimpossible for local schools to be able to maintain a secure and safe \nschool environment.\n  Interestingly enough, 2 weeks ago, I was traveling in the State of \nMissouri, talking with teachers and parents and principals and \nadministrators to get their input about education. Time after time, \nthey talked to me about safety and about discipline. Very often, they \neven mentioned weapons at school. They mentioned that the Federal law \nwas handcuffing their ability to take appropriate steps to keep their \nschools safe.\n\n  In a specific school--I was told by the administrator of that school, \nthis is not a hypothetical, but I choose not to name the school because \nthe school would prefer not to be identified--I was told of a situation \nin a rural Missouri school where a disabled student had made numerous \nthreats against both students and staff, had threatened on at least \nseven occasions to kill other students or staff. The school was aware \nof the threats, but was hindered by the Federal law from taking steps \nthat they thought were most appropriate to deal with the student.\n  Later, this high school student finally shot another student. The \nshooting happened off school grounds and the school was able to remove \nthe student from the classroom once the shooting had taken place.\n  But I wonder if we might think carefully as to whether or not the \nFederal requirements which tie the hands of State officials and school \nofficials regarding school discipline, whether those Federal knots, \nFederal handcuffs--ought to be taken off our school principals, our \nteachers, our administrators, our school boards so that they have the \nability at an early time when there is an early warning to take steps \nto avoid the tragedy that can otherwise exist. In this situation they \nweren't able to actually get done what they needed to do until another \nstudent had been shot. I don't believe that resulted in a fatality. But \nthe difference between someone wounded and someone killed is frequently \nnot something we can take a great deal of consolation in because that \nbullet could have been deadly.\n  Another school superintendent reported to me that Federal law \nrequired him to return a disabled student to the classroom after the \nstudent threatened to shoot school employees.\n  We have seen the tragic gruesome events in States close to Missouri, \nin schools in Jonesboro, AR, in Paducah, KY, and now in Littleton, CO. \nI don't want to see this happen in my home State of Missouri. I don't \nwant to see these kinds of things happen anywhere.\n  Again, I emphasize: We do not--I repeat ``do not''--know all of the \nfacts of the Littleton incident. We do not know if they were special \neducation students subject to the Federal IDEA laws or not. But we do \nknow that this situation should prompt us to examine all of our Federal \nlaws involving school safety.\n  We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we have Federal rules \nand regulations which keep our school officials across America from \nbeing able to control schools, control students, and discipline \nstudents appropriately.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we don't allow \nteachers and administrators to keep students who have guns from coming \nonto the campus and being on the campus.\n  The provision that is in this measure, which I have had the privilege \nof sponsoring, ends one of these laws and helps protect our kids from \ngun violence in schools.\n  The tragic events at schools across the nation in the last year or so \nsay something very, very troubling about our culture.\n  In Springfield, MO, which is my hometown--I grew up there, went \nthrough school grades 1 through 12 in Springfield--just hours after the \nshootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, the school board voted \nto approve arming its school district security guards with weapons. I \nam saddened that the board had to take this action. But it reflects the \nharsh reality of our culture today.\n  I think all of us wonder why these incidents of violence happen. \nChildren against children--what does it say about our culture?\n  Have we developed a culture of violence which degrades the value of \nlife?\n  We wonder about the movies, movies and video games and music, the so-\ncalled gangster rap--I am not even sure how to label it--which talk \nabout this kind of killing and suicide, and the disrespect for fellow \nstudents and fellow human beings.\n\n  I think we need in our society to reexamine what our culture is \nteaching our children.\n  What are we saying? What are we promoting with the death, with the \nviolence, with the glorification of drugs in so much of the literature, \nand as a matter of fact, in much of the music?\n  Parents need to be concerned.\n  These aren't all things that government can have much to do about, \nbut I think our parents need to be concerned about the level of \nexposure that our children have to things which degrade the \nappreciation for life and desensitize our feelings toward death.\n  The joystick on a video game may punch out an opponent on the screen, \nand one might be able to kill, kill, kill, kill just by punching the \nbutton on the computer.\n  I think we have to be careful that we don't create in ourselves the \nmentality of disrespect of what ought to be an appreciation for life, \nand desensitize our feelings.\n  Obviously, Congress can't solve all the problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Missouri has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent that I have another 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we can act to ensure that our \nlegislative policies empower parents, teachers, principals and \nadministrators with the ability to ensure that our children have a safe \nlearning environment. I believe that is something we owe America.\n  Current Federal education laws preclude schools from dealing with \nearly warning signs of danger. It is time for us to end that. I am \npleased that we have done it to a small degree in the Ed-Flex measure.\n  I am grateful for the sponsors of this measure and for the excellent \nwork they have done for America and education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from New York will \nbe speaking for about 5 minutes, after which I will have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon we are talking about education \nlegislation.\n  Today, all of our thoughts and prayers go to one school in Littleton, \nCO. Yesterday's massacre is all too familiar. It is America's recurring \nnightmare. It leaves us shocked and numb. It takes away our innocence. \nIt makes children afraid to go to school.\n  This morning I had breakfast with my daughters. I do that every day \nbefore they go off to the schoolbus. Usually, it is routine, but today \nthe conversation was a little different, both for me and for my girls.\n  Yesterday, as we sat transfixed to our television sets praying for \nthose caught in the crossfire and hoping for an explanation of the \ncarnage, we heard the same phrases that we heard in Pearl, in \nSpringfield, in Jonesboro and Paducah.\n  ``This is a quiet town.''\n  ``Nothing like this happens here.''\n  ``We do not have crime problems in this town.''\n  ``It didn't seem real.''\n  ``This is a good school.''\n  ``Could it have been prevented?''\n  ``How could someone be so distraught to murder, and, yet, no one in \nauthority knew?''\n  ``How did they get a gun?''\n  ``What can we do?''\n  The same words each time.\n  Each time there is a new tragedy, we act as if this will be the last \nin a list of school shootings. But it is not the last.\n  As sad and as horrible as it seems, this will definitely not be the \nlast time we tune in to our television sets to see children fleeing \nfrom their schools.\n  I have taken to the floor today to ask that we in Congress make a \nconcerted and comprehensive attempt to address school shootings. I \nwant, today, to list some ideas, many of which have already been \ndiscussed, some of which haven't, which I hope we can agree to work on \nand come up with some solutions that may make a difference. We have \ncounselled teenagers since time began who have struggled with personal \nand psychological problems. The difference today is that through \ncomputers, fantasy worlds, lethal guns, and explosives, the damage that \na disturbed boy can do today is 1,000 times worse than it was when we \nwere kids. Some schools are very good at counseling. Most are not. We \nneed to help schools get better at counseling.\n  We need the Federal Government to help share information among \nschools so that good schools can teach those schools that do not do \nvery well how to do it. There are too many young boys and girls with \ntroubles and too few well-trained people to handle them.\n  Second, the people who best knew that there were troubled kids in \nColumbine High were the students at the school.\n  Students need to be encouraged to confidentially identify for the \nschool psychologists and counselors those in the school who are \nexhibiting dangerous behavior and who need help. It is usually not the \nnature of a teenager to approach an authority figure to say someone in \nclass is doing something strange. But it is not impossible to change \nthat. If they know they are helping someone, kids will answer the call.\n  Then there is the issue of hate groups. It is shocking that a large \nnumber of students in Littleton knew that yesterday was Hitler's \nbirthday. That is because this group of so-called Goths idealize and \nproselytize about Hitler. But school authorities had no idea that there \nwere those who worship Hitler in the school.\n  We have to identify and we have to exchange information about hate \ngroups and be far more vigilant in condemning these activities. \nPrincipals, teachers, and students must be encouraged to speak out. We \nhave to get hate, white supremacy, and guns out of the schools. We \ndon't know yet how these youths got their weapons. Did they take them \nfrom their parents? Did they steal them from a neighbor? Did they buy \nthem off the Internet? Did they get them at a gun show or store?\n  We must accept that any solution has to involve a change in gun laws. \nA teenager can only do so much damage with his fists. There have always \nbeen troubled teenagers. All of a sudden they seem to have the ability \nto do so much more damage. We can work on trying to change teenagers. \nWe should also work on making sure that the instrumentalities of death \nand destruction cannot end up in their hands.\n  We have to close off loopholes that allow kids to get a gun. We \nshould ban unlicensed Internet sales. We should pass Senator Kennedy's \nchild access prevention law. The House should pass Congresswoman \nMcCarthy's comprehensive legislation. We need the\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nPresident to help us, to lead us in passing this type of legislation. \nWe should also begin an effort in the public and private sectors to \ninvest research money in ``smart'' guns that cannot be used by anyone \nother than the owner. This is an area where the military and the \nprivate sector can come together and do a lot of good. I will be \ntalking more about that later in the week.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not enough to wring our hands and pray it won't \nhappen again. We need to act. Let's resolve to work together to do what \nis necessary to protect our children. Let us focus on better \ncounseling, condemnation of hate groups within the school, encouraging \nstudents to come forward, and much better laws preventing kids from \ngetting guns.\n  We are all in mourning today. When the tears are dry, let's not \npretend that this won't happen again.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say at the outset, I salute the Senator \non his remarks. I think he struck the right tone. There is a sense of \nmourning and sadness across America for what happened in Colorado.\n  We have to address the needs of troubled children. I think the \nSenator from New York was correct in highlighting that. I think he also \ncalls us to task, too, to do something sensible about gun control. A \ntroubled child is a sad thing; a troubled child with a gun can be a \ntragedy not just for himself but for a lot of innocent youngsters.\n  I ask the Senator if he can indicate to Members those legislative \ninitiatives we should be considering that might slow down the violence \nwe are seeing too often in America and too frequently in our schools?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his comments. \nThere are a lot of initiatives. The Senator from Illinois himself has \nbeen a leader in this area. There are many things we can do.\n  In this specific instance, we don't know where the guns came from. \nThey may have come from gun shows. Gun shows are open markets where \nvirtually anyone can buy a gun. They may have even been bought off the \nInternet. There are almost no rules for controlling gun sales on the \nInternet.\n  We also can proceed with trigger locks and much stronger legislation \nin terms of making schools gun free.\n  These are things we can come together on. I think they are things \nthat most experts agree would not eliminate the chance for this \noccurring but greatly reduce it.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator and all Members of this \nbody to do something about this. It is just awful when you see the \npictures. Everyone is moved to try to do something to prevent it.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Angela \nWilliams and David Goldberg, detailees in my Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, be permitted floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the good Senator from Ohio. I know he has been \nwaiting. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Voinovich.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I rise to support approval of the conference report on Ed-Flex. \nHowever, I would be remiss if I didn't respond to the remarks of \nSenator Schumer and Senator Ashcroft in terms of the tragedy that took \nplace in Colorado and expressing the sympathy of the people of the \nState of Ohio to those families who are suffering today as a result of \nthat tragedy. As one who has lost a child from a tragic automobile \nsituation--instant death--I can understand the trauma those families \nare experiencing right now.\n  I think it is a sad commentary on our society that this happened in \nColorado, as well as other States, as mentioned by Senator Ashcroft and \nSenator Schumer. There is something wrong with our society and I am not \nsure we can solve it here on the floor of the Senate. I think it has to \nbe solved in the hearts and the minds of the people who reside in our \ncountry. I think a lot has to do with turning back to our family and \nour moral values that are so important and which inculcate in us \nrespect for our fellow man.\n  I grew up in a family where I was taught to respect all individuals. \nIt wasn't a man's color of skin, their religion, or their socioeconomic \nstatus that mattered; it was their character.\n  I think there may be lots of responses to this tragedy, but I cannot \nhelp but think if they go back to the Boy Scout motto, the Girl Scout \nmotto, and some of the basic fundamental organizations that build \ncharacter, that this country will be far better off.\n  In spite of everything we do, in my State I was ridiculed because we \nmade a major capital improvement to put metal detector devices into our \nhigh schools. Many people said we shouldn't have to do that in our high \nschools, and that money went that quick. We wanted to guarantee that at \nleast when kids were in school, they knew their classmates didn't have \nsome kind of weapon. I am sure that perhaps in that school district, \nnobody even gave any thought that that kind of a situation could occur.\n  The other area I think we need to recognize is that, unfortunately, \nyoungsters today aren't getting the kind of moral and family and \nreligious training at home and the responsibilities are falling more on \nour schools. In Ohio, we aggressively pursued a mediation and dispute \nresolution program in kindergarten and first grade to try to teach \nchildren that when they have differences of opinion with other \nindividuals, they sit down and talk them out; they don't use physical \nforce to resolve their problems. We have recognized in our State that \nsocial service agencies have to be connected. We are locating them now \nin our schools. If we identify a youngster with a problem, that student \ncan get the help they need. More important than that, most of the time \nthe family gets the help they need so that they don't participate in \nantisocial behavior.\n  There are a number of things that need to be done. I hope we don't, \nas a response to this, think there is just one approach that will make \na difference. It will require a multifaceted approach, and again, \nlooking into our own heart and soul.\n  Ed-Flex, which I have worked on as well as the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Frist, might also help because it will give school districts \naround this country the opportunity to take money which is available to \nthem through the Federal Government, and if they feel there is a better \nway that money can be spent to make a difference in the lives of \nchildren, they are going to be able to do that.\n  Many children who don't do well early on in school become frustrated; \nas a result of that frustration, they turn to antisocial behavior. One \nof the things that stands in the way is that they are unable to read.\n  Because of Ed-Flex, school districts that are title I schools, school \ndistricts that can take advantage of the Eisenhower Professional Grant \nProgram, are going to have the opportunity to change the use of those \ndollars and put them into reading. We found that in the State of Ohio, \nwhen we have taken the Eisenhower professional grant money that says \nyou have to use it for science and math and it has allowed us to take \nthat money and use it for reading. We did that because in the early \ngrades, if a kid cannot read, he cannot do math, he cannot do science. \nIf I had my way, every title I school, every Eisenhower grant in the \nprimary and secondary grades that are eligible for those programs would \ntake advantage of Ed-Flex, would come back to their State school \norganizations and say, we could use this money better so we can make a \ndifference in the lives of these kids.\n  Just think what a difference that will make in America today. We have \nin Ohio now what we have called a fourth grade guarantee. No child will \ngo to the fifth grade unless they are able to read at that fourth grade \nlevel. That in itself, I think, would help a great deal with some of \nthe problems we have in our schools today.\n  I would like to finish my remarks by giving some people some credit \nfor this work on Ed-Flex: The majority leader who helped make this a \npriority for this Senate; you, Senator Frist, for the terrific work \nthat you have done; Senator Jeffords, Senator Wyden, and everyone who \nhas come together; the National Governors' Association, on a\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nbipartisan basis, that supported this legislation.\n  I just want it known, I do not know what is going to happen with \nelementary and secondary education. I do not know whether our \nRepublican block grant is going to work or Senator Kennedy's various \neducation programs are going to work. But one thing I do know is going \nto work: Ed-Flex is going to work. I think if we let it work for the \nnext couple of years we will prove, just like we have with our welfare \nreform system, if you give people on the local level the flexibility to \nuse the dollars and to use the brains that God has given them, they can \nreally make a difference in the lives of people. That is the thing \nabout which we really should feel very, very good. I am glad I had a \nlittle part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time now remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 43 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Following that time, or at least some time, the good \nSenator from Minnesota has an hour, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Senator from Minnesota \nhas an hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with others who rise today to \nexpress our great sense of sorrow to those families and all of those \nwho have experienced the loss and suffering in Littleton, CO.\n  Our hearts go out to the children and their families and all the \nvictims of this latest senseless school tragedy. In the days and weeks \nto come, we will learn much more about how and why it could have \nhappened--and why it happened again, after the fair warning we have had \nfrom similar tragedies that shocked the nation so deeply in recent \nyears.\n  This terrible tragedy has scarred the Nation and reminded us, once \nagain, about the fragile nature of the young children in our country \nwho are going off to school every day. It reminds all of us that we \nhave an important responsibility to do everything we can to give \nchildren the support and love they need, to help them as they walk the \npath of adolescence into maturity.\n  Obviously, the schools are an extremely important element in that \ndevelopment. But we know nothing replaces the home, nothing replaces a \nparent, nothing replaces those members of the family or friends who are \nloving, caring, and encouraging. Those who offer firmness in \nestablishing guidelines and guideposts for children as they develop. So \nall of us are very mindful of those tragedies that are being \nexperienced even while we meet here, of the tears that are being shed, \nand the struggle of many of those young children for their lives, even \nas we meet here today.\n  There is a certain poignancy since we are meeting on education \nlegislation. It is important legislation. It is worthwhile of passage. \nBut I think all of us today are remembering Jonesboro, AR; Notus, ID; \nSpringfield, OR; Fayetteville, TN; Edinboro, PA; West Paducah, KY; and \nPearl, MS. Now we have Littleton, CO. All of those communities have \nbeen affected by violence in their community schools.\n  Perhaps reviewing the kinds of acts of violence that take place in \nschools, they do not appear to be overwhelming in total numbers, as we \nmight think of total numbers. I think all of us are enormously moved \nand touched by these human tragedies, because, of course, all of us \nbelieve young children have such hope and promise and opportunity to \nlive in our communities and in our country. Children offer so much to \ntheir families and to their loved ones. To see the violence snuff out \ninnocent lives is a factor, a force in all of our souls that rings \nheavily.\n  So, all of us here in the Senate reach out to those families.\n  Mr. President, in reading through the newspapers in my own city of \nBoston today, there were some rather interesting articles which I will \njust mention here on the floor of the Senate, and then I will take time \nto address the measure that is at hand.\n  There was a conference taking place in Boston and there were \nexcellent articles about that conference. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were order to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, Apr. 21, 1999]\n\n               Experts: Gun Access, Social Anger to Blame\n\n                            (By David Weber)\n\n       Easy access to guns, an increasingly blurred line between \n     fantasy and reality, and anger sparked by social rejection \n     fueled the epidemic of school violence, according to experts.\n       ``It's getting a little crazier and a little more frequent. \n     It seems to be the boundaries between reality and fantasy are \n     decreasing more and more,'' said Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, a \n     forensic psychiatrist.\n       ``As young people project themselves in virtual reality at \n     movies and arcades and get their heads into that, life \n     becomes virtual reality, which is not reality,'' he said.\n       Combine that with the age-old traits of teenagers--strong \n     urges, feelings of aggression and a sense of omnipotence--and \n     you have a dangerous mix, Yudowitz said. He said the feeling \n     of omnipotence allows teens to ignore consequences to \n     themselves and others.\n       ``It (adolescence) can be a fun and creative time. But you \n     need a context to provide boundaries,'' he said.\n       Citing his 30 years of working with young people, he said, \n     ``Adolescents are less and less grounded. If you don't have \n     the proper sense of reality, you can't attach your values to \n     anything of substance, and it all becomes a great big game.''\n       For students rejected by their peers, that game is all the \n     more dangerous, said author Hara Estroff Marano, who \n     addresses the string of recent school shootings in the book, \n     ``Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me: A Guide to Raising Socially \n     Confident Kids.''\n       ``I don't think the most important issues are gun control \n     or security in the school,'' said Marano, an editor-at-large \n     of Psychology Today.\n       ``The real issue is what's causing this behavior, and the \n     fact is kids who pull the trigger have problems along with \n     their peers.''\n       Working parents and school officials don't pay enough \n     attention to the social competence of children. And when \n     children become social outcasts, they're more susceptible to \n     dark media messages.\n       ``A normal, adjusted child who watches violent programming \n     will come away with a different message than a child who \n     lacks the social skills to get along with his peers.'' ``They \n     feel violent programs are in fact endorsing revenge.''\n       John Rosenthal, co-founder of Stop Handgun Violence, said a \n     proliferation of ever more lethal guns, along with \n     irresponsible storage of the weapons in homes, is a big part \n     of the deadly epidemic.\n       ``I'm horrified but not surprised (by yesterday's \n     shootings) because there were eight schoolyard shootings last \n     year that killed 15 kids and wounded 44 others. All were \n     perpetrated by teenagers, most of whom had access to high-\n     powered assault weapons.\n       ``In many cases, they were stolen from their parents or \n     other relatives who left their weapons around loaded and \n     unlocked,'' Rosenthal said.\n       ``Like those other schoolyard shootings, (yesterday's) \n     tragedy could have been prevented by reducing access to guns \n     by kids. We can blame TV, the media and any number of violent \n     movies, but access to guns is the real issue.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    [From the Globe, Apr. 21, 1999]\n\n              Deadly Acts Put Focus on Need for Prevention\n\n                           (By Ellen O'Brien)\n\n       It has happened in Alaska, Arkansas, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \n     Mississippi, and Kentucky.\n       All boys, all armed with guns and rifles, all creating a \n     deadly fantasy where one day they would strike back, and \n     often telling teachers and classmates their plans in advance.\n       And now, the nation turns its attention to the youths in \n     Littleton, Colo., where the toll was the deadliest yet.\n       Once again, the country will stop talking about \n     standardized testing and teacher's salaries and view children \n     in classrooms as potential targets and killers. People will \n     wonder how it could have been prevented and will worry about \n     where it will happen again.\n       The incidence of juvenile crime in big cities, and of \n     school violence, has been decreasing in recent years.\n       But these days, each angry act carries a far greater \n     threat.\n       ``These are still rare crimes,'' said Jack Levin, director \n     of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern \n     University. ``But because of the easy access to handguns, we \n     are seeing larger and larger body counts.''\n       ``All it takes,'' Levin said, ``is one alienated, \n     marginalized youngster who decides to get even.''\n       In general, Levin and other specialists said, big cities \n     have tried to respond to the issue of school violence with \n     more preventive measures. Meanwhile, Levin said, the high-\n     profile school massacres of the last decade occurred in \n     suburban or rural towns.\n       ``I think small-town America has to realize they also are \n     in trouble, and need to supervise their children and take \n     guns out of their hands--the way big cities have tired to \n     do,'' Levin said.\n       Metal detectors and police presence in schools, lawsuits \n     against gun manufacturers and media giants, and sentencing of \n     juvenile criminals as adults have all been suggested\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n     or tried. But none of these options, advocates agree, can \n     stop school violence.\n       Academics, activities, politicians, and parents around the \n     nation say solutions are obvious, though less tangible than \n     an instrument that detects gun metal. They cite the British \n     Parliament's approval of one of the world's strictest gun \n     laws after 16 children and their teacher were gunned down in \n     Dunblane, Scotland, in 1997.\n       They also point to overburdened schools, where the system \n     is faced with a growing number of angst-ridden students.\n       ``There's a real connection between'' this violence ``and \n     the fact that counselors have huge case loads'' and ``an \n     enormous amount of kids who evidence worry,'' said Margaret \n     Welch, director of the Collaborative for Integrated School \n     Services at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n       Still, deadly violence in schools is rare. June Arnette, \n     associate director of the National School Safety Center in \n     Westlake, Calif., which monitors school violence from news \n     accounts, said that before yesterday, they had identified \n     nine school-related violent deaths, including three suicides, \n     during the 1998-99 school year. She said there were 42 \n     violent school deaths in 1997-98 and 25 violent deaths the \n     previous school year.\n       In Boston and many surrounding cities and towns, Community \n     Based Justice has identified several boys who fantasized \n     about killing their classmates or teacher and bragged about \n     it or dedicated an English essay to it. The program, which \n     brings together teachers, students, prosecutors, and police, \n     updates reports on troubled children and suggests ways to \n     help.\n       Few officials believe the students were going to carry out \n     their elaborate plans. However, the children who appeared \n     troubled were visited at home, and at least one, who was also \n     displaying a fascination with setting fires, was referred \n     this year to a program for violent youths.\n       As for metal detectors, Boston Public School Superintendent \n     Thomas W. Payzant said they cannot prevent all students from \n     carrying guns and knives onto school property.\n       Boston's Madison Park High School posted metal detectors at \n     doors, but other city high schools supply officials with \n     handheld detectors that are used sporadically.\n       Because it is feared that expulsions can lead to violent \n     students returning with even more anger, troubled teens in \n     Boston are sometimes referred to counseling centers, and can \n     be readmitted after evaluation.\n       But Boston's school system has heard countless complaints \n     from headmasters that there are not enough alternative \n     schools where students obviously in need of help can attend \n     classes.\n       ``You can't do it with metal detectors,'' Welch said. \n     ``Support services need to be provided for all kids.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just mention a few quotations. This is one of the \nparticipants:\n\n       ``It's getting a little crazier and a little more frequent. \n     It seems to be the boundaries between reality and fantasy are \n     decreasing more and more,'' said Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, a \n     forensic psychiatrist.\n       ``As young people project themselves in virtual relative \n     movies and arcades and get their heads into that, life \n     becomes virtual reality, which is not reality,'' he said.\n       Combine that with the age-old traits of teenagers--strong \n     urges, feelings of aggression and a sense of omnipotence--and \n     you have a dangerous mix Yudowitz said. He said the feeling \n     of omnipotence allows teens to ignore consequences to \n     themselves and others.\n       ``It (adolescence) can be a fun and creative time. But you \n     need a context to provide boundaries,'' he said.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The real issue is what's causing this behavior, and the \n     fact is kids who pull the trigger have problems getting along \n     with their peers.''\n       Working parents and school officials don't pay enough \n     attention to the social competence of children. And when \n     children become social outcasts, they're more susceptible to \n     dark media messages.\n       ``A normal, adjusted child who watches violent programming \n     will come away with a different message than a child who \n     lacks the social skills to get along with his peers.'' ``They \n     feel violent programs are in fact endorsing revenge.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then it continues on with some very constructive \nsuggestions, from Mr. Rosenthal, who is a co-founder of Stop Handgun \nViolence, talking about responsibility, responsibility with regard to \nthe availability of weapons. He is talking about the responsibility of \nparents who own guns to make sure the guns are securely locked and kept \nseparately from ammunition, so no weapon is left loaded and accessible \nto children in a house; the responsibility of both manufacturers and \ndealers to prevent the proliferation of guns that are sold to children \ndirectly and on the black market, and that too easily get into the \nhands of gangs and the criminal element. These are important \nresponsibilities that adults must meet. They are not going to be a \ncure-all. They are not going to be an end-all.\n  But they are a beginning. A beginning to provide a measurement of \nresponsibility. We want responsibility from young people, from \nchildren, and we want responsibility from others as well who have the \naccess and the ability to see that either weapons are available or not \navailable to children.\n  We have 14 children die every single day from gun violence. None of \nus this afternoon have come up with a silver bullet to resolve all of \nthese kinds of problems, but we ought to be able to take some measured \nsteps to make some difference. It is not going to be enough to just \nshed tears, because they are empty tears, unless we are prepared to \ntake some actions on these measures.\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from Missouri \nspeak about a particular provision about guns which he offered to the \nlegislation and which was retained in the ED-Flex conference report. I \nam also reminded that there was a very close referendum in his home \nState, only decided 53-47, on whether a felon could purchase and carry \na concealed weapon--even allowing a felon to carry that weapon onto \nschool grounds. The National Rifle Association said yes, they should be \nable to do that. There is a similar measure in Colorado itself, right \nnow it is ready to be voted on by the state legislature. We will soon \nenough see statements from the National Rifle Association supporting \nthis law--urging that criminals ought to be able to have concealed \nweapons, even though they have committed felonies, that for their own \nself-protection they can carry those weapons anywhere, even into a \nschool--come on now. Come on now. We cannot solve all the problems \nhere, but we can reduce the access and the availability in these kinds \nof circumstances. We ought to at least ask ourselves, How hard is the \nNational Rifle Association going to press on these measures? How many \ntimes do we have to be reminded about the tragic consequences these \nmeasures can have?\n  The good citizens of Missouri rejected that law. It is the first time \nwe have had a referendum, and it was rejected by the public.\n  I am not here to describe what the position of the Senator was on \nthat issue, but it does seem to me that to pass a law that says someone \nwho has committed a felony--they could have been convicted of a felony \nlike domestic violence--is permitted to go out and buy and carry a \nconcealed weapon is not moving us in the right direction.\n  I hope as my good friends and colleagues have mentioned--Senator \nSchumer, Senator Durbin and others who will speak on this--that we will \nbe able to at least present to the Senate some recommendations which \nreally demand responsibility from those who have access to keep those \nguns safely away from children.\n  It is interesting to me that this body has voted to effectively \nprevent the Centers for Disease Control from accurately calculating the \nnumber of injuries from gun violence because of the power of the \nNational Rifle Association on the floor of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. They do not want to know how much gun violence is out \nthere. We do not let the Centers for Disease Control, using all their \ncapabilities, even tell us how big the problem is.\n  Today, as we sit in the Senate, the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission has the ability to provide safety for toy guns for children \nso that the ends will not break off and a child will not gag or choke. \nBut virtually all protections available to the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission for real guns that can be used against the citizens have \nbeen taken away. Isn't that extraordinary? The Consumer Products Safety \nCommission can issue regulations on toy guns for your children but not \nreal guns that can kill you. Why? Because of the power of the National \nRifle Association.\n  Mr. President, I hope people around the country who are sharing the \ngrief of those families understand that there are no magic bullets to \nresolve these issues, but we can take some steps and we should take \nsome steps to do something about it. I believe in requiring responsible \nactions by manufacturers who produce guns to have safety locks so that \nthey will not discharge and kill\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nchildren if they are dropped and cannot be fired by a child who takes \nthe gun without parental supervision, and requiring other safety \nprovisions so they can only be used by those who purchase the weapon.\n\n  There are all kinds of technology available which add maybe a few \ndollars to the cost of those weapons, but can greatly improve the \nsafety of the guns with just a little responsible action by the \nmanufacturers, by the dealers, and by the gun owners. Hopefully, we can \nget their support for legislation that can at least reduce access and \navailability of weapons to children who are going to school. I hope we \nwill be able to do that.\n  I think we can give the assurance that we will have an opportunity to \ndebate those issues in this Congress, hopefully very soon, with or \nwithout the hearings in the Judiciary Committee; preferably with, but, \nif necessary, without. I do not think those measures are so difficult \nand so complex that the Members of this body cannot grasp them. We can \nhave some accountability in the Senate on those measures.\n  Mr. President, on the underlying legislation, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the ED-Flex conference report. We will have many opportunities \nover the course of this session to improve and expand the partnership \nwith States and local communities to strengthen public schools across \nthen nation.\n  I commend Senator Frist and Senator Wyden for their leadership on the \nED-Flex Partnership Act of 1999. And, I commend Chairman Jeffords, \nCongressman Goodling, and Congressman Clay for their leadership in \nmaking education a priority in this Congress.\n  To date, the Federal Government has been a limited partner in \nsupporting elementary and secondary education. However, we have made a \nsubstantial investment increasing the accessibility and affordability \nof college for all qualified students. For elementary and secondary \neducation, the Federal Government provides 7 cents out of every dollar \nat the local level. The ED-Flex legislation is not going to provide an \nadditional nickel or dollar to any school district.\n  In 1994, when Senator Hatfield offered, and I supported, an amendment \nto provide that ED-Flex program for 6 pilot states. Then we expanded \nthe program to 6 more states so that there are currently 12 ED-Flex \npilot States. The conference report today is simply an expansion of \nthat program.\n  Mr. President, some may say, why don't we give complete flexibility \nto the local community? Communities need additional support. We know \nthat the primary responsibility for the education of the nation's \nchildren remains within the local community, the local school boards, \nteachers, and parents, and with help and assistance from the States, \nand some help and assistance from the Federal Government.\n  When we first passed title I--I was here when we did it--we did not \nprovide the kind of statutory protections and accountability that we \nhave today, many of which can be waived under ED-Flex. And what do you \nknow? Five years later, they were using the title I programs to build \nswimming pools and buy shoulder pads for football players in local \ncommunities. It did not ensure that the neediest children who had the \ngreatest needs were served and served well. So we amended the law to \nensure that federal support for education was targeted on the neediest \nstudents and used on targeted purposes.\n  There is an appropriate role for greater flexibility--with \naccountability--and we recognized that in the 1994 reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The ED-Flex Partnership Act \nis a worthwhile step towards improving public schools. By giving states \nthe authority to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements \nthat apply to federal education programs, we hope to support and \nenhance state and local education reforms that will help all children \nreach high standards of achievement.\n  Families across the nation want Uncle Sam to be a partner in \nimproving education. Parents are impatient about results. They want \ntheir communities, states, and the federal government to work together \nto improve public schools. In fulfilling our federal responsibility, we \nmust continue to ensure that greater flexibility is matched with strong \naccountability for results, so that every parent knows their children \nare getting the education they deserve.\n  The ED-Flex conference report meets that goal by including strong \naccountability measures. Flexibility and accountability must go hand-\nin-hand in order to ensure that we get better results for all students.\n  If states are going to accept federal resources paid for by public \ntax dollars, we must ensure strong accountability. In the ED-Flex \nConference Report, the House and the Senate maintained our commitment \nto serving the neediest and poorest children to help improve their \nacademic achievement. Senator Wellstone worked hard to ensure that we \nretained these targeting provisions.\n  We have retained the amendment of my friend and colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed, that insisted that we ensure that parents have a \nstrong role in the waiver process and that they are going to be a \nstrong partner in the educational decisions that affect their children. \nI commend Senator Reed.\n\n  The conference report also helps see that increased flexibility leads \nto improved student achievement. Accountability in this context means \nthat states must evaluate how waivers actually improve student \nachievement. Open-ended waivers make no sense. Results are what count. \nThe Secretary of Education has the power to terminate a state's waiver \nauthority if student achievement is not improving. States must be able \nto terminate any waivers granted to a school district or participating \nschools if student achievement is not improving. If the waivers are not \nleading to satisfactory progress, it makes no sense to continue them.\n  I also commend Senator Murray for her work to ensure that our \ndownpayment on hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in the \nearly grades I retained. We will have an opportunity in this session to \ncome back to the broader issue about whether it is going to be a matter \nof national priority that we continue our commitment to reducing class \nsize. This commitment is one of President Clinton's most important \ninitiatives on education. The Senate-passed bill would have undermined \nit, and the decision by the conferees to retain it is a significant \nvictory for the nation's schools and students.\n  But, these accomplishments are not enough. More--much more--needs to \nbe done to make sure that every community has the support it needs to \nimplement what works to improve their public schools. We must do more \nto meet the needs of schools, families, and children, so that all \nchildren can attend good schools and meet high standards of \nachievement.\n  We should do more to help communities address the real problems of \nrising student enrollments, overcrowded classrooms, dilapidated \nschools, teacher shortages, underqualified teachers, high new teacher \nturnover rates, and lack of after-school programs. These are real \nproblems that deserve real solutions.\n  We should meet our commitment to reducing class size over seven \nyears. We should help recruit more teachers. We should improve and \nexpand professional development of teachers. We should expand after-\nschool programs. We should help ensure all children have access to \ntechnology in the classroom. And we should rebuild and modernize school \nbuildings.\n  ED-Flex is a good bipartisan start by Congress to meeting all of \nthese challenges. My hope is that these other proposals to address \ncritical issues will also receive the bipartisan support they deserve, \nso they can be in place for the beginning of the next academic year \nthis fall. Improving education is clearly one of our highest national \npriorities. Investing in education is investing in a stronger America \nhere at home and around the world, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on both sides to address the critical education issues \nfacing communities across the country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I was visiting today with the leader in the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Gephardt, and we talked about \neducation. He spoke very knowledgeably about a school he visited in \nHarlem, NY, that has had significant success in improving academic \nachievement of students. He pointed out that this school had been a \nschool with 2,000 students. Overcrowding and discipline were a problem\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\nthat was impeding the academic success of its students. They decided to \ndivide it into 10 schools of 200 students each.\n  The point is that the head mistress at that particular school was \nasked--as everyone asks--What is really the secret? Of course, we all \nknow that there is no one answer to improving education. But this one \ncourse of action was one that both Leader Gephardt and I found very \npersuasive. By reducing the size of the school and classrooms, every \nteacher in that school knew the name of every student in that school; \nand every student in that school knew the name of every teacher. And \nevery teacher in every class knew the parents by name of every one of \ntheir students and had a relationship with every one of those parents. \nThey were then able to effectively reach students and academic \nachievement and discipline improved. They were able to develop a spirit \nand a sense of family in an area where students feel many kinds of \npressures. Students were given the support, love, attention, \ndiscipline, and firmness, they needed to get results.\n  So, Mr. President, if we, as a society generally and as a people \nindividually, offer our prayers for those families who have been \naffected and as a country begin to try to look at some of the issues \nthat are presented by these tragedies in an important way, then perhaps \neven the extraordinary clouds that are over this, and particularly in \nColorado, might part just briefly so some sunshine might come in and we \nmay do better for our children in the future.\n  I commend and thank all the staff members for their skillful \nassistance on this ED-Flex legislation: Susan Hattan, Sherry Kaiman, \nand Jenny Smulson of Senator Jeffords' staff; Townsend Lange and Denzel \nMcGuire of Senator Gregg's staff; Lori Meyer and Meredith Medley of \nSenator Frist's staff; Suzanne Day of Senator Dodd's staff; Elyse Wasch \nof Senator Reed's staff; Greg Williamson of Senator Murray's staff; Bev \nSchroeder and Sharon Masling of Senator Harkin's staff; Lindsay \nRosenberg of Senator Wyden's staff; and Connie Garner, Jane Oates, Dana \nFiordaliso, and Danica Petroshius of my own staff.\n  I also commend the skillful work of the House staff on the conference \ncommittee, including Vic Klatt, Sally Lovejoy, Christy Wolfe, and Kent \nTalbert of the House Committee's Republican staff; Melanie Merola of \nRepresentative Castle's staff; Mark Zuckerman, Sedric Hendricks, and \nAlex Nock of the House Committee's Democratic staff; Charlie Barone of \nRepresentative Miller's staff; and Page Tomlin of Representative \nPayne's staff.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have been down here for about an hour and a half. I \nwas under the impression that I would follow Senator Kennedy. I am in \nopposition to this bill. I was supposed to have an hour to speak. This \nis the only time, actually, I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you.\n  I say to my colleague from Vermont, I will not take up all that time, \nbut my colleague from Virginia asked to speak briefly. So I ask \nunanimous consent that he be allowed to speak for several minutes, and \nthen I follow him.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I would just like to have a \nfew short minutes to speak on the bill, on the Ed-Flex bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. These are good friends, but I know Senators' ``short \nminutes.'' I also have to leave to meet with a lot of students from \nMinnesota. I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Virginia be \nallowed to speak for a few short minutes and then my colleague from \nConnecticut, who asked to speak, be allowed to speak for a few ``short \nminutes,'' after which I will be able to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I amend my unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kennedy not be allowed to speak, as he can't speak \nfor a few ``short minutes.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object. (Laughter.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, the \nunanimous consent request by the Senator from Minnesota is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I want to, first of all, say that I support the Ed-\nFlex bill, so I particularly appreciate my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota yielding just a couple minutes to me.\n  But like so many of our other colleagues today, I want to express my \ncondolences to all of those in Littleton who have suffered such a \ntragic loss in such a traumatic event to the community. I think it was \nobvious last night when the President was asked after his statement if \nthere was anything we could do to prevent tragic incidents like this \nfrom happening, he acknowledged that there aren't any easy answers. But \nwe all know that recognizing the warning signs of stress and depression \nand substance abuse and violent behavior starts at home and extends \nwell into our communities. Littleton, as other communities, is \nsuffering in ways we can only imagine. My three daughters are now \ngrown, but I cannot imagine the agony of waiting to find out what fate \nmight have befallen them under similar circumstances.\n  I grieve with the families, as all others do. I note to my colleagues \nthat I had introduced legislation in 1993 which I believed would make a \ncontribution to the effort to reduce and prevent school violence. I \nplan to reintroduce similar legislation sometime in the next week or \ntwo. I welcome the work of any colleagues who desire to help.\n  I appreciate the fact that in 1997 we were able to divert money from \nthe Community Oriented Policing Services funds to fund school safety \ninitiatives, and we were able to increase those funds by tenfold in \n1998. We can do more, and I hope the legislation I plan to offer will \nadvance that cause.\n  But for right now, I simply join with all of our colleagues here in \nthe Senate in expressing to those families grieving in Littleton, CO, \nand all over the country, that we understand the agony through which \nthey are hopefully passing at this moment, and we will do our best to \nwork with them.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and particularly thank my colleague from \nMinnesota for yielding to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Virginia and \nothers who I know have spoken this morning in the Chamber about the \ntragic and unbelievable events in Littleton, CO. I can't help but \nobserve that the Presiding Officer has more than just a passing \nfamiliarity with this kind of tragedy, in that in his own State we saw \na similar situation. It has occurred in other States around the country \nas well.\n  Crime rates are coming down all across the Nation. So many positive \nthings seem to be happening with new policing, community policing, \nefforts being made all across the board. That we still find what \nappears to be an increase in this kind of crime is confounding and sort \nof cries out for us to be thinking harder about how we can deal with \nthese situations.\n  I, too, want to add my voice in expression of sorrow to the families \nin the community of Littleton, CO. We have to do more than just grieve \nand talk about our kids, their education, the day after these \ntragedies. That is certainly appropriate. But we must talk about them \nand try to come up with some answers the day before and the day before \nthat so that we minimize these kinds of incredible circumstances from \noccurring.\n  If we are going to be responsive to the needs of our young people and \nthe educational needs of Americans, then we have to invest our time and \nenergy in healing whatever has gone so terribly wrong in the lives of \nthese youth who allegedly were responsible for these events, even \nthough we don't know in total what has occurred there, or we are going \nto be revisiting these kinds of stories all too frequently.\n  With that, Mr. President, I am pleased to stand in the Chamber today \nand add my voice of support to this conference report on the Ed-Flex \nbill. The concerns of children and education are not going to be \nentirely solved by\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\nthis legislation, but I think it is a positive step forward.\n  I am pleased to support the legislation, the education flexibility \npartnership bill, as it is called. I compliment Senators Frist of \nTennessee and Wyden of Oregon who sponsored the legislation and have \nbeen involved as forceful advocates for it. I also thank the chairman \nof the committee, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking Democrat, Senator \nKennedy, who played a very important role in trying to strengthen the \nlegislation and have worked hard to improve the bill in this bipartisan \neffort.\n\n  The conference report before us reauthorizes and expands the existing \neducation flexibility demonstration program to all eligible States. We \nfirst enacted Ed-Flex in 1994 as part of the Goals 2000 legislation. \nSince that time, 12 States have been selected to participate. With the \nEd-Flex authority, States can waive Federal statutory and regulatory \nrequirements in several key elementary and secondary education programs \nwhere those requirements impede local efforts to improve schools. That \nwas the idea, test this out.\n  Although few States have used this authority broadly and results are \nstill being compiled, reports from the States suggest that this \nauthority is making a difference. State officials report Ed-Flex has \nchanged the climate of school reform in their States. It has led to far \nmore innovation. Texas, which has been the only State to use this \nauthority broadly--and I commend them for it--and to gather achievement \ndata has shown impressive student achievement increases among all \ngroups of students.\n  While each State is different, and certainly Texas would be the first \nto tell you how different they are, when it comes to education, \nparticularly elementary and secondary education, the lessons learned in \nTexas, I think, could be very helpful to all of us regardless of which \nsection of the country we are from.\n  Clearly there is potential in Ed-Flex, and I am hopeful that the \nexpansion we are enacting today will lead to more and better \ninnovations in our States to improve schools. I am very pleased that \nthe final legislation before us today includes several provisions which \nI believe will lead the States to use this authority more and to use it \nappropriately to improve the performance of our schools.\n  I am particularly pleased that language Senator Kennedy and I \noffered, improving the link between flexibility and accountability for \nstudent performance, is retained. Senator Reed of Rhode Island's \nlanguage on community and parental involvement in the process of \napplying for these waivers will, I believe, result in much stronger \napplications.\n  In addition, I believe the provisions protecting the targeting \nFederal dollars to the neediest students, offered by our colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, who fought tirelessly on behalf of that \nprovision to see to it that the neediest of our students would \ncertainly be the principal beneficiaries of his program. He worked, I \nknow, with Congressman George Miller of California on this, who has a \ndeep interest in this subject matter and is very knowledgeable about \nthese issues as well. I commend them for their efforts. This will \nensure that States and local communities continue to serve, as I said, \nthe neediest of our population.\n  Finally, and most importantly, I am pleased that the conference \ncommittee preserved our commitment to lowering class size by removing \nthe divisive language that pitted class size reduction against funding \nfor special education. However, even with these changes, I believe the \nmeasure before us is a modest one--a good one but a modest one. I view \nit as a first step, if only a modest one, in the direction of stronger \neducation policy.\n  I am very hopeful that we can now move onto bigger education issues. \nNot to belittle the importance some have placed on education \nflexibility, but I have never had one parent, one teacher, or one \nstudent raise this issue with me. But I have had many, many parents, \nstudents, and teachers concerned about class size. I have had school \ndistricts looking for reassurance that the full promise of 100,000 \nteachers will reach them. I have had many parents and teachers and \nstudents concerned about the overcrowding and the overall condition of \nschools in my State and across the country.\n  I have had numerous inquiries about the safety of children in school, \nand obviously the events in Littleton, CO, punctuate that concern, but \nit is one that all of us hear every day, regardless of what State we \nare from.\n  As well, Mr. President, parents and teachers and students raise \nconcerns about how many children start school not ready to learn. Many \nstudents go home to empty houses without supervision or the enrichment \nof afterschool programs. That issue is raised by parents who have young \nchildren all the time. Lastly, they raise concerns that the needs in \nour schools outpace the Federal funding in this crucial area. We must \nmove to these pressing issues as well.\n  Ed-Flex can make a difference in some States, but it cannot \nsubstitute for real education policy, broad policy. I look forward to \nbuilding on the success of this bill and looking for the kinds of \nbipartisanship that created this legislation, and to assist in coming \nup with some answers that will make a difference on class size, school \nsafety, afterschool programs, and condition of school buildings, which \nalso must be a critical part--each one--of improving the quality of \neducation and preparing this new generation of Americans to be the kind \nof leaders we all want them to be in the coming century. I thank my \ncolleague from Minnesota for allowing me to express my views.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't know that I have anything to \nadd to what other Senators have said about the awfulness and terror of \nwhat happened in Colorado. I really don't know--as Senator Dodd and \nSenator Hutchinson have said--what this means in personal terms. I \nsimply say to Senators Nighthorse Campbell and Allard and the people of \nColorado, as the Senator from Minnesota, I send my prayers, my love and \nsupport. I wish to God that it was within my ability to snap my \nfingers, or to be able do something to have prevented this from ever \nhappening. I wish I could understand how kids--children--could ever do \nthis. I actually don't know the answer.\n  I certainly agree with colleagues who have talked about measures that \ntry to make it as difficult as possible for kids to get ahold of guns. \nI do a lot of work in the mental health area. I know it can't do any \nharm--it can only do good--to see whether we can do better by way of \nworking with kids at a young age, and maybe we can head off kids that \nare heading in this direction. When such a God-awful act of violence is \ncommitted, it is very difficult to understand why. It is very difficult \nto understand why. I suppose that anything and everything that can be \nbetter in a family, should be better in families and better in \ncommunities and better in churches and synagogues and mosques, and in \nlegislation that would pass. But for today, I just want to, as a \nSenator from Minnesota, express my sorrow. I wish yesterday had never \nhappened.\n  Mr. President, I find myself in the position of speaking against this \nconference report. My colleagues have talked about some things that \nhappened in conference committee that they felt were positive, and I \nagree with them. I am going to divide my argument up into two parts. \nPart 1 is sort of to say, I think there is a distinction between \nflexibility, and I think--having been a community organizer for several \ndecades, I think that the more people are able to make positive things \nhappen at the local and community level, including the school district \nlevel, the better. So I think when it comes to the title I program, you \nreally do want decisions about whether or not you put more of the money \ninto teaching assistants, or into community outreach, or into other \nthings--many of those decisions to be made at the local level.\n  I will tell you why I think this Ed-Flex bill legislation is a \nprofound mistake--however well-intentioned those who are proposing it \nand who have fought for it are, like Senator Wyden here on the floor; \nit is just an honest difference of opinion. If I am wrong, I will be \nglad to be wrong. My own feeling is that this piece of legislation will \nactually be a step backward. The reason I say that is that when we \npassed\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act back in 1965, a lot of sweat \nand tears went into that.\n  Part of the idea then and over the years--we are talking about a 30-\nyear history here, 30 years plus--is that you wanted to have certain \ncore requirements, certain core standards that had to be met. And in \nparticular, we wanted to make sure that, as a national community, we \nmade a commitment to poor children and that there were certain kinds of \ncore standards that every school district in the land had to meet in \nthis title I program.\n  So I introduced an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill in which I took the \nbasic core requirements and I said, look, under no circumstances are we \ngoing to enable a State to allow a school district to be exempt from \nthe following requirements. Let me just read these. This is incredible, \nwhat happened on the floor of the Senate. That is why I am going to be \nthe only vote against it, though I wish others would vote against it. \nWhat were these core standards that would not be waivable? They are: \nProvide opportunities for all children to meet changing achievement \nlevels--I will list a few. Provide instruction by highly qualified \nprofessional staff. Provide professional development for teachers and \naides to enable all children in the school to meet the State student \nperformance standards. Review on an ongoing basis the progress of \nparticipating children, and revise the program, if necessary, to \nprovide more assistance to children, to enable them to meet the State \nstudent performance standards.\n  This amendment just said, when it comes to the basic core \nrequirements and core protection of title I for all children in \nAmerica, the heart and soul of what we did with title I, going back to \n1965, we weren't going to waive these. No, we weren't, because we were \ngoing to make sure that these title I children--even if they are low-\nincome children, we were going to make sure they were going to get good \ninstruction and make sure that every title I program in every school \ndistrict at least lived up to these standards. Now we have a piece of \nlegislation, with all due respect to all of my colleagues, that allows \na State to allow its school district to exempt itself from these \nrequirements.\n\n  I introduced this amendment which would have straightened out this \nlegislation. It was basically a party vote; it was a straight party \nvote, really. I am sorry I didn't get more support from Republicans. I \nam really sorry more Democrats aren't voting against this bill. That is \njust my own honestly held view.\n  Here is what is so troubling about this. I will try not to be \ntechnical. What would have been the harm in keeping these core \nrequirements? Surely, I can tell you the school districts in Minnesota \nwould say, fine, keep that core requirement because this is what we \nwant to do and this is what we do.\n  Why would this core requirement be considered overly bureaucratic or \ncumbersome or regulatory for any school district in America? The idea \nthat you have highly qualified instruction and you hold children to \nhigh standards and you do everything you can to make sure children meet \nthese standards, why would any school district want to be exempt from \nthe core requirements of the title I program? My argument would be that \nthey would not. This would not be a problem--unless you have the \npotential for abuse. And you do. That is what is going to happen. We \nhave moved away from a kind of value which says that we, as a Nation, \nhave certain kinds of core commitments and beliefs, and one of them is \nthat we are going to make sure there is protection and some commitment \nto poor children in America when it comes to education.\n  This piece of legislation called Ed-Flex does away with that basic \ncommitment. That is why I will vote against this. That is why I will be \nproud to be one to vote against this.\n  Mr. President, my second point is a little different. I am going to \nsay this with not bitterness but with some anger. I just want people in \nthe country to know as I get a chance to speak before the Senate, every \ntime I get a chance to speak, I think I am really lucky. I am one of \n100 people who gets a chance to speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nI get to say what I believe is right. I try to marshal evidence from my \npoint of view.\n  I want people in our country to know that not only is this piece of \nlegislation, I think, not a step forward but a great leap backward; it \nalso is a great leap sideways.\n  When I am in schools and I meet with students and I meet with \nparents--I have been in a school about every 2 weeks for the last 8 \nyears since I was elected to the Senate. I have been in inner-city \nschools. I have been in rural schools. I have been in suburban schools. \nI don't meet parents and children or students who talk to me about Ed-\nFlex. They do not even know what it is. They don't even know what it \nis. They talk about, ``Senator, this school is crumbling. This school \nis not an inviting place for us to be. Can't there be some Federal \ndollars that will enable us to rebuild our crumbling schools?'' Or, \n``Senator, you had better believe that with smaller classes teachers \ncould spend more time with us. And the best teachers are teachers who \nspend time with us.''\n  Where is the commitment to smaller classes?\n  Or, ``Senator, you want to know the best single thing you could do. \nYou could make sure that somehow we would address this learning gap,'' \nwhere so many kids come to school already way behind having never \nreally had the opportunity to have been read to widely, to have really \nreceived that kind of intellectual stimulation with the absence of \naffordable child care, or so little of it is available and they come to \nschool behind. Then they fall further behind. Then they drop out. And \nthen they wind up in prison.\n  Again, I hope I am right about this. I am trying to oversimplify it. \nBut I believe--I read it, I think, in the New York Times, or \nsomewhere--that in the State of California, I think between the ages of \n18 to 26, there are five times as many African American young men in \nprison than in college. That is stunning.\n  Let's not hype this legislation. Let's not pretend like we have done \nsomething great which will lead to the dramatic or positive improvement \nin the lives of children.\n  There is not one cent more for title I. Let me just tell you. In my \nState of Minnesota, we have schools there where 65 percent of the kids \nare low income, free or reduced lunch program participants. And they \ndon't get any title I money. They have run out of the money.\n  All over the country there are schools with a huge percentage of kids \nwho could use the additional reading instruction, who could use the \nadditional encouragement.\n  The title I program does great things. There is a lot of good work \nbeing done.\n  I assume my other colleagues did this. I met with title I teachers \nand title I parents. I met with kids around the State of Minnesota. \nThere is a lot of good work being done.\n  Does Ed-Flex add $1 to a program that is severely underfunded? No. Do \nyou want to know what is worse? We are not going to, not with this \nbudget that we have.\n  Let's be clear about this. This program, according to Rand \nCorporation, is funded at about the 50-percent level. I think the \nCongressional Research Service said it is at about the 33-percent \nlevel.\n  Given the budget resolution that we have and 10 years of tax cuts, we \nwill see who gets the major benefit. And with the money put aside for \nSocial Security and reducing the debt, do you think there is going to \nbe any money that is going to go into increased funds for title I? No. \nDoes this piece of legislation do anything by way of making child care \nmore affordable? No. Does it do anything about the Head Start program? \nNo. The Head Start Program has served--I can't even remember now. I had \nthe figure. I spoke to a national gathering in Minnesota, a great group \nof people. I think the Head Start Program has served maybe 17 million \nchildren since 1965.\n  Do you know that the Head Start Program, the goal of which is to give \na head start to kids who come from impoverished backgrounds, isn't even \nfunded at a 50-percent level? Do you know that with Early Head Start, \nMr. President, which is ages under 3, 3 and under, the most important \nyears for development, do you know how many of the 3 million children \nwho are eligible for some Head Start help so they\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nget a head start and do better, do you know how much funding we have \nfor them? One percent.\n  I would love it if somebody would come out here on the floor of the \nSenate--I would actually give up the rest of my time--and say, ``You \nare wrong, Paul. Given the budget resolution that we passed, we are \ngoing to be committing more money to Early Head Start. We are going to \nbe committing huge amounts of money to making sure there is good child \ncare for children before kindergarten.''\n\n  We are not going to do it at all. In fact, with this budget, we will \nprobably end up cutting it before it is all over.\n  Mr. President, here is where we can be a player. We can have Ed-Flex. \nI think it is a big step backward. I have explained why. I don't know \nwhy colleagues are not willing to make this standard. We shouldn't \nallow a State to allow a school district to waive it.\n  There is a real danger here. We are taking away some protection for \npoor children. We are doing that. That is not a step forward.\n  Frankly, if we want to be a player, when you talk to your people back \nin your States, especially when you are talking to the people who are \ninvolved in public education, they say you can be a player in \nprekindergarten. You, the Federal Government, could, out of your huge \nGovernment budget, be allocating some resources back to our communities \nfor affordable child care, to fully fund Head Start. You could make a \nhuge difference so that children come to kindergarten ready to learn \nand do better. We are not going to do it. We are going to pass \nsomething called Ed-Flex and pretend like this is some great step \nforward.\n  This applies perhaps more to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle than my colleague from Oregon, who is constantly committed to \nmore funding. He has a strong commitment to more funding for these \nprograms.\n  I want to be real clear about what we are doing and not doing today. \nI don't want us to get away with a piece of legislation that we pass \nthat is heralded as some great step forward when we don't really do \nwhat we should be doing.\n  Mr. President, we talk about law enforcement. Talk to the community \npeople, and they tell you everywhere that there are too many kids who \ncome from families where both parents are working, or where a single \nparent is working. There are no after-school programs with positive \nthings for them to do. There are not the community programs, the \ncommunity-based programs. I hear it everywhere.\n  In this budget, which is going to lead to these appropriations bills, \nare we going to make any kind of major investment of resources so we \nare going to have some of these afterschool programs, some of this \nafterschool care for kids for children? No. Are there first and second \nand third graders who go home and there is no one there after school, \nsometimes in very dangerous neighborhoods? Yes, there are. I have met \nwith them. Are there kids who go home and don't play outside even when \nit is a beautiful day because their parents tell them, ``Go home, lock \nthe door, don't take any phone calls?'' Yes. Are we doing anything in \nthe Senate about making any kind of investment of resources? Is the \nmajority party doing that? No.\n  There was a woman named Fannie Lou Hamer. I wished I could have met \nher. She was a great civil rights activist from Mississippi. Fannie Lou \nHamer said once, ``I am so sick and tired of being sick and tired.'' I \nam sick and tired of photo opportunity politics. I am sick and tired of \nthe breed of political person who wants to have their picture taken \nnext to children, and how we all say we are for education. We all say \nwe are for children. I look at the White House budget. They are \npathetic. I look at our budget; the majority party's is even worse. I, \nfrankly, see very little commitment to making sure that we have equal \nopportunity for every child in America.\n\n  This Ed-Flex bill doesn't do one thing to provide equal opportunity \nfor every child in America. Worse, and let me repeat it, we could have \nhad all the flexibility in the world, but for some reason when it came \nto the basic core protections and core requirements of the title I \nprogram--making sure there are highly qualified instructional staff, \nmaking sure kids are held to high standards, making sure we help the \nkids who are falling behind--my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle didn't want to have this basic core requirement. Without that \ncore requirement, we don't have that core protection.\n  I will finish my remarks in both a positive way and in a not-so-\npositive way. I want to again say to the title I teachers and the title \nI education people in Minnesota--I spent more time with them--I deeply \nappreciate the work being done and I do not want a misinterpretation of \nmy vote against this bill as not being in support of your work.\n  Let me read some wonderful testimonials from students, parents and \nteachers at the Garfield Elementary School in Brainerd, MN.\n\n       I love reading really much. When I grow up I'm gonna be a \n     teacher. When I'm a teacher, I'm gonna read a lot of books to \n     my children. When in college, I'm gonna read tons of books \n     and books. Right now I'm in second grade.\n       This class has helped me with reading and writing. I like \n     this class because it's fun and I'm 10 going on 11.\n\n  Some of the spelling is not perfect but the sentiment is wonderful.\n\n       Reading and writing help you get a job. Make that a good \n     job. My favorite thing that we've done is when we're drawing \n     a picture and characters from our book. I like the 5 minute \n     word tests. My highest score was 28 and I'm smart.\n\n  I love it when children believe they are something. That is good. \nThat is the way it should be.\n  Here is a statement from an educational assistant at Garfield School:\n\n       To whom it may concern: Every fall at the start of the new \n     school year I get my list of title I children that need a \n     little extra help in the classroom. I know I can help them. \n     Every spring when the school year ends, I know I have helped \n     these children. I know title I works when the light bulb goes \n     on after that child gets that math problem we have been \n     working on. I know that title I works when that child is \n     reading and understands what he reads. They can write a story \n     that makes sense.\n       Please keep the money for title I just for title I. Title I \n     money pays for my job, but it is also something very dear to \n     my heart. When I see a child get it, I know it works.\n\n  Mr. President, all over the United States of America there are \nschools with 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent low-income children that don't \nget any title I money because we have so severely underfunded this \nprogram. This legislation does not increase one dime, and we are not \ngoing to increase one dime for title I--not given this budget that we \nhave.\n  In addition, when it comes to how we as a nation can renew and live \nup to our vow that there will be equal opportunity for every child in \nAmerica, it is not here in this legislation. It is not here to make \nsure that the children come to kindergarten ready to learn. It is not \nhear to rebuild crumbling schools. It is not here for smaller class \nsizes. It is not here to make sure we have better teachers. It is not \nhere to make sure that we do better on after school programs. It is not \nhere to make sure there is affordable housing. It is not here for child \nnutrition programs. It is not here at all. And I want to say on the \nfloor of the Senate, I don't believe it will be here in this Senate. I \ndon't think the majority party will move on this agenda. Sometimes I \nworry a little bit about my party, as well.\n\n  I will be the only vote against this legislation. If I am wrong, I am \nsure my colleagues--Senator Wyden and Senator Jeffords, both good \nSenators, real good Senators--will tell me a few years from now, You \nwere mistaken. By not keeping that language in on the core \nrequirement--that is what I am focused on. We didn't create any \nloophole. We didn't take a step backwards. This legislation didn't fail \npoor children.\n  If they can tell me I'm wrong, I will be glad to be wrong. Today I \nshall vote no. Today I shall wonder why more colleagues aren't voting \nno. Today I sound the alarm that I believe this piece of legislation is \nprofoundly mistaken.\n  That is my honest view. I am sorry to be so critical of my \ncolleagues' proposal because I respect their work, but I cannot support \nthis legislation.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Emilia\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nBeskind be allowed floor privileges during the duration of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota for 10 \nminutes to address some of the important issues the Senator raised.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield 10 minutes to my colleague.\n  I have to meet with students from Minnesota. I will try to get a \nchance to respond, but I may have to respond at a later point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I think he has raised a number of important issues and several that I \nagree with. During my 3 years in the Senate, I have consistently \nstated, along with the Senator from Minnesota, that we must do more. It \nis a moral imperative that we do more in terms of the Head Start \nProgram, child care programs, and the variety of domestic needs that \nthe Senator from Minnesota is talking about. To build support in \nAmerica for additional funding for those programs, we ought to go to \ntaxpayers and show them that with programs such as Ed-Flex we are \nsqueezing more value out of the existing $12 billion that we are \nspending.\n  There is no quarrel between the Senator from Minnesota and I about \nthe need for additional funding for these programs. It is absolutely \nessential. We also happen to agree about eliminating some of the tax \nboondoggles and get the money. But, if we are going to get support from \nthe American people for additional funding, it seems to me we ought to \npass the bipartisan Ed-Flex bill and show that we are squeezing \nexisting value out of the current spending, get dollars out of \nbureaucracy and get them into the classroom.\n\n  The one point I would differ with my friend from Minnesota on, and I \nam happy to discuss this with him, is that in the weeks and weeks that \nwe have been debating on the floor of the Senate, there has not been \none example given of how much this program has been abused in the past. \nThis program is operating in 12 States in the country in countless \ncommunities, and we are told now we are taking a step backwards with \nrespect to this program though there has not been one example put \nbefore the Senate of how this program is being abused.\n  We have plenty of examples of how it works. The fact is, there is one \nvery close to this Capitol Building. Just a few miles from here in \nHoward County, for example, they have reduced class size by one half. \nThey did not do that by spending extra dollars. You already heard the \nSenator from Minnesota and I agree on that point. We ought to spend \nadditional funds to reduce class size. But a few miles from here they \nhave reduced class size with existing funds.\n  So we have examples of how this program works. Yet we are told this \nis a big step backwards while there has not been one example, not one, \nof how this program has been abused though it has been in place since \n1994 in 12 States. It does not change any of the core requirements of \ntitle I--civil rights laws, labor laws, safety laws; all the things \nthat are important for vulnerable children, that the Senator from \nMinnesota and I agree on, are kept in place. What this is going to do, \nas it did in my home State of Oregon, is make it possible for poor \nkids, who could not get advanced computing because of Federal redtape, \nto use Ed-Flex so they can get those skills and get the high-wage, \nhigh-skilled jobs the Senator from Minnesota and I want to see poor \nkids get.\n  I am very hopeful we will see overwhelming support today for this \nlegislation. I think by showing you can use existing dollars more \neffectively, this is going to lay the groundwork for the objective the \nSenator from Minnesota and I would like to see, which is additional \nsupport for Head Start, child care programs, domestic programs.\n  I look forward, after we pass Ed-Flex and after it works, not talking \nabout who is wrong between the Senator from Minnesota and I, but \ntalking about how we can join together and get additional support for \nHead Start, child care programs, and these domestic needs, because we \ncan go to the American taxpayer and show that, with Ed-Flex, we use \nexisting dollars in a more efficient way so we build more credibility \nwith them for domestic services.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague towards those ends. I \nthank him for giving me the time. He feels strongly about it. I do as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Oregon. I just wanted for the record on this debate on \nexamples--before, my colleague, Senator Kennedy, was speaking about \npast abuses, abuses of title I money. As to what has happened with \nthose States, part of the Ed-Flex States, he was talking just about the \nabuse of title I money in the past, not talking about abuse of Ed-Flex \nStates.\n  What we are talking about now is, we do not know. When we look at \nwhat GAO has said, the results are inconclusive one way or the other, \nand for that reason we should have waited and done this during the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization. I will quote \nfrom the GAO report:\n\n       While some States have put in specific goals (such as \n     improving student achievement in math and science) and \n     established clear and measurable objectives for evaluating \n     the impact of waivers (such as improving average test scores \n     by a certain number of points) many Ed-Flex states have not \n     established any goals or have defined only vague objectives.\n\n  That is only one example. I can go on. This is a rather longer quote \nin this report as well.\n  Actually I think Senator Wyden is probably the wrong Senator for me \nto be having this debate with. The point is, No. 1, GAO expresses some \nconcern about what could happen. The results are not conclusive one way \nor the other. But more important, why not--you voted for the amendment. \nI would have voted for this bill if we had just erred on the side of \nthese children. Why not keep in that core provision? If we do not have \nto worry about States abusing this, if we do not have to worry about \nStates not having this commitment to children, then surely this \nlanguage which talked about making sure they are good teachers, making \nsure kids are held to high standards, making sure if they are not, we \nare going to give them the instruction they need--why would any school \ndistrict want to waive that? Why would we not have kept that?\n  I would be willing to say that Arkansas and Minnesota and Oregon and \nVermont and the State of Washington school districts would say, ``Keep \nit in, that is what we are about.'' Why was it taken out? And why, when \nI introduced this amendment--this goes to the heart, the core, of the \nstandards of the protection--was this taken out? That is the problem.\n  When we had the vote on this language, you voted for it, Senator \nWyden. I am sure Senator Lincoln voted for it and Senator Murray voted \nfor it. I don't know what Senator Jeffords did. But that is my point.\n  So, in all due respect, it is not true that we do not have evidence \nof some problems. We have plenty from the past. As to the Ed-Flex \nStates, I just read from the GAO report. And then I had an amendment. I \nsay to my colleague over there, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, that \nwould have kept in the basic core protection. I do not think it would \nhave been a problem for Vermont or any other State. It should not have \nbeen taken out, because just by chance, Senator Wyden, just by chance, \nwhat if someplace, somewhere in the country, some of these kids fell \nbetween the cracks? Their parents did not have the most clout and there \nwas some investment of title I money in areas where it did not really \nmake a difference in these kids' lives. It should not have happened. We \nwould not have the protection. Why would we not want to err on the side \nof these children? Why would we not want to err on the side of core \nrequirements? That is my point.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 20 minutes \nbe added to the time, divided equally, 10 minutes a side, between \nSenator Kennedy and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on that time, no one could talk about \neducation today without thinking of the tragedy yesterday in Colorado. \nAs Members have expressed their sorrow over yesterday's events and the \nfive earlier school tragedies, the same question comes to everyone's \nlips: What can we do to prevent this from happening again?\n  The contribution of the Federal Government towards State schools has \nbeen defined in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act. It has always been \nmy intention, as a part of the hearings being held by the Health and \nEducation Committee toward reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, that I would hold hearings especially examining the Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools Act.\n  So, to those who have asked me today what is the Federal Government \ndoing, or what can we do, I want to inform my colleagues that the \nHealth and Education Committee will have hearings addressing the \nproblem of drugs and violence in schools and I will hold the first \nhearing early next month.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes from the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to discuss \npassage of the first education legislation of the 106th Congress. My \nsincere hope is that this is only the first step in bipartisan \nagreement about the path we are traveling toward improving America's \nschools.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act itself is not an earth-\nshaking proposal. Essentially, for a set of provisions under a list of \nFederal programs, school districts will be able to get waivers from \ntheir States instead of having to ask Secretary Riley. Since Secretary \nRiley grants these waivers fairly routinely, some might ask why we need \nthis bill. There has been so much talk about the great things this bill \ncontains that I just want to clarify what we are talking about.\n  Within the bill, we are not reducing paperwork or bureaucracy or cost \nor time spent away from the classroom. You will hear from some of my \ncolleagues that this bill does all those things and probably many other \nclaims. To some people, Ed-Flex has become the great tonic that will \nfix all the ailments of our schools.\n  I want you to notice something that Senator Frist has mentioned that \nI agree with. Ed-Flex is not a silver bullet or a panacea. It will not \nsolve all the challenges our schools face.\n  The important part of the message that does not always get through is \nthat no effort in the Congress or in your local school is that silver \nbullet or that panacea. The problems that affect today's schools, as we \nsaw yesterday in Colorado, are never easy to solve. They are always \nmore complex than a sound bite. Always.\n  Each part of the American school community, from classroom to \ncommittee room, must do its part. Every student, every family, every \neducator, every community leader, every local school board, every State \ngovernment, and every national policymaker--all of us must do what we \ncan.\n  The language of the Ed-Flex bill does not really provide any direct \nrelief to any of these problems. All it really does is say that in \naddition to asking Secretary Riley for a waiver from a provision of a \nFederal program, you can now ask your State officials.\n  So why would someone like me, someone who is a parent, a preschool \nteacher, a former school board member, why would I come to the Senate \nChamber and proclaim that we should pass the Ed-Flex bill? Because it \ncan help change thinking, and that is a vital and important goal.\n  Education flexibility is an important idea and concept. If, by \npassing this expansion of the education flexibility program, we can \nchange the thinking in just one community about what steps they can \ntake to improve their local public school, then that is a major \nvictory.\n  Too many local decisions, things that would directly improve the \nlearning of hundreds of children, are stopped before they get started. \nThe message this Congress needs to say to local communities is, if you \nhave a proven, effective way to improve learning for your students and \nyou have your community behind you and you are willing to be held \naccountable for the results, we should be doing everything we can to \nget the obstacles out of your way.\n  Sometimes the obstacle is a Federal law or regulation. Sometimes the \nobstacle is a State law or a State regulation. Sometimes the obstacle \nis a local school board policy that needs to be changed. Sometimes the \nobstacle is the bus schedule or the school lunch schedule or the sports \nschedule. Sometimes, believe it or not, the obstacle to improvement \ndoes not have anything to do with education law or with government at \nall.\n  Whatever the obstacles are, we all have a responsibility to do what \nis best for the students by holding the school accountable and helping \nthem get the obstacles out of the way.\n  My belief is that we should all be thanking Senator Wyden and Senator \nFrist, Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords for giving us an \nopportunity with this bill to help change thinking across this Nation, \nto remind communities that they have more power than they know to make \nimprovements in their schools, and to say in a meaningful way that \ntheir Federal Government is their partner in making their best schools \nbetter or in helping their struggling schools to thrive.\n  There are plenty of great schools and plenty of great thinking out \nthere right now without any further action on our part. But this bill \nwill encourage the discussion that is happening at every local school \nabout how to improve student learning and how to get even our best \nschools performing at higher levels. Great thinking alone will not do \nit.\n\n  That brings me back to my statement that although the Ed-Flex bill is \nthe first education bill in this Congress, it cannot be the last, \nbecause what local school communities need more than flexibility are \nthe resources and support to do something positive with it.\n  The Ed-Flex bill alone will not give your students more individual \nattention in the classroom. The Ed-Flex bill alone will not stop up a \nleak in your school's roof, unless it is a very small one. The Ed-Flex \nbill alone will not improve teacher training or any number of other \nimportant issues that real people across this Nation have to deal with \nevery day, which is why it is important for me and many of my \ncolleagues to start the larger debate about education with this bill.\n  We know we will not have many opportunities this year. This Congress \nmust continue to address the very real needs of school communities. The \npublic school is a powerful engine for social improvement and equity of \nopportunity. Millions of Americans have created lives that were \nmeasurably better in all ways than that of their parents because of \nsomething they learned in a public school.\n  As communities continue to update and improve and redesign their own \npublic schools to meet the changing needs of our economy and society, \nthey will need a very real, measurable investment from the other \nmembers of this great community we call our Nation.\n  We must continue our important national investment in reducing class \nsize by helping communities to hire 100,000 well-trained, high-quality \nteachers. We must do everything we can to improve the professional \ndevelopment and ongoing education of our teachers to make sure they are \nready for each challenge they face with each student each day they \nenter the classroom.\n  We must use every tax bill this year as a vehicle to help school \ncommunities modernize their school buildings and technology \ncapabilities.\n  None of these, nor the many other important investments we should \nmake, should be seen as a silver bullet or a panacea. But when you give \nlocal communities the freedom from regulation that we continue by \nexpanding the education flexibility program today, and then combine \nthat flexibility with the very real investment in the communities' \nability to hire good people, to improve school buildings, to pay for \nimprovements to the teaching process, and to choose the very best \neducational tools possible, then you are doing\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nsomething really big, then we are talking about a major investment in \nour Nation's future which will pay off for us in many ways--reduced \ncrime, more economic opportunity for people, the improved well-being of \nour neediest citizens, better citizenship, stronger communities with an \nimproved quality of life for all of us.\n  That is why I and my colleagues have come to the debate on the Ed-\nFlex bill and also talked about the other important national \ninvestments we must make and continue to make in our schools.\n  In the process, there have arisen some threats to that overall, more \nimportant national effort. There was an amendment to this bill that \nwould have undone the very important, vital, bipartisan agreement we \nall came to last year in helping communities reduce class size. If that \namendment had prevailed, we would have seen communities--communities \nthat are now struggling to put together their budgets for next year--we \nwould have seen them forced to make some very ugly choices in school \nboard meetings that already have enough disagreement and contention.\n\n  The good news is, that amendment which would have forced school \ndistricts to pit special education and regular education students \nagainst each other has been dropped. In its place, we have bipartisan \nlanguage which will allow more flexibility to the very small school \ndistricts who have already reduced class size. That is progress.\n  This year, we can have the opportunity to debate class size reduction \nand many other efforts to improve communities' abilities to improve \ntheir schools. My hope is that we take that opportunity. My hope is \nthat we have a full discussion and make some compromises and get to \nfurther progress.\n  Passing the Ed-Flex bill is a good first step. Continuing with our \neffort to leverage class size reduction across the Nation will be a \ngood next step because school boards are making those decisions now. \nMoving forward on school construction this year will be another good \nmove.\n  Increasing funding for special education by at least $500 million \nwill be another step towards progress. Improving the resources \ncommunities have to improve teacher training will be progress. We \nshould reauthorize the elementary and secondary school bill this year, \njust as we are scheduled to do.\n  We must continue talking and working. It is what the American people \nexpect of us. It is our responsibility.\n  We must increase flexibility and resources at the same time. People \nwant their schools to have the freedom to act and the funds to pay for \nit. Most people are, frankly, shocked by the fact that less than 2 \npercent of our overall national spending goes to education. We must \nmake that a higher priority. We have started our work. Now let's \ncontinue and do our part in the great partnership we call America's \npublic schools.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague for \nyielding.\n  It certainly is ironic that we should be scheduled to vote on \neducation legislation today in the wake of last night's tragedy in \nColorado. All of the Nation is wondering how we can help our children.\n  Since a school shooting a year ago in my home State of Arkansas, I \nhave been grappling with ideas to ensure that this type of tragedy \nnever happens again. Unfortunately, it did happen again yesterday when \nthe peacefulness of a Denver, CO, suburb was shattered by the sounds of \nexplosions and gunfire.\n  The first line of defense against the terrible television images that \nwe have seen over and over during the last 24 hours, and all too often \nduring the last year, is guidance and love in the home. Parents must \ntake responsibility for their children. And we, as a society, must do \nall that we can to provide the support our children need.\n\n  Our children are truly our greatest national resource. We must make \ntheir education a national priority. In order to do this, our teachers \nneed help, too.\n  Each year our Nation's educators are asked to wear more than one hat, \nto take on more roles--all the while teaching our most precious \nresource. They make sacrifices every day, and quite literally in some \ninstances have put their lives on the line for the safety of our \nchildren.\n  I do not claim to have all of the answers, but I do think we should \nprovide more assistance to our teachers in identifying troubled \nchildren and giving them skills to deal with these students. One of the \nsingle common denominators I get from school principals in K through 3 \nelementary grades is that they must have more resources in their \nschools, more medical professionals to deal with the severity of \nproblems that our young children are coming to school with today.\n  We have to give the teachers and the administrators the support and \ntrust necessary to guide our children when we cannot be there. And \nfinally, we must put more counselors and qualified medical health \nprofessionals in our schools as resources for teachers and \nadministrators.\n  Yes, we can install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in \nschools, but we will not get to the root of the problem. The youth of \nAmerica are suffering, and all of the increased security in the world \nmay ease our minds but it will not ease their pain.\n  I plan to work with the Senate Education Committee on school \ncounseling and mental health legislation so that we can take proactive, \ncommonsense steps toward seeing that tragedies such as those in \nColorado and Jonesboro, AR, become only a distant, painful memory.\n  But we are here today to move forward in the field of education. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of the Ed-Flex bill. I am pleased \nthat both sides could reach an agreement in conference so we can \nproceed to final passage of S. 280.\n  Although this process has taken longer than most of us wanted, there \nis a silver lining in this cloud. The Ed-Flex bill has given the Senate \nthe opportunity to talk seriously and comprehensively about education--\none of the most important issues facing our country.\n  It is absolutely essential that we continue that debate in the \nSenate. I have a county in southwest Arkansas where our superintendent \nmade it an obligation to his school district that within 3 years he \nwould minimize the size of K through 3 grades to well below 18 students \nper teacher. This school year they achieved that goal and have seen \nremarkable differences in their students.\n  Once the Ed-Flex bill passes, and States have greater flexibility \nwith Federal funds, we hope to see so much more of that. We still have \nlots of work to do to ensure that our children get a good education and \nthe best possible start in life.\n  Why? Because education is a national investment, with the highest \npossible return for which we could ask. The knowledge and training that \nwe provide our children are the tools that they will carry with them \nfor the rest of their lives. When we give them these tools, we have \nsuccessfully invested in the success of our workforce and the future of \nour country.\n  How do we accomplish this? First, let's talk about school \nconstruction and renovation.\n  As a product of Arkansas's public schools, I know they are not just \nbuildings where students and teachers spend their time; they are the \ncornerstones of our communities. And when a community works together to \nimprove its schools, everyone benefits.\n  We have to physically fix our schools that are crumbling. What kind \nof a message does it send to our children when we send them to a school \nthat has been allowed to literally fall apart? We have to devote the \nresources necessary to improving these situations.\n  School buildings also need to be adapted and equipped for computers \nthat are wired to the Internet. All of our Nation's children should be \nable to take advantage of technology and a ride on the information \nsuperhighway.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  In Arkansas, a recent survey of school facilities conducted by the \nArkansas Department of Education reports that facility maintenance is \none of the largest expenses for schools. The need for maintenance is \noften forgotten or overlooked, but in fact, the cost of roof repair or \nreplacement is one of the largest expenses that schools incur.\n  The study also indicates that 364 buildings are occupied beyond their \ncapacity. Some areas of the state are struggling to provide adequate \nfacilities to accommodate the student population growth. No one wants \nour children to study in make-shift classrooms. Portable buildings and \nmobile trailers don't serve children or teachers well.\n  As a Senator who represents a predominantly rural state, let me point \nout that we can't ignore our rural schools when we talk about school \nconstruction and renovation. I raised the needs of rural schools last \nweek on the Senate floor and will continue to do so as long as the \neducation debate continues. I look forward to working with Senator \nKennedy on the needs of rural schools as well as other Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who share my concern.\n  In addition to building new schools and renovating older ones, we \nmust reduce class size by hiring new teachers. Studies show that \nchildren learn better in smaller classrooms and teachers are able to do \na better job teaching children when they can devote more time to fewer \nchildren.\n  I have spent a lot of time talking with teachers in Arkansas. They \nare desperate for Federal assistance to help them reduce class size \nbecause a crisis is looming. Only 15 percent of the teachers in \nArkansas are under the age of 40.\n  This summer, Arkansas will receive $11.6 million as its first \ninstallment of funds to hire teachers to reduce class size in early \ngrades. Clearly, State educators are excited about this new pool of \nfunding to hire more teachers, but they are quick to point out that \nthey need commitments from Congress for additional funding to maintain \nthe new teachers in years 2 through 7. They simply don't have the funds \nto pay for these new teachers in years 2 through 7. What an important \nfield. But we also must encourage young adults to go into education.\n  Schools are now in the process of making hiring decisions for the \nfall. Let's make a commitment to this funding soon so school boards and \nprincipals can hire new teachers and promise them jobs for more than \njust one year.\n  I believe that as Senators, we can come together and do the right \nthing by our Nation's children, parents and educators. Let's take steps \nto end violence, reduce class size and rebuild our schools so America's \nchildren can thrive. Let us, in the Senate, not end our discussion on \neducation--our greatest national investment with this Ed-Flex bill, but \nlet us continue this discussion and truly make our children's education \na national priority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate and certainly add my support to the Ed-\nFlex bill. I encourage the rest of the Members of this body to continue \nthis debate on education throughout the next 2 years of this Congress.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the chairman \nfor yielding.\n  I am glad to join my colleague from Arkansas in supporting the Ed-\nFlex bill, also in joining all of my colleagues in our expressions of \ngrief for the families who are suffering such a loss in Colorado today. \nI have been struck, as I have listened to my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor. Time and time again words fail me to express the grief, the \nsorrow, that we all feel and really the lack of answers that we have.\n  As I presided a few moments ago, Mr. President, and listened to \nSenator Wellstone, he made the statement that if he could snap his \nfingers and somehow make yesterday not happen, he would do that. I \nthink all of us feel that way.\n  I would add that if we could somehow pass a law today, if we knew the \nsilver bullet, if we knew what it is that we could pass legislatively \nfrom Washington, DC, and put it in statutes, and that it would prevent \nthese kinds of tragedies from occurring, I think we would have a 100-0 \nvote this evening in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the solutions are not so simple. The answers are not \nso obvious. Perhaps it goes to the cheapening of life in our society. \nPerhaps it goes to the culture of violence that permeates so much of \nthe popular media today. I do not know all the answers, and perhaps \ntoday isn't the day to even talk about what the answers are or whether \nwe can do something from Washington, but certainly there is agreement \nthat it is a deep and shocking problem in our society. What is it in \nAmerica that allows this to happen?\n  I will join my colleagues in seeking to find answers and trying to \nmake this the kind of society where these tragedies are fewer and \nfewer.\n  I am glad to rise in support of the Ed-Flex bill. Certainly this is a \nstep in the right direction in education reform in our country.\n  The Ed-Flex program is about cutting the unnecessary strings attached \nto Federal education funds. It does not cede accountability. In fact, \nthe States must use the funds for the purpose intended; the money must \nremain targeted to the population it is designated to serve.\n  This bill, though, is recognition that when limited Federal funding \nis spread so thinly over such a wide area, the result is ineffective \nprograms that fail to provide students with the basic skills they need \nto succeed.\n  If we are to expect schools to increase their performance and provide \na better education for our children, then we must allow them to \ncoordinate school reform plans and to implement plans that coordinate \nprogram funds. We do not need to compartmentalize education, and this \nbill makes that coordination between programs easier.\n  In States such as Arkansas, where there are many small school \ndistricts, rural school districts that receive only small grants \nthrough various Federal programs, flexibility is the key. We must allow \nlocal school districts to decide how to spend Federal dollars in the \nway that will work for them, not the way that Washington tells them to \ndo it.\n  That is why, in addition to supporting this bill, I have introduced \nthe Dollars to the Classroom Act, which also gives more flexibility to \nlocal school districts. It would eliminate the bureaucracy and allow \nschools to continue the reform efforts that they have already started \nto implement.\n  Why do we think that Washington bureaucrats, who are over 1,100 miles \nfrom Arkansas school districts, can decide how to improve our \nchildren's education better than the parents, the teachers, the \nprincipals who live there?\n  We must give schools the tools that are necessary to let them address \nthe needs they are facing.\n  It is time to stop the one-size-fits-all approach to education, and \nallow those at the State and local level to decide what is best for \ntheir children. The problems facing Arkansas schools are not \nnecessarily the same as those facing schools in other parts of the \nNation. Ed-Flex allows States and local school districts to address \nthese problems without restrictions that can inhibit school reform.\n  If Congress expects improvement in our Nation's schools, then we must \nnot add any additional regulatory burdens that only create more \npaperwork for our teachers and principals. If we really want teachers \nto spend more time with their students, then we must cut the red tape \nthat occupies so much of their time.\n  In his testimony before the Senate Health and Education Committee on \nFebruary 23, as we well remember, Michigan Governor John Engler stated:\n\n       Many governors feel so strongly that the bureaucracy is the \n     problem that we cannot imagine being unable to improve \n     education with greater funding flexibility.\n\n  In fact, he and the 49 other Governors support this legislation, \nalong with the President and, most importantly, the teachers, the \nprincipals, the school boards and the administrators of this country.\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\n  The U.S. Department of Education's 1998 report to Congress on waivers \nstates:\n\n       Waiver authorities can be useful tools for promoting \n     improved student achievement and for promoting flexibility to \n     support local efforts to improve teaching and learning for \n     students.\n\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the Lott amendment regarding IDEA was \nremoved during conference.\n  The main objective of the Ed-Flex legislation is to give schools more \nflexibility. Allowing school districts more options in how to spend \ntheir federal dollars can only benefit those districts by giving them \ncontrol at the local level.\n  After talking with an administrator for the Class Size Reduction \nprogram in Arkansas, there are still several school districts who will \nchoose not to participate in this program because of excessive \nregulations. Many of the small- to medium-sized school districts in \nArkansas who have not yet reduced class size to 18 students per class \nwill choose not to go through the burdensome steps to form a consortia \nwith several other school districts for the hiring of only one teacher \nthat they must then share.\n  While this is an issue that we must continue to resolve, I am proud \nto have supported this legislation, and I hope that the education \ndebate that we have had in Congress will not end with the passage of \nthis piece of legislation. A significant amount of work remains in \nimproving our schools, and I look forward to further consideration of \nthis issue.\n  That is what this bill is about. That is why it has such broad \nsupport. Though we need to go much further, this is an important first \nstep in providing greater local flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment and then I am \nprepared to yield back my time. I guess the Senator from Minnesota \nstill wants to address the Senate. I yield myself a moment.\n  In my absence, our chairman has indicated that we will move forward \nand have some hearings about violence in schools for our Committee on \nEducation and Human Resources. I commend him for being willing to \nundertake that. I think that could be enormously important.\n  I do not think at the outset we are expecting the magical solution, \nbut I do think that we probably will get some very constructive ideas.\n  I can remember it wasn't long ago that several Members of the Senate \ngot together with the Attorney General and some of the parents from \nschools that had seen this kind of violence in the recent past. The \nparents had a number of ideas and recommendations and suggestions. I \nthink doing this in the formal setting of a committee hearing so that \nwe will have the record and have it kept and make it available to our \ncolleagues perhaps will be one of the most important things that we \nundertake in our committee--and we have many important things to \nundertake.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for his willingness on that and \nindicate that we are all looking forward to cooperating and working \nvery closely with the Chair in every way that we possibly can to hold \nmeaningful hearings and perhaps to help not just the families, but to \nhelp our country come to grips with at least the role of the school in \nthis whole process of young people's development and what we might be \nable to suggest that might be a constructive and useful idea.\n  We will not have all the answers, but maybe we will have some. I \nthink with that kind of commitment today, many of us feel at least the \nSenate is attempting to deal with this in an important way.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his thoughts.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to once again voice my \nsupport for the Education Flexibility Partnership Act or Ed-Flex. With \nthe passage of this important legislation, we are taking an important \nfirst step towards reducing the intrusive regulations and bureaucratic \nred tape the federal government imposes on local schools in Kansas and \naround the nation.\n  First, I would like to note that Ed-Flex legislation did not make it \nto this point without the combined efforts of a great many talented \npeople. I would like to commend and thank my colleagues Senators \nJeffords and Frist for their dedication to this legislation. I would \nalso like to thank our colleagues in the House and all of the staff \nthat have dedicated their time and ability to increasing flexibility \nfor school districts.\n  Mr. President, Ed-Flex is a truly significant piece of legislation. \nFor too long, the Federal Government, through the Department of \nEducation, has prevented local schools and school districts from \ncreating and implementing original programs custom designed to help \ntheir students learn. Ed-Flex provides local schools a chance to waive \nFederal regulations and statutes which prevent them from implementing \nthese innovative programs. We are sending an important message to \nteachers, parents and local school boards that we recognize that they \nknow best how to educate their students.\n  My home State of Kansas is one of the 12 States already covered under \nEd-Flex, and which have benefited from the waivers. Schools from across \nKansas have submitted 43 waiver requests, none of which have yet been \nrejected. To hear from the folks back home with whom I visited, \nstudents are much better served by flexibility than they are by rigid \nFederal mandates.\n  And Kansans aren't the only people who have supported our efforts to \nprovide more flexibility. Both the Senate and House versions of this \nbill passed with broad bi-partisan support. All fifty governors have \nendorsed Ed-Flex. In fact, even President Clinton agrees that Ed-Flex \nwill help to improve education in this country.\n  However, while Ed-Flex is an important first step towards relieving \nthe pressure of Federal mandates on local schools, it is still just the \nfirst step. Recognizing that the Federal Government is not best suited \nto set the rules under which we educate our students, we must continue \nto reduce the role of the Federal mandates in local education. The \ndemands on a school district in urban California are quite different \nfrom those on districts in rural Kansas--no less daunting--simply \ndifferent. We, as a body, must continue to move legislation which will \nallow those two districts to decide for themselves how best to educate \ntheir children.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report \non the Education Flexibility Partnership Act.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Conference Report contains my \namendment to ensure that parents have a strong voice in the Ed-Flex \nwaiver process. My amendment requires states and school districts to \nprovide public notice and comment opportunities to parents and other \ninterested members of the community before requesting waiver authority \nor waivers.\n  As an added accountability measure to ensure that parents and \ncommunities across the nation have confidence in the waiver process, my \namendment also requires states and school districts to submit these \ncomments along with their application to the Secretary or the state as \nappropriate.\n  Such requirements provide parents an opportunity to play an active \nrole in the waiver process, and, by doing so, empower them to help \ntheir children succeed in school.\n  I believe that it is extremely important for parents to be involved \nin their child's education. As the Center for Law and Education has \nnoted, ``when parents are involved at school, their children not only \ngo further, the schools become better for all children.''\n  Moreover, the implications of waiver requests are broad. Input and \nparticipation by parents and other interested members of our \ncommunities can only lead to more effective use of any waivers. Indeed, \nparents are more likely to be receptive to the waivers and work to see \nthat the goals intended by the waivers are achieved if they actually \nknow about the waivers; are involved in shaping the waivers; and have a \nreal stake in the waiver process.\n  With Ed-Flex, we have an opportunity to provide more flexibility to\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nenhance state and local education reform efforts. I am pleased that the \nConference Report recognizes the need to balance that flexibility with \naccountability by containing provisions that I worked on closely with \nSenators Kennedy and Dodd to ensure that the increased flexibility \nprovided to states and school districts is tied to strong \naccountability.\n  When we send scarce federal dollars to states and school districts, \nwe need to hold them accountable for results. Indeed, too many of our \nchildren do not get the education they deserve. Without accountability, \nwe will never reverse this situation.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the bipartisan commitment we \nmade last year to fund the class size reduction initiative is \nmaintained in the Conference Report. Indeed, the Republican attempt to \npit the needs of children with disabilities against the general student \npopulation is both counterproductive and destructive.\n  Lastly, I want to note that Ed-Flex alone is not going to turn around \nthe education of our children. Ed-Flex is one of the easier and less \ncomplex education issues we may consider this year. Now it is time to \nbegin the hard work of truly improving teacher quality, strengthening \nparental involvement, equipping our school libraries with up-to-date \nbooks, repairing and modernizing our schools, and reducing class size. \nThese initiatives are the hallmarks of real education reform--not \nslogans about block grants and vouchers.\n  Mr. President, the issue of education is one of the greatest \nchallenges facing our nation. There are no quick fixes. It is only \nthrough hard work and sensible reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act that we can begin to truly improve education.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act to speak in support of the \nconference report on this important legislation designed to improve the \nquality of our children's education.\n  This is a straightforward, bipartisan proposal with no budgetary \nimpact. It is endorsed by the governors of all fifty states. It will \ngive to every state the flexibility that twelve states have had for the \nlast five years--flexibility that will allow states and communities to \npursue innovative efforts for the improvement of K-12 education. We \nshould approve the conference report and take an important first step \ntoward returning the control of education to our states and local \ncommunities.\n  Opponents of education flexibility claim that it reduces the \naccountability of the states and will divert federal funds away from \nprograms that support low-income children. These arguments simply have \nno validity because of the safeguards we have written into the act. To \nbe eligible to participate in Ed-Flex, a state must have made \nsignificant progress toward developing and implementing challenging \nstandards for education content and performance for all of its \nstudents. Moreover, an Ed-Flex waiver can not exceed five years unless \nthe Secretary of Education determines the waiver has been effective in \nassisting schools in implementing education reforms.\n  It is not accountability that Ed-Flex eliminates; what Ed-Flex does \naway with is the direct federal control of local decisionmaking. The \nobjectives of federal education funding remain the same--improve the \nperformance of all students and all schools. Ed-Flex encourages and \nsupports the states and local school districts in developing innovative \nnew approaches to education reform and improvement. The intent of \nexisting education programs is preserved while the administrative \nburden on the states and local communities is lessened. States and \ncommunities will be allowed to tailor these programs to fit local needs \nand conditions. In short, the legislation we are now considering \nrecognizes that the people closest to our schools--our school board \nmembers, teachers, principals, and parents--are the best able to craft \nreforms that respond to local needs.\n  As pleased as I am to support this conference report, I am very \ndisappointed that it has eliminated the Senate's provision that would \nhave afforded local schools the choice of using the funds appropriated \nfor class-size reduction to pay for special education. Contrast the \nprogressive objectives of the Ed-Flex bill with this decision. Some \nmembers insisted on placing new federal requirements on local schools \nthrough a new categorical program at the same time we are moving toward \nmore local control through this bill. We need to move away from this \n``Washington knows best'' approach.\n  I am a strong supporter of public education and believe that the \nfederal government should increase its support for our schools. It \nshould realize this goal first by meeting its commitment to pay the \nfederal share of special education, not by creating new Washington-\ndriven programs. If we meet our obligation to pay forty percent of the \ncost of special education, millions of dollars of local education \ndollars will become available for the needs of education in every state \nand in every school district. These are dollars that can be spent on \nmore teachers--or on school construction, drop-out prevention, after \nschool programs, or on any other need a local school establishes as its \npriorities.\n  Clearly, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act is only the \nstarting point. We need to go much further in cutting the federal red \ntape that binds our local schools and hinders their ability to respond \nto the needs of their students. Giving schools greater flexibility must \nbe a major priority as we proceed with the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. I plan to take another step in \nthe direction of less federal control by introducing a bill to give \nsmall, rural schools greater flexibility in the way they use federal \neducation funding.\n  The federal government must help our local schools to improve their \nperformance. But control and management from Washington are not what is \nneeded. Extending the option of Ed-Flex to every state eases the \nfederal hold on our local schools. I urge my colleagues to approve the \nconference report that is before us today and to move forward in \nsupporting more local decision-making as we reauthorize the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act later in this Congress.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my support for the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act conference report. I commend the \nconferees for working so hard to remove the provisions of the bill that \nwould have been harmful to our schools, and for keeping the elements \nthat really will provide much-needed flexibility to States and local \nschool boards to try new, innovative approaches to improving public \neducation.\n  I support this conference report for several reasons. First, it \nremoves the provisions in the Senate bill that would have forced school \ndistricts to choose between hiring teachers or serving students with \nspecial needs. I strongly support putting more money into IDEA. The \nFederal government is required to pay for up to 40 percent of special \neducation costs; yet, we are currently only contributing about 10 \npercent. This is unacceptable and I am committed to increasing the \nFederal contribution to IDEA. But taking the money away from teachers \nis not the way to do it. We must find the will and the resources to \nmeet all of our educational needs and responsibilities--we should fund \nteachers, and special education, and technology, and school \nconstruction. We should not force school districts to choose between \nthese important priorities, and I am pleased that the conference report \nno longer does so.\n  Second, I strongly support the provision in the conference report \nthat allows schools to place disabled children who carry or possess a \nweapon at school in an alternative education setting. Unfortunately, \nduring consideration of the Senate Ed-flex bill, the amendment that \ncontained this important provision also contained other harmful \nprovisions that would have diverted funding away from teacher. Although \nI voted against the amendment because of the funding piece, I support \nthis provision to appropriately discipline and remove any student who \nbrings a weapon to school. I am pleased that the harmful pieces of that \namendment were dropped in conference, and that this provision to keep \nguns out of our schools was retained.\n  It seems particularly appropriate, yet tragic, that this requirement \nshould be passed on the day after the school shooting that occurred in\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nLittleton, Colorado. Although authorities are still sorting through the \nfacts and details of that horrifying incident, one thing is clear: we \nmust aggressively take every step possible to keep guns out of the \nhands of children and out of our schools. Enactment of my Gun Free \nSchool Zones Act was a good start, and this provision continues to move \nus in the right direction, but I believe we must go further and make \nthe safety of our school children a national, state and local priority.\n  Finally, the Ed-Flex conference takes a small but important first \nstep in correcting a glitch in last year's Class Size Reduction Act. \nCurrent law requires that if a school district receives less money than \nis necessary to hire a teacher, that district must form a consortium \nwith other districts, pool their money together, and share a teacher. \nThis simply won't work in many places in Wisconsin; the teacher would \nspend more time traveling between school districts than teaching. Yet, \nunder current law, unless the district formed the consortium, they \nwould not have access to the class size money at all.\n  The Conference report partially fixes this problem by allowing those \nschool districts that have already reduced class size in the early \ngrades to access this money without forming a consortium. They are free \nto use this money for professional development to improve teacher \nquality. I am pleased by this change, but this does not address the \nproblem for those districts that have not yet reached the target class \nsize reduction goals. These districts want and need this money, and I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues and with the Department of \nEducation to make sure they get it.\n  Mr. President, the Ed-Flex bill does not solve every problem in \npublic education. We still have many issues to address when we \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But I support \nthe principle of providing more flexibility to States and local school \ndistricts, who have the ultimate responsibility of educating our \nNation's children. Although it is a modest step forward, I am pleased \nto support the Ed-Flex conference report.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this conference report \non the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. When this so-\ncalled ``Ed-Flex'' bill was last before this body, it contained a plan \nto cut back on the commitment this Congress made last year to help put \n100,000 new teachers in our schools. Now that this contentious \nprovision has been removed, I'm pleased this afternoon to support the \nfinal passage of this bill and to clear this measure for the \nPresident's signature.\n  There's little doubt that education is something that can help set an \nindividual free or consign him or her to a lifetime of uphill battles. \nAnd as a Nation, the quality of our educational system can make us a \nworld leader or relegate us to a second-class status.\n  While most education decisions are--and should continue to be--made \nat the state and local level, the Federal Government has a crucial role \nto play in helping schools to educate all our children for the high-\ntech world of the 21st Century. I believe this bill will help us to \nbetter reach our goals.\n  All across America, parents, teachers, school boards, students, and \npolicy makers are looking to improve their schools, and the Federal \nGovernment has offered help to schools in developing and instituting \ninnovative reforms. In 1994, we took the important step of setting up a \ndemonstration program in six states to allow certain regulations in \nFederal education programs to be waived if those regulations impede \nprogress on school improvement efforts. We later expanded that \ndemonstration program to twelve states.\n  This legislation we are passing today will allow all states, \nincluding Delaware, the same flexibility that was afforded the states \nin the demonstration program. The Federal dollars will still be spent \nfor the purposes intended, but states will be freed to use the money in \nthe most efficient and creative ways, most responsive to local needs. \nImportantly, this bill also includes strong provisions to ensure that \nschools will be held accountable to meet educational goals.\n  In the struggle to improve our education system, this is an important \nstep in promoting new ideas and solutions to better our schools and \nmake the most of our education dollars.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to again express my \nstrong support for the education proposals currently before the Senate, \nwhich would direct more dollars and decision-making authority to \nstates, teachers, and parents.\n  Today the Senate considers an important bill designed to facilitate \neducation administration and free more resources for our students. The \n``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999'' would extend the \n``Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program,'' otherwise \nknown as ``Ed-Flex.''\n  Ed-Flex allows eligible local school districts to forgo federal red \ntape that consumes precious education resources. In return, states must \nhave sufficient accountability measures in place and continue to make \nprogress toward improving student education. States must also comply \nwith certain core federal principles, such as civil rights. The concept \nof Ed-Flex is simple, yet the benefits would be significant. In other \nwords, let's put more money into educating our kids in the classroom \nrather than lining the pockets of bureaucrats.\n  The Ed-Flex demonstration program is currently in place in 12 states. \nThe ``Ed-Flex Act of 1999'' would allow all 50 states the option to \nparticipate in the program. With good reason, the program has been very \npopular. Unnecessary, time-and-money-consuming federal regulations are \nrightly despised by school administrators. Did you know that the \nfederal government provides only seven percent of local school funding, \nbut requires 50 percent of all school paperwork? That's ridiculous. We \nneed to put education dollars into the classroom instead of \nbureaucracy.\n  Ed-Flex takes a critical step in allowing more localized decision-\nmaking authority--the power to decide when the federal regulations are \nmore troublesome and expensive than they're worth. Today, there are \nsimply too many regulations which are despised by school \nadministrators.\n  Giving more decision-making authority to states and local school \ndistricts is good common sense. Naturally, those who are closest to our \nstudents are in the best position to make the most appropriate and \neffective decisions concerning their education. One-size-fits-all \nlegislation may work well in other areas, but not in education. Some of \nthe most successful classrooms across our nation vary tremendously in \ntheir structure, functioning, and appearance.\n  In my home state of Minnesota, for instance, we have very rural \ncommunities, urban communities, and everything in between. We've got \nfarm kids, suburban kids, and city kids. All of these kids are \nstudents. And I know this sort of rural-to-urban community-mix is \ntypical for most states. How much sense does it make then, to require \nlocal school districts and classrooms--all with their own particular \nstrengths and weaknesses--to follow, in lock-step, the homogenized, \nuniform routine of federal bureaucracy? Not much.\n  This week in Minnesota, the focus in the State Legislature is on \neducation, and those involved in the debate over spending priorities \nand education initiatives will be Minnesota state officials, teachers, \nand parents: people much better suited to be making decisions for our \nstudents than Washington bureaucrats.\n  We have opportunities before us to do something meaningful for our \nchildren's education. A complementary bill to Ed-Flex which promotes \nlocal decision-making power is Senator Hutchinson's Dollars to the \nClassroom Act. Under this proposal, many federally funded K-12 programs \nwould be consolidated and the dollars sent directly to states or local \nschool districts--free from the usual Washington red tape. The bill \nwould require that at least 95 cents out of every dollar spent on 31 \nprimary and secondary federal education programs go to the classroom, \nallowing teachers and parents to support local education priorities.\n  It would take money from competitive federal grant programs, which \nrarely reach the local classrooms that need them, and send this money \ndirectly to local schools and districts for their spending needs.\n  Mr. President, in a more general sense, we need to address the \nreasons why our students aren't achieving the levels of academic \nexcellence they\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nshould. Of course we all want the best education available for our \nchildren, and to improve the state of American education and schools \nfor all children.\n  It's in the best interest of our kids and of our country. It would be \nnice to think that we could solve the problems of education by spending \nmore and more money. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. The United \nStates is the world leader in national spending per student. Yet our \ntest scores show that our system is failing our children.\n  Test results released last year show that American high school \nseniors score far below their peers from other countries in math and \nscience. We're at rock bottom. It's going to take more time and effort \nto solve these problems--and the most important work will be done by \nthose in the best position to do so: parents, teachers, and local \nadministrators. We must give them the freedom they need to accomplish \nthe job. This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based \non a variety of specific needs. I will continue to support measures \nlike the Ed-Flex legislation and the Dollars to the Classroom Act, that \nreturn money and control--from Washington--to parents, teachers, and \nlocal school districts. After all, they know best how to spend \neducation dollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know that education has a lot to do \nwith what happens in these cases, and the failure of our educational \nsystem in some regards is certainly a contributing factor. As we get \ninto the dropout protection aspects of the bill and also the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools Act, I think you will learn some startling things.\n  I remember not long ago here we had a speaker who told about the \namoral generation we are raising in gangs across the country leading to \nthese kind of problems. I think it is incredibly important that when we \ndo take up, which only occurs once every 5 years, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, we have to examine what happens and why we \nhave these problems. I look forward to working with my friend to design \nhearings which should be productive to our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nconference report on H.R. 800.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we cannot yield the remainder of the \ntime until we have the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum on his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, this weekend, the 19 member nations of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nwill gather in Washington to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \nestablishment of NATO. Some may see the juxtaposition of this summit \nagainst the images of NATO airstrikes over Yugoslavia as being ironic. \nI see it differently. I see it as prophetic.\n  The world has changed in the past 50 years, but as the events in \nKosovo so graphically illustrate, the world has grown no less \ndangerous. NATO, likewise, has undergone significant changes over the \nyears but remains no less important to the security of Europe. The key \nchallenge facing NATO today is the dramatic change in the nature of the \nthreat. The cold war is history; the Soviet Union is defunct; the \nBerlin Wall is just a pile of rubble. Forces massed along the borders \nhave given way to flash points dotted around the globe. The tense but \nsymmetrical standoff in Europe between the East and the West has been \nexchanged for the capriciousness of terrorists and tyrants.\n  Just as the nature of the threat has evolved, so must the structure \nand mission of NATO metamorphose if it is to remain relevant into the \n21st century.\n  In 1949, when the alliance was formed, the Soviet Union and its \nsatellites posed the only credible threat to Western security. It was \nthe chilly dawn of the cold war era, and NATO was precision-tuned to \nmeet the cold war challenge. In the ensuing decades, as NATO expanded \nfrom the original 12 to 16 member nations, the alliance grew in \nstrength and stature to guard Western Europe against the formidable \nforces of the Warsaw Pact nations.\n  Conflict in Korea and Vietnam, turbulence in the Middle East, the \ngrowing influence of China--none of the cataclysmic events of the \nsecond half of the 20th century deterred NATO from its focus on the \nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe. And, in the end, NATO's intensity and \nsingle-mindedness paid off handsomely, with the fall of the Berlin Wall \nand the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\n  Through the years, NATO has adjusted its strategy and its mission to \nmeet changing circumstances, but never has the challenge been as great \nor as far reaching as it is today. Where once NATO contended with the \nshifting fortunes of a cold war enemy massed along a single front, \ntoday the alliance is confronted with brush fires in its backyard, the \nthreat of terrorism from geographically remote nations and \norganizations, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in virtually \nevery direction.\n  To meet this shifting political and military landscape, NATO has \nexpanded on its primary focus of defending its members against the \nthreat of attack by reaching out to its former foes to promote European \nstability and security. Only last month, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic were welcomed into the alliance. And nine other nations are \nclamoring for membership.\n  It is in this context that the 19 members of the alliance will gather \nin Washington to mark the anniversary of NATO and to discuss the future \nof the alliance. And it is in this context that the conflict in Kosovo \ncan serve as a useful template for many of the challenges that the \nalliance is likely to face in the early years of the 21st century.\n  The lessons learned in Kosovo, preliminary though they may be at this \npoint, should be brought to the summit table. The lessons that are \nstill to come, as NATO prosecutes the attack on Yugoslavia, must be \naccommodated in any future strategy.\n  Several specific issues arising from the Kosovo conflict deserve \ncareful consideration by the members of the alliance. And these include \nthe following:\n  First, NATO should discuss the wisdom of establishing a more robust \nforward operating presence in Europe beyond alliance headquarters. \nGiven their history, the Balkans are a logical choice. The time and \nlogistical constraints built into ferrying people and equipment from \nthe United States, Britain, France and elsewhere to the front are \nformidable. The result is a potentially serious disconnect in the \nability of commanders in the field to respond rapidly and effectively \nto changing circumstances. One example of the problems this remote \nstaging has caused is the agonizing wait for the U.S. Apache \nhelicopters to arrive in theater--a delay that has cost NATO in terms \nof tactical flexibility and has given the Serbs in Kosovo a lethal \nwindow of opportunity to carry forward their ethnic cleansing \nactivities.\n  Second, and in conjunction with a more aggressive NATO forward \noperating presence, the allies must accelerate their efforts to field \ncommon systems and increase interoperability. This does not mean that \nthe United States should become an open-ended pipeline for the transfer \nof technology to our NATO allies, but there are basic military tools \nthat should be available to, and designated for, NATO operations.\n  Third, the Kosovo operation should be the genesis for a top-to-bottom \nreview of the NATO decisionmaking process. While the system seems to be \nworking reasonably well considering that it is a conflict being fought \nby committee, there is no doubt in my mind that decisionmaking must be \nstreamlined. It is, for example, far too cumbersome to give each of the \nmember nations veto power over the list of military targets. It may be \nwell for NATO to consider establishing subgroups of responsibility \ndefined operationally and perhaps even geographically. At all costs, \nNATO should not blunder into the decisionmaking no-man's-land that has \nparalyzed the effectiveness of the United Nations.\n  And finally, NATO should continue to engage Russia as a vital partner \nin its quest for stability and security, and redouble it efforts to \nbring other former Soviet bloc nations into the alliance once they have \nmet NATO membership criteria. This is the time to reach out, not to \npull back. NATO's sphere of interest and influence no longer spans just \nthe Atlantic Ocean; it spans a vast and complex territory never \ncontemplated in 1949. In this new operating arena, a broader but still \nsolid base will mean a stronger, more vigorous alliance.\n  We would be foolhardy to believe that Kosovo is an anomaly, just as \nwe would be foolhardy to believe that Kosovo will be the only model of \nfuture conflict. The threats that face the NATO alliance at the \nbeginning of the 21st century are many and varied, and they will \ndoubtless proliferate in the coming years. The threat of nuclear attack \nfrom rogue nations, the possibility of so-called ``loose nukes'' \nfalling into the hands of terrorists, the danger of chemical or \nbiological warfare, the prospect of cyber-attack, the reality of \nincreasing ethnic tensions amid shifting resources and contested \nborders--these are some of the threats that the United States and its \nNATO allies face in the coming years. And these are just the threats we \ncan predict today. Who knows, ten years or twenty years from now, what \nperils the world will face and what shape our defenses will have to \ntake. But as the conflict in Kosovo so sharply indicates, we must be \nprepared for the unexpected, even the unimaginable. If NATO has the \nstaying power to celebrate its centennial fifty years from now, it will \nbe in a world that few of us can image today.\n  NATO has served a worthy purpose since its inception in 1949. Its \nrole in the future security and stability, not only of Europe, but also \nof the United States as well as far-flung corners of the world, is \nequally essential. And so I salute NATO on its 50th anniversary, and I \nurge its representatives to weigh carefully the future goals and \nmission of the alliance. NATO is at a crossroads: it can remain a force \nfor security and stability in the world, or it can become just another \nrelic of the cold war. For the sake of us all, I hope that NATO charts \na course of action that will steer it safely through the turbulence of \ntoday and into the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was about to ask what business we were \non, and the Chair has answered the question.\n  What I will do now is talk for a few minutes about the reasoning \nbehind the amendment I brought on behalf of myself and Senators \nDomenici, Ashcroft, Lott, Nickles and several others, the so-called \nSocial Security lockbox.\n  First, I think it is important for our constituents to understand \nexactly what process happens now and what has been happening to their \nSocial Security payroll taxes.\n  If you are a working American, Social Security payroll taxes are \ntaken out of your paycheck. Most Americans rue that little FICA box, as \nthey know it means a reduction in the amount of take-home pay they \nhave. The money that falls under the Social Security component of the \nFICA tax goes into the Social Security trust fund. From there it is \nused to pay Social Security benefits to retirees.\n  Right now, however, the Social Security trust fund is taking in more \nmoney in taxes than it is paying out in benefits. We are doing that \nbecause in 1982 and 1983, as a result of the Bipartisan Commission's \nrecommendations, we came up with an increase in the payroll taxes, the \ngoal of which was to begin to build a surplus that could be used to \nmeet the retirement demands, in terms of the system, of baby boomers.\n  As a result, over the next 10 years, starting this year, Social \nSecurity will build up a surplus of $1.8 trillion. That means 1.8 \ntrillion more payroll tax dollars are going to go into the Social \nSecurity trust fund than will be needed to meet the retirement benefit \npaychecks that will be paid during that timeframe.\n  As I think most Americans know, and it seems at least virtually every \nsenior or person nearing senior citizen age in my State that I meet \nwith knows, Social Security surpluses have, in recent years, been used \nto mask the size of the Federal deficit and basically to finance other \nGovernment spending--everything from foreign aid to funding for the \nbureaucracy in the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Now, however, Mr. President, as a result of the hard work this \nCongress and previous Congresses have done in the last several years, \nwe are on the verge of balancing the budget without using the Social \nSecurity surplus. In fact, over the next 10 years, the Federal \nGovernment will accumulate a total budget surplus of $2.7 trillion--\n$1.8 trillion, as I mentioned, in the Social Security trust fund and \n$900 billion in non-Social Security surpluses.\n  The question, then, is what should we do with the Social Security \nsurpluses that we are contemplating generating over the next 10 years? \nShould we continue spending those surpluses on other Government \nprograms, on new spending programs, or on increases in existing \nprograms? Or should we save those dollars for Social Security? \nRemember, that was the intent of developing the surplus, to set aside \nadditional surplus Social Security dollars for the day when Social \nSecurity income is no longer meeting its outflow in terms of paychecks.\n  Well, those of us bringing this amendment today say, very simply, \nlet's save it all. We want to save every penny of every dollar to fix \nthe Social Security program, to modernize the program, so that it is \nready to meet the demands of the 21st century. If we don't pass a \nSocial Security modernization plan, then it is our belief that that \nmoney should be used to reduce the public debt and not used for new \nspending programs, for tax cuts, or for anything else.\n  That is the purpose of the legislation we are offering in the form of \nthis amendment--to set up, in effect, a safe-deposit box into which we \nwould put Social Security surpluses to guarantee that they are used \nsolely to modernize Social Security or to pay down the debt.\n  Mr. President, this protection is needed. It is needed because, \nwithout it, the Social Security surplus will be spent. President \nClinton said in a press statement of November 15, 1995, that he wanted \n``to assure the American people that the Social Security trust fund \nwill not be used for any purpose other than to pay benefits to \nrecipients.''\n  ``Under current law,'' he went on to say, ``the Secretary of the \nTreasury is not authorized to use the fund for any purpose other than \nto pay benefits to recipients. There will be no exceptions under my \nwatch. None. Not ever.''\n  That is pretty unequivocal language: The Social Security trust fund \nwill not be used for any purpose other than to pay benefits to \nrecipients. Unfortunately, in 1998, as you will recall, the President \nthreatened to shut down the Government if we didn't appropriate $21 \nbillion in new Federal spending, to be funded, in effect, from the \nSocial Security surplus. And now the Congressional Budget Office \nreports and has estimated that the President's latest budget, the one \nhe submitted in February, spends $158 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus--20 percent of the surplus that will be generated over the next \n5 years on non-Social Security programs.\n  If we have learned anything else over the last several years, we \nshould have learned beyond a shadow of a doubt that money left in \nWashington will be spent in Washington. That includes money in the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n\n  I have singled out the President in my comments here because of this \nyear's budget submission, as well as last year's spending bills; but it \nis not one side of the aisle alone that has a tendency to spend \ndollars. We have all voted for spending bills here that have taken the \nSocial Security trust fund money and spent it elsewhere. In my \njudgment, the failure of the current budget process to provide \nsafeguards against such spending demands that we put in place the kind \nof safe-deposit lockbox we are discussing here today in order to make \nsure that in the future the Social Security surplus dollars are \nprotected, because unless we protect that surplus, in my judgment, it \nwill be spent and we will not have adequate money to make sure that \nSocial Security is not only available to today's seniors but tomorrow's \nseniors as well.\n  The purpose of our Social Security lockbox is to make Social Security \nfunds unavailable to those who want to spend them. First, it reaffirms \nthat Social Security is off budget. Second, it establishes a 60-vote \nSenate point of order against any resolution or legislation that spends \nthe Social Security surplus. Third, it establishes in law a declining \nlimit on the amount of debt to be held by the public, which keeps \nSocial Security moneys from being spent on Washington programs.\n  In other words, Mr. President, initially on an annual basis, and then \non a biannual basis, this legislation would mandate that the publicly \nheld debt be decreased by the amount of money in the Social Security \ntrust fund surplus until such time as we pass Social Security \nmodernization legislation that would use those surpluses. In other \nwords, if Congress does not pass a Social Security modernization plan, \nwe will reduce the public debt, and the total amount over that 10-year \nperiod would be over $1.2 trillion--well over $1 trillion that would \notherwise have been simply spent would, under this proposal, be used to \npay down our debt. That, in turn, would lower interest rates, \nstrengthen our economy, and strengthen the Social Security system \naccordingly. By strengthening our economy, this debt reduction will \ndirectly impact, in my judgment, not only economic growth but the \nstrength of Social Security.\n  Mr. President, in light of the time, I want to turn at this point to \nsome of the comments that have been made on the Senate floor with \nregard to this amendment. Perhaps the most serious we have heard are \nserious charges that this amendment would prevent the Federal \nGovernment from meeting its\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nobligation to pay Social Security benefits themselves. This is premised \non a letter that was sent by Secretary of the Treasury Rubin some time \nago--before this legislation was even drafted, I might add--criticizing \nthe as-yet-to-be-drafted legislation on a number of counts. Some have \nreferred to the letter from Secretary Rubin in expressing his concern \nabout a bill not yet introduced.\n  I urge my colleagues who have raised these concerns to please read \nthe text of the amendment before us today. Let me point out in this \nregard that no fewer than three provisions in this amendment guarantee \nthat there will be absolutely no disruption of any kind in the payment \nof Social Security benefits. We attempted--even though we had not yet \ndrafted the legislation--in drafting the initial bill itself, which \nis offered in this amendment, to make sure that the concerns raised by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury were, in fact, addressed. First, we \nincluded a recession trigger, which would suspend these public debt \nlimits in times of recession and reinstate them only after we had \nrecovered from a recession at a newly adjusted public debt level. \nSecond, we included a provision seeing to it that no short-term task \nmanagement problems would endanger Social Security payments. We have \ndone that very specifically. Finally, we provided for a 7-month delay \nin implementing the lower debt limit figures--a delay that would make \nsure that when the publicly held debt limit was reduced, that event \nwould occur at a time when the Treasury was at its maximum annual cash \nflow position, so that any type of management of money challenges the \nSecretary of the Treasury might have that might precipitate a short-\nterm cash flow problem would not be encountered.\n\n  In our judgment, this will provide the Secretary with a buffer that \nwill be more than adequate, in terms of cash flow, to meet all Social \nSecurity obligations. In addition, the amendment contains a legal \ndeclaration that Social Security benefit payments required by law have \npriority claim on the U.S. Treasury. Such provision should not be \nnecessary because in the highly unlikely and, indeed, unprecedented \ncase of a default, I would be shocked to find that Secretary Rubin, or \nany of his successors, would give greater priority to spending dollars \non foreign aid, corporate welfare, or the IRS bureaucracy than paying \nbenefits to seniors. Nonetheless, to ensure that does not happen, we \nhave included in this amendment a guarantee that, in the highly \nunlikely event of a default, Social Security benefits will be paid \nfirst.\n  Finally, I must add one other guarantee of Social Security payments. \nI must mention one, and that is the Members of Congress themselves. I \ncannot conceive, and I am sure the Presiding Officer cannot conceive, \nthat there is any Member of this body who would not vote to suspend \nthese debt limits immediately if there was any risk of failing to meet \nour Social Security obligations. That would not happen. I don't think \nthere is a Member in the House or the Senate who would vote to make \nsure those payments were met, and that is what we have--a point of \norder that can be overturned by a 60-vote Senate vote on the \nlegislation.\n  Social Security benefits are not endangered by this amendment. They \nare, in fact, made much safer by its provisions for saving Social \nSecurity, as well as the clear priority the amendment gives to all \nSocial Security payments.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we believe this amendment \nwould make Social Security safer, and that is why 99 Senators recently \nvoted for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution declaring that every nickel \nof the Social Security surplus should be saved in this way to fix \nSocial Security, or to reduce the public debt.\n  I urge those same 99 Senators to vote for cloture so that we can have \nan up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  I also say this. I know there are other Members who have other ways \nin mind as to how, perhaps, to address the challenge of protecting the \nSocial Security surplus. In fact, I suspect the Senator from South \nCarolina, who spoke about this yesterday, will perhaps offer an \namendment that he offered in committee. That is fine. I think we should \noffer different proposals. Let's vote them up or down. Let's not \nprevent votes from taking place. I would like a vote on this amendment, \nand I would certainly be happy to have a vote on amendments offered \nfrom other Members on either side of the aisle. But let's move the \nprocess forward.\n  I think most people would like to see us addressing this issue head \non and not deferring it and not refusing to take votes on it. I think \nwhat we should do is try to offer those various approaches and have the \nchance to have them debated in the context of the bill on the floor, \nand then vote on the amendment we are proposing, and on others as well, \nand we will see where the Senate judgment ultimately lies.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nhere today, and that I will now replace the Presiding Officer. I notice \nthat the time for that, too, has arrived.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \na question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will yield for one. I have to relieve the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. He doesn't mind. He loves it.\n  I just heard coming on the floor the expression that ``every nickel'' \nis expended for Social Security. Is that correct, under this amendment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Our proposal, as the Senator knows, is to make sure that \nevery Social Security surplus dollar is either spent in conjunction \nwith legislation to modernize and guarantee the long-term solvency of \nSocial Security, or used, as I said, to pay down the publicly held \ndebt.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That isn't what it says. ``Every nickel,'' the Senator \nsaid, could be used for Social Security. What I am trying to \ndistinguish here, and asking the question, is the doubletalk, which \nobviously when you say ``every nickel'' used to reform or pay for \nSocial Security or pay down the debt, now when you use moneys to pay \ndown the debt, that is not for Social Security.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. As I think I laid out very clearly what the amendment \ndoes, I think the Senator from South Carolina would agree with me that \nwhen we take the Social Security surplus dollars and spend them on new \nspending programs or tax cuts or the expansion of existing programs--\nthat is what has been going on--I don't think that is what we want to \nsee done with those dollars.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The issue is what do we do with them, if we don't spend \nthem or use them for more spending programs?\n  The legislation we are proposing says we either use those dollars to \nfix Social Security to deal with this long-term insolvency, or until we \npass such legislation that we would use it to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  In my State, at least, I find an overwhelming number of people who \nfeel that paying down the national debt is the one and only alternative \nfor using these dollars. That makes sense to them because they know \nthat will help us in the long term to address Social Security and \nsolvency and a variety of other challenges that we face as a country.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How do you pay down the debt with Social Security \nmoney, thereby causing a debt in Social Security? Social Security, I \nask the distinguished Senator, is not responsible for the debt. In \nfact, Social Security is running a surplus, a surplus which was created \nintentionally to help fund the retirement of the Baby Boom generation.\n  So let's both agree that Social Security hasn't caused the debt.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is right. I agree.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When you use the expression ``to pay down the national \ndebt,'' or the ``public debt,'' or whatever debt, it is debt caused by \nspending, or by tax cuts, or both. So you are not using every nickel \nfor Social Security. On the contrary, what you are using is Social \nSecurity moneys to pay other debts for any and every purpose but Social \nSecurity.\n  I don't understand the distinguished Senator coming along and \nsupporting this. I don't want to see him get in trouble, because I am \ngoing to ask the majority leader to pull this amendment down. They \ndon't want a vote on this. What he is saying is that he wants to save \nSocial Security. I have the quotations in the file of everyone.\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\n  Senator Domenici says ``every nickel'' to be spent on Social \nSecurity. Senator Gramm says ``every nickel'' to be spent on Social \nSecurity. I come in on the floor, and Senator Abraham says ``every \nnickel'' to be spent on Social Security. Then when you use the \nexpression ``pay down the debt,'' which everybody wants, I agree with \nthat. But when you use that expression and use that legislation, the \namendment, to pay down the debt, in essence what you are saying is you \nare going to use Social Security, not for ``every nickel'' on Social \nSecurity, but for every nickel on any and everything other than Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. As the Senator from South Carolina knows, Mr. President, \nright now we are spending as much money as the current benefit system \nrequires. We are fulfilling every single benefit which Social Security \non an annual basis requires. The question is, If you have additional \nmoney, what do the American people want done with it? I think the \nAmerican people do not want it spent for and don't want to see that \nadditional surplus used for tax cuts. I think the American people are \nfed up with that.\n  In my judgment, if the amendment were offered and passed, then that \nmoney will be spent, or it will be used in one of the fashions you have \njust described, the very way it has been used since 1983.\n  So the question is which option do we prefer? I would like to see the \nmoney used to modernize Social Security. I hope we can on a bipartisan \nbasis come forward with a plan that, in fact, modernizes Social \nSecurity for the 21st century. Until we do that, of the three choices \nleft to us, it seems to me that at least the constituents in my State \nwant to make sure that money doesn't get spent. I don't want to see it \nused for tax cuts. We want to see it used either to fix Social \nSecurity, or to bring down the national debt, because by bringing down \nthe national debt we will, in effect, strengthen our position as we \nattempt to solve Social Security in the long term.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will get into the point about the national debt. I \nwish, as the Senator just outlined, ``pay down the national debt''--the \ntruth of the matter is paying down the public debt has caused the \nnational debt to continue to rise. We are not paying down the national \ndebt.\n  I wish Mr. Greenspan and Chairman Domenici, and all the rest who are \ntalking about paying down the debt, would say, just as the Senator from \nMichigan has said, pay down the national debt, but the assumption is \nyou have money left over. The truth of the matter is having used Social \nSecurity over the last several years, since 1983, to pay down the \npublic debt, we now owe. We don't have a surplus in Social Security. \nThis year the Social Security surplus is estimated to be $127 billion, \nbut by the end of the year we actually will owe $857 billion to Social \nSecurity. Why? Because we loot money from the trust fund and use it for \nother things.\n  That is my problem. And it was intended for the surplus money to stay \nthere and to earn under section 201, in regular Treasury bills, \ngovernment securities. And this year, if left untouched, it would earn \nalmost $50 billion in interest for the Social Security trust fund.\n  Incidentally, I know the Senator is a good businessman. That is the \npolicy for corporate America. We make it a felony to pay down the \ncompany debt with the pension fund. Here we are paying down the \ngovernment debt, whether it is public or the national debt, we are \npaying down the debt with Social Security, or the pension money, where \nit is a felony in private practice. We think that is a wonderful \npolicy.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We are sort of moving a little beyond the question here, \nI say to the Senator, in that I have to relieve the Presiding Officer.\n  Here is what I say to the Senator from South Carolina. We have a lot \nof ideas. Senator Hollings has offered in the committee his alternative \nas to how we should deploy these resources, these surplus dollars. \nOthers have talked about an even bigger lockbox than the one we are \nproposing that might encompass other areas of Federal spending. That is \nfine. I am more than happy to debate each of these options. I would \njust like to see us vote on this option.\n  I would like to see the Members of the Senate have a chance to vote \nyes or no on the question of whether or not we create as an option to \nusing these dollars for spending or tax cuts the option that would have \nto be followed of using it to pay down the debt.\n  In my judgment, Mr. President, that is an option that seniors, and \npeople who will soon be seniors, would prefer to see these dollars used \nfor as opposed to the way they have been spent in recent years.\n  But if a majority of the Senate thinks that they prefer to see these \ndollars spent, whether on tax cuts or new spending programs, they can \nvote on it. And they should have a chance to vote on it. In fact, \ntomorrow they will have their first chance to vote on it. I say let's \ngive the various plans their day in court here and let's see if the \nmajority of the Senate supports one over the others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan yielding and engaging in a colloquy with me.\n  Moving right to the point, it is not a question of this particular \napproach or that particular approach. It is this particular amendment \nby the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I think it ought to be \nwithdrawn.\n  What has been prompting this maneuver? They have been planning to see \nhow in the world they could kill the President's program in one \ninstrument while ensuring a tax cut on the other hand. In order to do \nthat, they brought out the budget resolution with all that language I \npointed out earlier yesterday repealing the pay-go rule. After \nrepealing that pay-go rule, they can come in later with tax cuts.\n  Incidentally, the tax cut is going to be scheduled so that it brings \nin, over the first 5 years, only a tax cut of about $142 billion; but \nover the next 5 years, $736 billion. That is how they get by the pay-go \nrule with that language in the concurrent resolution.\n  Reading from the handout from the distinguished majority leader, and \nthe author, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, it ``uses Social \nSecurity surplus to reduce debt held by public.'' What they are saying \nis they are using Social Security money to pay a debt.\n  Now, if it was to pay the debt owed Social Security, the $857 billion \nwhich we will owe at the end of this year. Why is that? Because we have \nbeen paying down the public debt with Social Security trust funds. That \nis exactly why there is a debt in Social Security. Under the policy set \nby this particular amendment, you say that is exactly what we love to \ndo, we are going to use the Social Security surplus to reduce the debt \nheld by the public.\n  This activity is illegal, in the sense that section 13301 of the \nBudget Act says you cannot use the particular moneys of Social Security \nin the general budget. There should never be a budget reported using \nSocial Security moneys by the Congress, by the President, or in the \nbudget resolution. That law, the Budget Act of 1990, was signed by \nPresident Bush. I heard a Member mention 99 Senators; 98 Senators, \nbipartisan, voted for section 13301, but that has been violated ever \nsince its enactment, and that is why the debt continues to grow.\n  Now, I would shut up, sit down, and take my seat if this amendment \nsaid ``use Social Security surplus to pay down the Social Security \ndebt,'' but you are going to use the Social Security surplus to pay \ndown any and every debt but the debt in Social Security and in the same \nbreath say we want to save Social Security and this is how--put it in a \nlockbox. You say we will put it in a lockbox, and every nickel will be \nused for Social Security, yet this amendment actually guarantees that \nevery nickel of that surplus will be used for any and every thing but \nSocial Security.\n  I am sure the Senator from Michigan wants to look at that closely \nwith the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, because I had \nthis particular debate last year in the election. My poor Republican \nopponent came with the same kind of language, and we put him right. We \nhave different organizations to save Social Security. Max Richmond and \nthe rest came down and gave me an award. This is a fact.\n  And we wonder why there is no confidence in the Congress and why our\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nRepublicans get in trouble on Social Security. They get in trouble on \nSocial Security because they tried to take it away in 1986. That is \nwhen they lost the U.S. Senate. Then they fought me. I finally \nembarrassed them into voting in 1990 to save it. I thought they would \nobey their own law. They didn't.\n  Now, in an effort to get on top of the Social Security, they put out \nthe rhetoric that every nickel is going to be saved for Social \nSecurity. I can state in this submission exactly what was said. Senator \nDomenici, the chairman, when asked, ``Why is that the case?'' ``Because \nwe say put 100 percent of the accumulated surplus that belongs in the \ntrust fund in the trust fund.''\n  That isn't what the amendment says. It doesn't say, ``keep it in the \ntrust fund.'' It says, ``use the money to reduce the debt''--any and \nevery debt.\n  How is the debt caused? Kosovo spending. How is the debt caused? \nMilitary pay. How is the debt caused? Foreign aid. Any and every \nprogram.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan said that the Commerce \nDepartment was running up a debt unnecessary to the Department--abolish \nthe Department. We are going to use Social Security money to pay for \nthe Commerce Department--the very Department that the distinguished \nSenator said we ought to abolish.\n  Let me read further. Here is the chairman of the Budget Committee:\n\n       In addition, for those who are wondering what we are doing \n     about Social Security and what the President does about it, \n     let me remind you, we do not spend one nickel of Social \n     Security, of their money, for any new program. When the \n     President of the United States spent $158 billion in the \n     first 5 years out of Social Security trust fund without any \n     apologies, just said spend it, we say ``Don't spend it, keep \n     it in the trust fund and put it in a statutorily created \n     lockbox that would be tied to debt so it never can be \n     spent.''\n\n  Further down:\n\n       You do not have to be worried whether that Social Security \n     trust fund is going to be used for tax cuts because we cannot \n     direct that any of that money be used for tax cuts. It can be \n     used for the debt caused by tax cuts.\n\n  They are running around wanting to reduce the debt. How can you \nreduce the debt by giving an across-the-board tax cut? That reduces \nyour revenues and causes the debt to increase.\n  Senator Gramm says:\n\n       What this budget does on Social Security is very, very \n     simple. It says every penny [not just every nickel; the \n     Senator from Texas is a real conservative] every penny that \n     we collect in Social Security taxes that we don't have to pay \n     Social Security benefits should be dedicated to Social \n     Security, not to any debt caused by other programs in the \n     government.\n       We should not spend it on any other Government programs, \n     nor should we use it for tax cuts. Senator Domenici, in a \n     proposal that is enshrined in this budget that we will have \n     to vote on, sets up a lockbox. We will not be able to spend \n     one penny of the Social Security surplus. This is vitally \n     important because, as everybody in the Senate knows [I am \n     quoting Senator Gramm] and I wish every American knew, our \n     Government has been using every penny of money coming into \n     the Social Security trust fund for other programs. We \n     currently have IOUs for this money.\n\n  Mr. President, $857 billion, those are the IOUs. So the Senator from \nTexas and I agree that we have been stealing it. And how do we steal \nit? We use it to pay down the public debt. How is the debt caused? By \ntax cuts.\n  So, what goes around comes around. I know the distinguished Senator \ndoes not want to join in that because he wants to save every nickel, he \nsays. I will get the Congressional Record tomorrow and I hope they do \nnot change it. But the quotation is there: ``Every nickel to be spent \nfor Social Security.'' That is what Senator Gramm, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, and the majority leader said. If \nyou really want to save Social Security rather than spend it, you are \ngoing to, by gosh, vote against cloture, continue this debate so people \ncan come to their senses. I can tell you that right now, I do not mind \nvoting against it. You can tell my opposition to it.\n  I will ask the distinguished Senator from Idaho, what about Social \nSecurity? I am trying to get sense out of this language here. \nFortunately, the 19-page amendment is reduced. As it is described in \nthe handout by the distinguished majority leader, it ``uses the Social \nSecurity surplus to reduce the debt.''\n  How do you use the Social Security moneys to reduce the debt and yet \nspend every nickel--or every penny, as Senator Gramm says--for Social \nSecurity? The debt is not caused by Social Security. The debt is caused \nby anything and everything but Social Security. So, once you use Social \nSecurity moneys to pay the debt--I will be glad if somebody will just \nexplain that to me and I will be glad to stop. But I just do not \nunderstand how we save Social Security by spending its money on any and \nevery other program--the debt of every other program but Social \nSecurity.\n  Would the distinguished Senator want to respond?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will certainly be happy to try to respond \nto the Senator. The Senator has been here a good deal longer than I, \nhas spent a good deal more time on this issue than I, but he also \nunderstands the term ``the debt held by the public.'' Any time you \ndecrease the debt held by the public, you increase the ability of \nGovernment to pay their obligations to Social Security. Because those \nobligations will not be ingrained in new spending--be it discretionary \nor entitlement spending--we set it aside and we do not obligate it \nexcept for, as you would have in this instance, a reduction of debt and \na decline, therefore, of interest paid on debt.\n  That specifically is what the language does. I think it is quite \nclear and it is quite obvious that we are not obligating Social \nSecurity trust funds anymore to entitlement spending or to \ndiscretionary spending. And, therefore, when the obligations of the \ntrust fund come due, you have money available because you did not \nobligate it. Therefore, this Senator and I do not have to go to the \npublic to raise taxes to pay for a system for which the public had \nalready been taxed.\n  I am not a budgeter, nor am I on the Finance Committee, but I have \nworked with the chairman of the Budget Committee in the crafting of the \nlanguage. I find it quite clear, not very confusing at all.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Does the distinguished Senator find that Social \nSecurity has caused the debt that we are talking about paying, whether \nit be public, private or otherwise?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Federal Government has borrowed money from the trust \nfunds, as the Senator knows. That is the law that was created.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. But I am asking does it cause any debt? Did Social \nSecurity overspend?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It creates an obligation to repay because it is taken out \nin the form of Treasury notes and interest paid, and certainly there is \nan obligation to pay back. Whether it is an obligation to pay back or a \ndebt, then that is a game of semantics, but it is an obligation. If I \nhad an obligation to pay, as the Government does, to the trust funds of \nSocial Security, I would consider that a debt burden and something I \nwould have to pay. And I am quite sure my accountant would want me to \nput that in the ``debt'' column of ``bills outstanding'' or ``money to \nbe paid'' or ``owed to'' a particular payment scheme. I call that debt.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is because the Government has taken the money from \nSocial Security?\n  Mr. CRAIG. They have borrowed it by law, as was prescribed in 1935, \nfrom the trust funds. That is the only way the money can be held in the \ntrust funds to generate interest on the account. That is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Held in the trust fund? Let's you and me stop there. \nWhy not hold it in the trust funds? Why spend it?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, no. Because you would have to use it. If it sat idle, \nit would lose anywhere from 8 to 10 percent a year on interest it could \nbe earning.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It could be held in trust over in the Treasury. We have \na measure to do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And done what with it, invested in the stock market to \ngain money?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, invested under section 201. Under section 201 it \nmust be invested.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Loaned to the Government.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Long-term securities. It takes securities but you can\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\ntake that money and put it back into the trust funds so it can earn the \ninterest.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from South Carolina and I both know exactly \nwhat we are talking about. We are talking about the same thing. The law \nis very specific.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You don't loan it out to a bank. You don't play it in the \nstock market. You loan it back to the Government and the Government \nuses the money that they borrowed.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is where we differ. Why would they loan the money? \nWhy not put it back in trust when we make that profit, the maximum \namount allowable under law.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield just briefly, and I will let him \nhave the floor for the remainder of his time, the Government is not \ngoing to pay interest on money they can do nothing with.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We can buy those--you said the Government needs to do \nit?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, the law requires it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is not a question of need, it is a question of law.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Government doesn't need to do it, the law requires it \nto do it. I did not write the law; it was written in 1935 before the \nSenator from South Carolina and I ever got here.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what I want to say, exactly. And I think it is \na very sound law and I am not trying to repeal it. I am trying to carry \nout its intent. That is, we reap those benefits like any other Treasury \nsecurity. Mr. President, there is not any question we are in a dickens \nof a fix. The CBO predicts that at the end of 1999 we will owe Social \nSecurity $857 billion; in the year 2000, it will be $994 billion that \nwill be owed to Social Security. I want you to get the feel and the \npicture of exactly what is coming. They are talking like this is the \nonly way to do it.\n  This is the only way to absolutely savage and destroy Social \nSecurity. They want to continue to do it formally with this particular \namendment, because this amendment, by the year 2001, paying down the \npublic debt with the Social Security surplus, we will owe Social \nSecurity $1.139 trillion. Extrapolating it on out, by the year 2007 we \nwill owe Social Security, paying down the public debt, $2.205 trillion; \nand on the 10th year out, the year 2008, we will owe Social Security \n$2.417 trillion.\n  There is where we are going to be faced, before we get to the point \nof the year 2012-2013, where they said the interest costs then are \ngoing to have to be consumed and not earned in order to make the \npayments. And by 2022, we will be totally out of money. By that time it \nwill be about $4 to $5 trillion. But just in the short period, by 2008, \nthey are talking about all of this going up and how we are paying down \nthe public debt over the years, we are increasing the Social Security \ndebt, all under the auspices and policy of saving Social Security. That \nis what this Senator is trying to ram home.\n  This is not saving Social Security. This is spending Social Security, \nputting it in a deep hole, totally in the red, and there is nobody in \nhis right mind going to come and start trying to raise taxes for $2.417 \ntrillion. That is the course we are on with this particular amendment. \nThat is why the Senator from South Carolina is exercised.\n  We have several problems. One, of course, is to save Social Security. \nThe way they do it is to continue to pay down the public debt with this \nparticular amendment. It uses the Social Security surplus to reduce the \ndebt held by the public. That is exactly what we have been doing, and \nnow we want to formalize it. In essence, in paragraph 1 of the \namendment, they reaffirm section 13301 saying that you cannot do that, \nand then in a further paragraph on page 10, they say that is what we \ncan do.\n  I remember, Mr. President, when I was the Governor of South Carolina, \nwe had a contest. We were cleaning up the insurance industry. We had \nthe Capital Life Insurance Company. They were looking for a slogan. We \ncame up with the winning slogan: ``Capital Life will surely pay if the \nsmall print on the back don't take it away.''\n  That is exactly what we have in this amendment. They are trying to \nsay, ``Oh, no, we're not changing the law at all. We have the very same \nthing. We are doing it exactly the way it has been done over the \nyears.''\n  This is a long amendment:\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Social Security Surplus \n     Preservation and Debt Reduction Act.''\n\n  Then, it cites a finding. In the finding, Mr. President, right in the \nvery beginning, page 3, section 1, it says:\n\n       (1) Reaffirmation of Support.--Congress reaffirms its \n     support for the provisions of section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act of 1990 that provides that receipts and \n     disbursements of the social security trust funds shall not be \n     counted for the purposes of the budget submitted by the \n     President, the congressional budget, or the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  That is to keep the money in Social Security.\n  But if you turn to page 10, it has a very tricky clause in here. It \nis called ``calculation.'' They were calculating when they wrote this \none:\n\n       After the Secretary determines the actual level for the \n     social security surplus for the current year, the Secretary \n     shall take the estimated level of the social security surplus \n     for that year specified . . . and subtract that actual level.\n\n  When you subtract that actual level, you pay down the public debt. \nThat is where they satisfy we are going to use Social Security trust \nmoneys to pay down or reduce the debt. Fine business. It is reducing \nthe debt for any and every program in Government, whether it is \nentitlement, discretionary, defense spending, or whatever, for any and \nevery debt caused by every and any program other--other--except for \nSocial Security. That is what gets me.\n  Then they say every nickel is going to be spent, every penny is going \nto be spent, lockbox, nobody can touch it, you can't get to this money \nfor any tax cut or for any spending programs or anything else, but you \ncan get it for the debt caused by tax cuts, for the debt caused by \nspending programs.\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. I think it ought to be \nwithdrawn, because Members should not want to be in a subterfuge \nsituation of this kind trying to save Social Security and actually \nsavaging the program.\n  Mr. President, I got into this debate with the Office of Management \nand Budget when they used the word ``surplus.'' There is no surplus.\n  We can see from another chart that as of the year 1998, the expected \ndeficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office--and this is the \nmost recent April 15 figure--is $109 billion. Then 1999, $105.2 \nbillion. They expect on the current policy--current policy is not $17 \nbillion to $18 billion for military pay; it is not $6 billion more for \nKosovo; it is not the caps being busted; it is really, since we already \nspent $12 billion last year and already busted the caps in this year's \nbudget, $21 billion.\n  We are looking for $32 billion there. We ought to pocket right this \nminute over $50 billion. The task of the Congress to keep current \npolicy to only get to a deficit--again, next year on the 2000 budget of \n$91.8 billion, Mr. President, we have to start cutting programs some 50 \nbillion bucks.\n  That is not in the cards at all. My friends on the other side of the \naisle who came and said, ``Look, what we want to do is get rid of the \nDepartment of Education,'' now say, ``What we want to do is increase \nspending for education,'' because education, we found out in the \npolitical polls, is a very important issue in the Governors' races.\n  All over America, everybody is interested in education. So now we \nwant to increase spending for education, and instead of abolishing the \nDepartment, they are looking at election 2000. So they say, ``What we \nare going to do is actually increase money.'' You can see at a glance \nthat we are in trouble there.\n  The deficit, under current policy, continues to go up, as you can \nwell see by the gross Federal debt on page 38 of the most recent \neconomic and budget outlook fiscal years of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. They see that the debt continues to go up in the years 2000, \n2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005. And then by the year 2006, the actual \ndebt will start coming down. We will actually get in more money. We \nwill spend less, for the first time, than what we take in.\n  Right now, our dilemma is that just with current policy and not \ncutting $51 billion, we are going to have a $91 billion deficit. And if \nwe do not cut some $50 billion from the spending programs to take care \nof the military, Kosovo,\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nand the particular targets set, then we are going to be back to about \n$140 billion.\n  We had a good record in 1993, and it was not Greenspan. I keep \nhearing how the people out there did it. No; we sweat blood and tears. \nWe voted to increase taxes on Social Security. I hear about all the tax \ncuts. Where is the tax cut to reestablish the moneys back to Social \nSecurity? They have given that up. The Senator from Texas said they \nwere going to hunt us down in the streets and shoot us like dogs with \nthat thing. Senator Packwood stood on the floor and said he would give \nyou his house if the program worked. Congressman Kasich, chairman of \nthe Budget Committee on the other side, said he would change parties.\n  The stock market has gone over 10,000. Still we have the lowest \ninflation, lowest unemployment rate, business confidence, what have \nyou, and the program is still working. Greenspan has not had anything \nto do since 1993. He just sits there as a sage and talks about some \nkind of increased excitement or whatever else, however he phrases it. \nActually, he just lets our particular program work, and we are proud of \nit. The deficit has been coming down each year.\n  Now under this amendment, you can bet your boots that you are \nspending Social Security to pay down the public debt. While saying you \nare trying to save it, you actually are going to increase the debt.\n  That is how the CBO figures show it. That is what has been done over \nthe years. That is the current policy. And this particular amendment \ndoes not change it. It is just fancy language to come about and try to \nget credit for ``100 percent.'' The rhetoric is correct: ``100 percent, \nevery penny, every nickel, lockbox, lockbox,'' everything else. But the \nactual instrument itself--``Watch what we do, not what we say,'' as the \nformer Attorney General, Mr. Mitchell, said.\n  So what we do have is fiscal cancer. I say that advisedly, Mr. \nPresident, because everybody in America should understand that this \nyear we are going to waste $356 billion in interest costs on the \nnational debt. That is money spent for nothing productive. And when you \ndo that, you really are taxing the people.\n  If you could start paying down that debt--not the public debt, \nbecause when you pay down the public debt it increases the Social \nSecurity debt. It is like two credit cards, of course, having a \nMasterCard and Visa card, and you want to pay down the MasterCard, the \npublic debt, with your Visa card, the Social Security card. So as you \npay down what they can see, and what the stock market loves--because \nthey do not want the Government, with its sharp elbows, coming into the \nmarket running up interest rates, crowding out corporate capital, maybe \ncausing inflation, and otherwise, slowing the economy, actually paying \nits bills.\n  There is no free lunch. What happens is, your interest costs go up, \nup and away, as this particular chart shows.\n  Back when we last balanced the budget, Mr. President, under President \nLyndon Baines Johnson, the debt was less than $1 trillion. And the \ninterest cost for 200 years of history and the cost of all the wars--\nthe Revolution, the Civil War, World War I, II, Korea, Vietnam--the \ninterest cost of 200 years of history and all the wars, the interest \ncost was only $16 billion. And since that time, without the cost of a \nwar, it has gone up to $356 billion--think of that--$340 billion more \nthat we have taxed the American people that we have to spend.\n  ``Government's too big,'' is the charge about tax cuts. ``The \nGovernment is way too big.'' What is too big is the waste that has been \ncaused by this political rhetoric and litany going on about ``the \nGovernment's too big; therefore, we need a tax cut.''\n  What we need is a tax increase. Can you imagine a Senator saying that \non the floor? I am like the Senator from Michigan. I do not think too \nmuch spending cuts are going to occur to take care of this particular \nproblem for the simple reason we had 8 years of President Reagan \ncutting spending, we had 4 years of President Bush cutting spending, we \nhave had now another 6 years of President Clinton cutting spending--\nthat 1993 Act cut spending $250 billion, and in fact it was way more \nthan what we thought.\n  As we went into the different programs, we increased taxes $250 \nbillion, which really amounts to about $310 billion. And we taxed the \nupper brackets, we taxed Social Security, as I have just described, but \nwe got the economy going, and we started bringing the deficits down; \nbut the debt kept going up because we kept spending Social Security on \nthe public debt.\n  That is how the debt has continued to go up, up and away on the \nSocial Security. And the national debt has gone up. And it is fiscal \ncancer. You cannot give a tax cut if you are not paying your bills. You \ndo not want to cut your revenue. You do not want to increase spending. \nEverybody agrees with that.\n  But one way to make sure your debt continues to increase, which means \nthe waste of interest costs continues, is a tax cut. But that is \npolitical jargon. We had that debate last year. And the distinguished \ncolleague that I had opposing me, he wanted to have a tax cut. I said, \nlet's pay down the debt. And we had put in a plan--I think the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer should remember this because it was \nbipartisan.\n  We had a conscience back 10 years ago. In 1988, we met in the Budget \nCommittee, and you could see this so-called supply side--I wish my \nfriend, Jack Kemp, was here because we would have a good debate. I will \nnot describe that bus wreck that Senator Dole would always talk about, \nthe bus going over the side--a bunch of supply-siders. He said that was \nthe good news. He said what was the bad news was one empty seat.\n\n  We were just causing the debt to go up, up. By the way, that is in \nthe Congressional Record. That is not off-color by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I will get it out of the Congressional Record and show \nit to you. That is one reason I think Senator Dole lost. Because he and \nI worked on cutting down the debt, cutting down the spending, and then \nhe went for a 15-percent across-the-board tax cut knowing that it was \nnot any way to pay the bills and cut down the debt.\n  But in any event, we realized, Mr. President, that we had to do \nsomething. So in the Budget Committee, in 1988, I presented a value-\nadded tax, a value-added tax of 5 percent, each percent raising about \n$35 billion, for about $185 billion.\n  The distinguished Senator on the floor just momentarily asked, What \nare you going to do with the money? I say, put it in trust to not be \nexpended except on reducing the deficit and debt. ``Reducing the \ndeficit and debt,'' that was the language.\n  I had Senator Armstrong from Colorado. I had Senator Boschwitz from \nMinnesota. I had six other Democratic Senators. We had eight Senators \nvote for that, and I appeared before the Finance Committee, and they \nquietly told me--they said, If we could have a secret ballot, we would \npass it in a minute because we have to start doing it. I even wrote my \nfriend, President Bush, and told him I would be glad to head up the \nBudget Committee effort and everything like that if he was really doing \nit. He said now is not the time. I will show you the letter.\n  But we have been trying our best. If we had a VAT here, a tax \nincrease allocated to the deficit and the debt, it would not only start \npaying it down, it would immediately remove about a 15- to 17-percent \ndisadvantage of producing in the United States of America.\n  Now we have all of these different commissions on competitiveness and \nproductivity. Every industrialized country has a value-added tax. \nCanada has one. Japan has one. In Europe the average is about 17 \npercent. And what we did is we brought the expert, Van Canosom was his \nname, from Holland, who had worked on both the Canadian and the \nJapanese, as well as the United Kingdom VAT. And he helped in an \nappearance before the Finance Committee.\n  What we pointed out, in addition to paying down the debt, if \neverybody really wants to pay down the debt, we could also reconcile \nwhat you saw in the morning paper--$310 billion this year in deficit in \nthe balance of trade. It went on to say that the economic experts were \nworried because we were consuming more than we are producing.\n  The policy is not to produce in the United States. We are not \ncompeting really with the Japanese, really with the Mexicans. We are \ncompeting with\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nourselves. If you have a manufacturing plant, and 30 percent of your \nvolume is your labor cost, you can save as much as 20 percent of the \nvolume by moving your manufacturing to a lower-wage, offshore country. \nSo if you have $500 million in sales, you can move to that low-wage, \noffshore country your manufacturing--just keep your executive office \nand your sales force in the United States--and immediately, before \ntaxes, you make $100 million; or you continue to work your own people \nand go broke, because your competition is moving like gangbusters just \nover and fast.\n  The only industries--as a former Governor I was in that game of \nindustry attraction-- we are getting in South Carolina and in the South \nare foreign manufacturers who are trying to get into the American \nmarket, the richest market in the world.\n  That is what is really happening. We are not getting any expansions. \nOn the contrary, the already instituted manufacturer is moving, like \ntextiles, with NAFTA. We have lost 30,000 jobs since NAFTA in the \nlittle State of South Carolina. We have Ambassador Barshefsky. She is \nworrying about bananas. And then I hear about the WTO with China, the \nPeople's Republic of China. I notice my friend, Tom Friedman, wrote an \narticle that we had everything to win and nothing to lose.\n  He doesn't understand there is a nonmarket economy in the People's \nRepublic of China. Whereas, yes, we can bring a steel dumping case in \nhere and have legislation already passed overwhelmingly in the House of \nRepresentatives, now before the Senate. The bill is at the desk, and we \nare ready to pass it. We could do that on our own. Join the WTO and you \nare bogged down in bureaucracy. You won a little vote. Cuba will cancel \nyou out in the WTO. But he doesn't see anything wrong.\n  We are trying to maintain our economic strength. The security of the \nUnited States of America is like a three-legged stool. The one leg is \nyour values as a nation. We dedicate ourselves, again, in Kosovo and \nBosnia, Somalia, feed the hungry and everything. America is the envy of \nthe world for its values, individual rights, equal rights, freedom of \nall mankind. The second leg is the military, unquestioned, the \nsuperpower. The third leg economically has been fractured over the last \n50 years intentionally. We did it with the Marshall Plan. We sent over \nthe expertise. We sent over the best machinery, and we won. Capitalism \nhas generally prevailed in Europe and in the Pacific rim over \ncommunism. So we are proud of that.\n  But now, as we try to build back our economic strength, we are \nspending like gangbusters. Our job policy program in this country is to \nget rid of all the jobs, send them all overseas. We are talking about \nthe rich getting richer on the stock market, but we are actually \neliminating the middle class in this country.\n  So, yes, if you want to pay down the debt, I will be glad to work \nwith someone on the other side, because that is the only way to get any \nlegislation passed. It has to be bipartisan. If I can find somebody on \nthe other side who is willing to take the risk, we can debate it. It \nmight not pass this year, but then we have next year and maybe we can \npass it next year. But somehow, somewhere we have to start paying the \nbill and quit running up deficits, politically describing them as \nsurpluses in order to reelect ourselves. That is the biggest phony \nactivity that is going on, the worst political charade. And then we \nwonder why, for example, we don't have the public's confidence.\n  Mr. President, I got with Ken Apfel out at the Social Security \nAdministration, because I was encouraged at the beginning of the year. \nI heard the President say he was going to save Social Security. And \nthen, of course, he was only going to save 62 percent. He was going to \nspend 38 percent. And to be candid with you, the 38 percent was what he \nhad been spending all along. The 38 percent now amounts to the $50 \nbillion that he was spending when he first took office in 1993. So he \nwas getting the same amount of money. The Social Security moneys went \nup, up and away, as you well know.\n  I heard my Republican friends say, in a 99-0 vote, that we were going \nto save Social Security, every nickel of it, the distinguished \ngentleman said.\n  So I introduced S. 605 after the advice of the counsel of the Social \nSecurity Administration itself. I can read paragraph 5 to you:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law throughout each \n     month that begins after October 1st, 1999, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall maintain in a secure repository or \n     repositories cash in a total amount equal to the total \n     redemption value of all obligations issued to the Federal Old \n     Age and Survivors Insurance trust funds--\n\n  The Senator asked me on the floor a little while ago what we are \ngoing to do with it. You are going to comply with the law--\n\n       pursuant to section 201(d) of the Social Security Act that \n     are outstanding on the first day of the month.\n\n  So, yes, complying with the act back in 1935 that we invest the \nmoneys of Social Security in Treasury bills, Government securities and \nimmediately at the first of each month put that money back in trust in \nSocial Security thereby earning its interest, very easily done and \nabsolutely required to the point that if it is not done, it constitutes \na felony in corporate America.\n  I guess the McLain family is going to write me and say, please, don't \nquote my situation anymore. There was one gentleman up there in \nDetroit, where the distinguished Presiding Officer is familiar with, \nbecame the head of the corporation and paid down the company debt with \na pension fund and was sentenced to jail. Now, you could find that \ngentleman, where he is serving, and say, next time run for the Senate; \ninstead of a jail term, you get the ``good government award.''\n  We put in here, with all dignity, we are going to save Social \nSecurity. We are going to have every nickel, every penny spent on \nSocial Security, not on anything else. Here it is. Here is the handout. \nUsing Social Security to reduce the debt. And it is to reduce the debt \nfor any and every other program that you can think of other than Social \nSecurity.\n  Social Security hasn't caused the debt. There is a debt; it doesn't \npay the Social Security debt of $857 billion. It just allows that to \ncontinue to increase the next year to 900 some. If I could get that \nchart, I would like for them to see that.\n  It goes up, then, to 994, almost $1 trillion, and then at the end of \nthe 5-year period you owe $1.6 trillion and at the end of the 10-year \nperiod, you owe some $2.400 trillion. That is paying down the public \ndebt. That is what my colleagues do not want to vote for.\n  Let's keep the conversation and let's keep the debate going so that \nthey all understand. I do not mind voting to kill it, but being in the \nminority--and I happen to be a minority of a minority, and I know how \nminorities feel and have to act; they do the best they can. Some would \nsay I am taking an inordinate amount of time. Well, I have been trying \nto get time on the budget, but every time they get the budget, they \ncontrol the time. I was going to have 20 minutes when we passed the \nbudget resolution. They got me down to 15 minutes. They got me down to \n10. Then when they said I could have 5 and got up to talk, they said, \nno, you only have 3. So how can you explain the facts of life?\n  We do have fiscal cancer, and this amendment continues to spread the \ncancer. You pay down the debt with Social Security moneys so that not \nevery penny goes to Social Security, not every nickel goes to Social \nSecurity, but every penny and every nickel goes to any and other \nprograms that have caused debt.\n  Now, that is running the debt up in Social Security, all trying to \nsave Social Security, trying to pay a worthy cause, trying to pay down \nthe debt, another particular worthy cause.\n  Let me make a proposition to the distinguished Presiding Officer. I \nknow he is conscientious about this particular initiative, so if you \nreally want to pay down the debt, we can go in with a VAT. I know he is \nfor tax cuts. Maybe we can put in a 5-percent value-added tax and cut \nthe payroll tax.\n  It is very, very interesting, because all of these tax cuts, we need. \nThe Government is too big. The Government is too big, so let's cut our \nrevenues, but do not cut the working man's payroll tax, the fellow who \nis keeping the country together by the sweat of his brow. No, take the \nsuper rich where they have $10,000 in the stock market and give them a \ncapital gains tax cut. Take the other rich who have money so they can \nget a write-off to go to college. Take another group and say, what\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nyou need is not to inherit these millions so you can sail around and \njoin all the country clubs and drink up all the liquor and just have a \nhappy time; let's have a reduction in the estate tax, all of these \nthings, never saying cut the payroll tax.\n  What is causing the surplus? What is causing the surplus they never \nget to. They do not have a conscience. I know that the distinguished \nPresiding Officer has a conscience, and maybe he will join me. If we \ncan, you have to give a little in order to get a little, I understand, \nin this political game.\n  I am ready to put a value-added tax out right and allocate it in \nTreasury like we tried to do back in 1988, but I will try it again here \nin 1999. But in order to get some votes, since they are interested in \ngiving tax relief, we can get an offset, a certain amount of the \npayroll tax, a 5-percent cut in the payroll tax, 5-percent value-added \ntax.\n  Once we put that in, then we will really do away with consuming \nAmerica; we will really start paying down the bills and you will \nincrease the strength of the economy and you will, in essence, be \ngiving a double tax cut to that poor fellow in the middle on the \npayroll tax. Those are the men and women who really need consideration.\n  If we can do that and stop spreading this fiscal cancer, Mr. \nPresident, we can really get this country continuing to move into the \nnext century. But what we are doing now, as we are looking at November \n2000--the election--and we have to cut the revenues to increase the \ndebt, all the time talking about we want to pay it down, we want to \nspend Social Security in order to save Social Security, increasing its \ndebt going into the red, and its instability, and otherwise in trade \ncontinue not enforcing our dumping laws, but rather going along with \nbananas and citrus--they think they have something.\n  I don't know how many banana growers we have and how many citrus \ngrowers. I think the citrus comes in a big tanker down in Florida from \nBrazil. They send a big concentrate tanker in, and I would be willing \nto wager that the majority of citrus consumed in the United States is \ncoming out of South America, or maybe Mexico. I remember Castro was \nsending his citrus to Mexico, and Mexico was sending its up here. So it \nwas a foreign aid program for Castro and Cuba all the time with the so-\ncalled embargo.\n  What we need is to continue to have a dynamic manufacturing economic \nstrength program where, like Henry Ford said, ``I want to pay my \nworkers enough money so they can buy what they produce.'' That produced \nand developed the strength of democracy in America, the middle class. \nWhat we are doing with this gamesmanship is saying we are going to pay \ndown debt while we increase the debt, and saying we are going to save \nSocial Security while we savage it, and saying we are looking out for \nthe economy, and the Government is too big, while increasing its size \nand spending for nothing, and increasing the waste, as we give these \nso-called tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, we are on the wrong road. The state of the Union is \nnot all that good. The country is in good shape, but the Government--if \nwe had a board of directors or stockholders to vote on it, and they \nknew exactly what was going on with corporate USA, they would run us \nall off, because it is one grand fraud, a fraud that is intent to \ndeceive.\n  I know the people backing this particular amendment know better. They \nunderstand that when they say they pay down the debt, it sounds pretty, \nbut the truth of the matter is that they take Social Security, \nincreasing its debt, taking its money to pay down the debt, but all the \ntime increasing the national debt and increasing the interest costs and \nincreasing the fiscal cancer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the so-called \nSocial Security lock box legislation, let me again emphasize that we \nDemocrats strongly support the purported goal of protecting Social \nSecurity surpluses. But many of us also feel that this legislation \nwould be a serious mistake, for three reasons.\n  First, it does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows \nCongress to squander funds needed for Medicare on tax breaks for the \nwealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. Under the amendment, an \nunexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social \nSecurity checks.\n  Also, the amendment contains a loophole that would allow Social \nSecurity contributions to be diverted for purposes other than Social \nSecurity benefits, such as risky new privatization schemes or tax \nbreaks.\n  And, third, the amendment threatens a government default. This could \nundermine our nation's credit standing, increase interest costs, block \nbenefit and other payments, and ultimately lead to a world-wide \neconomic crisis.\n  For all these reasons, as I explained in more depth yesterday, I \nbelieve the pending amendment is seriously flawed.\n  Today I want to talk a little more about some of the practical \nproblems involved with the amendment, and why the last minute changes \nproposed by its sponsors fail to adequately address these problems.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us would establish limits on \npublic debt that were constructed based on the Congressional Budget \nOffice's projections for the next ten years. Under the proposal, those \nlimits would be locked into law, and could be changed only for a few \nvery narrow reasons, such as wars or emergencies.\n  But it's important for our colleagues to understand that CBO's \nprojections are highly uncertain. And it doesn't make sense to create \ninflexible and legally-binding debt limits based on those projections.\n  Consider what happened to CBO's budget estimates last year. On March \n6, CBO revised its earlier estimate and said that we would have a \nfiscal year 1998 surplus of $8 billion. That was March 6. Two months \nlater, on May 6, that $8 billion estimate mushroomed to a new estimate \nof $43 to $63 billion.\n  So, in just two months, CBO's surplus projection changed by up to $55 \nbillion. And, I would note, even the upper range of the May estimate \nturned out to be too low. The actual surplus was about $70 billion.\n  Keep in mind that these projections were for a figure five to seven \nmonths in the future. Now we're being asked to rely on projections of \nup to ten years. And if we're wrong, what's the result? A government \ndefault and a world wide economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, you don't have to be a critic of CBO to question the \naccuracy of their estimates. CBO itself devoted an entire chapter of \nits Economic and Budget Outlook to uncertainties in budget projections.\n  CBO compared the actual surpluses for 1988 through 1998 with the \nfirst projection of the surplus it produced five years before the start \nof the fiscal year. Excluding the effects of legislation, the remaining \nerrors averaged about 13 percent of actual outlays.\n  According to CBO, a deviation of 13 percent of projected outlays in \n2004 would produce an increase or decrease in the surplus of about $250 \nbillion. In 2009, a 13 percent error would produce a swing of about \n$300 billion, In fact, since the errors made ten years in advance are \nprobably larger than the errors in estimates made five years ahead--\nwhich, again, is where the 13 percent figure came from--the deviation \nin 2009 is likely to produce an even larger swing.\n  It is simply dangerous to establish a rigid 10-year plan based on \nsuch speculative projections. The whole approach is fundamentally \nflawed.\n  Our Republican colleagues have added two provisions to their \nlegislation that they argue would provide a sufficient cushion to \nprevent an unintended default. But these provisions won't solve the \nproblem.\n  The new proposal would delay the implementation of each year's new \ndebt limit by seven months, to kick in on May 1 of each one- or two-\nyear period rather than on October 1. The sponsors argue that this \nwould make the new limit effective at a time when the Treasury tends to \nbe flush with cash. This, they say, would ensure that the new, lower \nlimit would not immediately trigger a default.\n  Unfortunately, this change is like plugging a small hole on the \nTitanic. And it won't prevent disaster.\n  First, it can only work if the CBO projections on which the debt \nlimits are based prove accurate. And, as I've already discussed, we \nknow they won't be.\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\n  But even if by some miracle the estimates are right, that still may \nnot take care of the problem.\n  Let's take, for example, a year in which there is a recession. Now, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle will point out that they have \nprovided an exception for recessions. But that exception won't work \nvery well.\n  Mr. President, we're not very good at predicting recessions. And, \ntypically, by the time we know we're in one, we've actually been in it \nfor a while.\n  The recession exception in the amendment only kicks in after we have \ntwo quarters of low economic growth. But a slowdown could easily begin \nin one quarter, but late enough to keep growth for that quarter above \nthe threshold for the exception. We then might have two quarters of low \ngrowth followed a few weeks later by the release of the official data \ntriggering the exception.\n  By that time, we would be eight or nine months into a recession. We \nwould have had months of lower tax revenues and higher outlays for \nunemployment compensation and other programs. And, together, those \nchanges already could have pushed us over the new debt limit and into \ndefault.\n  Mr. President, a recession exception does no good if it is declared a \nfew months after we've gone into default. We cannot take default back \nand say an exception should have been in place.\n  It already would have happened. And Americans would have to pay for \nit through higher interest rates on their mortgages, car loans, and \ncredit cards. Businesses would have to pay for it through higher \nborrowing costs. And taxpayers would have to pay for it because \ninvestors will demand higher interest rates on Treasury bonds.\n  This would be an economic disaster for our country. And it would \ncreate an international economic crisis of unknown dimensions.\n  Mr. President, under the Republican lock box, I'm afraid the question \nis not ``will this happen?'' The question is ``when will it happen?''\n  That more than anything is why this proposal is so irresponsible. \nIt's why Secretary Rubin is recommending a veto. And it's why it's so \nimportant that senators be allowed to offer amendments to improve it.\n  Mr. President, this proposal was finalized only yesterday afternoon. \nAnd when they presented it, the sponsors themselves expressed openness \nto further tinkering. Unfortunately, there will be no opportunity to \nmake any improvements unless we reject cloture tomorrow.\n  So I would urge all my colleagues to oppose cloture. This proposal is \nseriously flawed. If we're serious about protecting Social Security, \nlet's take the time to do it right.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Idaho \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the debate today on the floor on S. 557 is \nnot a fraud; it is a real shakeup with reality that a lot of our \nSenators and some Members of this Congress don't want to face, because \nfor years we have had the tremendous flexibility in this country of \nborrowing money from the Social Security trust fund and spending, and \nspending, and spending.\n  I think the American public is suggesting to us that that time ought \nto come to an end. There is no question that, in 1994, it began to come \nto an end. Some Senators can't face the reality of the changes that \noccurred then. But the American economy did, and it responded robustly \nwhen Government curbed its appetite to progressively spend a greater \namount of the gross domestic product of this country. And it is now \nwith a balanced budget and a surplus, generated by Social Security \npayroll taxes, that we have an opportunity to turn to the American \npeople and, for the first time in a long while, say to the American \npeople that we can not only ensure your Social Security without a new \ntax increase, but we can modernize it for future generations so that it \nwill be a reliable and an earning annuity of the kind that most people \nwould like their retirement account to be.\n  At the end of this fiscal year, the Social Security trust fund will \nhold an estimated $853 billion. This year alone, it is projected to run \na $127 billion surplus. The Social Security trust fund's $853 billion \nbalance equals roughly half of the total Federal budget for this year. \nIt equals America's total income tax payment for this year. Every cent \nof every dollar that every American pays in income tax will just equal \nthe Social Security trust fund balance. Yet, how much actual money has \nbeen set aside for Social Security's $853 billion balance? Not one \ncent. Not one cent.\n  Why are we, then, arguing about the concept, if not the reality, of \nan idea that begins to set it aside? Now we are starting to split the \nhairs on how it is set aside. I don't think it is time for that \nanymore, because I believe the American people no longer trust us. You \ncannot argue Social Security from 1935 to today and say, ``Trust us,'' \nbecause the American people have said, ``You spent the money, you \nindebted the country.'' We are saying that time should stop.\n  Of course, the White House is playing one of the most phenomenal \ndouble standards that I have ever seen a White House play, because, as \nwe know, President Clinton proposes quite the opposite today from what \nhe proposed a year ago. I have not seen the Senator from South \nCarolina, in any way, try to defend what his President is talking \nabout--and I am glad he isn't--because what the President talked about \nis raiding Social Security this year, when last year he said that every \npenny of it ought not to be spent, except for Social Security.\n  What we are suggesting to the President is that he honor his first \ncommitment instead of his latter commitment. What was it called? Save \nSocial Security first. This year, he wants to spend $158 billion of the \nsurplus, and he just sent up a bill for $6 billion more. Perhaps the \ntime has come when defending the definition of ``is'' really isn't \nworth defending because what was last year isn't this year.\n  The American people are very wise to the man in the White House who \nsays one thing one day and contradicts himself the next day with a \nstraight face. President Clinton's proposal reminds me of St. \nAugustine's confession on having prayed for chastity-- ``but not just \nyet.''\n  Over the last holiday, I traveled home to my State of Idaho. I spoke \nto hundreds of people across my State about Social Security. I called \nit ``seniors to seniors'' town meetings. I asked the high school \nteachers to send their seniors from high school, and I asked the AARP \nand the senior centers to ask if their seniors would attend. We had the \ncharts and we had the graphs of Social Security, and where it is, and \nwhere it is from the 1983 act, and how it will be solvent to 2014 or \n2015, and then by 2034 it is in trouble. Everybody sat and listened and \nanticipated.\n  Then we talked about the surplus and the opportunity to modernize, as \na result of that, to transition ourselves generationally into the 21st \ncentury with the true annuity program that not in any way blights the \nAmerican economy but probably creates the kind of energy and driving \nforce it deserves. It was not where we just played the old pyramid, \nBismarckian game of Social Security where you had 1 retiree versus 8 or \n10 at the base paying.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is right when he talks about the \nworking person today and that response, because in 2034--I think I \nmight be around then--I am going to be a Social Security recipient. I \nam going to be getting more than $1,000 a month in Social Security. \nThere are going to be two people out there working, each one of them \npaying $500 out of their hard-earned money so I can live well. That is \na travesty.\n  I have a feeling that my grandkids are going to turn and say, \n``Grandpa, we can't afford you anymore. You are a liability to us \nbecause we can't afford to put our kids in college because your Social \nSecurity is costing us too much.''\n  So what does that have to do with the debate this evening? It has a \ngreat deal to do with this debate, because what we are talking about is \na generational opportunity. I am not going to debate Reagan economics. \nThat would be like debating FDR and blaming him for the big Government \nwe have today, and forgetting Congresses from FDR to today that could \nhave made those changes.\n  We have changed a lot since Ronald Reagan and George Bush. My guess \nis, decades from now we will change a lot more from what the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nSouth Carolina or the Senator from Idaho will do or would be about to \ndo. That is the way our Government should work. It is not stagnant. It \nis not static. It is dynamic, sometimes for positive and sometimes for \nnegative.\n  But today and tomorrow, a balanced budget and a true surplus on the \noperating accounts means we have a generational opportunity to make a \nchange like none I have seen in the years I have had a chance to serve \nIdaho in the Congress.\n  Idahoans find it hard to believe that the President and future \nCongresses can resist the temptation to raid future surpluses and spend \nthem. Why should they trust us? That is what we have done in the past. \nSure enough, we have a balanced budget, and now we are at war in \nKosovo, and here comes a new bill for $6 billion. What are we going to \ndo? My guess is we could tighten our belt just a little bit, guarantee \nthe stability of Social Security and the integrity of the trust fund, \nand recognize the priority of war, as past Americans did, over certain \nkinds of domestic spending, and spend accordingly.\n  That is going to be the test of this Congress in the coming days, and \nit is a legitimate test, it is a responsible test.\n  So I thank Senator Abraham, Senator Domenici, Senator Ashcroft, and \nothers who, like many Americans, said, you know, we have an \nopportunity, and let's build a lockbox safeguard to assure that we can \nmake this generational shift to modernize Social Security for the 21st \ncentury, to guarantee it to those who are receiving today and those who \nwill receive from this system in the near future, but possibly--just \npossibly--create an environment where we can make some changes for the \nfuture.\n  I say it is nothing short of historical. I believe it to be true. For \nthe first time since Social Security began over 60 years ago, we would \nset aside all its moneys for all its intended purposes. This would \namount to about $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\n  The Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft proposal would require 60 votes for the \nSenate to dip into the Social Security surplus. And it would require \nthe money be set aside by instituting and then lowering a limit on the \npublic debt. It is a legislative money belt for Social Security. It is \nnot a straitjacket for government. We recognize there are true \nemergencies. While as much as 29 days ago we would not have recognized \nourselves in war, we now must recognize that we are at war. So we have \nshown the flexibility for that concern.\n  It would allow an exemption for real Social Security reform. It would \nsave not only Social Security money but Federal money too.\n  Setting aside Social Security surpluses also means retiring Federal \ndebt. I don't care how the debt was generated. The public holds the \ndebt in a general sense. It may have been generated by defense spending \nor social spending. Government borrowed the money and spent it. The \ndebt is not categorical to each area of government. We all know that.\n  So I think it reasonably unfair to debate it in that manner. That is \nwhy we focus on the debt as debt held by the public.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, compared to spending \nthat $1.8 trillion, as has been done until now, setting it aside would \nreduce Federal interest payments $468 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Some Senators want to talk about a tax increase to fund the largess \nof Government. How about running the system right so we save that kind \nof obligation and outlay? $468 billion worth of savings in 10 years is \npretty darned good. It can be done, and we should do it now with a \nbalanced budget and a surplus.\n  We save Social Security's $1.8 trillion surplus for its modernization \nof the system, and we save $468 billion in interest payments as a \nresult.\n  Guaranteeing Social Security and guaranteeing savings--who wants to \nbe against that?\n  Now there are going to be some who will find rather unique arguments \nto say we have to vote ``no'' against this. It is a political trap for \nthe year 2000. How about a political reality for the 21st century? That \nis what this legislation is all about--guaranteeing Social Security and \nguaranteeing savings.\n  Who wants to be against that? The same people who wanted to raid it \nfor $158 billion this year. I would expect the American people do not \nfind that too surprising.\n  John Dillinger hated bank vaults. It made his job harder.\n  Big spenders in Washington will hate this lockbox because it leaves \ntheir appetite for spending without food.\n  In last year's State of the Union Address on the other side of this \nvery Capitol, President Clinton said:\n\n       I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--\n     that's every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all \n     the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security \n     system for the 21st century.\n\n  What a difference a year makes, or a word, or the opportunity to \nfocus the American public in a different direction. Now he proposes not \nto keep his promise. But, rather than admitting he opposes it because \nof his desire to keep his hand in the Social Security cookie jar, he \nuses the same old scare tactics to which he has always resorted when \ncornered.\n  The administration has sent us a veto threat on the Social Security \nlockbox. That has been about the 40th or 50th veto threat we have had \nfrom this administration in a reasonably short period of time.\n  It is also out of date--remarking on a proposal that is far different \nfrom what we debate here today, because that veto threat had the \nquestion of money management in it. And that was taken care of by the \nauthors of this bill.\n  Why did President Clinton claim to oppose the security lockbox?\n  First, he claimed that it would hurt in times of recession.\n  If we are in a recession, we can declare that to be an emergency and \nwe all know that. However, the proposal before the Senate would not \neven apply in a time of recession. We have taken that safeguard.\n  Second, President Clinton claims it would limit the Treasury's \nability to manage the Government's normal cash flow. This, however, has \nbeen addressed in the legislation now before the Senate. In addition, \nlimits already exist on Treasury's ability to borrow and have since \n1917. Listen to your Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. President. Does \nPresident Clinton want us to abandon the statutory debt limit that now \nexists? I presume, under his Treasury's twisted logic, that he would \noppose the existing legal limits if it were now being offered for the \nfirst time.\n  It is ironic that he uses his Treasury Secretary to make his \nopposition for him. This is the same Treasury Secretary that just 3 \nyears ago circumvented the existing statutory debt limit by raiding \nSocial Security trust funds for billions of dollars. Let me repeat \nthat: The President who appoints a Secretary of the Treasury and says \nleave every dime in the trust funds is the same President whose \nSecretary of the Treasury just 3 years ago moved the law around \nexisting statutory debt limits by raiding Social Security trust funds \nfor billions of dollars.\n  They called that disinvestment. ``Scheme'' is a better word. I call \ntheir opposition now disingenuous, because if that was disinvestment, \nwhat they say today is truly disingenuous to what this Congress wants \nto do and what the American people have demanded and are now asking \nfor.\n  Other than these, President Clinton offers no reason with any \njustification to argue opposing the lockbox. He claims it will not help \nthe Social Security trust fund, and others are now claiming that, too. \nYet saving the surplus is what he proposed just a year ago. I guess now \nthat we are proposing it, it is not a good idea; when he proposes it, \nit is a good idea.\n  Does he claim that his spending of $158 billion of the Social \nSecurity trust fund over the next 5 years will help Social Security? \nPresident Clinton also claims, again, that his phony transfer scheme \nwould help Social Security. I could go on in those details, but other \nSenators are waiting to speak on this issue.\n  There ought to be no schemes or gimmicks this time. This is a very \nstraightforward proposal. I guess it is honesty that frustrates the \nother side. It is clarity, it is easy to understand by the American \npeople. The idea that you just cannot spend at will anymore, you have \nto balance your budget and you have to face the hard truth of spending,\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nand maybe the honest truth that if you are going to spend more, you \nhave to tax more. Then you give the Congress a choice: Should we cut \nspending to balance the budget, or should we shift our priorities in a \ntime of war, while assuring to the American people that their pensions, \ntheir retirement, their security will remain stable and that the \nCongress will not raid it. That is what the issue is here.\n  It is not a matter of quoting history anymore. It is a matter of \nlooking into the future. It is a matter of taking the unique \nopportunities today that we have to move forward.\n  In those town meetings that I held across Idaho less than 3 weeks \nago, I think senior citizens left feeling that Social Security for \nthemselves was intact; they also left recognizing that probably their \ngrandchildren did not expect it to be there for them, that they would \npay three or four times more money into it and get three or four times \nless out of it. I think it is time that we think about all generations \nof Americans, young and old alike.\n  I voted for the 1983 Social Security Reform Act. I am proud that we \nbuilt that strength and that stability into the system, but I am not at \nall proud of the way this Congress spent the reserves in those trust \naccounts and built the debt that it built. While there is a lot of \nfingerpointing as to how that debt got there, there is one easy way to \nsolve it; that is, to vote no.\n\n  Finally, we have a Congress that is willing to face up to it. Out of \nthat Congress comes a balanced budget. Out of that balanced budget \ncomes a surplus. Out of that surplus comes the unique opportunity to \nstrengthen and modernize Social Security. We do that by assuring to the \nAmerican people that we will no longer borrow it off into all branches \nof government, but that we will lock it up, we will pay down debt, we \nwill increase the strength and the financial stability of our \ngovernment and we will honor the trust funds' commitments to recipients \nof Social Security. That is what the debate is about today. That is \nwhat we have created with S. 557. No more, no less.\n  We don't need to quote a lot of history. The American people know \nwhat we have done. Most importantly, they are extremely excited about \nwhat we are proposing to do. For the first time, there is a strength of \nhonesty and stability to their government with balanced budgets and \nsurpluses that they have not seen for a long while. They are not \nfearful of debt anymore because debt begins to decline. More \nimportantly, we begin to pay it down so that we have the strength to \nhonor our commitments in the future.\n  That is what S. 557 is all about. I am amazed it finds opposition. I \nthink it ought to be bipartisan. It is, without question, the way to \nsave Social Security: Honor its commitments and project its strength \nand its modernization into the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nLott-Domenici Social Security lockbox amendment. This is the first real \nstep in the effort to save Social Security. I thank the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, and Senator Abraham for their hard work \nin drafting this legislation and ensuring it comes to this Senate \nfloor.\n  During my campaign last year for the Senate, I visited almost every \nregion of the State of Ohio. During those visits, I asked the question \nof those in attendance, How many in this room pay a payroll tax? Every \nhand went up. Then I asked, How many of you expect to receive Social \nSecurity? Only those close to retirement raised their hands.\n  It was perplexing to me because it verified something my son George \nsaid to me--George, the summa cum laude graduate, undergraduate law \nschool, CFE of a corporation--``Dad, I'm not going to see a dime of \nSocial Security.''\n  What a terrible thing, in a country like ours, where about two-thirds \nof the people who pay more into the Social Security funds than they do \nin taxes don't believe when the time comes for them to retire there is \ngoing to be anything there for them. I said during those visits that I \nwas going to do everything I could to put a firewall between the Social \nSecurity trust fund and the general fund of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I think we all recognize that part of the problem that we have had in \nthis country since the Vietnam war is that after that war we didn't \nhave the money to pay for it, nor did we have the money to pay for the \ngreat society. So we took the trust funds and placed them into the \ngeneral fund, using them to mask a deficit. In other words, we weren't \nwilling to pay for those things that we were spending our money on.\n  Today, we have a chance to pass some legislation which gives honor to \nthe sacred trust between the Federal Government and every American. I \nbelieve we need to get away from treating the Social Security trust \nfund as a part of the budget and wall it off from any temptation to use \nit for tax cuts or for new spending. We have been playing games with \nSocial Security for too long. It is time to stop.\n  The Senator from Idaho in his remarks today mentioned the fact that \nthe President will be sending up a request for some $6 billion to pay \nfor the war in Kosovo. The American people should know that that money \nis going to come from Social Security.\n  Because the Social Security surplus is all there is. That is the \nsurplus that we have today. There is not any onbudget surplus. There \nwill not be any onbudget surplus until the year 2001, if we are lucky.\n  So it seems to me that one way we can guarantee to my son and to all \nthose other people I visited during that campaign, and to the American \npeople, that one way we can at least begin to guarantee there will be \nsomething there when they retire is to put that money away so it cannot \nbe touched.\n  I wish there was a way you could put it into Fort Knox, so it could \nnot be touched. But the fact of the matter is, the way this Government \nworks today is that money in the Social Security trust fund is used to \nbuy Treasury bills that are then used to pay for a lot of things that \nwe do not have money to pay for. The thing about this lockbox proposal \nis that it takes all the Social Security trust fund and uses it to pay \ndown the public debt, which means instead of it being used for spending \nprograms, at least we are going to get the benefit for a period of time \nof paying down that public debt.\n  I think it is real important that we are candid with the American \npeople and tell them this is not the end of the solution, we have to \ntackle reform of Social Security. But one step, one gigantic step is \nfor the first time saying we are no longer going to use it to pay for \nspending programs.\n  In all due respect to the President of the United States, when this \ndebate started several months ago, he said: I want to protect Social \nSecurity and I am going to use 62 percent of the unified budget, as \nSenator Hollings just said here this afternoon, to protect Social \nSecurity. The fact of the matter is the only surplus we have is Social \nSecurity, so he is going to take 62 percent of the Social Security \nsurplus to protect it and use the other 38 percent of it for spending \nprograms or whatever. On my side of the aisle, they talked about using \nthe 38 percent to reduce taxes. On the other side of the aisle, we are \ngoing to use it for a little tax reduction, we are going to use it for \nspending programs, protect this and protect that. But it was a fraud. \nThe only surplus we have is Social Security.\n  So I am really quite concerned that today we hear the President \nsaying: I am going to veto this legislation. Either you are for taking \nthe first step to protect Social Security or you are not. You also \nought to be in favor of putting all of this in the lockbox because you \nknow what it is going to do? It is going to force us, if we want to \nkeep the budget agreement, or if we want to maintain the budget caps, \nto find some other money; either reprioritize the dollars that are \nbeing spent on other programs or perhaps raise the dollars, raise more \nmoney to pay for these programs on which people want to spend money.\n  I repeat, all of this started back after the Vietnam war. We will \nhave a big decision here one of these days to decide whether or not we \nare going to get involved in an all-out war with Serbia. That is going \nto cost a whole lot of money and the American people ought to know that \none of the considerations is how are we going to pay for it? Are\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nwe going to pay for it with the Social Security surplus? Are we going \nto borrow the money? Think about it.\n  I have a great deal of respect for Senator Hollings. I think he and I \nare the only ones who had amendments to use the onbudget surplus to \nreduce the debt. I concur in that. I think that is what we ought to do.\n  I just had my second grandchild and my grandchildren's gift from the \nFederal Government was a bill for $187,000 to pay interest on a debt \nthey had nothing to do with. I think it is horrible that this debt \nkeeps going up. Senator Hollings is right; the debt is going to \ncontinue to go up.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Certainly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio. He got a lot of heat. But what he was trying to do, like we \nboth did as Governors, is just hold the line and make certain that we \ncan save something. On the figures of the Congressional Budget Office, \nhe said 2001, they said 2006, that there would be an actual surplus and \nwe could then pay down the debt. So I voted for the Voinovich \namendment, and the distinguished Senator helped me on our amendment. We \ngot 24 and he got even more votes, if I remember.\n\n  So I congratulate the Senator's sincerity in his endeavor. Let me ask \nthe distinguished Senator the question, when he says the only surplus \nwe have is that of Social Security, that is true, although we have some \nother surpluses in the military retirement, civil service retirement, \nand other matters here. But isn't it the fact that the only debt we \nhave is other than Social Security? In other words, Social Security has \nnot caused the Government debt, be it public debt, private debt, or any \nother kind of debt, because we have been paying off Social Security and \nenjoying the surplus each year since 1983. Is that not the case? I \nmean, when you say pay off the debt----\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. It is my understanding what we would do with this \nlockbox money is to use it to pay down the public debt, which would \nlower the interest costs to our Federal budget every year. But at the \nsame time it would mean that money ultimately would have to be paid \nback to the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right. But when you say ``pay it back,'' you will use \nSocial Security moneys to pay down debt that is caused by any and every \nother Government program, be it entitlements or defense or foreign aid \nor Kosovo or military pay that we voted for--whatever it is--but it is \nnot a debt that was caused by Social Security. Is that correct?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield, that is correct. But the \nalternative to that, from my perspective, is that the money, the Social \nSecurity money, would then be used for spending programs that could be \nused to pay for the war or to pay for education or pay for a lot of \nother things.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And that is how you pay for it, by paying down their \ndebt. You pay down the debt of the war, the debt of the spending \nprogram and everything else. That is what we have been doing. That is \nwhy on this chart, I showed it, under CBO we owe Social Security $857 \nbillion. The particular amendment that has been introduced and is now \nsubject to a vote tomorrow does not pay down Social Security's debt. It \npays down the public debt, which is any and every other debt than \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I say to the Senator, in all due respect, that is a \nwhole lot better than doing nothing at this time, when he knows and I \nknow if it is there to be taken--let's just take what the President \ndid. The President said, ``I want to protect Social Security,'' and \nsaid, ``but I want to use 38 percent of it for other spending \nprograms.'' This would eliminate this money being used for those other \nspending programs. This would allow the money to be used to pay down \nthe debt and give us a little time in the meantime to come up with a \nreal reform of that Social Security program. We know that is something \nthis Congress is going to have to do if we really want to guarantee to \nthe next generation that there will be something there for them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I know the Senator was not here with Senator John \nHeinz, a Republican Senator from Philadelphia. He and I worked together \nback in 1990 and we held the floor for quite some time. We thought at \nthat time--that is why I am questioning and speaking advisedly--we \nthought at that time we had a lockbox. We put in section 13301.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have section 13301 printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That said, you could not use Social Security in a \nunified budget; namely, you could not use it for any spending programs, \ntax cuts, and everything else. But they ignored it, since it was only a \nbudget law and we did not make it a criminal statute to lock up the \nCongress or lock up the President of the United States for doing it.\n  It has been totally honored in the disobedience thereof. We have not \ndone it. Now I work with the administrator of Social Security. I want \nto show this to the distinguished Senator. It is S. 605, and it puts \nthe money over in Treasury. You said you wish we could put it in Fort \nKnox. I can change that if the distinguished Senator would cosponsor \nit. We will say put it in Fort Knox, not to be spent for any purpose \nother than Social Security. It can be done.\n  The dilemma we are in is, section 201 of the original Social Security \nAct says to use those moneys to buy Treasury bills or Government \nsecurities. Don't leave the money, then, with the Government when you \nbuy that security. Count that same amount of money to be transferred \nback into the Social Security trust fund. Thereby, you have the money \nand you have also earned the interest each month.\n  That is the way to do it, under the counsel of the Social Security \nAdministration. I have checked it with other lawyers because I had been \nfrustrated. I thought we had a lockbox. Oh, boy, Senator Heinz and I \ntalked about the lockbox back in 1990, and President George Bush, on \nNovember 5, signed it into law. That is the law today. That is \nreiterated in this amendment to S. 557, on page 3:\n\n       Congress reaffirms its support of the provisions of section \n     13301.\n\n  But then on page 10, they spend it. What do they spend it for? For \ndebt. Who caused that debt? All other programs, all programs other than \nSocial Security. Social Security does not cause public debt, it is \ncaused by other programs. That is how they get around the nuance of \nspending it.\n  What we have, I say to the Senator, is a lockbox that everybody has \nthe key to except one group--the Social Security folks. When you pay \ndown the public debt, you can spend it for everything because that is \nwhat causes the public debt. That is why I was a little taken aback--\nyou try to talk politely on the floor, and my distinguished friend from \nIdaho said he was really worried about the honesty of this thing. You \ndon't want me to get up and holler about the dishonesty, because I know \nthe intent of the distinguished Senator from Michigan who offered it is \ngood. I would not accuse him of being dishonest. But it is inaccurate, \nI can tell you that. It is totally, totally inaccurate to say that you \nhave a lockbox. It is misleading when you use\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nthe expression ``pay down the public debt.''\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield, one of the things I have \nlearned, and this is my 33rd year in the business, is that you crawl \nand you walk and you run. You tried with Senator Heinz to come up with \nsomething you thought was going to lock it up.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I have been working with Senator Domenici since the \nday I came here to figure out something, and it is not easy to put that \nlockbox in place. Based on all of the information that I have, the best \nthing that we could do at this stage of the game, if we really want to \nblock it off, is this legislation. It may not be perfect, but the fact \nof the matter is that it is much better than the current situation \nwhich allows the Social Security surplus to be used for spending \nprograms.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In violation of section 13301.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield, you know and I know, we \nhave had all that language in there, and they keep doing it. They have \nused that money to pay for new programs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You are right.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. They have used that money to provide for tax \nreductions. Can you imagine that, tax reductions?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. I agree. You are exactly right on that score, \nand you and I have the same intent. But I am trying to explain the best \nI can. All you have to do is read the language.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a document titled ``The \nSocial Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, Summary of \nAmendment,'' dated April 20, 1999, by the majority staff be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act\n\n\n                  summary of amendment, april 20, 1999\n\n       The Act is effective for ten years and then sunsets. This \n     is the same time period covered by the recently adopted \n     Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000--\n     H. Con. Res. 68. It is a period of time in which the Social \n     Security Trust Fund balances are expected to grow by nearly \n     $1.8 trillion. These balances would retire debt held by the \n     public which would help prepare the country for the \n     retirement of the baby boom generation early in the next \n     century.\n       1. Reaffirms Off-Budget Treatment of Social Security \n     Program.--The Act reaffirms current law that the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Social Security trust funds shall not be \n     counted for the purposes of the federal budget submitted to \n     Congress by the President or any Congressional budget.\n       The Act creates a new budget act point of order against \n     Congress adopting a budget that uses social security \n     surpluses to achieve balance, and requires the President to \n     submit a budget that does the same.\n       2. Uses the Social Security Surplus to Reduce the Debt Held \n     by the Public.--The Act establishes a new enforceable limit \n     on the amount of debt held by the public over the period from \n     2000 to 2010. These debt limits specified in the Act are \n     current estimates of the level of borrowing from the public \n     over this period that result from the social security surplus \n     only being used to retire public debt. The surplus could not \n     be used for non-social security spending or tax cuts. \n     Legislation increasing these limits would require a super-\n     majority vote in the Senate.\n       The Act establishes the first limit to become effective as \n     of May 1, 2000, and effectively ratchets down this limit May \n     1 and periodically thereafter. The effective date \n     accommodates Treasury Department's federal cash management \n     responsibilities. The newly established debt held by the \n     public limits would not disrupt the cash management \n     operations of the Bureau of the Public Debt nor would it \n     jeopardize Social Security benefit payments.\n       The limits follow:\n\n     May 1, 2000 through April 30, 2001--$3.628 trillion\n     May 1, 2001 through April 30, 2002--$3.512 trillion\n     May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004--$3.383 trillion\n     May 1, 2004 through April 30, 2006--$3.100 trillion\n     May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2008--$2.775 trillion\n     May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2010--$2.404 trillion\n\n       3. Adjustments to Limits for: Social Security Reform, \n     Recessions, Emergencies and War.--1. Social Security Reform. \n     The Act authorizes adjustments to the limits established for \n     legislation enacted that reforms social security during this \n     time period. If Social Security reform legislation is \n     enacted, and if that legislation has the effect of changing \n     the debt held by the public specified in this Act, then the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall adjust the limits in this Act \n     to reflect those changes.\n       2. Recessions. The provisions of this Act are suspended \n     during a period of low economic growth. Two consecutive \n     quarters of less than 1 percent real economic growth would \n     automatically make the debt limits in this Act inoperative. \n     After the recession has ended, the Act would reinstate new \n     debt limit levels adjusted for the impact of the recession.\n       3. Emergencies. The Act also provides for an automatic \n     adjustment to the debt limit levels specified if, after the \n     adoption of this Act, the Congress enacts into law \n     ``emergency'' spending defined under the Balanced Budget Act. \n     If emergency spending uses a non-social security surplus, \n     then no adjustment to the limits would be necessary. If, \n     however, emergency spending requires the usage of social \n     security surpluses, then the limits specified in the Act \n     would be adjusted for that amount.\n       4. Declaration of War. The Act would be suspended upon \n     Congress enacting a declaration of war.\n\n              PROJECTIONS OF FEDERAL DEBT ASSUMING THAT ON-BUDGET SURPLUSES ARE REDUCED TO ZERO AFTER 2000 USING CBO'S MARCH 1999 BASELINE\n                                                        [By fiscal years, in billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt Held by the Public at the       3,771     3,720     3,628     3,512     3,383     3,245     3,100     2,945     2,775     2,595     2,404     2,203\n Beginning of the Year..........\nChanges:\n    Surplus \\1\\.................       -69      -111      -133      -145      -153      -162      -171      -184      -193      -204      -212      -218\n    Other.......................        18        19        16        16        16        16        15        14        13        12        11        11\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.....................       -51       -92      -117      -129      -137      -145      -156      -169      -180      -191      -201      -206\nDebt Held by the Public at the       3,720     3,628     3,512     3,383     3,245     3,100     2,945     2,775     2,595     2,404     2,203     1,997\n End of the Year................\nDebt Held by Govt Accounts......     1,769     1,956     2,164     2,376     2,601     2,833     3,072     3,321     3,577     3,842     4,107     4,373\nGross Federal Debt..............     5,479     5,584     5,676     5,758     5,846     5,933     6,016     6,096     6,172     6,246     6,311     6,370\nDebt Subject to Limit...........     5,439     5,545     5,838     5,721     5,809     5,897     5,981     6,062     6,139     6,214     6,279     6,339\n \n                                                                 AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP\n \nDebt Held by the Public at the       44.3%     41.4%     38.6%     35.7%     32.8%     29.9%     27.2%     24.5%     21.9%     19.4%     17.0%     14.8%\n End of the Year................\nMEMORANDUM\nBaseline Total Surplus..........        69       111       133       156       212       213       239       263       309       338       358       383\nOn-Budget Deficit (-) or Surplus       -30       -16        -5        11        59        61        68        79       116       134       146       165\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Surpluses are shown here as negative because they decrease the debt.\n \nNOTES.--Projections of debt assume that discretionary spending will equal the statutory caps on such spending through 2002 and will grow at the rate of\n  inflation thereafter. Reduction of the on-budget surpluses is assumed to have no effect on trust fund holdings.\n \nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator has the floor. I apologize for \ninterrupting. It says: ``Uses the Social Security Surplus to Reduce the \nDebt. . . .'' Then it goes on to say:\n\n       The surplus could not be used for non-social Security \n     spending or tax cuts.\n\n  But when you say pay down the debt, that is actually what you are \ndoing, is using the money for non-Social Security spending or maybe a \ntax cut, but it is not Social Security spending.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield, the problem that we have is \nthat currently under the law, my understanding is that you need to buy \nthe special Social Security Treasury bills with this money, and when \nyou do that, the Federal Government has those dollars. What they have \nbeen doing with those dollars is paying for programs that they would \nnot be able to pay for if they had not been using those special bills.\n  This legislation at least stops that from occurring.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. It is going to take the money, and instead of spending \nit, at least we are going to get the benefit\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nof reducing the debt which brings down the interest rate. It is a \nworthy alternative to the current situation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have about $3.6 billion in public debt and about \n$1.8 billion or $1.9 billion in Government debt. Yes, you reduce the \npublic debt, but you increase the Social Security or Government debt. \nWhat happens is the overall debt continues to go up.\n  It is like I explained a little bit earlier about having two credit \ncards. I have a Visa card and a MasterCard. I want to pay down the \npublic debt with the MasterCard. I said what I will do is use my Visa. \nSo I pay down the MasterCard with the Visa card, but my name is on the \nVisa card, and I owe just that same amount of money.\n  You can see by paying down the public debt, that is the unified \ndeficit using the trust funds. It has been going down, and even the \nregular debt has been going down until now. It is going to start back \nup. The overall debt has been increasing up, up and away. It was less \nthan $1 trillion.\n  This is the cancer you and I worry about, not just the Social \nSecurity recipient getting their money, but it was less than $1 \ntrillion when President Johnson balanced the budget, and the interest \ncost was only 16. Now it is $5.7 trillion and interest costs of almost \n$1 billion a day. That is all for nothing. That is almost $340 billion \nin increased spending each and every year for absolutely nothing. That \nis the biggest waste. When you say Government is big, that is the big \npart.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. We are spending $600 million a day on interest costs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Actually almost a billion a day. Interest costs are \nover $363.8 billion a year. So the debt is going up.\n  That is a beautiful little description that Alan Greenspan and the \nrest give that when you pay down the public debt, the interest costs go \ndown. That is not the fact at all. Interest costs continue to increase.\n  The Senator from Ohio has been very indulgent. He has the floor, and \nI apologize. I think he and I have the same frustration and the same \nintent. I advisedly and very seriously and very sincerely say look at \nthis particular entry on page 3. That is exactly what they do, they \nreaffirm the lockbox, but on page 10 they transfer the money back to \nthe debt, and it is every and any debt but Social Security. It can be \nspent for any and every amount, and it runs up Social Security and that \ngoes into the national debt and that goes into the interest costs and \nthat continues to increase. That is what has happened.\n  When I was Governor, we had an insurance scandal, and we began to \nclean up the industry. One of the companies reorganized and said, ``Now \nwe need a new slogan.'' I said, ``Capital Life will surely pay if the \nsmall print on the back don't take it away.'' That is exactly what we \nhave here in this amendment. You have it on page 3, the lockbox, and \nnow on page 10, you take it away.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The Senator yields back his time. Thank you.\n  I have enjoyed the discussion we have had. Obviously, there is a \ndifference of opinion between the Senator from South Carolina and the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Based on all of the research work that I have done, and the options \nthat are available to us, to me this is the most practical way, Mr. \nPresident, to deal with the problem that we have had for too long in \nthis country. I believe that with the passage of this lockbox \nlegislation, we are going to go a long way in making sure that this \nmoney is not being used for spending programs that we are unwilling to \npay for and have not been willing to pay for in the past. The real \nbeginning of the deficits that we have had began when we merged the \nSocial Security surplus in with the unified budget and started to spend \nit.\n  In fact, in 1979 the national debt was something like $860 billion. \nToday it is $5.7 trillion. I believe that this is the first step that \nwe need to take to restore trust in those people in this country who \nare worried about Social Security, understanding that it is not \nperfect--understanding that it is not perfect--and understanding that \nthis Congress needs to come together, on a bipartisan basis, hopefully \nwith the leadership of the President, and tackle the problems that we \nhave with the Social Security system in terms of guaranteeing its \nviability for the future. And that is something that hopefully we will \nget to this year; and if not then, hopefully next year; and if we do \nnot then, when we elect a new President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a few \nseconds here. The statement was made that it would not put Social \nSecurity in a straitjacket. But the amendment does.\n  I have the letter here from the distinguished Secretary of the \nTreasury. In yesterday's debate, we introduced the letter, \nsubstantially the same, dated March 17.\n  This is dated April 21. It explains the serious objections that the \ndistinguished Secretary of the Treasury has to the particular \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: This letter transmit an analysis of the Social \n     Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act, the \n     amendment offered by Chairman Domenici and Senators Abraham \n     and Ashcroft to S. 557, which is currently being debated on \n     the Senate floor. This Act would create new statutory limits \n     on debt held by the public in addition to the existing \n     ceiling on the total debt held by the public and the Federal \n     trust funds. Our analysis indicates that this provision could \n     preclude the United States from meeting its financial \n     obligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit \n     payments--including Social Security checks--and could also \n     worsen a future economic downturn. Let me refer you to my \n     earlier letter as I will not repeat here all of the concerns \n     I have with this proposal. For all of the reasons I mention \n     there, I would recommend to the President that he veto this \n     Act if it were presented to him for his signature.\n       It is still my view and the view of the Administration that \n     fiscal restraint is best exercised through the tools of the \n     budget process. Debt limits should not be used as an \n     additional means of imposing restraint. By the time a debt \n     limit is reached the Government is already obligated to make \n     payments and must have enough money to meet its obligations. \n     These proposed new debt limits, despite the changes made, \n     could run the risk of precipitating a debt crisis in the \n     future.\n       The proposal makes only limited exceptions for \n     unanticipated developments on the non-Social Security side of \n     the budget. However, the potential for forecast error is \n     great even for estimates made for one year in the future, let \n     alone for ten years. Projections of future budget surpluses \n     are made using hundreds of assumptions, any of which is \n     subject to error. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) studied the errors in its own five-year estimates and \n     concluded that, based on their average deviation, the annual \n     surplus estimate for 2004 could vary by $250 billion. Much \n     smaller forecast errors could cause these new debt limits to \n     be reached.\n       The amendment's shift of the effective date from October 1 \n     to May 1 may provide some degree of cushion but it does not \n     eliminate the risk that the debt limit could be reached in \n     the normal course of business. It reduces the debt limit just \n     after the large revenue bulge in April. However, the size of \n     the cushion and the impact of the timing shift can be far \n     smaller than the deviations from surplus projections \n     described above.\n       The amendment could run the risk of worsening an economic \n     downturn. The debt limit would be suspended following two \n     consecutive quarters of real GDP growth below one percent. \n     However, an economic slowdown of any duration that did not \n     result in real growth of less than one percent for two \n     consecutive quarters could increase spending and reduce \n     recipts--and both CBO and OMB estimates indicate that such \n     a moderate slowdown could require the borrowing of \n     hundreds of billions of dollars over a period of just a \n     few years. Absent a super-majority vote to raise the debt \n     limit, Congress would need to reduce other spending or \n     raise taxes. Either cutting spending or raising taxes in a \n     slowing economy could aggravate the economic slowdown and \n     substantially raise the risk of a significant recession. \n     In addition, there would be a lag of at least seven months \n     from the onset of a recession to the time that the \n     statistics were available to demonstrate two consecutive \n     quarters of real growth of less than one percent. During \n     these seven or more months, as in the first case, revenues \n     would likely decline and outlays increase necessitating \n     that Congress either reduce other spending or raise taxes. \n     In both cases, the tax increases and spending cuts could \n     turn out to be inadequate to satisfy all existing payment \n     obligations and to keep the debt under the limit, and the \n     debt-limit crisis could worsen.\n       In addition, the Act does not guarantee that Social \n     Security benefits will be paid as scheduled in the event that \n     the debt ceiling were reached. The Act requires the Treasury \n     Secretary to give priority to the payment of Social Security \n     benefits but, if the Treasury\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n     could no longer borrow any money, there might not be enough \n     cash to pay all Social Security benefits due on a given day. \n     We believe that all obligations of the Federal government \n     should be honored. We do not believe that prioritizing \n     payments by program is a sound way to approach the \n     government's affairs (e.g., giving Social Security payments \n     precedence over tax refunds or other benefits, such as those \n     for veterans). In addition, this Act does not indicate how \n     this complex prioritization process should be implemented, no \n     system currently exists to do so, and any such system would \n     be impractical.\n       Clearly, there could be very serious risks to Social \n     Security and other benefits and to the credit worthiness of \n     the United States if this Act were enacted into law. To \n     ensure fiscal discipline, the Administration recommends \n     instead that the pay-go rules and the discretionary spending \n     caps in current law be extended beyond FY 2002. These tools \n     of fiscal disciline--which do not rely on debt limits--have \n     been highly effective since they were adopted in 1990 on a \n     bipartisan basis. I urge the Congress to consider these \n     provisions--rather than new debt ceilings--as the best choice \n     for maintaining our hard-won fiscal discipline.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nalso section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Social Security and the United Budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The reason I do that is the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho said he was here and voted for the Greenspan Commission report. \nAnd the Greenspan Commission report said: Look, as sort of a lockbox, \ntake the Social Security trust funds out of the unified budget.\n\n       A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, the DI, HI, and \n     SMI Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget.\n\n  You see we contemplated back in 1983 the baby boomer problem. And it \nis now determined to be not a baby boomer problem, but an adult problem \non the floor of the National Government right here in the Congress.\n  I will ask consent also to have printed in the Record the surpluses \nso they will have the exact figure.

Mr. President, in 1999 we have a $126 billion surplus; \nin 2000, a $137 billion surplus; and then out into the year 2009, a \n$217 billion surplus. We contemplated that at the time of the enactment \nof the Greenspan Commission and said we are going to build up, like a \ngood, responsible insurance company, a reserve so that we could take \ncare of demands of the baby boomers in the next generation.\n  If we said, at that particular time, Mr. President, that the money is \ngoing do be spent for any and everything, as the Senator from Ohio and \nI have just been discussing, we would have never voted for the payroll \ntax. You could not have gotten a vote except to save Social Security at \nthat particular time. And we contemplated a reserve fund. Instead, they \ngot all of these super-duper plans to solve the baby boomer problem; \nwhen the truth of the matter is, the big thing to do--and it almost \nputs it back solvent--is quit looting the Social Security trust fund \nfor debt caused by any and every other program but Social Security.\n  And one final point: The lockbox, in other words, with this \nparticular measure, gives everybody the key but Social Security. When \nyou say, pay down the public debt, you are paying down the debt caused \nby any and every other program, whether it is entitlement, \ndiscretionary or defense. That is the debt. Because it is not Social \nSecurity's debt. I wish they would pay down the $857 billion they owe \nSocial Security.\n  But they said, pay down the public debt. That increases the Social \nSecurity debt. The debt increases, as shown for the next 5 years by the \nCongressional Budget Office. The debt increases, interest costs \nincrease.\n  We are getting by now, but if we go back to the regular order of \nbusiness economically in this country, we are really going to be \nsavaged. And when they say honesty, what really frustrates the people \nwho oppose this amendment is the honesty of it--I don't want to say the \ndishonesty, but the incorrectness of it.\n  This amendment ought to be withdrawn. It actually continues what we \nhave been doing that got us into this particular fix in formalizing. \nAnd they know it is formalizing and dignifying the savaging of the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for his indulgence. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me especially thank \nthe Senator from Ohio and the Senator from South Carolina for their \ncourtesy in allowing me to speak at this time.\n  I want to simply acknowledge that the Senator from South Carolina is, \nin my mind, the leader in the entire Congress on trying to make sure \nthat we actually protect the Social Security trust fund and that it not \nbe subject to the kind of raids it has been subjected to for the last \n30 years. I give him enormous credit for that. He has been my leader on \nthis issue. I thank him for his continued advocacy in protecting the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, tomorrow's vote on the Social Security \nlock-box legislation will be a defining moment for the Senate. Members \nwill be making an unequivocal statement about how they feel about the \nSocial Security program: Do we truly believe Social Security's monies \nshould be protected and preserved from spending raids? Or are we \nwilling to allow Social Security monies to be treated as a ``piggy \nbank'' that can be tapped and diverted to other federal programs?\n  I think the answer to these questions should be obvious--and I \nbelieve the 99 Senators who voted on March 24 for an amendment calling \nfor adoption of the lockbox provision during the consideration of the \nSenate's FY 2000 budget resolution have an obligation to uphold the \ncommitment they made to protect Social Security's monies and vote for \nthe lock-box proposal.\n  Every Republican and every Democrat present voted for the substance \nof this proposal just a few short weeks ago and--accordingly--I hope \nthey will vote to conclude debate tomorrow. The Administration's \nopposition to this legislation should come as no surprise, especially \nconsidering that President Clinton's FY 2000 budget proposal relied \nheavily on Social Security's surpluses to fund numerous other programs. \nSpecifically, the President's\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\nbudget would have raided $158 billion from the Social Security surplus \nover the coming five years to pay for other programs, while the \nRepublican budget preserves every penny of the Social Security surplus.\n  In light of the President's diversion of Social Security monies to \nother programs, the members of the Budget Committee--by a nearly \nunanimous vote of 21 to 1--voted for an amendment I offered during the \nmarkup that called on Congress to reject any budget that would spend \nany portion of Social Security surpluses for any program other than \nSocial Security. Not coincidentally, when the President's budget was \nlater brought to a vote in the Senate, it was resoundingly rejected by \na vote of 97 to 2.\n  The bottom line is that the time has come for Congress and the \nPresident to stop relying on Social Security's surpluses to fund other \ngovernment programs. The Social Security lock-box legislation we are \nnow considering provides a hard and fast means of protecting these \nmonies, while providing needed ``safety valves'' for recessions, \nemergencies, declarations of war, or legislation that strengthens the \nSocial Security program. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to uphold \ntheir commitment to this proposal by voting to conclude debate and \nbring the Social Security lock-box proposal to a Senate vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4022-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, when the Commerce Committee filed the \nreport for S. 96, the Y2K Act, the Congressional Budget Office had not \ncompleted the cost estimate for the bill. Recently, the committee \nreceived the estimate. In summary, the estimate concludes that the \nmeasure would most likely result in a savings to the Federal court \nsystem. I look forward to debating this measure, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 96, the Y2K Act.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Susanne \n     S.

CBO estimates that the net effect of \n     S. 96 would most likely be a savings to the federal court \n     system but we cannot estimate the extent of any such savings \n     because we cannot predict the number of lawsuits that would \n     arise--under either S. 96 or current law--from computer \n     failures associated with the year 2000.\n       The cost of addressing the Y2K problem in the United States \n     is expected to total hundreds of billions of dollars. The \n     extent to which such problems will be resolved prior to next \n     January (or shortly thereafter) remains highly uncertain. \n     Even more uncertain is the extent to which companies and \n     individuals might file lawsuits against businesses because of \n     problems encountered next year. CBO expects that enacting S. \n     96 could deter some potential plaintiffs from filing such \n     lawsuits.\n       Some class action lawsuits may be shifted from state courts \n     to federal court under this bill, so the federal courts could \n     incur an increase in costs because class action lawsuits tend \n     to be very timely and costly. However, CBO expects that any \n     such increase would be more than offset by savings \n     attributable to having fewer Y2K cases, overall, under the \n     bill than under current law. Any net change in costs to the \n     federal court system would affect appropriated spending. The \n     bill would not affect direct spending or receipts, so pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would not apply.\n       S. 96 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) but, overall, CBO expects \n     that enacting this bill would lead to a savings for state and \n     local governments. The threshold established in UMRA ($50 \n     million in 1996 dollars, adjusted annually for inflation) \n     would thus not be exceeded. The bill also would impose a new \n     private-sector mandate but CBO cannot estimate the cost of \n     the mandate.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: S. 96 would \n     provide various liability protections for businesses and \n     state and local governments facing possible litigation \n     arising from Y2K computer problems. In particular, the bill \n     would: limit punitive damages to $250,000 or three times the \n     actual damages that a plaintiff suffered, whichever is \n     larger, and cap punitive damages at $250,000 for companies \n     with fewer than 25 employees; require potential plaintiffs to \n     give a prospective defendant 90 days to propose a plan to \n     resolve the Y2K problem before any legal action could be \n     taken under a lawsuit; assess any liability on a proportional \n     basis, whereby a person against whom a judgment is made would \n     be liable for only the portion of damages corresponding to \n     that person's percentage of responsibility as determined by \n     the judge; and ease restrictions for filing class action \n     lawsuits in federal court.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 96 would probably result in a net reduction \n     in the workload of the federal court system as compared to \n     what would occur under current law. Thus far, about 60 \n     complaints associated with Y2K problems have been filed; the \n     majority of cases based on those complaints are class action \n     lawsuits that have been filed in state courts. Several of the \n     larger cases have been settled, but there is little basis for \n     predicting the number or outcome of Y2K lawsuits that would \n     be filed under S. 96 or under current law. Therefore, CBO \n     cannot estimate the magnitude of any net savings to the \n     federal government under the bill.\n       To the extent that a significant number of lawsuits related \n     to Y2K problems are filed under current law, the Judiciary \n     will either need to seek legislation authorizing additional \n     judgeships and support personnel to address the increased \n     workload or experience a severe backlog in cases. Because S. \n     96 would limit punitive damages associated with Y2K cases, \n     give businesses 90 days to respond to Y2K problems before any \n     legal action could be taken against such businesses, and make \n     other changes affecting liability laws, CBO expects that \n     parties to lawsuits would be encouraged to reach a \n     settlement. Thus, we anticipate that many lawsuits would not \n     result in a trial, which can be timely and expensive. \n     However, some class action lawsuits could be shifted from \n     state to federal jurisdiction under S. 96 because the \n     bill would ease restrictions for filing such actions in \n     federal court. On balance, CBO estimates that the savings \n     from eliminating trials for many lawsuits would more than \n     offset any increased costs that might be incurred from \n     trying additional class action lawsuits in federal court.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 96 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in the \n     UMRA but would impose no significant costs on state, local, \n     or tribal governments. The bill would preempt state law by \n     applying certain federal requirements to Y2K civil lawsuits \n     in state courts after February 22, 1999. CBO expects that \n     enacting this legislation would deter some potential \n     plaintiffs from filing and pursuing lawsuits, thus reducing \n     the resources state courts would expend on this type of \n     litigation.\n       In addition, by easing the requirements for filing Y2K \n     class action lawsuits in federal court, the bill could \n     diminish some of the burden on state courts, where most of \n     the current lawsuits have been filed. On the other hand, more \n     individual cases might be filed in state courts to complement \n     class action suits in federal courts. Overall, CBO \n     anticipates the net effect of this bill would be a savings to \n     state courts.\n       This bill would supersede any state laws inconsistent with \n     it. While no state has established Y2K liability protection \n     for the private sector, several states currently are\n\n[[Page S4023]]\n\n     considering that issue in their legislative bodies. Finally, \n     S. 96 would provide state and local governments protection \n     from punitive damages arising from a Y2K action. Only six \n     states and the District of Columbia have already passed \n     legislation protecting themselves and their localities from \n     Y2K liability. To the extent that state and local governments \n     could become defendants in Y2K litigation and have not \n     protected themselves from liability, this bill would provide \n     such protection and could result in a savings.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 96 would impose \n     a new private-sector mandate by requiring prospective \n     plaintiffs in legal actions related to Y2K computer problems \n     to notify prospective defendants of their intent to file suit \n     and wait up to ninety days after such notification before \n     filing. The notice must identify the cause and size of the \n     prospective plaintiff's loss, the remedy sought, and the \n     legal basis for the suit.\n       For a single prospective plaintiff, the cost of complying \n     with the mandate, the expense incurred in drafting and \n     delivering the notice, is relatively small. The notice is, in \n     effect, a summary of the suit to be filed, so that \n     preparation for the suit is also preparation for the notice. \n     CBO cannot, however, produce an estimate of the aggregate \n     costs of the mandate, largely because we have no way to \n     predict the number of Y2K lawsuits.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Susanne Mehlman; \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Lisa Cash \n     Driskill; Impact on the Private Sector: John Harris.\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A.

Mr. President, I rise to observe the Armenian Genocide \nRemembrance Day which takes place on April 24. Each year we remember \nand honor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed \nto still have with us.\n  During the periods 1915-1918 and 1920-1923, approximately 1.5 million \nArmenians perished under the rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The \nArmenian people fell victim to deportation, expropriation, torture, \nstarvation and massacre. We signify April 24, 1915 as the day of \nremembrance because of the more than 200 Armenian community leaders who \nwere systematically hunted down in Constantinople on this date.\n  The Armenian genocide was the result of a consciously orchestrated \ngovernment plan. The United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, \nHenry Morgenthau, stated at the time that, ``When the Turkish \nauthorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely \ngiving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, \nand, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to \nconceal the fact . . . I am confident that the whole history of the \nhuman race contains no such horrible episode as this.''\n  In an effort to further our understanding of this tragic period, one \nof my constituents, Mae Derdarian, has written an important survivor's \naccount of the Armenian genocide. Her book, Vergeen, recounts a \nthirteen-year old girl's deportation from her home, the atrocities she \nsurvived, her escape from her tormentors, and her ultimate triumph over \nthe horrors she witnessed and which were perpetrated on her. In a \nreview of Ms. Derdarian's book, The Detroit Jewish News wrote ``Every \nnow and then a book comes along that haunts the reader long after the \nlast page is turned. Vergeen is one of those stories . . . Mae \nDerdarian has created a page-turner, combing Vergeen's memoir and her \nown mother's recorded accounts of what both women endured as survivors \nof the first genocide of the 20th century.'' Such first-hand accounts \nfrom survivors are critical to our understanding of genocide, and help \nus all to recognize and honor the lives of the victims.\n  Mr. President, each year we remember the horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people during the periods 1915-1918 and 1920-1923 under the \nOttoman Empire. However, it is not enough to simply remember those who \nhave perished. We must dedicate ourselves to see that tragedies such as \nthe Armenian Genocide are not revisited on our planet. This is the \nhighest tribute we can pay to the victims of any genocide.\n  The Armenian people have earned our enduring admiration for \nwithstanding the horrors of two world wars and several decades of \nSoviet dominance in order to establish modern Armenia. The United \nStates must continue its efforts to support freedom, prosperity and \nstability in Armenia as we honor and remember the victims of the \nArmenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4023-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARMENIAN GENOCIDE COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 84th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. This is an event that has defined \nthe Armenian people for the past 84 years, and my thoughts and \nsympathies are again with them as they remember these events.\n  It is with a great sense of sorrow that we mark the 84th year since \nthe tragic genocide and exile of the Armenian people. The Turkish \nOttoman Empire expelled nearly 1.5 million Armenians as part of a \nstaged campaign. In doing so, the world witnessed one of the most \nsobering events in modern history. As the first genocide of the 20th \ncentury, the period between 1915 and 1918 deserves our attention and \nrespect, and it should remind us of the need to keep all those who \nperished during the Genocide alive in our memory.\n  While humankind has the ability to sponsor acts of great kindness and \nsacrifice, we also have the capacity for great evil. By pausing to \ncommemorate the Armenian Genocide, we ensure that it will never slip \ninto the recesses of history. Along with the Holocaust, the Armenian \nGenocide signifies our ability to promote evil, but if we close our \neyes to the tragedies of the past, we risk the chance of repeating them \nin the future.\n  Sadly, the Armenian American community has its roots in the Armenian \nGenocide. Many individuals living here in the United States either lost \nfamily members at the hands of the Ottomans, or are survivors \nthemselves. They have risen above adversity to become prominent and \nsuccessful citizens despite a tragic past. The Armenian American \ncommunity has been vocal in expressing its anguish about the Genocide. \nIt is my hope that their perseverance in marking this event each year, \nas well as our own efforts here in the United States Senate, will be \nenough to allow us to remember the lessons of the Genocide. We are \nconstantly forced to relearn the effects of evil unchecked, but I hope, \nin this case, we will be guided to a better future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4023-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4023-S4024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECURITY AT AMERICA'S NUCLEAR LABORATORIES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly on the \ncritically important hearings being conducted in Congress regarding the \nalleged national security breaks at our Department of Energy nuclear \nweapons laboratories. As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I am committed to finding the answer to what may \nhave happened and ensure that our national security is just that--\nsecure.\n  I share the concern of most Americans that starting during the Reagan \nAdministration, Chinese spies reportedly stole secrets from New \nMexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory to assist China in developing \nadvanced nuclear weapons. I am also concerned with the perceived \ninaction by individuals and agencies within our government for almost \nten years. However, I strongly discourage my colleagues and others in \nframing this issue in partisan terms because the timeline we are \ndiscussing here today includes three Administrations of both parties. \nThe goal of placing blame on Republicans or Democrats is \ncounterproductive to the ultimate need of finding answers that lead to \nsolutions.\n  The American public is entitled to know whether critically important \nsecrets were stolen from our nuclear laboratories. We, as citizens of a \ndemocracy, also have the right to know what steps our government took--\nor failed to take--to protect our interests and livelihood. The \naccusations surrounding the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory have shaken \nthe trust Americans have in our national security, our government, and \nour developing relationship with China, the most populated country in \nthe world. It is the responsibility of this committee, Congress as a \nwhole, and the Administration to provide the American public with the \nanswers they deserve.\n  Accountability and accuracy must be established in this matter. \nHowever, knowing what happened and who was responsible is not enough. I \nam hopeful that out of this committee hearing and\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\nsubsequent investigations by other Congressional committees and \ngovernmental agencies, we can make sure our national security secrets \nare safe in a world where it is inevitable and necessary that \nscientists from different countries work together.\n  Action must be taken if it is found that security lagged and \nindividuals failed to respond in a timely and appropriate manner. \nAction must also be taken if it is found that foreign governments \nactively spied in our nuclear laboratories. However, we will not know \nwhat action is necessary until all the information is presented. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue and will continue \nto work to ensure that important questions are answered fully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4024-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECENT EVENTS IN GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a milestone in the \nhistory of the Georgian nation towards consolidating its independence \nand sovereignty and the progress Georgia has made in moving towards \nbecoming a democratic government with a free market economy.\n  On the 9th of April 1999, Georgian Orthodox Good Friday, Georgia \ncommemorated a tragic anniversary: ten years ago on that day in 1989, \ntwenty-two people died for daring to express their desire for the \nindependence of their country. During a peaceful demonstration in \nTbilisi, Soviet troops moved in on the unarmed crowd with tanks. \nSoldiers carrying field engineer spades bludgeoned these brave people \nto death--all of them were unarmed and many of them were women. The \ntroops also used an unknown type of poisonous gas which put thousands \nof people in hospital. These people paid a heavy price for expressing \ntheir desire for independence.\n  This week, almost exactly 10 years later, Georgia is celebrating \nanother major step towards the goal of full independence for which \nthose people died: this time economic independence. On April 17th, \nGeorgia celebrated the inauguration of the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline. \nWith this step, Georgia has gained another significant measure of \nindependence.\n  This is a long way to have come in just ten years. And these have \nbeen very tumultuous years filled with strife and hardship: \nassassination attempts against President Shevardnadze; pressures from \nRussia which continues to harbor Igor Giorgadze, the mastermind behind \nthe 1995 assassination attempt against President Shevardnadze; ethnic \nconflicts, over 300,000 refugees from Abkhazia, and tremendous economic \nhardships for the Georgian people.\n  This refugee problem is one which should resonate with all of us. The \ntelevision pictures and the stories told by the Kosovar refugees of \nethnic cleansing, people pushed out of their homes and villages is a \nsight which shocks us and has galvanized the United States and the west \nto action. Similar scenes were taking place in Georgia which in a very \nshort time had to assimilate over 300,000 refugees driven out of \nAbkhazia as part of ethnic cleansing in that part of the country. Had \nthere been TV cameras there the world might have reacted. But there \nweren't and Georgia has been left to deal with this difficult problem \non its own.\n  Despite this difficult backup, President Shevardnadze and the \nreformers in the Georgian parliament have started and made significant \nprogress in building a new nation. What we are witnessing in Georgia is \ntruly that: the building up from scratch of a new state. This is a \ndaunting task and one which requires immense fortitude and persistent \ncommitment.\n  There is no quick formula for building a state, no blueprint to \nfollow which will smooth the way. In fact, the road is anything but \nsmooth and there have been wrong turns along the way. But it is taking \nplace. There are a number of indicators.\n  One is the regaining control of borders. After much negotiating, and \npersistence, Georgia is starting to regain control of its borders: in \nthe strategic sea-port of Poti, the northern border as well as parts of \nthe border with Turkey. Georgia is also scheduled to take control of \nthe entire Turkish-Georgian border in Ajara in 1999.\n  Another is in the area of basic legal reforms. Not only have \nPresident Shevardnadze and the reformers in Parliament tackled problems \nsystematically, they have clearly demonstrated their commitment by \npassing legislation which will set the foundations for a free and \nprosperous society. A recent example is the overhaul of the judiciary. \nMost of Georgia's judges are being forcibly retired and replaced by new \nones chosen by competitive examinations. This is a bold move in the \nright direction. While the reform of the legal system is moving forward \nat a fast pace, one area of concern is the recent decision to return to \nthe Soviet system of appointing lay judges for high crimes' sentencing. \nThese judges don't have to pass tests or meet the same standards as \nfederal judges. This is a dangerous road to go down as it could slow \ndown the pace of legal reform and open the door to corruption. \nNevertheless, on the whole Georgia should be proud of this wonderful \nstep forward. In a civil society, the legal system should work for the \nsociety and not for the benefit of the authorities. The overhaul of the \njudiciary sets Georgia on that course.\n  Another is the fight against corruption. The reformers in Georgia \nhave also taken on one of the most pervasive problems which is the \nlegacy of 70 years of communism: corruption. Recent examples of the \ncommitment to take on this overwhelming problem can be found in a \nnumber of decisions relating to the areas in which corruption is the \nmost prevalent in any society. Georgia has hired foreign companies to \ntake over areas which are traditionally the richest sources of bribes \nand corruption: the distribution of electric power in Tbilisi and the \ncustoms service. In another bold move, the Georgian government will be \ntaking procurement away from the ministries: a law passed recently \nrequires that as of 1 July 1999, all government procurements beyond \n20,000 lari must be subject to tender by the Ministry of Economy. This \nlaw is most significant and will be further enhanced by establishment \nof a system for third party procurement. The Ministry of Economy \nworking with seasoned western companies can make these tenders work for \nthe government and not for individual people looking for their own \npersonal gain. Leading the way in this effort is the military and the \nborder guards. This will concretely contribute to the more efficient \nuse of Georgian government resources and reduce the temptation of \ncorruption.\n  The progress made to date has not come easily and has not necessarily \nbeen smooth; mistakes have been made along the way. But we must \nremember that there is no easy map to chart the way from the economic \nshambles Georgia and the other former Soviet republics inherited to a \nfull blown free market economy and democratic institutions. Building \nthem takes some time, determination and perseverance.\n  Mr. President, once implemented, the Georgian people will surely \nbegin to see that they are on the right track toward a serious \nimprovement in their circumstances. I congratulate President \nShevardnadze and the parliamentarians who have stood up for the freedom \nand long-term wellbeing of their country.\n  Mr. President, the geostrategic importance of Georgia to the United \nStates is clear and has been mentioned often. It also has another claim \non our attention and support: the progress toward democratization and \nfree market economy there is a strong example to the other countries in \nthe region. Georgia deserves our support as well as our \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4024-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4024-S4025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL ROY LEE JOHNSON, USN (RET.)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our nation has lost a truly great American \nin the recent passing of Admiral Roy Lee Johnson, USN (Ret.), who died \nMarch 20th in Virginia Beach, Virginia at the age of 93. My Senate \ncolleagues should know that he was the father of Jo-Anne Coe, long-time \ntop aide to Senator Bob Dole. We all join in sending our deepest \nsympathy to Jo-Anne and her family.\n  Admiral Johnson had a distinguished Naval career of over 38 years, \nculminating in his appointment as Commander in Chief of U.S. Naval \nforces in the Pacific (CINCPACFLT) from 1965-67 at the height of the \nVietnam conflict. Prior to this, he was Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet. \nIn his capacity, he gave\n\n[[Page S4025]]\n\nthe order to the USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy to fire back at Viet \nCong gunboats in the Tonkin Gulf incident.\n  Admiral Johnson graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929. A \npioneer of naval aviation, he received his wings in 1932, and served as \na flight instructor at the U.S. Navy flight school at Pensacola, \nFlorida, in the biplane era in the early 1930's and again in the \n1950's. After retirement, he served a term as president of the Early \nand Pioneer Naval Aviators Association, nicknamed ``The Golden \nEagles'', and from 1980-81 was President of the Naval Academy Alumni \nAssociation.\n  During World War Two he served on the USS Hornet, which won a \nPresidential Unit Citation. He was awarded the Bronze Star, the Air \nMedal, and the Legion of Merit with gold star for his service in action \nwhich included campaigns against Japanese forces in the Philippines, \nWake and Truk Islands, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He also saw action during \nthe Korean War, as Commanding Officer of the escort carrier USS Badoeng \nStrait.\n  In 1955 he became the first Commanding officer of the USS Forrestal \n(CVA 59), the first of the ``supercarriers'', receiving this coveted \nappointment after developing operational procedures for this new class \nof carrier which were still in use at least 15 years later. In this \nrole he was promoted to Rear Admiral and later assumed command of \nCarrier Division Four, with the Forrestal as his flagship.\n  In January 1960, he was named Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for \nPlans and Policy. Two years later he was promoted to Vice Admiral and \nbecame the Navy's senior representative in determining U.S. air strike \npriorities during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n  In July 1963, he became Deputy Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific \nFleet and a year later was appointed Commander of the U.S. Seventh \nFleet. For his service in these assignments he was awarded a second \nDistinguished Service Medal. In 1965, he was promoted to full Admiral \nand became CINCPACFLT. He was the last U.S. Military Governor of the \nBonin Islands, which include Iwo Jima.\n  Admiral Johnson's exceptionally distinguished military career and \nachievements as a private citizen stand out as an example of the \nselfless devotion to our country that only a few Americans have \nexemplified. Hopefully, his achievements will serve as the standard for \nour naval officers and citizens to strive to achieve. His lasting \ncontributions to ensuring the freedoms and greatness of our nation are \nhis legacy. Admiral Johnson will be profoundly missed and fondly \nremembered by all who knew him and by others who only know of his \nexceptional service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4025-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EARTH DAY 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1969, American astronauts heading for \nthe first walk on the moon sent back breathtaking pictures of the \nEarth. Later that year, Senator Gaylord Nelson called on teachers and \nstudents to hold a national teach-in on environmental issues.\n  The two events were closely related. The NASA photos gave everyone on \nEarth an inescapable image of our planet as one world, a tiny ``blue \nball'' floating in the vastness of space. Along with Senator Nelson's \ncall to action, it helped galvanize a growing consciousness of the \nEarth's fragile environment and how it was affected by human activity.\n  Millions of people answered Gaylord Nelson's call. On April 22, 1970, \nover 20 million Americans--including students at 10,000 public schools \nand a thousand colleges--gathered to express their concern about \nenvironmental issues. ``Earth Day'' was born.\n  Congress responded quickly by establishing the Environmental \nProtection Agency and enacting three sweeping laws that laid the \ncornerstone for the environmental protections we enjoy today: the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy \nAct.\n  The first Earth Day and its aftermath were a great success. On Earth \nDay 1999, we can celebrate the fact that the air we breathe, the water \nwe drink, and our oceans, rivers, and streams are cleaner now than when \nEarth Day was first celebrated. In the past three decades, we have \nbanned lead in gasoline. We banned DDT. We reduced toxic air emissions. \nWe established strong public health standards for drinking water. We \neliminated direct dumping of sewage into our oceans, rivers, lakes, and \nstreams.\n  We have made great progress in providing a safer and healthier \nenvironment for ourselves and our children. But we still have a long \nway to go, especially where children are concerned. Most of our \nenvironmental standards are designed to protect adults rather than \nchildren. In most cases, we haven't even done the tests that would \nallow us to measure how harmful substances affect our children. And, \nperhaps most surprisingly, in the face of that uncertainty, we don't \npresume that harmful substances may present special dangers to our \nchildren and adopt a more protective standard.\n  In effect, our environmental laws assume that what we don't know \nabout harmful substances won't hurt our children.\n  That is why I wrote my Children's Environmental Protection Act, or \nCEPA. CEPA would child-proof our environmental laws. It would require \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set environmental \nstandards to protect children. And, most importantly, if there is no \nspecific data that would allow EPA to measure the dangers to children, \nit requires EPA to set a more protective standard to take that lack of \ninformation into account.\n  As we strive to give our children a safer environment, we must also \nconsider the natural legacy we hope to leave them. Along with clean air \nand water, we need to preserve wild places and wide-open spaces for \nfuture generations to enjoy. We need to preserve historic sites, \nconserve farmland, and maintain public parks.\n  Earlier this year, Congressman George Miller and I introduced \nsweeping legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives to \nprotect America's historic and natural heritage. The Permanent \nProtection for America's Resources 2000 Act--or Resources 2000--sets \naside $2.3 billion annually in offshore oil and gas drilling revenues \nto create a sustainable source of funding to acquire and maintain \npublic lands, expand urban recreation opportunities, and protect the \nNation's marine, wildlife, and historic resources.\n  To mention just one example, Resources 2000 would mandate full \nfunding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In 1965, Congress \nestablished this Fund, which was to receive $900 million a year from \nFederal oil revenues for acquisition of sensitive lands and wetlands. \nThe good news is that Fund has collected over $21 billion since 1965. \nThe bad news is that only $9 billion of this amount has been spent on \nits intended uses. More than $12 billion has been shifted into other \nFederal accounts. Resources 2000 would fund the Land and Water \nConservation Fund at $900 million per year, the full level authorized \nby Congress.\n  On Earth Day 1999, I ask my colleagues once again to answer Gaylord \nNelson's noble call to action. Let us enact an agenda that will sustain \nboth a healthy economy and a healthy environment. Let us rededicate \nourselves to the principles of Earth Day and do all we can to heal, \nprotect, and honor the Earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4025-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4025-S4026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN CELEBRATION OF EARTH DAY 1999\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

As a nation, we have made great strides in the last three \ndecades in protecting important ecosystems, cleaning up past mistakes \nand improving the environmental records of industry and agriculture. I \nam confident that as we move into the 21st century, our Nation will \ncontinue to be a leader in both environmental protection and economic \nstrength.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, one of our most pressing challenges is to \nrestore our dwindling wild salmon stocks. This year, the Puget Sound \nchinook salmon\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\nwas listed on the endangered species list, making it one of the first \nspecies in the Nation to require protection efforts in an intensely \ndeveloped metropolitan area.\n  This will give our region an opportunity to highlight again how we \ncan both thrive economically and provide critical protection to other \nspecies. Already we have seen examples across our State. Farmers have \nmodified irrigation systems to make them more salmon-friendly. Forest \nlandowners have foregone timber harvest in sensitive areas and \nreplanted along streams with vegetation particularly beneficial to \nfish. Citizens of our urban areas have taken the first steps toward a \ncomprehensive plan to restore urban salmon and have joined forces to \nrestore devastated wetlands and streams.\n  One of the important lessons we should have learned about \nenvironmental protection is it is much easier--and far less costly--to \npreserve an ecosystem rather than try to repair it once it has been \ndestroyed. That is one of the reasons I am pushing my colleagues so \nhard to pass my legislation to create a Wild and Scenic River on the \nHanford Reach of the Columbia River. These are the last free-flowing 51 \nmiles of this mighty river and they contain some of the most productive \nand important fish spawning habitat in the lower 48 States. The reach \nproduces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as \nwell as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. While most of \nthe Columbia River Basin were being developed during the middle of this \ncentury, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation were kept pristine by the same veil of secrecy and \nsecurity that lead to the contamination of the central Hanford Site.\n  Mr. President, we have been offered an opportunity to continue to \ngrow the rural economy of central Washington while protecting this \nvital source of our economic strength that the Columbia River provides. \nCreating a Wild and Scenic River could help us avoid drastic protection \nmeasures, like breaching the dams along the Columbia Snake River \nsystems to save salmon. This simple step will demonstrate our \ncommitment both to protecting wild salmon and to the economic and \nsocial structure of the inland West.\n  Today, we also celebrate the introduction of legislation to protect \nanother national treasure: the wilderness of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. Senator Roth will again introduce, and I will \ncosponsor, his bill to protect one of the only remaining complete and \nundisturbed arctic ecosystems in the world. It is home to an abundance \nof wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, musk-oxen, wolves, and \na host of migratory bird species. It is also home to the magnificent \nporcupine caribou herd, whose 160,000 members rely on this coastal \nplain for their calving grounds.\n  This bill will prohibit development of oil within the fragile \nwilderness of the refuge. Oil development would likely disrupt the \nporcupine caribou and force them to change their calving grounds and \nmigratory routes. This, in turn, will adversely impact the lifestyle \nand culture of their neighbors, the Gwich'in people.\n  Proponents of development claim that only 13,000 acres of the refuge \nwill be impacted. While this may be true, that development will take \nplace in the biological heart of ANWR and have a devastating impact on \nthe wilderness values of the area. In this biological heart, developers \nwill create a major industrial complex. They will build hundreds of \nmiles of roads and pipelines, erect housing for thousands of workers, \nand construct two sea ports and one airport. These developments will \nlead to mining of enormous amounts of gravel, will require diversion of \nstreams and will result in pollution of fragile tundra.\n  Mr. President, as we celebrate the last earth day before the 21st \ncentury, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether to support both of these bills in order to hand down to our \nchildren and grandchildren a part of America's great natural legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4026-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4026-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:49 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 208.

A bill to make available funds for a security assistance \ntraining and support program for the self-defense of Kosova; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                      the kosovo self-defense act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kosovo \nSelf-Defense Act. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, in offering this bill. Our proposal \nwould provide $25 million to arm and train members of the Kosovo \nLiberation Army, or KLA. This would equip 10,000 men or 10 battalions \nwith small arms, antitank weapons, for up to 18 months. Let me repeat \nthat: For less than the cost of one evening's air raids, we can provide \nsignificant defensive capabilities to those most willing to fight Serb \naggression inside Kosovo.\n  I know the administration questions why the United States should take \nthis bold step. My question is, Why haven't we already made the \ndecision to arm and train the Kosovar Albanians who are on the ground \nfighting for their homes, their loved ones, and their rights? It seems \nto me that the question is not why, but why not? It took 4 years of \nbloodshed to recognize we should arm the Bosnians. How many lives will \nbe lost before we do the right thing in Kosovo?\n  There is widespread agreement that President Clinton and his National \nSecurity Advisers have made a grave tactical error in removing even the \nthreat of U.S. ground troops. With this declaration seemingly repeated \nhourly by top Clinton officials, the United States has signaled to \nMilosevic that, regardless of his actions--including genocide--America \ndoes not have the determination to stop this outrageous behavior. After \nmonths of hollow American threats, we are now crippling our prospects \nfor success by signaling to Milosevic just how far we are willing to \ngo. No option should have been taken off the table.\n  Just last October, with great fanfare, the President announced a \ncease-fire, but it was a farce. The Serbs continued their brutal war \nagainst the Kosovars. In Pristina, cynics were heard to say, ``If they \nonly burn a village a day it keeps NATO away.'' The Serb campaign to \nexterminate all semblance of Albanian society raged daily--just not on \na massive, headline-grabbing scale.\n  Unless faced with serious and sustained military pressure on the \nground, this war will go on until Kosovo is empty of all Albanians. \nGiven administration and public reluctance to deploy U.S. troops, there \nis only one option: The KLA must be given the means to defend their \nhomeland. All reports indicate that the KLA is growing in number and \nremains willing to fight Serb aggression. Given the right equipment and \nlimited training, the KLA could offer a significant deterrent to \nMilosevic's murderous thugs.\n  If the administration had armed the Kosovar Albanians in January when \nI first suggested that approach, I believe the daily tragic exodus of \nrefugees could have been avoided.\n  I ask unanimous consent the op-ed I wrote which appeared in the \nWashington Post back in January advocating this course of action be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1999]\n\n                        Independence for Kosovo\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       Once again, NATO ambassadors have condemned barbaric \n     atrocities deliberately inflicted by Serb forces on cold, \n     hungry, exhausted civilians. Top generals have been \n     dispatched to warn that Western patience has been strained by \n     Belgrade's slaughter of 45 villagers in Racak. The Serbs have \n     retaliated by evicting the American chief of the observer \n     mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE)--leaving a more sympathetic French official in \n     place.\n       It is time for the United States to accept reality, \n     recognize Kosovo's independence and provide Pristina's \n     leadership with the political and security assistance \n     necessary to halt Serbia's genocidal war.\n       Kosovo's humanitarian disaster continues today. Although it \n     is true that some 300,000 refugees have left the mountains \n     where they fled from Serb ethnic cleansing last summer, the \n     catastrophe has simply moved behind closed doors. \n     International relief agencies support a program of one warm \n     room per household, but this effort is barely meeting the \n     basic human needs of the extended or expanded families \n     created by the war. Families\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\n     ranging in size from 12 to 18 people, half of whom are \n     children, are crammed into the only standing room left in a \n     house, usually no larger than 12 by 20 feet. With freezing \n     temperatures and heavy snow, shortages of mattresses, \n     blankets, warm clothing and food are evident throughout \n     Kosovo. Schools and clinics are shuttered or shattered.\n       Nongovernmental organizations and the U.S. Disaster Team \n     have performed heroically in hostile conditions. \n     Unfortunately, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     World Food Program and Agency for International Development \n     headquarters have become bureaucratic bottlenecks slowing the \n     availability of relief supplies to these able partners.\n       The Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement for Kosovo has failed. \n     There is no cease-fire. The massacre in Racak is only the \n     latest example of weekly Serbian violence. Invariably, the \n     victims are civilians. Each time the Serbs offer the same \n     explanation: Violence resulted from their search for the \n     perpetrators of a crime. The Serb military response is always \n     brutally disproportionate to the needs of any legitimate law \n     enforcement effort. As one little girl cried after her \n     village was shelled, ``I would understand if they killed \n     soldiers, but they killed my home. Why?''\n       In addition to violating the cease-fire, the Serbs have \n     failed to comply with another key aspect of the agreement. \n     Belgrade was required to substantially reduce its Kosovo \n     force level. In fact, a senior American official acknowledged \n     the effort to verify the troop withdrawal was a farce. No one \n     knows how many Serbs are still deployed in Kosovo.\n       Hopeful of replacing this menacing presence, the \n     administration is developing an ill-advised plan to create a \n     new civilian police force. Unarmed and with the benefit of \n     only a few weeks training, this force is destined to fail or, \n     far worse, become hostages. An American diplomat summed up \n     the situation: ``The Serbs will continue to go where they \n     want, do anything they want, whenever they want.'' Neither \n     OSCE nor a civilian police force will change that outcome.\n       The primary reason the agreement has collapsed is that the \n     use of force has been abandoned as an option. A senior OSCE \n     French official observed, ``In October, Milosevic was \n     presented with two options--to be bombed or to accept \n     verifiers. He agreed to the OSCE mission. We now stand in \n     lieu of any military option. . . . Our political intervention \n     is incompatible with military action. No nation will be \n     willing to take military action and risk retribution against \n     its citizen verifiers.'' In short, 2,000 potential hostages \n     prevent any meaningful debate about force.\n       The use of force has been further undermined by the \n     withdrawal of virtually all 300 aircraft deployed in the \n     fall, and by members' statements that any effort to implement \n     the Activation Order for airstrikes will require more votes \n     by NATO. Challenge inspections of potential Serb military \n     violations were forfeited in a Belgrade-NATO document \n     guaranteeing prior notice of all air verification flights. \n     Finally, the Serbs know from daily testing that aggression \n     will produce little more than a rhetorical rebuke and renewed \n     talks.\n       George Mitchell is said to have produced Ireland's Good \n     Friday Agreement by shuttling between 12 factions, few of \n     which were ever in the same room at the same time. The case \n     in Kosovo has been much simpler, with only two real points of \n     view, one seeking independence, one an interim autonomy \n     settlement. Since the summer ethnic cleansing campaign there \n     has been only one view: independence.\n       American negotiators, constrained by European anxiety and \n     inertia, have failed to accept the inevitability of this \n     objective. The administration clings to the idea that this \n     goal is unachievable politically and unwinnable through \n     combat. This is no longer the case.\n       The United States should have learned several pertinent \n     lessons in Vietnam. To win, the Kosovo Liberation Army does \n     not need to control territory. It must be able to maneuver at \n     will, be well trained, equipped and financed and enjoy \n     popular support. Last year's Serb offensive energized \n     universal popular support for the Kosovo Liberation Army \n     (KLA), and military analysts now point to substantial \n     improvements in the KLA's tactics, command and control, \n     financing and arsenal.\n       Our policies must recognize the essential goal: \n     independence for Kosovo. To achieve it, we must take several \n     steps:\n       Expand direct U.S. aid to nongovernmental humanitarian \n     organizations and improve the management of international \n     organization relief efforts.\n       Suspend U.S. funds for the OSCE observers.\n       Demand a NATO vote to implement the Activation Order for \n     airstrikes.\n       Recognize Kosovo's independence and implement plans to arm \n     the KLA.\n       Facing hard realities has always been America's best \n     course. It is the only course to follow in Kosovo.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Rather than choosing this course, the U.S. and NATO \nhave relied solely on the use of controlled airstrikes. Now, I \nsupported this use of force and believe we should come to the defense \nof the Kosovar Albanians, the victims of genocide. However, the nightly \nstrikes on Milosevic's terror machine have not stopped the massive \nkilling. In fact, the atrocities have dramatically increased since NATO \naction began. Our halfhearted effort has allowed Milosevic the freedom \nto feed the most evil of instincts. Police, paramilitary, and army \nunits are engaged in an effort to deport or exterminate 2 million \nAlbanians.\n  Air power alone cannot stop this slaughter. This week the Albanian \nGovernment recognized this fact and called on the United States \nGovernment to arm the KLA. That was a shift in position of the Albanian \nGovernment. Recognizing the growing strength and tenacity of the KLA, \nthe Albanian Government has switched positions and said we ought to arm \nthe KLA.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article concerning that matter in the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 20, 1999]\n\n                    Albania Asks West To Arm Rebels\n\n                            (By Peter Finn)\n\n       TIRANA, Albania, April 19--The Albanian government has \n     asked the United States and other NATO countries to arm the \n     Kosovo Liberation Army and Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani \n     is prepared to raise the subject when he meets with President \n     Clinton during the NATO summit in Washington this week, a \n     senior adviser to the Albanian leader said today.\n       The decision is a significant policy shift for Albania, \n     which until NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia began last \n     month had maintained an official policy of neutrality toward \n     the different Kosovo Albanian political movements, including \n     the KLA, which has been fighting to win the province's \n     independence.\n       But Prec Zogaj, a senior adviser to the Albanian president, \n     said today that one of the effects of the mass expulsion of \n     ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, as well as reports of Serbian \n     massacres of civilians, has been to transform the rebel army \n     into the single voice of Kosovo Albanians, sidelining \n     provincial leaders who advocate nonviolence.\n       Albania, in response, is now willing to throw its \n     diplomatic weight behind the guerrillas' appeals for arms \n     from the West, Zogaj said in an interview. ``We have to find \n     ways to send military aid to Kosovo,'' Zogaj said. ``In \n     Kosovo, the only force that protects civilians is the KLA, \n     but they do not have enough arms.''\n       The change of policy threatens to deepen the strains in \n     relations between Albania and the Serb-led government of \n     Yugoslavia, which broke off diplomatic ties with Tirana on \n     Sunday and whose armed forces have fired shells into northern \n     Albania in the past week. Although the Albanian army is in \n     disarray, the West has long been concerned that it would be \n     drawn directly into the Kosovo conflict and ignite a broader \n     war.\n       The rebels set up training camps in mountainous northern \n     Albania and smuggled arms into Kosovo from there. But the \n     Albanian government has not officially sanctioned their \n     activities on its soil, and argued that it was unable to \n     control the rebels' movements in the north because the region \n     was so lawless.\n       ``The KLA was [previously] a military segment of the Kosovo \n     liberation movement,'' Zogaj said. ``Today, now, the KLA is \n     the movement itself. There is no other option.''\n       In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin \n     said he was not aware of a formal request from Albania to arm \n     the rebels, but he said Albania has informally communicated \n     its desire to do so. The United States has made clear it \n     continues to oppose arming or training the rebels, Rubin \n     said.\n       The Clinton administration does not support the rebels' \n     objective of a Kosovo independent of Serbia, Yugoslavia's \n     dominant republic. However, administration officials have \n     warned that the longer NATO's air war continues, the greater \n     the chances are that the guerrilla army will fill a power \n     vacuum in Kosovo.\n       Zogaj said Albanian officials raised the question of arming \n     the Kosovo rebels with U.S. Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's \n     supreme commander, when he visited Tirana Saturday. Zogaj \n     said officials have made the same request repeatedly to U.S. \n     officials in the past three weeks. Zogaj said Clark refused, \n     adding that the general cited the arms embargo placed on \n     Yugoslavia as a barrier to such a move.\n       But Zogaj said that Albanian officials inferred from their \n     conversations with Clark that he really feared that if NATO \n     armed the rebels, Russia would arm the Serbs. Zogaj said the \n     KLA was obtaining new arms on the international black market \n     and continued to buy weapons from Serbian arms merchants \n     despite the war. Zogaj also estimated that 8,000 new rebel \n     recruits from other countries have arrived in Albania in the \n     past four weeks. If true, that could nearly double the size \n     of the rebel fighting force.\n       Albania is one of more than two dozen European countries \n     that will join NATO's 19 members in Washington, for a three-\n     day summit that begins Friday.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Milosevic's storm troopers must face operations in the \nair and on the ground. The KLA is willing to wage this war on the \nground. It is their homes that are being burned,\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\ntheir businesses destroyed; and, worse, their wives and sisters being \nraped, their families being slaughtered. They don't need convincing to \nsummon the will to fight. What they need is international support.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have a proposal which will begin this effort. \nIf the only people willing to fight are the KLA, we should do what we \ncan to see that they have the ability to do so. Who else will provide \nthe necessary deterrent to Milosevic and his army? The administration \nhas made it clear that it will not be America's sons and daughters. I \ndon't want to see United States soldiers fighting this war, but I also \ncannot abide the continued extermination of the people of Kosovo. They \nare entitled to defend themselves. We should not delay any further in \nour commitment to their legitimate cause.\n  Let me sum this up as I see my friend from Connecticut is here. What \nwe have is a situation with the KLA where their leaders are in \ncommunication with the State Department and our military on a daily \nbasis. We have an organization which, by telephone, is identifying \nmilitary targets inside Kosovo for our planes. We are dealing with the \nKLA multiple times a day, both diplomatically and militarily. We are \nobviously pulling for them. We are egging them on. We are saying, ``Go \nout there and do it.'' But when they request an opportunity to be \nadequately armed, we say no. It is an utterly absurd position.\n  We have heard the rumors around town. We heard these in the 1980s, \nwhen the issue was supporting the contras, that there are some bad \ncharacters in the KLA. I don't think we have time to run a background \ncheck on everybody involved in this effort. The question is simply \nthis: Who else is willing to fight the fight on the ground inside \nKosovo on behalf of the Kosovar Albanians? There is nobody else willing \nto fight this war on the turf. We are already cooperating with them. We \nalready deal with them on a daily basis. We are encouraging them. They \nare our allies. Why not give them the opportunity to engage in a fair \nfight on the ground inside Kosovo where the atrocities are occurring?\n  The growing suspicion of all of us is that this air war can go on \nforever and not have an impact on the real problem, which is inside \nKosovo. The Senator from Connecticut and I believe we are advocating \nhere a proposal that is in the best interests of the United States of \nAmerica and of NATO. We have obviously picked a side. We are on their \nside. The question is whether we should fight this war entirely on \ntheir behalf or whether we should give them an opportunity to help us \nfight it--since it is their land, their family, and their principal \nconcern. We think we have a proposal here that makes sense.\n  Finally, for a mere $25 million--which is less than we are spending \non these air raids per night--we could arm the KLA for up to 18 months \nto give them a chance to defend their wives, their homes, and their \nfamilies.\n  So I thank the Senator from Connecticut for joining with me on this \nproposal. I see he is here now to speak on its behalf.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kosova Self-Defense Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States to provide the \n     interim government of Kosova with the capability to defend \n     and protect the civilian population of Kosova against armed \n     aggression.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SECURITY \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to funds \n     otherwise available to carry out section 23 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763), there are authorized to \n     be appropriated to the President to carry out the provisions \n     of such section, $25,000,000, which amount shall be made \n     available only for grants to the interim government of Kosova \n     to be used for training and support for the established self-\n     defense forces to carry out the policy of section 2.\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n     SEC. 4. RELATION TO EXISTING AUTHORITIES IN LAW.\n\n       Assistance provided under section 3 may be made available \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law (including any \n     executive order or directive or any rule or regulation).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nKentucky, with whom I am proud to join in this effort, and I thank him, \nreally, for his initiative and leadership in this regard. He was the \nfirst, that I am aware of, to make this proposal. It made a lot of \nsense to me when we talked about it.\n  I must say, from the time we introduced it--which must be 4 weeks \nago, now, when the NATO air campaign began--to today, it seems to me \nthe logic and the morality that was behind the original proposal has \ngrown greater. In fact, the support has grown for this proposal from \nthose whom I respect, who think deeply about this matter. Some at the \nhigh levels of our Government, while not supporting our proposal to arm \nthe Kosovars, nonetheless have increasingly spoken of the Kosovar \nLiberation Army positively, as the Senator from Kentucky indicated, \nreferring to its members as our allies, and even defended them against \nsome of the criticisms that have been heard against them.\n  Yesterday I came to the floor to join with several colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to introduce a resolution which would authorize the \nPresident, as Commander in Chief, to take all actions necessary to \nachieve the objectives that NATO has stated for our action in the \nBalkans: To remove the Serbian military and paramilitary from Kosovo, \nto allow the Kosovars to return to their homes to live in peace, and to \nprovide for an international peacekeeping force. It seems to me one of \nthe steps that might be taken--and taken as soon as humanly possible--\nwhich supports the three NATO objectives, is exactly the proposal that \nSenator McConnell and I are making, which is to offer some truly \nminimal support to help arm and hopefully, at some point, better train \nthe Kosovars who are fighting to defend their own communities, their \nown families, their own freedom, their own lives.\n  I think there are compelling strategic and moral reasons that argue \nfor this legislation. The fact is, we are engaged in a battle, and it \nis a difficult battle. I am one who believes the NATO aerial \nbombardments, which will probably continue for weeks, are hurting the \nSerbs. Hopefully this bombardment will bring the leadership in Belgrade \nto their senses so they will order the Serbian troops out of Kosovo, \nwhich is one of our objectives. But let's speak truthfully about this. \nThere is no indication of any breaking of will in Belgrade at the \ncurrent time. There simply is none. If, after weeks and perhaps months \nof bombardment and still Milosevic does not yield we will not have \nachieved our objectives. Then we will face a stark choice. What my \nfriend from Kentucky and I are saying is, at that point we will ask \nourselves, how can we alter the status quo on the ground, since the air \ncampaign has not done it? And the only way to do that, of course, is \nwith forces on the ground. Then we will face a very difficult choice, \nwhich I have said I believe we have to at least begin to think about \nand consider and plan for, if that is necessary. That is whether to \nintroduce NATO ground forces, including American soldiers into conflict \nin the Balkans.\n  But the fact is, as the Senator from Kentucky said, there are forces \non the ground now fighting the Serbian invaders. They are the Kosovars \nthemselves. They have by far the deepest and most genuine reason to \nfight, and they have the will to do so. They are fighting to defend \nthemselves and their neighbors, their communities. They are fighting \nwith remarkable resilience. The fact is, Milosevic had two aims in \ninvading Kosovo. One was obviously to eliminate the Kosovars, to \nslaughter some of them, to torture and rape others, and expel the rest. \nA critical part of that strategy, the other aim was to defeat, totally \ndefeat, the force on the ground, the indigenous force that is fighting \nMilosevic and frustrating his desires. That is the KLA, the Kosovar \nLiberation Army. Remarkably, He has failed totally at that.\n  Of course many people who have worn the uniform and carried the flag \nof the KLA have lost their lives already, but the numbers in uniform\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nthere have grown as people from all over the world, not just from \nwithin Kosovo--including hundreds, maybe thousands, from the United \nStates, Albanian Americans--have gone over there to fight this just \nfight. So they are on the ground, ready to fight. But they do not have \nenough to fight with. They do not have a lot of ammunition. In some \ncases they do not even have a lot of food.\n  But we have a common enemy here. Remember the old slogan, ``The enemy \nof my enemy is my friend.'' The enemy of our enemy, Milosevic, is now \nour ally in this fight. Senator McConnell said it. Our military is \ntalking to them every day. They are providing us with valuable \ninformation from the ground that has helped us to target enemy \nlocations in Kosovo. So we have crossed that bridge. Why not do the \nnext logical step to advance our military purposes and to support them \nwith arms?\n  I make a moral argument here, too, as well as a strategic argument. \nNo matter what else was happening, these poor people have been \nvictimized in a way we hate to imagine. But we have to imagine it \nbecause we see it on TV every day. We read about it in the newspaper. \nThe fortunate ones do not look very fortunate at all. They are the ones \nwho have been expelled. I say that comparatively, of course, because \nthe ones who are less fortunate are the ones who have been slaughtered, \nwho have lost their lives, who have been separated from their families \nand may well be trapped in areas of Kosovo now where they are starving.\n  So these people are exercising not just their legal right but their \nmoral right to defend themselves. That right is at the heart of our own \nhistory and our own moral system. What was our Revolution about? It was \nabout a valiant attempt by a band of patriots, freedom fighters, to \nbreak loose of the Crown and the suppression it was imposing on \ncolonial America--fortunately, much less brutal and barbaric than that \nimposed on the people of Kosovo by the Serbs, and by Milosevic \nparticularly.\n  So I think we cannot stand by and watch this slaughter. That is why \nwe got involved in the first place. But I also think we cannot stand by \nand watch these brave people, against superior forces, equipped with \nmuch more than they have, fight, and not want to come to their defense.\n  I know there are critics of these people, as Senator McConnell has \nsaid. Some say the KLA is composed of extremists, Marxists; they may \nhave connection with groups in the world which we oppose. Some even say \nsome of them are drug runners. I cannot vouch for every one of the \nthousands of members of the Kosovar Liberation Army. I cannot speak to \nevery place they are receiving funds, though I would say that a \nstarving person does not ask the ideology or source of income of a \nperson offering him or her food.\n  In the same way, in ways that we may not like, people who are \nfighting for their freedom against very difficult odds may not always \nquestion the sources of help they need so desperately.\n  Of course, the best way for us to overcome these questions is for \nourselves and, hopefully, some of our NATO allies to become the sources \nof financial support for the Kosovar Liberation Army. I will share with \nyou my impression, based on all that I have read and studied about the \nKosovar Liberation Army--the UCK, as they are called in their native \nlanguage--and all that I have heard about them from their friends and \nrelatives in this country, fellow Americans.\n  If I may, it reminds me of that old line about what is the definition \nof a conservative? A conservative is a liberal who has been mugged. \nThat is from an earlier time. What is the definition of a member of the \nKLA? It is probably a citizen of Kosovo who has watched his house burn, \nhis brother murdered and his daughter raped.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Connecticut has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes for the Senator from Connecticut and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Can I ask the Senator from Connecticut a question \nrelated to the point he just made?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Connecticut not agree that if \nyour house is being burned and your wife is being raped, you are not \nlikely to ask the question: Who is this person who is offering to help \nme? And if our Government were truly offended or if our Government were \ntruly convinced about all these rumors that have been spread around \nabout the KLA, does not my friend from Connecticut agree we would not \nbe taking their phone calls at the State Department and the military \nand we would not be accepting their advice about what military targets \nto hit? Is that a reasonable assumption?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator is correct. It is more than a reasonable \nassumption. I am a member of the Armed Services Committee. We recently \nhad a hearing on Kosovo with Secretary Cohen and General Shelton. I was \nquite struck by two things: First, to hear General Shelton say that one \nof our aims of our air campaign is to degrade the Serbian military in \nKosovo so that the UCK--the KLA--can achieve a balance of power with \nthe Serbian forces there. So we have the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs \nof Staff linking us with them. Of course, the better way, the easier \nway to achieve that balance of power is by arming the Kosovars.\n  The second is, one of the members of the committee echoed some of the \ncriticisms of the KLA--terrorists, extremists, drug merchants. And \nSecretary Cohen, our Defense Secretary, serving with remarkable skill \nin this crisis, came to the defense of the KLA and said, yes, he \ncouldn't say that everyone there was an angel, but that the balance of \nequities of morality was clearly on the side of the KLA.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does my friend from Connecticut also share my memory, \nsince we have been in several of these meetings with the President on \nthis subject, that the only piece of good news about what is going on \ninside Kosovo at the last meeting was a report that the KLA was growing \nin strength? It was the only piece of good news about the condition \nwithin Kosovo. Does my friend from Connecticut also share my memory of \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. May I ask, Mr. President, for an additional 5 minutes \nfor the Senator from Kentucky and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. The Senator from Kentucky is quite \nright. That is my recollection, that there was a very good report \ngiven, with some surprise, but admiration, I say, by the intelligence \ncommunities that the numbers fighting with the KLA have, in fact, \ngrown. There is such a painful irony here. As we both said, while the \nair campaign goes on, the suffering, the expulsion, the murder \nnonetheless goes on in Kosovo on the ground, and the only force there \nthat can stop it now is the KLA, and we are hesitating to support them.\n\n  I take them to be much more in the spirit of partisans who fought \nduring the Second World War against overwhelming odds, perhaps even the \nfreedom fighters in Hungary during 1956 and later in Prague, during the \nPrague spring. We have not only a strategic tie with them, it is much \nmore consistent with our own history and values and our belief in \ndemocracy that we try to support this group, which, as the Senator \nsays, is not being vanquished.\n  The truth is, if I were Milosevic, the one thing I would fear is the \nUnited States and the West arming the KLA because he knows their zeal, \ntheir purpose, the will they have to fight. They are brave. They will \ntake losses because they are fighting for a greater purpose, and, in \nfact, if I were Milosevic, the one thing I would fear, and what I \nbelieve he will face in any case, is a long-term indigenous insurgency, \nwhich I predict he will never be able to stop. The sooner we help them, \nthe sooner we bring them to the result that they and we want.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Connecticut, what our bill is \nall about is really an effort to call on the President to change this \npolicy. We should not have to offer the bill that we are offering. We \nare offering it, but we should not have to offer it because\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nit makes elementary good sense to give the people, on whose behalf we \nare fighting this war, a chance to participate themselves.\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut, does he not agree, this is what \nthis is about, to give the people, on whose behalf we are fighting this \nwar, a chance to participate themselves?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Kentucky is absolutely right. That is \nthe purpose. The purpose is to push this option, this act which will \nsupport our objectives, objectives for which we are spending billions \nof dollars and already risking American lives, to push us closer to \nachieving those objectives and also, if I may add, to hopefully force \nsome discussion of this option among our NATO allies.\n  One of the arguments we hear about why this is not being considered \nby the administration is that there is opposition to it among our NATO \nallies. But we also hear there is opposition among our NATO allies, \nwhich I understand at this point, to the introduction of NATO ground \nforces. If there is opposition in NATO, as there is in Congress and in \nthe administration, as the Senator has said, to the introduction of \nground forces, including Americans, then, again, isn't it both wise \nmilitarily and powerful morally for us to as soon as possible be \nhelping the fighters on the ground, the KLA?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, I say to my friend from Connecticut, isn't it \nreasonable to argue that the only reason these refugees have been \ncreated is because there was no effective fighting force on the ground \ninside Kosovo? No way to defend your home, no way to defend your \nfamily, and what do you do when you are afraid? You run. That is what \nhas created the refugee problem, which is presumably what our European \nallies care about most--the spillover into their countries.\n  The only effective way, the Senator from Connecticut and I are \nsaying, to prevent a further accumulation of refugees is for there to \nbe some fighting force on the ground in Kosovo adequately trained and \nequipped in order to fight this battle where it counts.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Kentucky is right, and there is a \npainful irony here. He is absolutely right both about our objectives on \nthe ground and our objectives to maintain stability in the region which \nis being destabilized now by these large refugee flows.\n  The victories, if one can call them that, that the tragic, brutal, \nbarbaric victories that Milosevic's forces have had over the Kosovars \nare hollow. They are barbaric because this was an armed force fighting \nagainst unarmed, undefended people. It is a question that will hang in \nthe air--and some later time we will come back to it--what might have \nbeen different if, in fact, the KLA had been better armed at the outset \nof this a month or two or three ago, because I think that might have \ndeterred, certainly delayed the massive exodus and slaughter that has \nbeen carried out against this undefended indigenous population.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is no question the Senator from Connecticut is \ncorrect. The good news is, it is not too late. The KLA is bigger and \nmore committed today than it was 2 months ago when this policy also \nmade sense.\n  Mr. President, I encourage cosponsorship on behalf of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Kentucky for his leadership. We \nintend to pursue this and urge our colleagues to consider it as quickly \nas possible so that we may do something concrete and tangible that \nreally can alter the balance of power and the balance of morality and \nthe balance militarily on the ground in Kosovo.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 847. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexclude clinical social worker services from coverage under the \nmedicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                medicare social work equity act of 1999\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nSocial Work Equity Act of 1999. I am proud to sponsor this legislation \nwhich will amend section 4432 in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which \nprevents social workers from directly billing Medicare for mental \nhealth services provided in skilled nursing facilities (SNF's). This \nbill will also ensure that clinical social workers (CSW's) can receive \nMedicare reimbursement for mental health services they provide in \nskilled nursing facilities. I am honored to be joined by my good \nfriends Senators Murray, Inouye, Hollings, Wyden, Johnson, Reid, and \nBingaman who care equally about correcting these inequities for social \nworkers and about ensuring quality mental health services for nursing \nhome residents.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) changed the payment method for \nskilled nursing facility care. Before BBA, reimbursement was made after \nservices had been delivered for the reasonable costs incurred. However \nthis ``cost-based system'' was blamed for inordinate growth in Medicare \nspending at skilled nursing facilities.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 phased in a prospective payment \nsystem for skilled nursing facilities that was fully implemented on \nJanuary 1, 1999, for Medicare part A services. Payments for part B \nservices for skilled nursing facility residents are to be consolidated. \nThis means that the provider of the services must bill the facility \ninstead of directly billing Medicare. The consolidated billing \nprovision has been delayed indefinitely by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) while it addresses Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance \nissues.\n  However, Congress was careful to not include psychologists and \npsychiatrists in this consolidated billing provision. Social workers \nwere included, I think by mistake. Clinical social workers are the \nprimary providers of mental health services to residents of nursing \nhomes, particularly in underserved urban and rural areas. CSW's are \nalso the most cost effective mental health providers.\n\n  This legislation is important for three reasons: First, I am \nconcerned that section 4432 inadvertently reduces mental health \nservices to nursing home residents. Second, I believe that the \nconsolidated billing requirement will result in a shift from using \nsocial workers to other mental health professionals who are reimbursed \nat a higher cost to Medicare. Finally, I am concerned that clinical \nsocial workers will lose their jobs in nursing homes or will be \ninadequately reimbursed.\n  In addition, this bill ensures that clinical social workers can \nreceive Medicare reimbursement for mental health services they provide \nin skilled nursing facilities. An April 1998, HCFA rule would have \neffectively eliminated Medicare reimbursement for clinical social \nworker services provided to residents of SNF's, whether or not their \nstay was being paid by Medicare, Medicaid, or a private payer. It would \nhave deemed all mental health services provided to nursing home \nresidents ``required'' services, not distinguishing between the mental \nhealth diagnosis and treatment services provided by CSW's and the \nrequired medically-related social services provided at the SNF.\n  Facilities would likely bring in a psychiatrist or psychologist (if \navailable) because services provided by them could still be billed \nseparately This would affect seniors in many rural and underserved \nareas where CSW's are often the only available mental health provider \nand have developed relationships over time with these SNF patients. \nHCFA delayed this rule for two years. However, clarification is needed \nin the law to ensure that CSW's can be reimbursed by Medicare for the \nmental health services they provide to inpatients in SNF's. This bill \nmakes that necessary change.\n  I like this bill because it will correct inequities for America's \nsocial workers, it will assure quality of care for nursing home \nresidents, and will assure cost efficiency for Medicare. This bill is \nstrongly supported by the National Association of Social Workers, \nClinical Social Work Federation, American Psychological Association, \nAmerican Group Psychotherapy Association, Bazelon Center for Mental \nHealth Law, National Mental Health Association, National Council for \nCommunity Behavioral Health Care, National Association of Protection \nand Advocacy Systems, Anxiety Disorders Association of America, and the \nMental Health and Aging Network of the American Society on Aging. I now \nlook forward to the Senate's support of this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. Feinstein:\n  S. 848. A bill to designate a portion of the Otay Mountain region of \nCalifornia as wilderness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4033-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4033-S4055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OTAY MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Otay \nMountain Wilderness Act of 1999. This bill would designate an 18,500 \nacre portion of the Otay Mountain region in Southern California as \nwilderness. The bill passed the House last week on a voice vote, with \nbroad bi-partisan support.\n  Otay Mountain, which is located near the U.S.-Mexico border in \neastern San Diego County, is one of California's most special wild \nplaces. The mountain is a unique ecosystem, home to 20 sensitive plant \nand animal species. The endangered quino checkerspot butterfly calls \nOtay Mountain home, and the only known stand of Tecate cypress, as well \nas the only known population of the Mexican flannel bush, also thrive \non the mountain. For these reasons, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management \nfirst recommended Otay Mountain for wilderness designation in the \n1980s.\n  In addition, Otay Mountain is key to San Diego County's habitat \nconservation planning efforts. The County has identified the region as \na core reserve in the multi-species habitat conservation plan that it \nis currently developing.\n  Otay Mountain is scenic, rugged, and beautiful. The area is well \nworth preserving as wilderness for generations to come. This bill will \nensure that San Diegans, and indeed all Americans, will be able to \nexperience and enjoy Otay Mountain in all its unique splendor.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years Otay Mountain's sensitive habitat has \nbeen damaged by illegal immigration and narcotics activity in the area. \nThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management has worked closely with the U.S. \nBorder Patrol to bring these problems under control, and they have \nexperienced great success. This legislation would specifically allow \nBorder Patrol and firefighting activities to continue in the new \nwilderness area, so long as they remain in accordance with the 1964 \nWilderness Act. This provision in the legislation is specific to Otay \nMountain and will not apply to any other wilderness area.\n  I want to thank Congressman Brian Bilbray for his leadership in \nintroducing the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and guiding it through the \nHouse of Representatives. I also want to thank Congressman Filner, who \nhas been a steadfast supporter of the legislation, along with the \nClinton Administration. The California Departments of Fish and Game and \nFire and Forestry Protection support the bill, as do the Endangered \nHabitats League and other environmental groups. Finally, the bill has \nstrong support from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and the \nSan Diego Association of Governments.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to \napprove the Otay Mountain Wilderness Act and send the bill to the \nPresident for signature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Otay Mountain Wilderness Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the public land in the Otay Mountain region of \n     California is one of the last remaining pristine locations in \n     western San Diego County, California;\n       (2) this rugged mountain adjacent to the United States-\n     Mexico border is internationally known for having a diversity \n     of unique and sensitive plants;\n       (3) this area plays a critical role in San Diego's multi-\n     species conservation plan, a national model made for \n     maintaining biodiversity;\n       (4) due to the proximity of the Otay Mountain region to the \n     international border, this area is the focus of important law \n     enforcement and border interdiction efforts necessary to \n     curtail illegal immigration and protect the area's wilderness \n     values; and\n       (5) the illegal immigration traffic, combined with the \n     rugged topography, present unique fire management challenges \n     for protecting lives and resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Public land.--The term ``public land'' has the meaning \n     given the term ``public lands'' in section 103 of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (3) Wilderness area.--The term ``Wilderness Area'' means \n     the Otay Mountain Wilderness designated by section 4.\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGNATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--In accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), there is designated as wilderness and \n     as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System \n     certain public land in the California Desert District of the \n     Bureau of Land Management, California, comprising \n     approximately 18,500 acres as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled ``Otay Mountain Wilderness'' and dated May 7, 1998.\n       (b) Otay Mountain Wilderness.--The area designated under \n     subsection (a) shall be known as the Otay Mountain \n     Wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 5. MAP AND LEGAL DESCRIPTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, a map and a legal description for the \n     Wilderness Area shall be filed by the Secretary with--\n       (1) the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \n     Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (b) Force and Effect.--The map and legal description shall \n     have the same force and effect as if included in this Act, \n     except that the Secretary, as appropriate, may correct \n     clerical and typographical errors in the map and legal \n     description.\n       (c) Availability.--The map and legal description for the \n     Wilderness Area shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the offices of the Director and California \n     State Director of the Bureau of Land Management.\n       (d) United States-Mexico Border.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall ensure that the southern \n     boundary of the Wilderness Area is--\n       (1) 100 feet north of the trail depicted on the map \n     referred to in subsection (a); and\n       (2) not less than 100 feet from the United States-Mexico \n     international border.\n\n     SEC. 6. WILDERNESS REVIEW.\n\n       All public land not designated as wilderness within the \n     boundaries of the Southern Otay Mountain Wilderness Study \n     Area (CA-060-029) and the Western Otay Mountain Wilderness \n     Study Area (CA-060-028) managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management and reported to the Congress in 1991--\n       (1) have been adequately studied for wilderness designation \n     under section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782); and\n       (2) shall no longer be subject to the requirements \n     contained in section 603(c) of that Act pertaining to the \n     management of wilderness study areas in a manner that does \n     not impair the suitability of those areas for preservation as \n     wilderness.\n\n     SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION OF WILDERNESS AREA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights and to \n     subsection (b), the Wilderness Area shall be administered by \n     the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), except that for the purposes of the \n     Wilderness Area--\n       (1) any reference in that Act to the effective date of that \n     Act shall be considered to be a reference to the effective \n     date of this Act; and\n       (2) any reference in that Act to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall be considered to be a reference to the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       (b) Border Enforcement, Drug Interdiction, and Wildland \n     Fire Protection.--Because of the proximity of the Wilderness \n     Area to the United States-Mexico international border, drug \n     interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management \n     operations are common management actions throughout the area \n     encompassing the Wilderness Area.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrant programs for youth substance abuse prevention and treatment; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\n           youth substance abuse prevention and treatment act\n\n  Mr. Bingaman. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Youth \nSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This bill is designed to \nincrease access to drug prevention and treatment services for our \nnation's youth. It also provides for critical training of health care \nprofessionals who work tirelessly with young people with drug problems.\n\n  Nationwide only 20% of the 648,000 youth with severe substance use or \ndependency receive treatment. The statistics tell the tale and it is an \nunacceptable story.\n  Heroin use has doubled among teenagers in the 1990's.\n  More than 50% of 12th graders have tried an illicit drug.\n  In senior high schools across the country, 25% of students use an \nillicit drug on a monthly basis, and by the 12th grade, more than \nthree-fourths of students have used alcohol, and over 30 percent are \nbinge drinkers (more than five drinks at a sitting).\n  By the time they are seniors, almost one in four teens are current \nmarijuana users and 1 in 20 use every day and this number is on the \nrise.\n  Studies have also indicated that youth who have used marijuana and \nother drugs in the past year were more likely than non-users to report \nproblem behaviors including running away from home, stealing, skipping \nschool, selling drugs, drunkdriving, and considering suicide.\n  Over the past several months, I have had the opportunity to hear \nfirst hand about the drug problem in New Mexico and the barriers for \nproviding services that confront health care professionals and families \neveryday.\n  Drug use seems to be more common among youth in New Mexico than \nnationally. In fact, most underage teens in New Mexico drink alcohol; \nover one-third of seventh grade students and over three-fourths of 12th \ngrade student reported drinking alcohol. Eighteen percent of 8th \ngraders in New Mexico used illegal drugs other than marijuana in the \npast year compared to 12% nationally. In my state, ninth graders' \nillicit drug use has been increasing. This trend is of great concern \nbecause we also know that the younger people begin to use drugs or \nalcohol, the greater the chance they will continue to use drugs as \nadults.\n  With drug and alcohol use come other problem behaviors, violence, \nproperty damage, and threatening behavior; and in New Mexico these \nbehaviors occur at a greater frequency than the national rates. In \nfact, nationally, the majority of teens enter substance abuse treatment \nonly after they have had contact with juvenile justice authorities.\n  There is another significant problem confronting our nation. Illicit \ndrug use among Native American youth is very high. According to Bureau \nof Indian Affairs officials, alcohol-related automobile accidents are \nthe leading cause of death among Native American youth. We must address \nthis issue.\n\n  The Youth Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act provides funds \nfor:\n  School-based community after-school prevention programs; schools and \nhealth providers working hand-in-hand with students and families to \nassure early identification and referral for at-risk students.\n  This bill also provides funding for youth treatment and encourages \nthe use of community-based wrap around services.\n  This measure also includes special provisions for youth who live in \nrural areas as well as for Native Americans. These two youth \npopulations are particularly suffering from a serious lack of \nprevention and treatment services.\n  The Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, Dr. Alan \nLeschner has stated that addiction is a treatable disease. While there \nhave been advances in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, \ndissemination of this valuable and potentially life-saving information \nis not consistently getting out to grassroots health care providers. \nThat is why this legislation also assists healthcare professionals in \naccessing the latest information on emerging drug threats and the most \nrecent advances in prevention and treatment techniques.\n  I am especially concerned with rural and remote areas where health \ncare professionals may have to travel hours to attend a conference, \nmany times on their limited time off.\n  The evidence in support of prevention and treatment is overwhelming; \nboth in social and economic terms. Several studies have demonstrated \nthat for every dollar spent on drug treatment the community gets back \nanywhere from six to seven dollars in reduced crime, and other lowered \nsocial costs. For youth especially, we see improved school attendance, \nbetter grades, and a reduction in violent and other anti-social \nbehaviors.\n  There is one other benefit that is derived from adequately treating \nyoung people; when we help these young people, they are healthier and \nhappier. We cannot forget the personal and family tragedy associated \nwhen youth are involved with drugs.\n  I recognize that this bill does not provide the entire solution, but \nit is a necessary step in addressing this national problem. I am \ncommitted to solving the problem of inadequate access to drug \nprevention and treatment services for all young people. I welcome my \ncolleagues to work with me to ensure that all American youth who need \naccess to these services, have the opportunity to pursue their dreams \nand when they stumble, we are there as a community to help. That is \nwhat this bill is all about and I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the Youth \nSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 849\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1.

A bill to make schools safer by waiving the local matching \nrequirement under the Community Policing program for the placement of \nlaw enforcement officers in local schools; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      cops in schools act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we are faced again with an tragedy \nin one of America's schools. There are many things that schools are and \ncould be doing to prevent violence--and many ways the federal \ngovernment could help. But, today, I am going to speak to just one of \nthem.\n  Under the COPS program--President Clinton's initiative to put 100,000 \nnew police officers on our streets--local governments are required to \nprovide 25 percent of the funding. But, the Attorney General has the \nauthority to waive the local matching requirement for any reason.\n  Last summer, I called on the Justice Department to establish a \nblanket waiver policy for any local community that wanted to place a \nlaw enforcement officer in a public school. To its credit, the \nDepartment has done so in some cases, and it says it will continue to \ndo so on a case-by-case basis.\n  But, Mr. President, that is not good enough. We need to tell our \nlocal communities that the local match will be waived, period, for any \nnew police officer hired to be in the schools. I have again called on \nthe Administration to establish such a waiver policy--and to tell our \nlocal communities about it. Just in case, however, I am also \nintroducing legislation today--the COPS in Schools Act--to require a \nwaiver.\n  I am not advocating putting police officers in the schools just to \npatrol. Nor do I want people to think our schools are or should be \njails or combat zones. Police officers in schools are important to work \nwith school staff to develop anti-crime policies on campus, to \nimplement procedures to ensure a safer school environment, and to \nreassure parents that a police officer is there to deal with those \nstudents that might cause problems.\n  Children in public schools have a right to be safe, and it is our \nobligation to ensure their safety. It is as fundamental as the right to \na free public education. Let's not wait for yet another tragedy to get \nadequate protection for America's school children. My bill is a small \nstep, and it is not the only step we need to take. But, it can help to \nreduce the chance of more bloodshed at yet another school.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Moynihan)\n  S. 851. A bill to allow Federal employees to take advantage of the \ntransportation fringe benefit provisions of the Internal Revenue Code \nthat are available to private sector employees; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                FEDERAL EMPLOYEE FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator \nMoynihan, the Federal Employee Flexibility Act of 1999, a bill that \nwould provide flexibility and choices for Federal employees.\n  This flexibility was provided to private sector employees in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century (TEA 21). We believe that these provisions provide to \nemployers and employees important new flexibility which should reduce \nsingle occupant vehicle trips from our highways and therefore \ncontribute to reduced congestion, a cleaner environment, and increased \nenergy conservation.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century include significant changes to the way the Internal \nRevenue Code treats employer-provided transportation fringe benefits. \nUnfortunately, we have become aware that personnel compensation law for \nFederal employees restricts implementation of this new flexibility.\n  Prior to enactment of these two bills, the Federal tax code provided \nthat employer-provided parking is not subject to Federal taxation, up \nto $170 per month. However, this tax exemption was lost for all \nemployees if the parking was offered in lieu of compensation for just \none employee. In other words, if an employer gave just one employee a \nchoice between parking and some other benefit (such as a transit pass, \nor increased salary), the parking of all other employees in the company \nbecame taxable. It goes without saying that no employers jeopardized a \ntax benefit for the overwhelming majority of their employees to provide \nflexibility to others. In effect, the tax code prohibited employers \nfrom offering their employees a choice. Parking was a take-it or leave-\nit benefit.\n  The changes in these two laws make it possible for employers to offer \ntheir employees more choices by eliminating the take-it or leave-it \nrestriction in the Federal tax code. Employees whose only \ntransportation benefit is parking can now instead accept a salary \nenhancement, and find other means to get to work such as car pooling, \nvan pooling, biking, walking, or taking transit.\n  Unfortunately, Federal employees will not be able to benefit from the \nincreased flexibility available to private sector employees, unless \nFederal compensation law is modified. Current Federal law provides that \na Federal employee may not receive additional pay unless specifically \nauthorized by law. Therefore, a Federal employee could not ``cash out'' \na parking space at work, and instead receive cash or other benefits.\n  To address this limitation for transit passes and similar benefits, \nthe ``Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act'' enacted in 1993 \nallows the Federal government to provide transit benefits, bicycle \nservices, and non-monetary incentives to employees. However, when this \nlegislation was enacted, the Federal tax code prohibited the so-called \n``cash out'' option discussed above, and therefore was not included in \nthe list of transportation-related exemptions in that statute.\n  The short and simple bill we introduce today would add ``taxable cash \nreimbursement for the value of an employer-provided parking space'' to \nthe list of benefits that can be received by Federal employees.\n  This bill is very similar to a bill Senator Moynihan and I sponsored \nin the 105th Congress, S. 2575 and H.R. 4777 sponsored in the House by \nRepresentatives Norton, Nadler, Morella, and\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\nMoran. These same House colleagues are today introducing a bill \nidentical to the bill we introduce today.\n  Let me assure my colleagues and Federal employees that this bill \nwould not require that Federal employees lose their parking spaces, as \nmay be feared when there is discussion of Federal employee parking \nspaces. The bill simply provides Federal employees the same flexibility \nthat is available to private sector employees. Employees who want to \nretain their tax-free parking space would be free to do so.\n  We think it is vital that the Federal government show leadership on \nthe application of new and innovative ways to solve our transportation \nand environmental problems. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this bill and that we can act swiftly on it in this session \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CASH PAYMENT TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR PARKING \n                   SPACES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal \n     Employee Flexibility Act of 1999''.\n       (b) In General.--Section 7905 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2)(C) by inserting ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in paragraph (3) by striking ``; and'' and inserting a \n     period; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:\n       ``(A) a qualified transportation fringe as defined in \n     section 132(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;'';\n       (B) in subparagraph (B) by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (C) in subparagraph (C) by striking the period and \n     inserting a semicolon and ``and''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) taxable cash payment to an employee in lieu of an \n     agency-provided parking space.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 852. A bill to award grants for school construction; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  excellence in education act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprovide funds to build new schools. It is the Excellence in Education \nAct of 1999.\n  The purpose of this bill is to (1) reduce the size of schools and (2) \nreduce the size of classes. The bill would create a 50-50 matching \ngrant program to build new schools to meet the following size \nrequirements:\n  School size requirement:\n  for kindergarten through 5th grade, not more than 500 students;\n  for grades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students; and\n  for grades 9 through 12, not more than 1,500 students.\n  Class size requirement:\n  for kindergarten through grade 6, not more than 20 students per \nteacher;\n  for grades 7 through 12, not more than 28 students per teacher.\n  The bill authorizes $5 billion each year for the next five years for \nthe U.S. Department of Education to award grants to local school \ndistricts. School districts would have to match federal funds with an \nequal amount. In addition to making the above reductions, school \ndistricts would be required to terminate social promotion, provide \nremedial education and require that students be subject to state \nachievement standards in the core academic curriculum.\n  Why do we need this bill?\n  First, many of our schools are just too big, especially in urban \nareas. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. ``It's not \nunusual to find high schools of 2,000, 3,000, or even 4,000 students \nand junior high schools of 1,500 or more, especially in urban school \nsystems,'' writes Thomas Toch in the Washington Post. In these \nmonstrous schools, the principal is just a disembodied voice over the \npublic address system.\n  Equally serious is the fact that our classes are too big. Even though \nwe have begun to reduce class sizes in my state, California still has \nsome of the largest class sizes in the U.S. The National Center for \nEducation Statistics says California's classrooms have the highest \npupil-teacher ratios in the nation.\n  This bill will provide a new funding source for school districts or \nstates to match to build new schools and reduce both school size and \nclass size. There is no good estimate of how many schools would be \nneeded to reduce schools and classes to the levels specified in the \namendment, but we all know that there are many large schools and large \nclasses in public education today.\n  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build \n6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This \nestimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school \nsizes. The needs are no doubt huge.\n  My state that has some of the largest schools in the country. Our \nstudents are crammed into every available space, even in cafeterias and \nlibraries. Today, 20 percent of our students are in portable \nclassrooms. There were 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in 1998. \nHere are some examples:\n  High Schools:\n  Roosevelt High School (Los Angeles), 4,902;\n  Huntington Park High School, 4,275;\n  Roosevelt High School, Fresno, 3,692;\n  Berkeley High School, Berkeley, 3,025; and\n  Mt. Carmel High School, San Diego, 3,279.\n  Intermediate Schools:\n  Clark Intermediate School, Clovis, 2,744 students;\n  Gianni Middle School, San Francisco, 1,336; and\n  O'Farrell Middle School, San Diego, 1,441.\n  Elementary Schools:\n  Rosa Parks Elementary School, San Diego, 1,423;\n  Winchell Elementary School Fresno, 1,392;\n  Zamorano Elementary School, San Diego, 1,424; and\n  Kerman/Floyd Elementary School, Fresno, 1,000.\n  California also has some of the largest classes sizes in the nation. \nIn 1996-1997, California had the second highest teacher-pupil ratio in \nthe nation, at 22.8 students per teacher. Fortunately since 1996, the \nstate has significantly cut class sizes in grades K-3, but 15 percent \nor 300,000 of our K-3 students have not benefitted from this reform. \nAnd students above grade 3 have not been touched.\n  Here are some examples of classes in my state:\n  Fourth grade, statewide, 29 students; sixth grade, statewide, 29.5 \nstudents.\n  National City Middle School San Diego, English and math, 34 to 36 \nstudents.\n  Berryessa School District in San Jose--fourth grade, 32 students; \neighth grade, 31 students.\n  Long Beach and El Cajon School Districts, tenth grade English, 35 \nstudents.\n  Santa Rosa School District--fourth grade, 32 students.\n  San Diego City Schools, tenth grade biology, 38 students.\n  Hoover Elementary and Knox Elementary in E. San Diego Elementary, \ngrades 5 and 6, 31 to 33 students.\n  Hoover High School 10th grade Algebra, 39 students.\n  To add to the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate \nbetween 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 \npercent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states \nduring the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased \nby 35.3 percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven \nnew classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the \nsurge in student enrollment. The California Department of Education \nsays that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, \njust to keep pace with the projected growth.\n  The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the \nnational cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is \n$27 million. In California, our costs are higher than other states in \npart because our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, \nfloods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. California's \nstate earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction \ncosts. Here's what it costs to build a schools in California: an \nelementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school (7-8), $12.0 \nmillion; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.\n  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class \nsizes are reduced.\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\n  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high \nschool size is between 600 and 900 students. Study after study shows \nthat small schools have more learning, fewer discipline problems, lower \ndropout rates, higher levels of student participating, higher \ngraduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's \nschool administrators are calling for more personalized schools.\n\n  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called \nProject STAR, in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of \ndifferent sizes. The students stayed in small classes for four years \nand then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. The test scores \nand behavior of students in the small classes were better than those of \nchildren in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that \nsmaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.\n  Take the example of Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock \nPark Elementary School. She used to have 32 students in her second \ngrade class. In the fall of 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend \nmore time on individualized reading instruction with each student. She \ncan now more readily draw out shy children and more easily identify \nslow readers early in the school year.\n  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in \nthe San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with \nstudents, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions \ndropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most \nwonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''\n  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller \nclasses mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; \nmore contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse \ninstructional methods; and a higher morale.\n  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, \nask more questions and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools \nand smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.\n  My state needs a total of $34 billion to build schools from 1998 to \n2008. Of this, $26 billion is needed to modernize and repair existing \nschools and $8 billion is needed to build schools to meet enrollment \ngrowth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds \nproviding $6.5 billion for school construction.\n  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per \nclass between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student \npopulation. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. \nCalifornia needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years \njust to keep pace with the projected growth.\n  Other bills in the Congress that I am supporting provide tax \nincentives for holders of school bonds to modernize old schools and we \nhave many old schools. One third of the nation's 110,000 schools were \nbuilt before World War II and only about one of 10 schools was built \nsince 1980. More than one-third of the nation's existing schools are \ncurrently over 50 or more years old and need to be repaired or \nreplaced. The General Accounting Office has said that nationally we \nneed over $112 billion for construction and repairs to bring schools up \nto date.\n  Big schools and big classes place a heavy burden on teachers and \nstudents. They can be a stressful learning environment.\n  The American public supports increased federal funding for school \nconstruction. The Rebuild American Coalition last month announced that \n82 percent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, \nup from 74 percent in a 1998 National Education Association poll.\n  Every parent knows the importance of a small class where the teacher \ncan give individualized attention to a student. Every parent knows the \nimportance of the sense of a school community that can come with a \nsmall school.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in passing this important \neducation reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assist local educational agencies to help all \nstudents achieve State achievement standards, to end the practice of \nsocial promotion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nend the practice of social promotion in our public schools and to \nprovide remedial education to help students meet academic achievement \nstandards. The Student Achievement Act of 1999 authorizes $500 million \nfor five years for local school districts to provide extended learning \ntime so that K-12 students can achieve.\n  Social promotion is the formal or informal practice of promoting a \nstudent from grade to grade even when the student fails to achieve a \nlevel of achievement and proficiency in the core curriculum.\n  To receive funds, schools would have to:\n  Adopt a policy prohibiting social promotion;\n  Require that students be subject to academic achievement standards in \nthe core curriculum, defined as subjects such as reading, writing, \nlanguage arts, mathematics, social sciences and science;\n  Test student achievement in meeting standards at certain benchmarks, \nto be determined by the states;\n  Provide remedial education; and\n  Have substantial numbers of low-performing students.\n  I am introducing this bill because I believe that the linchpin to \neducational reform is the elimination of the path of least resistance \nwhereby students who are failing are simply promoted to the next grade \nin hopes that they will learn. The product of this practice of simply \npromoting youngsters when they are failing to adequately learn has \nproduced a generation of young people who are below standard and high \nschool graduates that cannot read or write, count change in their \npockets or fill out an employment application. It is that bad.\n  And my state is just about the worst. There's a steady stream of bad \nnews. On March 5, we learned, yet again that California ranks second to \nlast among 39 states in fourth-grade reading skills. Eighty percent of \nmy state's fourth graders are not proficient readers. For eighth \ngraders, California is 33rd out of 36 states and only 22 percent of \nCalifornia's eighth graders are proficient readers.\n  On March 24, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the state \nreceived a grade of D+ from the American Electronics Association for \nthe quality and availability of an educated workforce. This conclusion \nis in the state that is the home of Silicon Valley, the premier high-\ntech area of the country, in a state that received an A for electronic \ncommerce and is number one in high tech employment. But California does \nnot have a school system that trains students well enough to work in \nthe high-paying, skilled jobs available.\n  These numbers are a stunning indictment of a failing system.\n  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our \nstudents, their parents and the public. As long as social promotion \nexists and is widespread, youth who cannot read or write and who won't \nbe able to find jobs in the future will continue to graduate from high \nschool.\n  I agree with the conclusion of the September 1997 study conducted by \nthe American Federation of Teachers:\n\n       ``Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides \n     school failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, \n     who are deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to \n     be successful or get the message that achievement doesn't \n     count; for teachers who must face students who know that \n     teachers wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for \n     the business community and colleges that must spend millions \n     of dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal \n     with a growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared \n     to contribute productively to the economic and civic life of \n     the nation.''\n\n  There is no hard data on the extent of social promotion in our public \nschools, but most authorities, in the schools and out, know that it is \nhappening--and in fact, in some districts it is standard operating \nprocedure.\n  The September AFT study surveyed 85 of the nation's 820 largest \nschool districts in 32 states, representing one-third of the nation's \npublic school enrollment, about their promotion policies.\n  Saying that social promotion is ``rampant,'' AFT leaders found that \nschool districts' criteria for passing and retaining students is vague. \nOnly 17 states have standards in the four core disciplines (English, \nmath, social studies and science) that are well grounded in content and \nthat are clear enough to be used.\n  A January 14, 1998 Los Angeles Times article reported that four in 10 \nteachers said that their schools automatically promote students when \nthey reach the maximum age for their grade level.\n  None of the districts surveyed by AFT have an explicit policy of \nsocial promotion, but almost every district has an implicit practice of \nsocial promotion. Almost all districts view holding students back as a \npolicy of last resort and many put explicit limits on retaining \nstudents. Districts have loose and vague criteria for moving a student \nfrom one grade to the next. This approach, concludes AFT, is implicit \napproval of social promotion.\n  Last fall, thankfully, former California Governor Pete Wilson signed \ninto law a bill to end social promotion. In July 1998, I wrote some of \nCalifornia's school districts and asked about their policy on social \npromotion. Here are some of the reports I got back:\n  Some school districts did not have specific policies in place \nregarding social promotion. Exceptions to normal progression from one \ngrade to another may be made when it is ``in the best interest of the \nstudent.'' Teachers may provide recommendations but final decisions on \nretention are made by the parent of the student.\n  In other cases, school districts required students to earn 220 \ncredits to receive a high school diploma so that the district feels \nthat ``social promotion is not an issue.''\n  One school district believes that ``it is seldom desirable for a \nstudent to be retained by reason of achievement, maturity or attendance \nbecause research has shown that retention is likely to\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nhave strong negative effects.'' Retention is therefore discouraged in \nthe primary grades and prohibited thereafter.\n  Here's another example: Dr. Rudy Crew, Chancellor of the New York \nCity Schools, said in the January 25 New York Times that virtually \nevery student is promoted from one grade to the next, regardless of \nperformance on standardized tests.\n  Mike Wright, a San Diegian, is an example. Cited in the February 16 \nSan Diego Union-Tribune, Mr. Wright says he routinely got promoted from \ngrade to grade and even graduated from high school, even though he \nfailed some subjects. At age 29, he is now enrolled in a community \ncollege program to learn to read--at age 29!\n  Here are some examples of the harm of social promotion:\n  In California, a December 1997 report from a state education \naccountability task force estimated that at least half of the state's \nstudents--3 million children--perform below levels considered \nproficient for their grade level.\n  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college \nprofessors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a \nstudent has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63% of employers and \n76 percent of professors said that the diploma is not a guarantee that \na graduate can read, write or do basic math.\n  Nationwide, about one third of college freshmen take remedial courses \nin college and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, \noffer remediation, says the AFT study.\n  A March 27 California State University study found that more than \ntwo-thirds of students entering Cal State campuses in Los Angeles lack \nthe math or English they should have mastered in high school. At some \nhigh schools, not one graduate going on to one of Cal State's campuses \npassed a basic skills test. At Cal State Dominguez Hills, for example, \n8 out of 10 freshmen enrollees last fall needed remedial English and 87 \npercent needed remedial math.\n  Sadly, these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1997, 47 \npercent of freshmen enrolled at CSU needed remediation, compared to 43 \npercent in each of the previous three years. In math, 54 percent needed \nremedial help, compared to 48 percent in 1994.\n\n  Similarly, almost 35 percent of entering freshmen at the University \nof California do poorly on UC's English proficiency test and must \nreceive help in their first year.\n  Florida spent $53 million in college on remedial education, says the \nAFT study.\n  In Boston, school principals estimate that half their ninth graders \nare not prepared for high school work.\n  In Ohio, nearly one fourth of all freshmen who attend state public \nuniversities must take remedial math or English (Cleveland Plain \nDealer, July 7, 1997)\n  Employers tell me that their new hires are unprepared for work and \nthey have to provide very basic training to make them employable. For \nexample, last year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills \ntraining.\n  Fortunately, many policymakers are beginning to realize that we must \nstop social promotion. President Clinton called for ending it in his \nlast two State of the Union speeches. Last year, he said, ``We must \nalso demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade \nto grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any \nfavors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.''\n  Last year, California's former Governor Pete Wilson, signed into law \na bill to end social promotion in our public education system. The bill \nrequires school districts to identify students who are failing based on \ntheir grades or scores on the new statewide performance tests. The \nschools would have to hold back the student unless their teachers \nsubmitted a written finding that the student should be allowed to \nadvance to the next grade. In such a case, the teacher would be \nrequired to recommend remediation to get the student to the next level, \nwhich could include summer school or after-school instruction.\n  Los Angeles Unified School District is currently working to develop a \nplan to end the practice of social promotion. Los Angeles Unified \nSchool Board plans to identify those students who are at risk of \nflunking and require them to participate in remedial classes. The \nalternative curriculum will stress the basics in reading, language arts \nand math, and special after-school tutoring. The district's plan would \ntake effect in the 1999-2000 school year and target students moving in \nthe third through sixth grades and into the ninth grade.\n  In San Diego, the School Board adopted requirements that all students \nin certain grades must demonstrate grade-level performance. And they \nwill require all students to earn a C overall grade average and a C \ngrade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending \nsocial promotion for certain grades and for high school graduation. For \nexample, San Diego's schools are requiring that eighth graders who do \nnot pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer \nschool.\n  At least three other states--Florida, Arkansas and Texas--explicitly \noutlaw social promotion.\n  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their \nnew policy was put in place in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 students \nfailed tests in the third, sixth, eight and ninth grades and then went \nto mandatory summer school. Chicago School Superintendent calls social \npromotion ``educational malpractice.'' He says from now on his schools' \nonly product will be student achievement.\n  Cincinnati's students are now promoted based on specific standards \nthat define what students must know.\n  The AFT study says: ``In most districts, there are no agreed-upon \nexplicit standards of performance to which students are held \naccountable.''\n  Our schools need clear, specific achievement levels for the core \nacademic disciplines for every student. Many states are developing \nthose achievement levels or standards. California's Commission for the \nEstablishment of Academic Content and Performance Standards is \ndeveloping statewide, grade-by-grade academic standards.\n  Without them, we will never know (1) what our students need to learn \nand (2) whether they have learned what they should learn. How, I ask, \ncan you measure what you have accomplished if you don't know where you \nare going?\n  Sixty-one percent of Californians agreed in 1998 that our schools \nneed a ``major overhaul,'' up from 54 percent who answered the same \nquestion two years earlier. A mere six percent believe that schools \nprovide a ``quality education.''\n  A poll by Policy Analysis for California Education found that only 17 \npercent of the public considers the state's schools ``good'' or \n``excellent,'' down from about 33 percent three years ago.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in stopping social promotion \nand providing remedial education because we must stop shortchanging our \nstudents.\n  School achievement must mean something. It must mean more than \nfilling up a seat at a desk for 12 years. A diploma should not just be \na symbol of accumulating time in school.\n  Social promotion is a cruel joke. We are fooling students. We are \nfooling ourselves. Students think a high school diploma means \nsomething. But in reality, a diploma does not mean much when we are \ngraduating students who cannot count change, who cannot read a \nnewspaper, or who cannot fill out an employment application. I hope \nthis bill can help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of \nAmericans, to establish standards and procedures regarding law \nenforcement access to location information, decryption assistance for \nencrypted communications and stored electronic information, and other \nprivate information, to affirm the rights of Americans to use and sell \nencryption products as a tool for protecting their online privacy, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               ELECTRONIC RIGHTS OF THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, concern over privacy is reaching an all \ntime high. In 1978, 64 percent of Americans reported that they were \n``very concerned'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their \npersonal privacy. By 1998, this number had skyrocketed. According to \nthe Center for Social and Legal Research, 88 percent of Americans \nreported being ``very'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to \ntheir personal privacy. We in Congress must take this concern \nseriously, and in this regard I look forward to examining the privacy \nissues confronting us in hearings before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Good privacy policies make good business policies. New technologies \nbring with them new opportunities, both for the businesses that develop \nand market them, and for consumers. It does not do anyone any good for \nconsumers to hesitate to use any particular technology because they \nhave concerns over privacy. That is why I believe that good privacy \npolicies make good business policies.\n  Protecting privacy plays an important role in the exercise of First \nAmendment rights. Ensuring that we have adequate privacy laws has a \nmore significant and important role in our democracy than just \nfostering hi-tech businesses, however. We also must defend our on-line \nfree speech rights from heavy-handed content regulation. That was my \npurpose in voting against the unconstitutional Communications Decency \nAct that became law in 1996.\n  Stopping efforts to create government censors is critical to allow \nour First Amendment rights to flourish, but it is not enough. For \npeople to feel comfortable in exercising their First Amendment rights--\nby speaking, traveling and associating freely online or in physical \nspace--they must be able to keep their activities confidential and \nprivate. When Big Brother is watching, the exercise of First Amendment \nrights is chilled no less than the threat of a government censor.\n  It is therefore not surprising that our country has a long and \nhonorable tradition of keeping our identities private when we exercise \nour First Amendment rights. The Federalist Papers, which is probably \nthe most important political document ever written about our \nConstitution, was authored anonymously by James Madison, John Jay and \nAlexander Hamilton and published under a pseudonym.\n  Healthy advocacy and debate often rests on the ability of \nparticipants to keep their identities private and to act anonymously. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has said, ``Anonymity is a shield from the \ntyranny of the majority.''\n  Healthy commerce also depends on satisfying consumers' desire to keep \ntheir business affairs private and secure. A report I released last \nmonth on Vermont Internet commerce is very telling on this point. The \nstrongest obstacle among consumers from shopping and doing business \nonline was their fear of the online security risks. This is why \npromoting the use of encryption is so important, so that businesses and \nconsumers can use this technology to provide the privacy and security \nthey want and best suits their needs.\n  The legislation I introduce today would help ensure that Americans' \nFourth Amendment rights to be secure\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\nin their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable \ngovernment searches and seizures are given ample protection in a \nnetworked computer environment. In addition, several provisions address \nthe concern Americans have about the use and handling of their \npersonally identifiable records and information by businesses, \nsatellite carriers, libraries and book sellers.\n  Industry self-regulation efforts should be encouraged. In contrast to \na citizen's relationship with his or her government, consumers have a \nchoice of whether they want to deal or interact with those in the \nprivate sector. In my view, this choice should be generally recognized \nin the law by allowing consumers and businesses in the marketplace to \nset the terms of their interaction. This is an area where the Congress \nshould tread cautiously before regulating. Online businesses are \nengaging in serious efforts to make available to consumers information \non privacy policies so that consumers are able to make more educated \nchoices on whether they want to deal. I commend and applaud those \nefforts.\n  That being said, however, current laws do not apply privacy \nprinciples in an even-handed manner. Video rental stores and cable \noperators are subject to privacy laws to protect our right to keep our \nviewing habits private, but no protections exist for the books we \nborrow from the library or buy from a bookstore, or the shows we watch \nvia satellite. This bill would provide more uniform privacy protection \nfor both books and videos, no matter the medium of delivery.\n  Similarly, telephone companies and cable operators are subject to \nlegal restrictions on how they may use personally \nidentifiable information about their Internet subscribers, while other \nInternet and online service providers are not. The E-RIGHTS bill \npromotes a more level playing field in terms of the privacy protections \navailable to Internet users, no matter whether they obtain their \nInternet access from AOL, their cable company or their local phone \ncompany.\n\n  This legislation addresses a broad range of emerging hi-tech privacy \nissues. For example:\n  When should the FBI be allowed to use cell phones to track a user's \nmovements?\n  Should Kosovo human rights organizations that use a Web site to \ncorrect government misinformation be able to get a domain name without \nhaving their names publicly available on a database? Should we have the \nsame ability to get an ``unlisted'' domain name (or Internet address) \nas we are able to get an ``unlisted'' phone number?\n  Should we allow other federal prosecutors to act like Special \nProsecutor Kenneth Starr and go on fishing expeditions with subpoenas \nissued to bookstores to find out what we are reading? Should we protect \nour choices of reading and viewing materials the same way we protect \nour choice of videotapes that we rent from our local Blockbuster?\n  Should an Internet user who maintains a calendar on Yahoo! get the \nsame privacy protection as people who keep their calendars on their \ndesk or on their PCs' hard-drive? Will people avoid certain network \nservices offered by Netscape or new Internet start-ups because they get \nless privacy protection for the information stored on the network than \non their own PCs?\n  These are all important issues, and I have worked to propose \nsolutions to each of these and to other questions, as well, in the E-\nRIGHTS bill. This bill has the following four titles:\n  Title I: Privacy Protection for Communications and Electronic \nInformation. This title has ten sections that propose certain Fourth \nAmendment protections to guide the government's access to, or exercise \nof, law enforcement's enhanced surveillance capabilities due to new \ntechnologies. In addition, this title also contains sections that limit \nhow domain name registrars and Internet/Online service providers may \nuse information collected on Internet users.\n  Network Stored Information.--The bill would require that law \nenforcement give a subscriber notice of a subpoena or warrant before \nseizing electronic information stored on a network service. This is the \nsame notice that the subscriber would get if the information were \nstored on his or her own computer.\n  Cell Phone Location Information.--Before law enforcement may use a \nperson's cell phone as a tracking device, the bill would require a \ncourt order based on probable cause that the person is committing a \ncrime.\n  A related provision that has already passed the House in February as \npart of the ``Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999,'' \nH.R. 438, would require wireless phone providers to inform a cell phone \nuser's family and emergency services of their location in emergency \nsituations, while requiring the prior customer consent before that \nlocation information may be used for any other purpose.\n  Pen Registers.--The bill would authorize a judge to review \ninformation presented by a federal prosecutor to determine whether the \npen register is likely to produce information relevant to an ongoing \ncriminal investigation, since under current law the judge plays only a \nministerial role and must approve any order upon presentation by a \nprosecutor. Current law compels judges to be only a rubber stamp.\n  Conference Calls.--The FBI has claimed that the Communications \nAssistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that they be given \nthe capability to monitor conference calls which continue even after \nthe target of a wiretap order has dropped out of the call. This \nprovision would require that a court authorize such continued \nmonitoring of conference calls in the absence of the target.\n  Roving Wiretaps.--A substantial change that provides easier access to \nroving wiretaps was inserted without debate or hearings into last \nyear's Intelligence Authorization Act. With this change, the FBI is \nable to get a roving wiretap whenever a person's action could have the \neffect of thwarting interception. The bill would rectify this change to \npermit roving wiretaps only when the person actually changes phones in \na way which has the effect of thwarting surveillance.\n  Domain Name Registrars.--Internet users or businesses who get an \nInternet address with a second level domain name must also provide \ninformation about contact names, physical and E-mail addresses, network \nlocation, and other information that is posted in a publicly available \ndatabase called WHOIS. The bill would give users registering for a \ndomain name/Internet address authority to prohibit disclosure of the \ninformation, and keep the information confidential. Of course, the \nregistrar would be able to override the user's choice of \nconfidentiality and to disclose the information as necessary to provide \nservice or in response to a subpoena or court order.\n\n  Internet users who want an ``unlisted'' Internet address just as they \nhave the choice of getting an ``unlisted'' telephone number will be \nable to do so.\n  Internet and Online Service Providers.--The 1986 Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (ECPA) set up procedures for law enforcement \nto obtain records about subscribers from ``electronic communication \nservice providers'', but contained a blanket exemption allowing such \nproviders to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a \nsubscriber or customer to any non-governmental entity. Due to this \nexemption, ISPs and OSPs may sell their subscriber lists or track the \nonline movements of their subscribers and sell that information--all \nwithout the subscribers' knowledge or consent.\n  The bill would cut back on this blanket exemption. The bill would \nrequire electronic communication service providers to give their \nsubscribers an opportunity to prohibit disclosure of their personal \ninformation, and enumerates the situations in which the information may \nbe used or disclosed without the subscriber's approval. These proposed \nrules are generally analogous to restrictions already in place for \nother providers of Internet services, including cable operators and \nphone companies, which are restricted in how they may use personally \nidentifiable information about customers without the customers' \napproval.\n  No criminal penalties attach for violation. ECPA currently authorizes \nan aggrieved person to bring a civil action.\n  Title II: Promoting the Use of Encryption. This title contains three \nsections: (1) prohibiting domestic controls on encryption and \ngovernment-\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\ncompelled key escrow encryption; (2) requiring encryption products used \nby federal agencies to interoperate with commercial encryption \nproducts; and (3) adding a chapter to the federal criminal code \ndetailing procedures to law enforcement and foreign government access \nto decryption assistance.\n  Specifically, the bill would require the release of decryption keys \nor assistance to law enforcement in response to a court order based \nupon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary to decrypt \nlawfully intercepted encrypted messages or data.\n  Title III: Privacy Protection for Library Loan and Book Sales \nRecords. This title would extend the privacy protection in current law \nfor video rental and sale records to library loan and book sale \nrecords.\n  Library.--The library provisions are a reprise of sections that were \ndropped from the Video Privacy Protection Act enacted in 1988. This \nprovision would prohibit libraries from disclosing personally \nidentifiable information about patrons without the written consent of \nthe patron or in response to a court order to release the information \nto a law enforcement agency, with prior notice to the patron, if there \nis probable cause to believe a crime is being committed and the \ninformation sought is material to the investigation.\n  Booksellers.--The public outcry over Independent Counsel Kenneth \nStarr's subpoena in March 1988 to Kramerbooks & Afterwords for any \nbooks purchased by Monica Lewinsky, and the potential threat such \ngovernment fishing expeditions pose to First Amendment rights, prompted \nexamination of the privacy rules protecting the records maintained by \nbookstores. There are no rules barring book sellers from disclosing \nrecords about their customers.\n  This section would impose the same nondisclosure rules on \nbooksellers--whether online or in physical spaces--that apply to video \nrental stores. Generally, book sellers would be barred from disclosing \npersonally identifiable information concerning a book purchaser without \nthat purchasers' written consent given at the time the disclosure is \nsought.\n  Title IV: Privacy Protection for Satellite Home Viewers. In the 1984 \nCable Act, Congress established a nationwide standard for the privacy \nprotection of cable subscribers. Since the Cable Act was adopted, an \nentirely new form of access to television has emerged--home satellite \nviewing--which is especially popular in rural areas not served by \ncable. Yet there is no statutory privacy protection for information \ncollected by home satellite viewing services about their customers or \nsubscribers. This title fills this gap by amending the privacy \nprovisions of the Cable Act to cover home satellite viewing.\n  The amendments do not change the rules governing access to cable \nsubscriber information. Instead, they merely add the words ``satellite \nhome viewing service'' and ``satellite carrier or distributor'' where \nappropriate.\n  The amendment does not address another inconsistency in the law, \nwhich bears mentioning: should a cable company that provides Internet \nservices to its customers be subject to the privacy safeguards in the \nCable Act or in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which \nnormally applies to Internet service providers and contains obligations \nregarding the disclosure of personally identifiable information to both \ngovernmental and nongovernmental entities different from those in the \nCable Act? One court has described this as a ``statutory riddle raised \nby the entrance of cable operators into the Internet services market.''\n  New technologies and new uses for old technologies pose challenging \n``riddles'' for privacy, but they are solvable in ways that balance \ncompeting commerce, civil rights, and law enforcement interests. The E-\nRIGHTS bill proposes balanced solutions that protect our privacy \nrights. I invite others to share their ideas on these matters. There \nare few matters more important than privacy in maintaining our core \ndemocratic values, so I look forward to hearing their comments on ways \nto improve this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the E-RIGHTS bill and the sectional \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the privacy and constitutional rights of \n     individuals and organizations in networked computer systems \n     and other digital environments, protect the confidentiality \n     of information and security of critical infrastructure \n     systems relied on by individuals, businesses and government \n     agencies, and properly balance the needs of law enforcement \n     to have the access to electronic communications and \n     information in appropriate circumstances;\n       (2) to encourage Americans to develop and deploy encryption \n     technology and to promote the use of encryption by Americans \n     to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy of \n     their lawful wire and electronic communications and stored \n     electronic information; and\n       (3) to establish privacy standards and procedures by which \n     investigative or law enforcement officers and foreign \n     governments may obtain decryption assistance for encrypted \n     communications and stored electronic information.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the digitization of information and the explosion in \n     the growth of computing and electronic networking offers \n     tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, \n     work, and are entertained, but also raises new threats to the \n     privacy of the American people and the competitiveness of \n     American businesses;\n       (2) a secure, private, and trusted national and global \n     information infrastructure is essential to promote economic \n     growth, protect privacy, and meet the needs of the American \n     people and businesses;\n       (3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of \n     their communications and in the conducting of personal and \n     business affairs should be promoted and protected;\n       (4) the authority and ability of investigative and law \n     enforcement officers to access and decipher, in a timely \n     manner and as provided by law, wire and electronic \n     communications, and stored electronic information necessary \n     to provide for public safety and national security should \n     also be preserved;\n       (5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal, \n     medical, financial, and other information to computers and \n     computer networks unless the security and privacy of that \n     information is assured;\n       (6) businesses will not entrust their proprietary and \n     sensitive corporate information, including information about \n     products, processes, customers, finances, and employees, to \n     computers and computer networks unless the security and \n     privacy of that information is assured;\n       (7) America's critical infrastructures, including its \n     telecommunications system, banking and financial \n     infrastructure, and power and transportation infrastructure, \n     increasingly rely on vulnerable information\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\n     systems, and will represent a growing risk to national \n     security and public safety unless the security and privacy of \n     those information systems is assured;\n       (8) encryption technology is an essential tool to promote \n     and protect the privacy, security, confidentiality, \n     integrity, and authenticity of wire and electronic \n     communications and stored electronic information;\n       (9) encryption techniques, technology, programs, and \n     products are widely available worldwide;\n       (10) Americans should be free to use lawfully whatever \n     particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or \n     products developed in the marketplace that best suits their \n     needs in order to interact electronically with the government \n     and others worldwide in a secure, private, and confidential \n     manner;\n       (11) government mandates for, or otherwise compelled use \n     of, third-party key recovery systems or other systems that \n     provide surreptitious access to encrypted data threatens the \n     security and privacy of information systems;\n       (12) a national encryption policy is needed to advance the \n     development of the national and global information \n     infrastructure, and preserve the right to privacy of \n     Americans and the public safety and national security of the \n     United States;\n       (13) Congress and the American people have recognized the \n     need to balance the right to privacy and the protection of \n     the public safety with national security;\n       (14) the Constitution of the United States permits lawful \n     electronic surveillance and the use of other investigative \n     tools by law enforcement officers and the seizure of stored \n     electronic information only upon compliance with stringent \n     standards and procedures designed to protect the right to \n     privacy and other rights protected under the fourth amendment \n     of the Constitution of the United States;\n       (15) there is a need to clarify the standards and \n     procedures by which investigative or law enforcement officers \n     obtain decryption assistance from persons--\n       (A) who are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt \n     wire and electronic communications and stored electronic \n     information; or\n       (B) have information that enables the decryption of such \n     communications and information;\n       (16) Americans are increasingly shopping online and \n     purchasing books from online vendors, and expect that their \n     choices of reading or viewing materials will be kept \n     confidential;\n       (17) protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the \n     books, other written materials, and movies that a person \n     chooses to read or view should be protected to ensure the \n     free exercise of first amendment rights regardless of medium;\n       (18) generally, under current law, telecommunications \n     carriers may not disclose individually identifiable customer \n     proprietary network information without their customers' \n     approval, while providers of electronic communications \n     services and remote computing services may make such \n     disclosure to anyone other than a governmental entity and \n     have no legal obligation to notify their subscribers when \n     they do so;\n       (19) subscribers of Internet services through facilities of \n     cable operators must be given notice and an opportunity to \n     prohibit disclosure before the cable operator may disclose \n     any personally identifiable information, including name or \n     address, about a subscriber to any other person, while \n     providers of electronic communications services and remote \n     computing services have no similar legal obligation to \n     protect the privacy of their subscribers; and\n       (20) given the convergence among wireless, wire line, \n     cable, broadcast, and satellite services, privacy safeguards \n     should be applied more uniformly across different media in \n     order to provide a level competitive playing field and \n     consistent privacy protections.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Short Title.--The Act may be cited as the \n     ``Electronic Rights (E-RIGHTS) for the 21st Century Act.''\n       Sec. 2. Purposes.--The Act has three general purposes: (1) \n     promoting the privacy and constitutional rights of \n     individuals and organizations in networked computer systems, \n     and the security of critical information infrastructures, \n     while properly balancing law enforcement access needs; (2) \n     encouraging Americans to develop and deploy encryption \n     technology and to promote the use of encryption by Americans \n     to protect the security, confidentiality and privacy of their \n     lawful wire and electronic communications and stored \n     electronic information; and (3) establishing privacy \n     standards and procedures for law enforcement officers to \n     obtain decryption assistance for encrypted communications and \n     information.\n       Sec. 3. Findings.--The Act enumerates twenty congressional \n     findings that law enforcement investigative and electronic \n     surveillance needs must be balanced with the right to privacy \n     and other rights protected under the Fourth Amendment of the \n     Constitution; encryption technology, which is widely \n     available worldwide, is useful in protecting the privacy, \n     security, and confidentiality of the national and global \n     information infrastructure; Americans should be free to use, \n     and American businesses free to compete and sell, encryption \n     technology, programs and products; and given the convergence \n     among digital media, privacy safeguards should be applied \n     more uniformly to provide a level competitive playing field.\n       Sec. 4. Definitions.--The terms ``agency'', ``person'' and \n     ``state'' have the same meaning given those terms in \n     specified sections of title 18, United States Code, except \n     that the term ``agency'' also includes the United States \n     Postal Service.\n       Additional definitions are provided for the following \n     terms:\n       The terms ``encrypt'' and ``encryption'' mean the use of \n     mathematical formulas or algorithms to scramble or unscramble \n     electronic data or communications for purposes of \n     confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. As defined, the \n     terms cover a broad range of scrambling techniques and \n     applications including cryptographic applications such as PGP \n     or RSA's encryption algorithms; steganography; \n     authentication; and winnowing and chafing.\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n       The term ``encryption product'' includes any hardware, \n     software, devices, or other technology with encryption \n     capabilities, whether or not offered for sale or \n     distribution.\n       The term ``key'' means the variable information used in or \n     produced by a mathematical formula to encrypt or decrypt wire \n     or electronic communications or electronically stored \n     information.\n       The term ``United States person'' means any citizen of the \n     United States or legal entity organized under U.S. law that \n     has its principal place of business in this country.\n\n\n     TITLE I--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC \n                              INFORMATION\n\n       Sec. 101. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Information on \n     Computer Networks.--The Act modifies subsection (b) of \n     section 2703 of title 18, United States Code, to extend \n     privacy protections to electronic information stored on \n     computer networks.\n       When held in a person's home, records may only be seized \n     pursuant to a warrant based upon probable cause, or compelled \n     under a subpoena, which may be challenged and quashed. In \n     both instances, the record owner has notice of the search and \n     an opportunity to challenge it. By contrast, under United \n     States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) (customer has no \n     standing to object to bank disclosure of customer records), \n     and its progeny, records in the possession of third parties \n     do not receive Fourth Amendment protection. A governmental \n     agent with a subpoena based upon mere relevance may compel a \n     third party to produce records originating with or belonging \n     to another person, without notice to the person to whom the \n     records pertain. The record subject may never receive notice \n     or any meaningful opportunity to challenge the production.\n       This lack of protection for records held by third parties \n     presents new privacy problems in the information age. With \n     the rise of network computing, electronic information that \n     was previously held on a person's own computer is \n     increasingly stored elsewhere, such as on a network server. \n     In many cases the location of such information is not even \n     known to the record's owner.\n       Furthermore, Web-based information services are attracting \n     customers by offering free storage and services accessible \n     from any computer. Companies like When.com, Briefcase.com, \n     Yahoo and Netscape offer calendars, address books, ``to do'' \n     lists, stock portfolios and storage space, while more \n     targeted companies, like dietwatch.com let users keep track \n     of their diets. Potential customers of such services should \n     not be discouraged from subscribing due to the weaker privacy \n     and confidentiality protections afforded their remotely \n     stored records than if those records were stored on the \n     customer's own laptop or PC.\n       Under current law, these services are covered by the remote \n     computing service provision in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(b), which \n     authorizes a governmental entity to require disclosure of \n     those communications without notice to the subscriber. A \n     remote computing service provides storage or computer \n     processing services to customers and is not authorized to \n     access the contents of the electronic communications \n     created by the customer.\n       The Act amends section 2703(b) to extend the same privacy \n     protections to a person's records whether storage takes place \n     on that person's personal computer in their possession or in \n     networked electronic storage. The amendment to section \n     2703(b) would authorize a governmental entity to require \n     disclosure of electronic communications or records stored by \n     a remote computing service pursuant to (i) a state or federal \n     warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to be served \n     on the customer or record owner at the same time the warrant \n     is served on the remote computing service holding the record; \n     or (ii) a subpoena that must also be served on the customer \n     or record owner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge \n     the subpoena.\n       The penalties for violating this section would not change \n     and do not currently carry criminal fines or any term of \n     imprisonment. (See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2701(c) (criminal offense \n     provision does not apply to ``conduct authorized . . . in \n     section 2703''). Instead, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2707, a \n     government agent that violates this section is subject to \n     disciplinary action, and a service provider that violates \n     this section is subject to civil action for appropriate \n     relief.\n       Sec. 102. Government Access to Location Information.--The \n     Act adds a new subsection (g) to section 2703 of title 18, \n     United States Code, to extend privacy protections for \n     physical location information generated on a real time basis \n     by mobile electronic communications services, such as \n     cellular telephones. This section requires that physical \n     location information generated by a wireless service provider \n     may only be released to a governmental entity pursuant to a \n     court order based upon probable cause.\n       Location information on wireless telephones is \n     fundamentally different from the type of location information \n     that can be associated with a wireline telephone. Wireless \n     telephones are normally directly associated with the physical \n     presence of the individual user, and are carried by those \n     users into places where there is a reasonable expectation of \n     privacy. Tracking of cellular telephones, even more-so than \n     automobiles, implicates the movements of a person going about \n     his or her business and personal life.\n       Should the government seek to track a person by \n     surreptitiously placing a mobile tracking device on that \n     person's automobile, a court order would be required based \n     upon a finding of probable cause. (See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3117; \n     Fed. R. Cr. P. 41; U.S. v. In re Application, 155 F.R.D. 401, \n     402 (D. MA 1994)). No less should be required for use by the \n     government of a wireless telephone as a tracking device.\n       Civil liberties experts have noted that cellular telephone \n     technology ``is proceeding in the direction of providing more \n     precise location information, a trend that has been boosted \n     by the rulings of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     in its ``E911'' (Enhanced 911) proceeding, which requires \n     service providers to develop a locator capability for medical \n     emergency and rescue purposes.'' (Testimony of Deirdre \n     Mulligan, Center for Democracy and Technology, before the \n     House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Courts and \n     Intellectual Property, March 26, 1998). Specifically, the FCC \n     is requiring wireless service providers to modify their \n     systems to enable them to relay to public safety authorities \n     the cell site location of 911 callers. Carriers must also \n     take steps to deploy the capability to provide latitude and \n     longitude information of wireless telephone callers within \n     125 meters and, ultimately, to locate a caller within a 40-\n     foot radius for longitude, latitude and altitude, to enable \n     locating a caller within a tall building. (See In re Revision \n     of the Commission's Rules to Ensure Compatibility with \n     Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Sys., CC Docket No. 94-102, \n     Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (last modified Jan. 2, 1997)).\n       In a separate proceeding, the FCC in October 1998 proposed \n     ruling that a location tracking capability for wireless \n     telephones was required under the Communications Assistance \n     for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). The FCC has tentatively \n     concluded that carriers must have the capability of providing \n     to law enforcement a caller's cell site location at the \n     beginning and termination of a call. (See In re CALEA, CC \n     Docket No. 97-213, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (adopted October 22, 1998), 63 Fed. Reg. 63639, November 16, \n     1998). Whether this capability is ultimately required by the \n     FCC as part of CALEA, there is no doubt that real-time \n     location information will be increasingly available to law \n     enforcement agencies. Accordingly, the appropriate standard \n     for law enforcement access to such location information \n     should be clarified.\n       Sec. 103. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Transactional \n     Information Obtained From Pen Registers or Trap and Trace \n     Devices.--The Act enhances privacy protections for \n     information obtained from pen register and trap and trace \n     devices by amending section 3123(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code. Under current law, the court is relegated to a \n     mere ministerial function and must issue a pen register or \n     trap and trace order whenever presented with a signed \n     certification of a prosecutor.\n       This amendment authorize the court to review the \n     information presented in the certification to determine \n     whether the information likely to be obtained is relevant to \n     an ongoing criminal investigation. The amendment would not \n     change the standard for issuance of an ex parte order \n     authorizing use of a pen register or trap and trace \n     device.\n       In addition, the amendment would require law enforcement to \n     minimize the information obtained from the pen register or \n     trap and trace device that is not related to the dialing and \n     signaling information utilized in call processing.\n       Currently, pen registers capture not just such dialing \n     information but also any other dialed digits after a call has \n     been connected. The Department of Justice has taken the \n     position in connection with legislation pending in the 105th \n     Congress regarding law enforcement access to clone numeric \n     pagers that digits dialed and transmitted after a call has \n     been placed may consist of electronic impulses but ``are the \n     `contents' of the call,'' subject to more stringent privacy \n     protections under the Fourth Amendment. This provision would \n     provide protection for those ``contents.''\n       Sec. 104. Privacy Protection for Conference Calls.--This \n     section clarifies the circumstances under which the \n     government may continue monitoring a three-way call or \n     conference call after a facility specified in the wiretap \n     order is no longer connected to the call. The Fourth \n     Amendment requires the government when conducting a search \n     and seizure to have a warrant ``particularly describing the \n     place to be searched, and the person or things to be \n     seized.'' Under the terminology of the wiretap laws, the \n     place to be searched is called a ``facility,'' which has \n     generally been interpreted to mean a subscriber telephone \n     line.\n       Modern three-way and conference calling technology allows \n     an individual to initiate a three-way or conference call with \n     two or more other parties and then to ``drop off'' the call \n     while the other parties continue communicating. At that \n     point, the telephone line specified in the order is no longer \n     connected to the call. This section makes it clear that the \n     government may continue monitoring the communications of \n     parties remaining on a conference call when the facility \n     identified in the wiretap order is no longer participating \n     only if the government has shown and the authorizing judge \n     has found that an individual who remains a party to the \n     communication is committing, has committed or is about to \n     commit a particular offense enumerated in the wiretap order \n     and that communications concerning that offense will be \n     obtained through the\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\n     continuing interception. Since these are the basic standards \n     of the wiretap law, which the government must satisfy for any \n     interception, the effect of the change is to make it clear \n     that the interception of the remaining parties to a three-way \n     or conference call must satisfy the basic requirements of the \n     wiretap law.\n       Sec. 105. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Packet Networks, \n     Including the Internet.--This section amends subsection \n     3121(c) of title 18 to require law enforcement agencies \n     conducting pen register or trap and trace investigations on \n     packet communications to use reasonably available technology \n     to ensure that they do not intercept the content of \n     communications without a Title III order. The electronic \n     surveillance laws draw a distinction between the interception \n     of content, which requires a court order based on the high \n     probable cause standard, and the interception of call routing \n     information, which is obtained under the lower pen register \n     or trap and trace authority in sections 3121-3127. The \n     Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     requires carriers, to the extent reasonably achievable, to \n     design their systems to ensure that law enforcement agencies \n     conducting pen register and trap and trace investigations do \n     not intercept the content of communications. Subsection \n     3121(c), originally added by CALEA, imposed a mirror \n     obligation on law enforcement to use pen register or trap and \n     trace equipment that does not record or decode content.\n       Sec. 105 amends 3121(c) to make it clear that obligation \n     applies to packet switched communications, which are based on \n     technology that breaks a digital message into many small \n     packets, each consisting of addressing or routing information \n     plus a segment of content. This change makes it clear that \n     law enforcement agencies using pen registers or trap and \n     trace devices in packet switched environments must, if the \n     technology is reasonably available, record or decode only \n     addressing information, not content.\n       Sec. 106. Privacy Safeguards for Information Collected by \n     Internet Registrars.--The Act would amend section 2703 of \n     title 18, United States Code, to add a new subsection (g) \n     protecting the privacy of records pertaining to persons who \n     register for a second-level domain name, which serves as an \n     Internet address. Just as consumers may, by obtaining an \n     unlisted telephone number for privacy, safety or other \n     reasons, keep confidential personally identifiable \n     information associated with telephone numbers, such as name \n     and address, Internet users should be able to get an \n     ``unlisted'' Internet address. A domain name registration \n     service provider that violates this section would be subject \n     to civil action for appropriate relief, under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2707.\n       Internet domain names are the unique identifiers or \n     addresses that enables businesses, organizations, and \n     individuals to communicate and conduct commerce on the \n     Internet.\n       Until recently, pursuant to a cooperative agreement with \n     the Department of Commerce, Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), \n     was the exclusive registrar assigning domain names ending in \n     .com, .net, .org and .edu. As a registrar, NSI enters new \n     domain names into the master directory or registry.\n       The U.S. government is in the process of privatizing the \n     administration of the Internet domain name system (DNS) to \n     increase competition in the registration of domain names. \n     With the advent of competition in the DNS, NSI will continue \n     to operate the .com, .net, .org registries, but other \n     companies, including domain name registration resellers, \n     country code registries, ISPs, and major telecommunications \n     firms, may be able to offer competing registrar services or \n     registry/registrar services using other top level domains.\n       Normally, in order to process a request for a domain name, \n     registrars and registries must collect personal information \n     for billing and other purposes. The information currently \n     collected by NSI includes: name, organization, address, \n     country, contacts for administrative, technical and billing \n     matters, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address. This \n     information, along with the date on which the name was \n     registered and information on the computer network used by \n     the registrant to connect to the Internet, is compiled in a \n     registry and made publicly available on an Internet-\n     accessible ``WHOIS'' database.\n       This database provides an efficient way of identifying and \n     contacting persons operating Web sites for both legitimate or \n     illegitimate purposes, such as online trademark and copyright \n     infringement. The personally identifiable information placed \n     on the WHOIS database has been misused for ``spamming'', or \n     sending unsolicited and unwanted e-mail messages to the \n     persons who are registered with domain names. In addition, \n     this information has been used by ``cyber-squatters'' to \n     appropriate domain names for resale to the rightful owners. \n     Despite these misuses and abuses of the WHOIS database, this \n     information is valuable to marketers, news organizations, \n     governments, and intellectual property owners.\n       Personally identifiable information collected by domain \n     name registrars has privacy implications. For example, when \n     human rights organizations obtain a domain name to use the \n     Internet for political activities, disclosure of the required \n     mailing and contact information may be dangerous. The \n     importance of anonymity is amply demonstrated by the recent \n     example of people in Kosovo, who are using anonymous remail \n     services to try to maintain confidential communications and \n     avoid detection by Serbian forces. (See New York Times, at \n     C4, April 19, 1998). As one civil liberties organization has \n     said, ``Internet users should not have to sacrifice their \n     privacy and personal safety to exercise their right to free \n     speech and expression.''\n       The amendment seeks to balance these competing interests by \n     setting procedures for access to personally identifiable \n     information regarding domain name holders. The procedures \n     allow continued public access to information identifying the \n     service provider hosting the website of the subscriber or \n     customer, and are consistent with procedures adopted by the \n     Congress in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), P.L. \n     105-304, 112 STAT. 2883 (1998), which authorizes copyright \n     owners to obtain information identifying the operators of Web \n     sites or other Internet addresses engaged in possible \n     copyright infringements through use of an expedited subpoena \n     process. The DMCA provides that copyright owners ``may \n     request a clerk of any U.S. district court to issue a \n     subpoena to a service provider for identification of an \n     alleged infringer.'' 17 U.S.C. Sec.  512(h)(1).\n       Sec. 107. Reports Concerning Governmental Access to \n     Electronic Communications.--This section requires the \n     Attorney General to provide to Congress annual reports on the \n     number and nature of government interceptions of E-mail and \n     other electronic communications. To provide the appropriate \n     oversight, the Congress, other policy makers and the public \n     need information about government practices under the law. \n     While the wiretap provisions of Title III require detailed \n     reports by the courts and prosecutors on the number of \n     wiretap orders issued, there is no similar requirement for \n     collecting and publishing information on the nature and \n     extent of government access to E-mail and other electronic \n     communications under section 2703. Section 107 corrects this \n     deficiency by requiring the Attorney General to transmit to \n     Congress on an annual basis a report on the warrants, court \n     orders and subpoenas applied for and issued under section \n     2703.\n       Sec. 108. Roving Wiretaps.--This section amends subsection \n     (11)(b) of section 2518 of title 18, United States Code, \n     concerning the standard for issuance of a roving wiretap. \n     This standard was modified without debate or hearing in the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, P.L. \n     105-272, that passed in the final days of the 105th Congress, \n     to address the concern of the Department of Justice that the \n     prior standard for roving taps was too difficult to meet \n     because it required the government to demonstrate that the \n     subjective intent of the target was to avoid surveillance. \n     However, the modification eliminated virtually any standard \n     at all.\n       This section would amend the roving wiretap provision by \n     preserving the central rationale for roving taps: that they \n     are only appropriate where the subject is changing facilities \n     in a way that thwarts interception. As amended by this \n     section, (b)(i) does not require the government to prove \n     intent; it only requires the government to show effect. \n     Alternatively, under (b)(ii), the government can obtain a \n     roving tap where it can show the intent of the target, e.g., \n     where an associate of the target informs the government that \n     the target intends to evade surveillance by changing \n     facilities.\n       Sec. 109. Authority to Provide Customer Location \n     Information For Emergency Purposes.--This section amends \n     section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222) \n     to authorize telecommunications carriers to: (1) provide \n     call location information concerning the user of a \n     commercial mobile service to providers of emergency \n     services, to inform such user's legal guardian or family \n     members of the user's location in an emergency situation \n     involving the risk of death or serious bodily injury, or \n     to providers of information services to assist in the \n     delivery of emergency response services; and (2) transmit \n     automatic crash notification system information as part of \n     the operation of such a system. In addition, this \n     amendment requires the express prior customer \n     authorization of the use of either of the above \n     information for other than the stated purposes.\n       Finally, the amendment requires a telecommunications \n     carrier that provides telephone exchange service to provide \n     subscriber list information (including information on \n     unlisted subscribers) that is in its sole possession or \n     control to providers of emergency services and emergency \n     support services for use solely in delivering, or assisting \n     in delivering, emergency services.\n       This provision was included by Representative Markey (D-MA) \n     to the ``Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of \n     1999,'' H.R. 438, which passed the House on February 23, \n     1999.\n       Sec. 110. Confidentiality of Subscriber Information.--This \n     section amends section 2703(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, to protect the confidentiality of information provided \n     to and collected by electronic communication and remote \n     computing services about their subscribers. Under current \n     law, these service providers may disclose a record or other \n     information pertaining to a subscriber or customer to any \n     person other than a governmental entity.\n       By contrast, cable operators may not release to any person, \n     including the government, ``personally identifiable \n     information''\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n     about a customer'' without the prior written or electronic \n     consent of the subscriber concerned and shall take such \n     actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to \n     such information by a person other than the subscriber or \n     cable operator.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec.  551(c)(1). Similarly, \n     telecommunications carriers are generally barred from using, \n     disclosing or permitting access to individually identifiable \n     customer proprietary network information, such as the \n     services used and billing information, except ``with the \n     approval of the customer.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec.  222(c)(1). \n     Telecommunications carriers are now offering online and \n     Internet access services. In addition, digital convergence is \n     allowing cable operators to provide Internet services. These \n     developments only highlight the disparities in the privacy \n     regimes applicable to different providers.\n       This section would authorize providers of electronic \n     communication and remote computing services to disclose \n     records or information pertaining to their subscribers or \n     customers only if such disclosure is: (1) necessary in \n     connection with rendering services; (2) necessary to protect \n     the rights or property of the provider; (3) required by law; \n     (4) requested by the subscriber; or (5) if the provider has \n     provided the subscriber with the opportunity in a clear and \n     conspicuous manner, to prohibit such disclosure. In addition, \n     providers of electronic communication and remote computing \n     services are authorized to use aggregate subscriber \n     information from which individual subscriber identities have \n     been removed in any manner they wish.\n\n\n               TITLE II--PROMOTING THE USE OF ENCRYPTION\n\n       Sec. 201. Freedom To Use Encryption.\n       (a) No Domestic Encryption Controls.--The Act legislatively \n     confirms current practice in the United States that any \n     person in this country may lawfully use any encryption \n     method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length, \n     existence of key recovery or other plaintext access \n     capability, or implementation selected. Specifically, the Act \n     states the freedom of any person in the U.S., as well as U.S. \n     persons in a foreign country, to make, use, import, and \n     distribute any encryption product without regard to its \n     strength or the use of key recovery, subject to the other \n     provisions of the Act.\n       (b) Prohibition on Government-Compelled Key Escrow or Key \n     Recovery Encryption.--The Act prohibits any federal or state \n     agency from compelling the use of key recovery systems or \n     other plaintext access systems. Agencies may not set \n     standards, or condition approval or benefits, to compel use \n     of these systems. U.S. agencies may not require persons to \n     use particular key recovery products for interaction with the \n     government. These prohibitions do not apply to systems for \n     use solely for the internal operations and telecommunications \n     systems of a U.S. or a State government agency.\n       (c) Use of Encryption For Authentication or Integrity \n     Purposes.--The Act requires that the use of encryption \n     products shall be voluntary and that no federal or state \n     agency may link the use of encryption for authentication or \n     identity (such as through certificate authority and digital \n     signature systems) to the use of encryption for \n     confidentiality purposes. For example, conditioning receipt \n     of a digital certificate from a licensed certificate \n     authority on the use of key recovery would be prohibited.\n       Sec. 202. Purchase and Use of Encryption Products by the \n     Federal Government.--The Act authorizes agencies of the \n     United States to purchase encryption products for internal \n     governmental operations and telecommunications systems. To \n     ensure that secure electronic access to the Government is \n     available to persons outside of and not operating under \n     contract with Federal agencies, the Act requires that any key \n     recovery features in encryption products used by the \n     Government interoperate with commercial encryption \n     products.\n       Sec. 203. Law Enforcement Decryption Assistance.--The Act \n     adds a new chapter 124 to Title 18, Part I, governing the \n     procedures for governmental access, including by foreign \n     governments, to decryption assistance from third parties.\n       (a) In General.--New chapter 124 has four sections. This \n     chapter applies to wire or electronic communications and \n     communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  2510, and to stored electronic data. It proscribes \n     procedures for law enforcement to obtain assistance in \n     decrypting encrypted electronic mail messages, encrypted \n     telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile transmissions, \n     encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted file transfers \n     over the Internet that are lawfully intercepted pursuant to a \n     wiretap order, under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2518, or obtained \n     pursuant to lawful process, under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2703, and \n     encrypted information stored on computers that are seized \n     pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful process.\n       Sec.  2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the \n     new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2510. Definitions are provided for \n     ``decryption assistance'', ``decryption key'', ``encrypt; \n     encryption'', ``foreign government'' and ``official \n     request''.\n       Sec.  2802. Access to decryption assistance for \n     communications. In the United States today, decryption keys \n     and other decryption assistance held by third parties \n     constitute third party records and may be disclosed to a \n     governmental entity with a subpoena or an administrative \n     request, and without any notice to the owner of the encrypted \n     data. Such a low standard of access creates new problems in \n     the information age because encryption users rely heavily on \n     the integrity of keys to protect personal information or \n     sensitive trade secrets, even when those keys are placed in \n     the hands of trusted agents for recovery purposes.\n       Under new section 2802, in criminal investigations a third \n     party holding decryption keys or other decryption assistance \n     for wire or electronic communications may be required to \n     release such assistance pursuant to a court order, if the \n     court issuing the order finds that such assistance is needed \n     for the decryption of communications covered by the order. \n     Specifically, such an order for decryption assistance may be \n     issued upon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary \n     to decrypt communications or stored data lawfully intercepted \n     or seized. The standard for release of the key or provision \n     of decryption assistance is tied directly to the problem at \n     hand: the need to decrypt a message or information that the \n     government is otherwise authorized to intercept or obtain.\n       This will ensure that third parties holding decryption keys \n     or decryption information need respond to only one type of \n     compulsory process--a court order. Moreover, this Act will \n     set a single standard for law enforcement, removing any extra \n     burden on law enforcement to demonstrate, for example, \n     probable cause for two separate orders (i.e., for the \n     encrypted communications or information and for decryption \n     assistance) and possibly before two different judges (i.e., \n     the judge issuing the order for the encrypted communications \n     or information and the judge issuing the order to the third \n     party able to provide decryption assistance).\n       The Act reinforces the principle of minimization. The \n     decryption assistance provided is limited to the minimum \n     necessary to access the particular communications or \n     information specified by court order. Under some key recovery \n     schemes, release of a key holder's private key--rather than \n     an individual session key--might provide the ability to \n     decrypt every communication or stored file ever encrypted by \n     a particular key owner, or by every user in an entire \n     corporation, or by every user who was ever a customer of the \n     key holder. The Act protects against such over broad releases \n     of keys by requiring the court issuing the order to find that \n     the decryption assistance being sought is necessary. Private \n     keys may only be released if no other form of decryption \n     assistance is available.\n       Notice of the assistance given will be included as part of \n     the inventory provided to subjects of the interception \n     pursuant to current wiretap law standards.\n       For foreign intelligence investigations, new section 2802 \n     allows FISA orders to direct third-party holders to release \n     decryption assistance if the court finds the assistance is \n     needed to decrypt covered communications. Minimization is \n     also required, though no notice is provided to the target of \n     the investigation.\n       Under new section 2802, decryption assistance is only \n     required from third-parties (i.e., other than those whose \n     communications are the subject of interception), thereby \n     avoiding self-incrimination problems.\n       Finally, new section 2802 generally prohibits any person \n     from providing decryption assistance for another person's \n     communications to a governmental entity, except pursuant to \n     the orders described.\n       Sec.  2803. Access to decryption assistance for stored \n     electronic communications or records. New section 2803 \n     governs access to decryption assistance for stored electronic \n     communications and records.\n       As noted above, under current law third party decryption \n     assistance may be disclosed to a governmental entity with \n     a subpoena or even a mere request and without notice. This \n     standard is particularly problematic for stored encrypted \n     data, which may exist in insecure media but rely on \n     encryption to maintain security; in such cases easy access \n     to keys destroys the encryption security so heavily relied \n     upon.\n       Under new section 2803, third parties holding decryption \n     keys or other decryption assistance for stored electronic \n     communications may only release such assistance to a \n     governmental entity pursuant to (1) a state or federal \n     warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to be served \n     on the record owner at the same time the warrant is served on \n     the record holder; (2) a subpoena that must also be served on \n     the record owner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge \n     the subpoena; or (3) the consent of the record owner. This \n     standard closely mirrors the protection that would be \n     afforded to encryption keys that are actually kept in the \n     possession of those whose records were encrypted. In the \n     specific case of decryption assistance for communications \n     stored incident to transit (such as e-mail), notice may be \n     delayed under the standards laid out for delayed notice under \n     current law in section 2705(a)(2) of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       Sec.  2804. Foreign government access to decryption \n     assistance. New section 2804 creates standards for the U.S. \n     government to provide decryption assistance to foreign \n     governments. No law enforcement officer would be permitted to \n     release decryption keys to a foreign government, but only to \n     provide\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\n     decryption assistance in the form of producing plaintext. No \n     officer would be permitted to provide decryption assistance \n     except upon an order requested by the Attorney General or \n     designee. Such an order could require the production of \n     decryption keys or assistance to the Attorney General only if \n     the court finds that (1) the assistance is necessary to \n     decrypt data the foreign government is authorized to \n     intercept under foreign law; (2) the foreign country's laws \n     provide ``adequate protection against arbitrary interference \n     with respect to privacy rights''; and (3) the assistance is \n     sought for a criminal investigation of conduct that would \n     violate U.S. criminal law if committed in the United States.\n\n\n    TITLE III--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR LIBRARY AND BOOKSTORE RECORDS.\n\n       Sec. 301. Wrongful Disclosure of Library and Bookstore \n     Records.--The Act amends section 2710 of title 18, United \n     States Code, to extend the privacy protections currently in \n     place for video rental and sale records to library and book \n     sale records, whether the transactions take place on-line or \n     in a physical store.\n       Section 2710(a) is amended with definitions for the \n     following new terms: (1) ``book seller'' means any person \n     engaged in the business of selling books, magazines or other \n     printed material; (2) ``library'' means an institution which \n     operates as a public, university, college, or school library; \n     and (3) ``patron'' means a person who requests or receives \n     services within, or books or other materials on loan from, a \n     library.\n       Section 2710(b) is amended by applying the same privacy \n     safeguards that apply to video tape rental and sale records \n     to book sale records. As amended, a book seller who knowingly \n     discloses personally identifiable information about a \n     consumer of such seller is liable to an aggrieved person in a \n     civil action. A book seller is authorized to disclose such \n     information: (1) to the consumer; (2) with the informed, \n     written consent of the consumer; (3) to a law enforcement \n     agency pursuant to a warrant or a court order based upon \n     probable cause to believe a person is engaging in criminal \n     activity and the records sought are material to the \n     investigation of such activity; (4) to any person, if the \n     disclosure is limited to the names and addresses of consumers \n     and these consumers have been given the opportunity to \n     prohibit such disclosure, which does not identify the subject \n     matter of the material purchased or rented by the consumers; \n     (5) to any person, if the disclosure is incident to the \n     ordinary course of business; or (6) pursuant to a court order \n     in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need and \n     if the consumer is given reasonable notice and an opportunity \n     to appear and contest the claim of the person seeking \n     disclosure.\n       A new section 2710(c) is added to address privacy \n     protections for library records. This new subsection provides \n     that a library which knowingly discloses personally \n     identifiable information about a patron is liable to the \n     aggrieved person in a civil action. A library is authorized \n     to disclose such information: (1) to the patron; (2) with the \n     informed, written consent of the patron; (3) to a law \n     enforcement agency pursuant to a warrant or court order based \n     upon probable cause to believe a person is engaging in \n     criminal activity and the records sought are material to the \n     investigation of such activity; (4) to any person, if the \n     disclosure is limited to the names and addresses of patrons \n     and the patrons have been given the opportunity to prohibit \n     such disclosure, which does not identify the subject matter \n     of the library services used by the patrons; (5) to any \n     person, if the disclosure is necessary for the retrieval of \n     overdue materials or the recoupment of compensation for \n     damaged or lost library materials; or (6) pursuant to a court \n     order in a civil proceeding upon a showing of compelling need \n     and if the patron is given reasonable notice and an \n     opportunity to appear and contest the claim of the person \n     seeking disclosure.\n\n\n        TITLE IV--PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR SATELLITE HOME VIEWERS\n\n       Sec. 401. Privacy Protection for Subscribers of Satellite \n     Services for Private Home Viewing.--This section amends \n     section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934 (codified at 47 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  551), to extend the privacy protections \n     currently in place for subscribers of cable service to \n     subscribers of satellite home viewing services or other \n     services offered by cable or satellite carriers or \n     distributors.\n       In the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (``Cable \n     Act''), Congress established a nationwide standard for the \n     privacy protection of cable subscribers. (See H.R. Rep. No. \n     98-934, at 76, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4655, 4713). \n     Since the Cable Act was adopted, an entirely new form of \n     access to television has emerged--home satellite viewing--\n     which is especially popular in areas not served by cable. Yet \n     there is no statutory privacy protection for information \n     collected by home satellite viewing services about their \n     customers or subscribers. This title fills this gap by \n     amending the privacy provisions of the Cable Act to cover \n     home satellite viewing.\n       The amendments do not change the rules governing access to \n     cable subscriber information. Instead, they merely rewrite \n     section 631 to add the words ``satellite home viewing \n     service'' and ``satellite carrier or distributor'' where \n     appropriate.\n       The amendment does not address another inconsistency in the \n     law, which bears mentioning: should a cable company that \n     provides Internet services to its customers be subject to the \n     privacy safeguards in the Cable Act or in the Electronic \n     Communications Privacy (ECPA), which normally applies to \n     Internet service providers and contains obligations regarding \n     the disclosure of personally identifiable information to both \n     governmental and nongovernmental entities different from \n     those in the Cable Act? At least one court has noted the \n     ``statutory riddle raised by the entrance of cable operators \n     into the Internet services market,'' but declined ``to \n     resolve such ephemeral puzzles.'' In re Application of the \n     United States,--F.Supp.2d--, 1999 WL 74192 (D.Mass. Feb. 9, \n     1999).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 855. A bill to clarify the applicable standards of professional \nconduct for attorneys for the Government, and other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS ACT OF 1999\n\n       Mr. Leahy. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \n     legislation that would clarify the professional standards \n     that apply to federal prosecutors and identify who has the \n     authority to set those standards. These are two questions \n     that have cried out for answers for years, and created \n     enormous tension between the Justice Department and virtually \n     everyone else.\n       The Citizen's Protection Act, which is also known as the \n     ``McDade law,'' was passed last year to address these \n     important questions. This new law was intended to make clear \n     that a State -- not the Attorney General--has the authority \n     to make rules of conduct for attorneys practicing before \n     courts of that State. Rather than resolve the long-standing \n     tensions over this issue, the new law has only exacerbated \n     them. At a hearing before a Judiciary Subcommittee last \n     month, a number of law enforcement officials lined up to \n     criticize the new law.\n       The Justice Department aggressively but unsuccessfully \n     opposed passage of the McDade law last year in favor of \n     continued reliance on controversial Justice Department \n     regulations issued in 1994--regulations which allow contacts \n     with represented persons and parties in certain \n     circumstances, even if such contacts are at odds with state \n     or local ethics rules.\n       Independent Counsel. The debate over the professional \n     standards that apply to federal prosecutors comes at a time \n     of heightened public concern over the high-profile \n     investigations and prosecutions conducted by independent \n     counsels. Special prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Donald Smaltz \n     are the ``poster boys'' for unaccountable federal \n     prosecutors. They even have their own Web sites to promote \n     their work. By law, these special prosecutors are subject to \n     the ethical guidelines and policies of the Department of \n     Justice, and all of them claim to have conducted their \n     investigations and prosecutions in conformity with \n     Departmental policies. Yet, in practice, even the Department \n     has conceded in its March 1999 responses to my written \n     questions in connection with a July 1998 oversight hearing \n     that ``in general, the Department avoids commenting in any \n     way on how an independent counsel conducts his or her \n     investigation.''\n       I am not alone in my concerns about the tactics of these \n     special prosecutors and, specifically, requiring a mother to \n     testify about her daughter's intimate relationships, \n     requiring a bookstore to disclose all the books a person may \n     have purchased, and breaching the longstanding understanding \n     of the relationship of trust between the Secret Service and \n     those it protects. I was appalled to hear a federal \n     prosecutor excuse a flimsy prosecution by announcing after \n     the defendant's acquittal that just getting the indictment \n     was a great deterrent. Trophy watches and television talk \n     show puffery should not be the trappings of prosecutors.\n       One of the core complaints the Justice Department has \n     against the McDade law is that federal prosecutors would be \n     subject to restrictive State ethics rules regarding contacts \n     with represented persons. Yet a letter to The Washington Post \n     from the former Chairman of the ABA ethics committee pointed \n     out:\n       ``[Anti-contact rules are] designed to protect individuals \n     like Monica Lewinsky, who have hired counsel and are entitled \n     to have all contacts with law enforcement officials go \n     through their counsel. As Ms. Lewinsky learned, dealing \n     directly with law enforcement officials can be intimidating \n     and scary, despite the fact that those inquisitors later \n     claimed it was okay for her to leave at any time.''\n       The McDade Law. This is not to say that the McDade law is \n     the answer. This new law is not a model of clarity. It \n     subjects federal prosecutors to the ``State laws and rules'' \n     governing attorneys where the prosecutor engages in his or \n     her duties. A broad reading of this provision would seem to \n     turn the Supremacy Clause on its head. Does the reference to \n     ``State laws'' mean that federal prosecutors must comply with \n     state laws requiring the consent of all parties before a \n     conversation is recorded, or state laws restricting the use \n     of wiretaps? Furthermore, by referencing only the rules of \n     the state in which the prosecutor is practicing, does the new \n     law remove the traditional authority of a licensing state to \n     discipline a prosecutor in favor of the state in which the \n     prosecutor is\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n     practicing? The new law subjects federal prosecutors not only \n     to the laws and rules of the state in which the attorney is \n     practicing, but also to ``local Federal court rules.'' What \n     is a federal prosecutor supposed to do if the state rules and \n     local federal court rules conflict? Finally, the new law does \n     not address the possibility of a uniform federal rule or set \n     of rules governing attorney conduct in and before the federal \n     courts. Would this oversight inadvertently interfere with the \n     Supreme Court's existing authority to prescribe such rules \n     under the Rules Enabling Act?\n       These are all significant questions and the lack of clear \n     answers is a significant source of the concern expressed by \n     law enforcement over implementation of the McDade law.\n       S.250. At least one bill, the ``Federal Prosecutor Ethics \n     Act,'' S.250, has been introduced to repeal the McDade law. \n     This bill is a ``cure'' that could produce a whole new set of \n     problems.\n       First, this bill would grant the Attorney General broad \n     authority to issue regulations that would supersede any state \n     ethics rules to the extent ``that [it] is inconsistent with \n     Federal law or interferes with the effectuation of Federal \n     law or policy, including the investigation of violations of \n     federal law.'' I am skeptical about granting such broad \n     rulemaking authority to the Attorney General for carte \n     blanche self-regulation.\n       Moreover, any regulation the Attorney General may issue \n     would generate substantial litigation over whether it is \n     actually ``authorized''. For example, is a state rule \n     requiring prosecutors to disclose exculpatory information to \n     the grand jury ``inconsistent with'' federal law, \n     which permits but does not require prosecutors to make \n     such disclosures? More generally, must there be an actual \n     conflict between the state rule and federal law or policy? \n     Can the Attorney General create conflicts through \n     declarations and clarifications of ``Federal policy''? \n     Does a state rule ``interfere with'' the ``investigation \n     of violations of Federal law'' merely by restricting what \n     federal prosecutors may say or do, or is more required?\n       In addition to challenges concerning whether a Justice \n     Department regulation was actually authorized, violations of \n     the regulations would invite litigation over whether the \n     remedy is dismissal of the indictment, exclusion of evidence \n     or some other remedy.\n       Second, S.250 provides nine categories of ``prohibited \n     conduct'' by Justice Department employees, violations of \n     which may be punished by penalties established by the \n     Attorney General. These prohibitions were initially proposed \n     last year as a substitute for McDade's ten commandments, \n     which were extremely problematic and, in the end, not \n     enacted. With that fight already won, there is no useful \n     purpose to be served by singling out a handful of \n     ``prohibitions'' for special treatment, and it may create \n     confusion. For example, one of the commandments prohibits \n     Department of Justice employees from ``offer[ing] or \n     provid[ing] sexual activities to any government witness or \n     potential witness in exchange for or on account of his \n     testimony.'' Does this mean that it is okay for government \n     employees to provide sex for other reasons, say, in exchange \n     for assistance on an investigation? Of course not, but that \n     is the implication by including this unnecessary language.\n       Although the bill states that the nine ``commandments'' do \n     not establish any substantive rights for defendants and may \n     not be the basis for dismissing any charge or excluding \n     evidence, they would invite defense referrals to the \n     Department's Office of Professional Responsibility to punish \n     discovery or other violations, no matter how minimal. In \n     other words, these ``prohibitions'' and any regulations \n     issued thereunder could provide a forum other than the court \n     for a defendant to assert violations, particularly should \n     defense arguments fail in court. This could be vexatious and \n     harassing for federal prosecutors. The workload could also be \n     overwhelming for OPR, since these sorts of issues arise in \n     virtually every criminal case.\n       Two of the nine prohibitions are particularly problematic \n     because they undermine the Tenth Circuit's recent en banc \n     decision in United States v. Singleton that the federal \n     bribery statute, 18 U.S.C Sec.  201(c), does not apply to a \n     federal prosecutor functioning within the official scope of \n     his office. The court based its decision on the proposition \n     that the word ``whoever'' in Sec. 201(c)--``Whoever . . . \n     gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any person, \n     for or because of [his] testimony'' shall be guilty of a \n     crime--does not include the government. But the bill would \n     expressly prohibit Department employees from altering \n     evidence or attempting corruptly to influence a witness's \n     testimony ``in violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1503 or \n     1512]''--the obstruction of justice and witness tampering \n     statutes. These statutes use the same ``Whoever . . .'' \n     formulation as Sec. 201(c). By providing that government \n     attorneys are subject to Sec. Sec.  1503 and 1512, the bill \n     casts doubt on the Tenth Circuit's reasoning and may lead \n     other courts to conclude that Sec. 201(c) does, indeed, apply \n     to federal prosecutors, thereby reopening another can of \n     worms.\n       Third, S.250 establishes a Commission composed of seven \n     judges appointed by the Chief Justice to study whether there \n     are specific federal prosecutorial duties that are \n     ``incompatible'' with state ethics rules and to report back \n     in one year. The new Commission's report is not due until \n     nine months after the Attorney General is required to issue \n     regulations. Thus, to the extent that the Commission is \n     intended to legitimize the Attorney General's regulations \n     exempting federal prosecutors from certain state ethics rules \n     (by providing the record and basis for the exemption), its \n     purpose is defeated by the timing of its report. In addition, \n     the Commission's report must be submitted only to the \n     Attorney General, who is under no obligation to adopt or even \n     consider its recommendations in formulating her regulations.\n       For these reasons and others, S.250 is not the answer to \n     resolving the disputes over who sets the professional \n     standards for federal prosecutors and what those standards \n     should be.\n       Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of \n     1999. The question of what professional standards govern \n     federal prosecutors is only a small part of the broader \n     question of what professional standards govern federal \n     practitioners. The Justice Department has complained loudly \n     about the difficulty in multi-district investigations of \n     complying with the professional standards of more than one \n     state. Yet, private practitioners must do so all the time. No \n     area of local rulemaking has been more fragmented than the \n     overlapping state, federal, and local court rules governing \n     attorney conduct in federal courts.\n       The Judicial Conference of the United States has been \n     studying this problem for some time. I sent a letter last \n     month to the Chief Justice requesting information on when the \n     Judicial Conference was likely to forward its final \n     recommendations to Congress concerning rules governing \n     attorney conduct in federal court. The Chief Justice \n     responded:\n\n       The Judicial Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and \n     Procedure has appointed an ad hoc subcommittee composed of \n     two members each from the Advisory Committees on Appellate, \n     Bankruptcy, Civil, Criminal, and Evidence Rules to make \n     specific recommendations to their respective committees. The \n     subcommittee meets on May 4, 1999, and will meet again later \n     this summer in Washington, D.C. Consideration of any proposed \n     amendments would proceed in accordance with the Rules \n     Enabling Act rulemaking process. 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2071-\n     77. Under that process the subcommittee's recommendations are \n     expected to be considered by the respective advisory rules \n     committees at their fall 1999 meetings. The advisory \n     committees' recommendations will in turn be acted on by the \n     Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure at its January \n     2000 meeting. If amendments to the Federal Rules of Practice \n     and Procedure are approved, they would likely be published \n     for public comment in August 2000.\n\n       Any ethics legislation dealing with the particular problem \n     of federal prosecutors should be sensitive to the broader \n     issues and not foreclose reasonable solutions to these issues \n     on recommendation of the Judicial Conference.\n       Furthermore, while I respect this Attorney General and the \n     government attorneys at the Department of Justice, I am not \n     alone in my unease at granting the Department authority to \n     regulate the conduct of federal prosecutors in any area the \n     Attorney General may choose or whenever prosecutors confront \n     federal court or State ethics rules with which they disagree.\n       Therefore, the bill I introduce today would make clear \n     that, with respect to conduct in connection with any matter \n     in or before a federal court or grand jury, attorneys \n     employed by the federal Government are subject to the \n     professional standards established by the rules and decisions \n     of the relevant federal court. For other conduct, government \n     attorneys are subject to the professional standards \n     established by the States in which they are licensed to \n     practice. Beyond this, and consistent with the Rules Enabling \n     Act, this legislation would ask the Supreme Court to \n     prescribe a uniform national rule for government attorneys \n     relating to contacts with represented persons, taking into \n     consideration the special needs and interests of the United \n     States in investigating and prosecuting violations of Federal \n     criminal and civil law.\n       How would this bill work in practice? It would, for the \n     most part, simply codify existing practices and common-sense \n     choice-of-law principles patterned on Rule 8.5(b) of the \n     American Bar Association's (ABA) Model Rules of Professional \n     Conduct. Consider as an example the three stages of a federal \n     criminal prosecution. Under this legislation, a federal \n     prosecutor who is handling an indicted case before a federal \n     district court would be subject to the standards of attorney \n     conduct established by the rules and decisions of that \n     district court. A prosecutor who is conducting or preparing a \n     federal grand jury presentation would be subject to the \n     standards of the district court under whose authority the \n     grand jury was impanelled. In other circumstances, where no \n     court has clear supervisory authority over particular \n     conduct, a prosecutor would be subject to the standards of \n     the licensing State in which he or she principally practices.\n       Of course, every one of the 94 federal districts has its \n     own local rules and its own body of judicial decisions \n     interpreting those rules. Some districts have adopted their \n     state's ethics standards; some have adopted\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n     model standards developed by the ABA; some have taken other \n     approaches. As I mentioned, the Judicial Conference has been \n     studying this balkanization among federal court ethics \n     standards, and it may soon recommend changes. Nothing in this \n     bill would interfere with this process; rather, the bill \n     simply makes clear that, in most circumstances, government \n     attorneys are subject to local court rules and decisions, \n     whatever they may be.\n       Nor would anything in this bill disturb the traditional \n     authority of the state courts to discipline attorneys, \n     including government attorneys, who are licensed to practice \n     in their jurisdictions. The issue here is what standards \n     apply, not who gets to enforce them.\n       The bill also makes clear that the Department of Justice \n     does not have the authority it has long claimed to write its \n     own ethics rules. This authority properly belongs with the \n     federal courts, and that is where it would stay under this \n     legislation. With one exception, where there is a \n     demonstrated need for a uniform federal rule, the courts \n     would retain their current authority to prescribe rules of \n     professional conduct for the attorneys who practice before \n     them.\n       It has become clear, in recent years, that effective \n     federal law enforcement is impeded by the proliferation of \n     local rules, and the resulting uncertainty, in the area of \n     contacts with represented persons and parties. Rule 4.2 of \n     the ABA's Model Rules and analogous rules adopted by state \n     courts and bar associations place strict limits on when a \n     lawyer may communicate with a person he knows to be \n     represented by another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules \n     preserve fairness in the adversarial system and the integrity \n     of the attorney-client relationship by protecting parties, \n     potential parties and witnesses from lawyers who would \n     exploit the disparity in legal skill between attorneys and \n     lay people and damage the position of the represented person. \n     Courts have given a wide variety of interpretations to these \n     rules, however, creating uncertainty and confusion as to how \n     they apply in criminal cases and to government attorneys. For \n     example, courts have disagreed about whether these rules \n     apply to federal prosecutor contacts with represented persons \n     in non-custodial pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-\n     indictment situations, and in post-indictment situations \n     involving the same or different matters underlying the \n     charges.\n       We need to ensure that government attorneys can participate \n     in traditionally accepted investigative techniques without \n     undue fear of ethical sanctions arising from perceived \n     violations of the ``no contact'' rule. Absent clear statutory \n     authority to engage in communications with represented \n     persons--when necessary and under limited circumstances \n     carefully circumscribed by law--the government will be \n     significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute \n     federal offenses.\n       The ``no contact'' rule has been a focus of controversy, \n     study and debate for many years. Given the advanced stage of \n     dialogue among the interested parties--the federal and state \n     courts, the ABA, the Department of Justice, and others--I am \n     confident that a satisfactory uniform federal rule governing \n     contacts with represented persons by government attorneys can \n     be developed, through the Rules Enabling Act, within the time \n     frame established by this bill. Until then, government \n     attorneys would be well advised to seek court approval before \n     engaging in contacts with represented persons, at least in \n     jurisdictions where the relevant standards are uncertain.\n       The problems posed to federal law enforcement \n     investigations and prosecutions by the McDade law may be \n     real, but resolving those problems in a constructive and fair \n     manner will require thoughtfulness on all sides.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement, the bill, and the \nsectional summary of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Consistent with the Rules \n     Enabling Act, this legislation would further ask the Supreme \n     Court to prescribe a uniform national rule for Government \n     attorneys in an area that has created enormous tension \n     between the Justice Department and virtually everyone else--\n     contacts with represented persons and parties.\n       More specifically, this bill would substitute for the \n     ``McDade law''--enacted at the end of the last Congress as \n     part of the omnibus appropriations bill--a new 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 530B governing professional standards for Government \n     attorneys. The new section 530B consists of four subsections:\n       Subsection (a) defines the term ``attorney for the \n     Government'' in the same manner as it is defined in the \n     McDade law, by reference to existing Federal regulations. It \n     also provides simple definitions for the terms ``court'' and \n     ``State''.\n       Subsection (b) establishes a clear choice-of-law rule for \n     Government attorneys with respect to standards of \n     professional conduct. Modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the ABA Model \n     Rules of Professional Conduct, this subsection simply \n     codifies existing practice: for conduct in connection with \n     any matter in or before a court or grand jury, Government \n     attorneys are subject to the professional standards \n     established by the rules and decisions of the relevant court; \n     for all other conduct, Government attorneys are subject to \n     the professional standards established by rules and decisions \n     of the States in which they are licensed to practice.\n       Because this subsection addresses what standards apply, not \n     who gets to enforce them, nothing in this subsection would \n     disturb the traditional authority of the State courts to \n     discipline attorneys, including Government attorneys, who are \n     licensed to practice in their jurisdictions.\n       Subsection (c) directs the Judicial Conference of the \n     United States to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed \n     uniform national rule governing the conduct of Government \n     attorneys with respect to communications with represented \n     persons and parties. The Judicial Conference is directed to \n     take various law enforcement concerns into consideration when \n     crafting a proposed rule, and to complete its work within one \n     year.\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\n       Subsection (d) provides that nothing in the bill would \n     interfere with the Federal courts' existing authority, under \n     the Rules Enabling Act or any other provision of law, to \n     prescribe standards of attorney conduct for Federal \n     practitioners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 856. A bill to provide greater options for District of Columbia \nstudents in higher education; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\nexpanded options in higher education for district of columbia students \n                              act of 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing today--along \nwith Senators Hutchison and Warner--the ``Expanded Options in Higher \nEducation for District of Columbia Students Act of 1999.'' The purpose \nof this measure is to provide citizens of the District with a greater \nrange of options in pursuing postsecondary education by having the \nFederal government offer support that, in other areas of the country, \nis provided by State governments.\n  Our legislation takes a three-pronged approach toward meeting this \nobjective:\n  First, it offers a broader array of choices available to students who \nwish to attend public institutions of higher education by picking up \nthe difference in cost between in-state and out-of-state tuition for DC \nresidents who attend public postsecondary institutions in Maryland and \nVirginia.\n  Second, it provides additional support to the one public \npostsecondary education institution in the District, the University of \nthe District of Columbia (UDC), by authorizing funds for the \nstrengthening activities outlined in Part B of Title III of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  Third, it offers support to those students choosing to attend private \ninstitutions in the District and neighboring counties by providing \ngrants of up to $2,000 to help defray tuition costs.\n  With respect to public postsecondary education, students exploring \ntheir options find they have a more limited set of choices than any \nother group of students in the country. A student in any of the 50 \nstates who wishes to attend a public institution of higher education \nhas a number of institutions among which to choose. That student can \nbase his or her decision on considerations such as the size of the \ninstitution and the strengths of the various programs it offers. A \nstudent in the District of Columbia finds that only one public \ninstitution is available.\n  As a practical matter, the District cannot expand its boundaries, nor \ncan it establish a system of public higher education that can offer the \ndiversity of offerings available in the various states. Every State \nprovides support for higher education from which their residents \nbenefit through lower in-state tuition, while out-of-state residents \npay a premium to attend. I believe it is appropriate for the Federal \ngovernment to assume the role of the State, effectively pushing the \nboundaries to a point where District students are placed on an equal \nfooting in terms of the public education choices available to them.\n  The legislation also makes additional support available to the \nDistrict's public institution, UDC. Although UDC is a Historically \nBlack College and University (HBCU), it has been precluded from \nobtaining the support made available to other HBCUs under Part B of \nTitle III of the Higher Education Act. Part B funds are designed to \nenable institutions to strengthen their programs through activities \nsuch as acquisition of laboratory equipment, renovation \nand construction of instructional facilities, faculty exchanges, \nacademic instruction, purchase of educational materials, tutoring, \ncounseling, and student activities. The funds made available to UDC \nunder my legislation are to be used for activities authorized under \nPart B.\n\n  Finally, the legislation recognizes that many District residents \nchoose to attend one of the many private postsecondary institutions in \nthe DC area. Many of these institutions have made extraordinary efforts \nto enable District residents to succeed in their pursuit of advanced \neducation. A number of states have developed programs, such as the \nVirginia Tuition Assistance Grant (TAG), to assist students at private \ninstitutions in defraying costs. The program authorized in this bill is \nmodeled after these initiatives.\n  An investment in education is one of the most important investments \nwe as a society and we as individuals can make. There are boundless \nopportunities in the DC area for individuals with education and \ntraining beyond high school. DC residents should not be left behind in \nobtaining the capacity to take advantage of these opportunities.\n  There is a need at every level of the education system to improve the \nopportunities available to District students. Throughout my career in \nCongress, I have made support for education one of my top priorities, \nand I have regarded the education of DC students as being an important \ncomponent of my efforts.\n  The legislation we are introducing today complements not only those \nprograms such as ``Everybody Wins!'' and the Potomac Regional Education \nPartnership (PREP) with which I have been directly involved, but also \nthe many other initiatives undertaken by individuals and institutions \nwho work tirelessly to nurture the potential of the children of our \nNation's capital. Members of the business community have recently \nlaunched a program known as the D.C. College Access Program (DC-CAP) \nwhich will offer both financial support for students pursuing \npostsecondary education and assistance to high school students to \nassure they are prepared to tackle the challenges of higher learning.\n  I am encouraged by the positive response which I have received in \ndiscussing this concept and which has greeted similar legislation put \nforward by Representative Tom Davis. I look forward to working with all \nmy colleagues in advancing this proposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a summary of my legislation appear in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\nExpanded Options in Higher Education for District of Columbia Students \n                   Act of 1999--Summary of Provisions\n\n\n                 public institution tuition provisions\n\n       The Secretary of Education is authorized to make payments \n     to public institutions of higher education located in \n     Maryland and Virginia to cover the difference between in-\n     state and out-of-state tuition charged to residents of the \n     District of Columbia attending those institutions. The \n     legislation does not alter in any way the admissions policies \n     or standards of those institutions.\n       Students eligible to participate in the program include DC \n     residents who begin postsecondary study within 3 years of \n     high school graduation (excluding periods of service in the \n     military, Peace Corps, or national service programs) and who \n     are pursuing a recognized educational credential on at lease \n     a half-time basis.\n       Individuals who have already obtained an undergraduate \n     baccalaureate degree or whose family income exceeds the level \n     at which eligibility for the Hope Scholarship tax credit is \n     set are not eligible to participate.\n       The program will be administered by the Secretary of \n     Education, in consultation with the Mayor of the District of \n     Columbia. The Secretary is authorized to delegate the \n     administration of the program to another public or private \n     entity if he determines it would be more efficient to do so. \n     The Secretary will report annually to Congress regarding the \n     operation of the program.\n       Funding of $20 million in fiscal year 2000 and ``such sums \n     as may be necessary'' for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal \n     years are authorized for the program.\n\n\n                 University of the District of Columbia\n\n       Funding of $20 million in fiscal year 2000 and ``such sums \n     as may be necessary'' for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal \n     years authorized to enable UDC to carry out activities \n     authorized under Part B of Title III of the Higher Education \n     Act.\n\n\n                     Private Institution Provisions\n\n       The Secretary of Education is authorized to make awards of \n     up to $2,000 per academic year on behalf of students to help \n     defray tuition costs for attendance at private postsecondary \n     education institutions.\n       The student eligibility requirements are identical to those \n     provided for the public institution tuition program.\n       Private postsecondary education institutions which are \n     eligible to participate in the program include non-profit \n     institutions of higher education and degree-granting \n     proprietary institutions which are located in the District of \n     Columbia or in neighboring counties.\n       The program will be administered by the Secretary of \n     Education, in consultation with the Mayor of the District of \n     Columbia. The Secretary is authorized to delegate the \n     administration of the program to another public or private \n     entity if he determines it would be more efficient to do so.\n       Funding of $10 million in fiscal year 2000 and ``such sums \n     as may be necessary'' for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal \n     years are authorized for the program.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nof this important legislation offered by Senator James Jeffords, \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions. Through this proposal, we seek to significantly expand post-\nsecondary educational opportunities for high school graduates residing \nin the District of Columbia through the provision of financial aid to \ncompensate for non-resident tuition rates at colleges and universities \nin Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  This legislation is comparable in many ways to the highly innovative \nbill put forth in the House of Representatives by Congressman Tom Davis \nof the 11th Congressional District of Virginia. Mr. Davis' bill, H.R. \n974, is different in scope, with national rather than regional college \naccess, but our intent is the same. District of Columbia high school \nstudents need a broader horizon of more affordable public colleges and \nuniversities.\n  We would assist those students who have been admitted on the basis of \ntheir own academic achievement, and once admitted, as an example, to \nGeorge Mason University or James Madison University, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education would make funding available so that the \nstudent's net cost would be the same as that of an in-state resident. I \nwant to stress that these students would not receive preference in \nanyway in the admissions procedure.\n  I believe this is an exciting concept for the youth of the nation's \ncapital, and one which has already been embraced by a number of \nimportant local community figures who wish to further strengthen the \nprogram with private donations.\n  Mr. Davis' legislation is on a fast track in the House Government \nReform Committee, and I understand that our bill will be referred to \nthe Senate Committee on Government Affairs. I look forward to working \nwith our Senate Chairman Fred Thompson, our D.C. Subcommittee Chairman \nGeorge Voinovich, as well as D.C. Appropriations Chairman Kay Bailey \nHutchison as we work our way through the legislative process.\n  I believe if we can all keep our focus on the common goal of \nimproving college access for D.C. students, our local youth will turn \nup winners. I commend Senator Jeffords and Congressman Davis for their \nleadership in this endeavor, and I look forward to a healthy and \nproductive debate as we hammer out the final form of the \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Ashcroft, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Warner, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Collins, Mr. DeWine, and \n        Mr. McCain):\n  S.J. Res. 21. A joint resolution to designate September 29, 1999, as \n``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day''; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n           veterans of foreign wars of the United States day\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution honoring the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United \nStates.\n  This resolution designates September 29, 1999, as Veterans of Foreign \nWars of the United States Day, and urges the President to issue a \nproclamation in observance of this important day. September 29, 1999 \nmarks the centennial of the VFW. As veterans of the Spanish American \nWar and the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and the China Relief \nExpedition of 1900 returned home, they drew together in order to \npreserve the ties of comradeship forged in service to their country, \nforming what we know today as the VFW.\n  Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think \nabout the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made to \nsafeguard the democracy we cherish, especially those who made the \nultimate sacrifice. My resolution recognizes those contributions and \nsacrifices. It also recognizes the contributions that VFW members \ncontinue to make day-in and day-out in our communities--the youth \nactivities and scholarships programs, the Special Olympics, homeless \nassistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in \nneed, national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all \nAmericans, and others too numerous to mention. Over the last 100 years, \nmembers of the VFW have contributed greatly to our nation both in and \nout of uniform in many ways.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry. This is an opportunity to honor the men and women and their \nfamilies who have served this country with courage, honor and \ndistinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed \nthem, and this is a small token of our appreciation.\n  The centennial of the founding of the VFW presents all Americans with \nan opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the more than two million \nactive members of the VFW and to all veterans, as well as to the ideals \nfor which many made the ultimate sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in a strong show of support and an expression of appreciation \nfor the VFW and all veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with my colleague, \nthe Senator from Maine, Mrs. Snowe, in introducing a resolution \nhonoring the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States and \ncommemorating the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the VFW, by \ndeclaring September 29, 1999 as Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \nStates Day.\n  Since its inception after the Spanish-American War in 1899, the VFW \nhas dedicated itself and its members to improving twentieth century \nAmerica. The value of the contributions that members of the VFW and its \nLadies Auxiliary have made to their communities and to this nation \ncannot be overstated. After returning home from foreign service during \ntimes of war and armed conflict, these men and women have continued to \ngive of themselves to ensure that this nation protects and maintains \nthe democratic ideals upon which it was founded, and that the veterans \nand their dependents are cared for. From providing services for \nveterans and their families, to sponsoring community action and charity \nprojects, the VFW strengthens not only its members, but each and every \nAmerican as well.\n  On a personal note, I have had the unique pleasure of sharing the \nfloor of the United States Senate with several decorated veterans, as \nwell as enjoying the privilege of having several veterans of American \nconflicts on my own staff. I've also enjoyed the ongoing opportunity of \nmeeting and working with the very patriotic citizens of Delaware whom \nthis resolution honors. Throughout my entire tenure in the United \nStates Senate, the members of Delaware's VFW have been, for me, a \ncontinued source of knowledge, insight, and inspiration.\n  Particularly with the members of our armed forces currently serving \nin the Balkans in mind, whom I just visited, I offer my humble \nrecognition to all of those who have so bravely and selflessly served \nAmerica in the past. I sincerely trust that my colleagues will join me \nin acknowledging the courage, the sacrifice, and, frequently, the sheer \nbravery of our members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, whose \ncontributions to this country will be reaped for generations to come. I \nwant to both demonstrate and convey to them my profound gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url":

AND EXISTING CAMPUS-\n                           BASED AID PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program, \n     now known as the Pell Grant Program in honor of Senator \n     Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, was first authorized in the \n     1972 amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965;\n       Whereas the Pell Grant Program has become the largest need-\n     based Federal higher education scholarship program and is \n     considered the foundation for all Federal student aid;\n       Whereas the purpose of the program is to assist students \n     from low income families who would not otherwise be \n     financially able to attend a postsecondary institution by \n     providing grants to students to be used to pay the costs of \n     attending the postsecondary institution of their choice;\n       Whereas in the late 1970's, the Pell Grant covered seventy-\n     five percent of the average cost of attending a public four-\n     year college; by the late 1990's, it only covered thirty-six \n     percent of the cost of attending a public four-year college;\n       Whereas families across the country are concerned about the \n     rising cost of a college education, and for children from low \n     income families, the cost of college continues to be an \n     overwhelming factor in their decision to forego a college \n     education;\n       Whereas children from high income families are almost twice \n     as likely to enroll in college as children from low income \n     families;\n       Whereas higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals and economic competitiveness for our Nation;\n       Whereas the Pell Grant and Campus-Based Aid Programs target \n     aid to low income students as effectively as any programs \n     administered by the Federal government; and\n       Whereas student borrowing to finance a postsecondary \n     education has increased to an average indebtedness of $9,700, \n     and therefore increased grant aid is more important than \n     ever: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress and the President, should, \n     working within the constraints of the balanced budget \n     agreement, make student scholarship aid the highest priority \n     for higher education funding by increasing the maximum Pell \n     Grant awarded to low income students by $400 and increasing \n     other existing campus-based aid programs that serve low-\n     income students.\n\n  Ms. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, ``Education is a social process . . . \nEducation is growth . . . . Education is, not a preparation for life; \neducation is life itself.''\n  John Dewey, a distinguished Vermonter, philosopher and educator wrote \nthese words decades ago, yet they ring true today. Education provides \nus with opportunities to explore, to experience, to grow, and to \nimprove. Education is a great equalizer--it affords these positive \nopportunities to anyone who is able and interested in pursuing \nknowledge. Yet often times, young people in our country are discouraged \nfrom engaging themselves in learning because of financial hardship.\n  It is with these thoughts in mind that I rise today to submit this \nSenate Concurrent Resolution--a resolution that calls on the Congress \nand the President to increase funding for the Pell grant program and \nfor campus based student aid programs--programs that provide assistance \nto individuals with financial need to participate in higher education. \nI am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins, Kennedy, DeWine, Dodd, \nHutchinson, Harkin and Reed in this effort.\n  Last Congress we had a number of great successes in the area of \neducation. Passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 is high \non that list of important education bills that the Congress authored. \nWith bipartisan backing and unanimous support, the Senate adopted the \nconference report to accompany the Higher Education bill. It is my \nbelief that we achieved broad agreement on this bill because we all \nkept focused on the ultimate goal of crafting a bill that offered all \nour nation's students more opportunities to pursue post-secondary \nstudy.\n  And in fact, as a result of this legislation, the window of \nopportunity for students has been opened wider than ever before. The \nHigher Education Amendments of 1998 lowered the interest rate for new \nstudents to the lowest level they have been in 17 years. It \nstrengthened and improved grant aid and campus based programs. It will \nimprove the delivery of financial aid for all students through the \nnewly created performance based organization housed in the Department \nof Education. It invests in programs like TRIO and GEAR UP so that many \nmore of our nation's young people who aspire to getting a college \neducation will be able to pursue their dream. Finally, the bill \nreaffirms and strengthens the federal government's small but important \ncommitment to graduate studies and will provide important support for \nour nation's neediest graduate students.\n  In submitting this resolution today, we have taken another step \nforward in meeting the goals that we set out in the Higher Education \nAmendments of 1998. Our resolution follows the blueprint that was laid \nout during reauthorization. It follows up on the important work of \nSenator Collins who sponsored the Sense of the Senate amendment on Pell \ngrants, campus based aid and TRIO that was included in the final budget \nresolution.\n  As some of my colleagues may recall, in February I called for a $400 \nincrease in the maximum Pell grant. The importance of this program \ncannot be overstated--it is the cornerstone of our federal investment \nin need-based grant aid. It has helped millions of young people obtain \na degree. The Pell grant has made a positive difference in the lives of \nindividual students who received it and it had made a positive \ndifference in the well being of our nation. Thanks to the Pell grant, \nmore Americans have received a post secondary degree, the knowledge \nbase of our nation has been expanded and the earnings base of our \nnation has increased.\n\n  Our resolution also calls on Congress and the President to boost \nfunds for other programs that complement the Pell grant and provide \nneeded supplementary aid to our nation's neediest students. The campus \nbased programs are targeted to provide additional assistance to \nstudents who really need it the most. These funds often times make the \ndifference for a student between making it through school or dropping \nout. Therefore, our efforts today in support of these programs are \ncritical.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to work together, in a bi-partisan \nfashion,\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nas we did during consideration of the Higher Education Act and pass \nthis resolution. It is my hope that in adopting this resolution, it \nwill bring us one step closer to adopting higher levels of funding for \nthese important programs. In funding these programs at a higher level \nwe will be making the dream of college a reality for so many young \npeople. We will be helping motivated and engaged young people to \nachieve to the full level of their potential.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4058-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 81--DESIGNATING THE YEAR OF 1999 AS ``THE YEAR OF \n  SAFE DRINKING WATER'' AND COMMEMORATING THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                ENACTMENT OF THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, it is an unfortunate result of \ntoday's modern health care system that many health care providers face \nserious financial difficulties. Increasingly, these health care \nproviders are filing for the protection of the bankruptcy system. This \nreality was demonstrated recently in New Jersey where the parent \ncompany of the HIP Health Care Plan went bankrupt, leaving the plan's \n194,000 subscribers in health care limbo.\n  The bankruptcy system, for all of the benefits it provides to \ndebtors, creditors and the public, does little to protect patients of \ninsolvent health care providers. These patients have no choice when \ntheir provider files for bankruptcy, they are, quite literally, \ninnocent victims. In some cases such as the HIP HMO in New Jersey, \nstate insurance commissioners have stepped in to manage failing \nproviders. However, such steps will not always be possible,\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nand in those cases patients must have adequate protections. \nFurthermore, this bill applies not only to HMOs, but also to hospitals, \nnursing homes, and long term care providers.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked diligently to craft a fair \nbankruptcy bill that addresses the true problems of the bankruptcy \nsystem. We believe that the increasing frequency of health care \nbankruptcy and the problems it creates for patients is a serious \nproblem that deserves to be addressed in our bankruptcy reform effort.\n  Our bill would create several important patient protections. It would \nprovide for the appointment of an ombudsman to monitor and assure \ncontinued quality of the care being provided to patients. The bill \nwould set up procedures to ensure that the confidentiality of patient \nrecords is strictly maintained as a health care provider closes its \noperation.\n  Our legislation would also raise the priority in bankruptcy of the \ncosts associated with closing a health care business. Those cost are \noften incurred by state agencies, and thus the taxpayers. Finally, the \nbill would require a bankruptcy trustee to use best efforts to transfer \npatients to alternative providers when a health care business fails.\n  The reality of today's health care system is that there will \ninevitably be providers who fall upon financial difficulties and seek \nthe protection of the bankruptcy system. Given that reality, we must \ntake the steps today to ensure that the patients of these providers \nhave adequate protections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4064-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BILL McSWEENY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since coming to Washington, Marcelle \nand I have had an opportunity to meet very special people who have \nbecome special friends. Among those are Bill and Dorothy McSweeny.\n  A great regret I had was having to miss Bill's surprise 70th birthday \nparty recently, but it showed the genius of Dorothy that she was able \nto keep it a secret. That so many turned out shows a great respect for \nthis multi-faceted man--people across the political spectrum and \nincluding some of the best representatives of arts and entertainment. \nIt definitely reflected all of his background.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that an article in Monday, March 15th \nWashington Post be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 15, 1999]\n\nA Full-Blown Surprise for Bill McSweeny's Birthday, 70 Candles and 200 \n                                Friends\n\n                          (By Roxanne Roberts)\n\n       Some men think birthdays are depressing. Some think getting \n     older is preferable to the alternative, but nonetheless \n     annoying. Then there are the few, the happy few, who think \n     each birthday is a passport to wonderful new opportunities.\n       ``The great thing about being 70 is that you get to kiss \n     all the beautiful ladies,'' said. Bill McSweeny with only a \n     slightly wicked grin. ``When you're 70, you don't look \n     dangerous. Little do they know.''\n       The local businessman, arts advocate and community leader \n     was the guest of honor at a surprise party Friday night at \n     Ford's Theatre. What started out as a small gathering for \n     family ballooned into a celebration with more than 200 \n     friends and longtime fans. Everyone was sworn to not drop a \n     single, solitary hint--and judging by the look at McSweeny's \n     face when he walked into the theater, they succeeded.\n       ``Who said people couldn't keep secrets in Washington?'' \n     said his wife, Dorothy.\n       This was no small feat, considering the guest list included \n     the likes of Mayor Anthony Williams, former mayor Marion \n     Barry, Education Secretary Richard Riley, Dorothy Height, \n     Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West, comedian Mark Russell, \n     WJLA anchor Paul Berry, talk show host Diane Rehm, NASA \n     administrator Dan Goldin, media moguls Arnaud de Borchgrave \n     and Phil Merrill, and former FBI director Bill Sessions. The \n     crowd was full of prominent Washingtonians--LaSalle Leffall, \n     John Hechinger, Esther Coopersmith, Marshall Coyne, Peggy \n     Cafritz and Frankie Hewitt, to name a few--a testament to \n     McSweeny's lifelong involvement with his adopted home town.\n       ``I met him more than 40 years ago and we've been friends \n     ever since,'' said Height, the president emerita of the \n     National Council of Negro Women. ``He's so genuine. And in \n     addition to everything else, he's lots of fun.''\n       ``When you think about people who have done something for \n     the community, you think about Bill,'' said Leffall. ``He's \n     always been there.''\n       McSweeny, former president of Occidental International, has \n     spent most of his life trying to make Washington a better \n     place to live. He was crucial in reopening Ford's Theatre and \n     has served on the boards of the Kennedy Center, Folger \n     Shakespeare Theatre and Helen Hayes Awards. He's been a \n     longtime advocate for the D.C. schools, housing and inner-\n     city youth, and a key fundraiser for the Lombardi Cancer \n     Center and other charities.\n       ``Bill is a real inspiration for this city,'' Williams \n     said. ``I think he's a real role model for every American \n     citizen to contribute to Washington, D.C.''\n       ``I think Bill McSweeny is one of God's special people on \n     Earth,'' said Cora Masters Barry.\n       They like him. They really, really like him. So his wife \n     and friends wanted to do something special for his 70th \n     birthday this month.\n       Problem was that the birthday boy already had decided how \n     he was going to celebrate. McSweeny made a deal with his wife \n     to bring their four children and grandchildren down to Mexico \n     for two weeks. The official birthday is March 31, and he \n     planned to scuba-dive and have a nice, low-key party on the \n     beach.\n       So, naturally, his wife of more than three decades decided \n     that a huge bash was exactly what he needed.\n       Dorothy McSweeny proceeded to issue invitations, juggle a \n     thousand details, lie sweetly when her husband walked in on \n     telephone conversations and lure her unsuspecting spouse \n     to the theater with the help of pals Leon and Lynn Fuerth. \n     It was natural to go to Ford's, where McSweeny--a longtime \n     member of the board--thought he was going to see \n     ``Eleanor: An American Love Story,'' a musical based on \n     the marriage of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt.\n       The hardest part for the guests was remembering not to \n     blurt out something stupid in advance: ``When you see someone \n     an awful lot, it's hard not to let the cat out of the bag,'' \n     said Victor Shargai, who serves with McSweeny at the Kennedy \n     Center and Hayes awards.\n       The surprise worked, it seems, because the party took place \n     two weeks before his actual birth date. McSweeny walked in, \n     did a double take and slapped hand to forehead as his friends \n     sang a ragged rendition of ``Happy Birthday.'' There was much \n     hugging and kissing. Everyone looked terribly pleased, \n     probably because the surprise was not on them.\n       ``I love surprise parties--for others,'' said Leon Fuerth.\n       ``I want to choose the people who come to my birthday \n     party,'' said Diane Rehm.\n       ``It's about control,'' Rehm's husband, John, said \n     knowingly.\n       Luckily, McSweeny is one of those rare creatures who like \n     surprise parties. ``I think it's the most wonderful way of \n     all,'' he said. ``You don't have to worry about anything. \n     It's a very emotional thing to walk in and see all your \n     friends.''\n       In this case, he also got to see ``Eleanor''--any \n     resemblance to the current first lady is strictly \n     coincidental: Then the party moved downstairs to the Lincoln \n     Museum, where there were more hugs and kisses, a telegram \n     from Vice President Gore, a medal from the VA's West and a \n     presentation and testimonial by NASA's Goldin.\n       ``He helps people,'' Goldin said of McSweeny. ``In addition \n     to knowing people, he helps people.''\n       The menu consisted of McSweeny's favorite foods: hot dogs, \n     Boston baked beans, corn pudding and Black Forest cake. \n     McSweeny was having such a good time he kept inviting \n     everybody to his 100th birthday party.\n       No wonder they like him: This is an optimist, count-your-\n     blessings, look-to-the-future kind of guy. ``Hey, Bill!'' \n     shouted Mark Russell. ``Seven more years and you'll be old \n     enough to be an astronaut!''\n       Meanwhile, there are plenty of ladies to kiss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4064-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4064-S4065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RHODE ISLAND RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Rhode \nIsland Department of the Reserve Officers Association of the United \nStates (RIROA) on the 75th Anniversary of its founding.\n  The Reserve Officers Association was established in 1922 to link \ntogether Reserves from each of the armed services. The fighting force \nof the 21st century is a joint force, yet Rhode Island's Reserves \nimplemented this concept 75 years ago when the Army, Navy Reserve, and \nNational Guard joined together to form the RIROA.\n  The purpose of the Reserve Officers Association is to support a \nmilitary policy for the United States that will provide, promote, and \ndevelop the execution of adequate national security. The RIROA has \ndedicated itself to this purpose and to bringing all military services \ncloser in a common bond. The RIROA is a leading proponent of developing \nstrong Reserve forces in each of the uniformed services to work for the \nwelfare of citizen soldiers in Rhode Island and the interests of the \nnational security of the entire country.\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  The Reserves are essential members of the national security force, \nfacing greater challenges than ever before. Today's military is leaner, \nyet the number of missions has steadily increased. Therefore, the \nservices are relying more and more on reserve forces to carry out the \ntask of protecting the U.S. and its principles.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nCongressional Record an article which appears in the April 19, 1999, \nedition of Forbes magazine regarding Focus: HOPE, an extraordinary \norganization in Detroit, Michigan which is dedicated to human \ndevelopment.\n  The article follows.\n\n                      [From Forbes, Apr. 19, 1999]\n\n                          Teach A Man To Fish\n\n                          (By Srikumar S. Rao)\n\n       Eleanor Josaitis can remember the moment in March 1965 her \n     life changed. She was in her comfortable home in a Detroit \n     suburb watching a television program on the Nuremberg trials. \n     A news flash cut in: Selma, Ala. Mounted troopers, wielding \n     electric cattle prods, charged peaceful protesters. Minutes \n     earlier she was pondering what she would have done if she had \n     been in Nazi Germany. A new question intruded: ``What will I \n     do now?''\n       Two years later Detroit exploded in flames. Touring the \n     decimated area with Father William Cunningham, her weekend \n     parish priest, they swore to alleviate the suffering. But \n     what could be accomplished by a housewife with two young \n     children and a radical priest trained as an English \n     professor?\n       Quite a bit, actually. Focus: Hope, the nonprofit \n     organization they birthed in Detroit's rubble, today occupies \n     well over a million square feet on 40 acres of that once-\n     devastated area. It started with urgent but limited goals--\n     feeding poor mothers and their infants. Now it has grown into \n     a powerful and world-recognized job-training machine. An \n     education boot camp has lifted nearly 5,000 city residents to \n     high school equivalence and placed them in real jobs. A \n     machinist institute has trained 1,800 urban youngsters in \n     reading blueprints and operating numerically controlled \n     machine tools, and put them in high-paying positions with \n     outfits like GM, Ford and Chrysler. A Center for Advanced \n     Technologies has just started to churn out engineers with \n     bachelor's degrees. Next up: an information technology \n     center, funded by the likes of Microsoft and Cisco Systems, \n     to teach computer skills.\n       Josaitis, age 67, built Focus: Hope on the simple \n     proposition that many of the chronically underemployed yearn \n     for an opportunity to haul themselves into the middle class. \n     She says: ``We are failing our poorest citizens when we don't \n     provide them the means to break out of their poverty.''\n       What welfare official has not echoed precisely that \n     thought? The Focus: Hope difference is one of execution. \n     Josaitis runs the centers with businesslike efficiency and \n     sets demanding standards for the students. She coddles no \n     one: Use profane language after two warnings and you're out. \n     Steal something and you're out immediately. She believes that \n     discipline and responsibilitly are keys to improvement. \n     Rewards must be earned.\n       That philosophy has made Focus: Hope a landmark in Detroit. \n     It has attracted more than 50,000 Detroit-area volunteers, \n     including big names at the car companies, like Ford Chief \n     Executive Jacques Nasser. A sizable business itself, Focus: \n     Hope employs more than 800 people and has a budget of $68 \n     million, half from government, a third from contracts with \n     for-profit companies and the rest from private contributions.\n       That's eons away from the rather inauspicious beginnings. \n     To get closer to the problem, Eleanor and her husband, the \n     owner of a chain of hobby shops, sold their house and moved \n     into an integrated neighborhood in 1968. Her mother, alarmed \n     for their safety, even hired a lawyer to try to wrest custody \n     of her children away. Eleanor retained custody and bears no \n     animosity toward her mother.\n       She and Father Cunningham, who died of cancer in 1997, \n     began with food. Tapping federal funding, they launched a \n     tiny program to distribute food to pregnant women and small \n     children. It still does that, at last count for 46,000 people \n     a month (half the peak in 1991). The program succeeded so \n     well that it became a model for similar efforts in other \n     states. A food program for senior citizens followed.\n       But Josaitis and Father Cunningham wanted to turn the \n     recipients into productive jobholders. They browbeat and \n     cajoled federal agencies and private foundations to raise \n     $250,000 to start a job-training program. In 1981 they opened \n     the Machinist Training Institute to train Detroit's youths in \n     machining and metalworking, especially for the automobile \n     industry.\n       It's an intensive program that can last for 57 weeks if \n     students choose the entire curriculum. Students spend the \n     first 5 weeks, eight hours a day, learning blueprint reading \n     and some math and working the lathe. On the shop floor they \n     later learn to work with mills, grinders and computer-\n     controlled machine tools. In the classroom they learn more \n     about manufacturing theory and quite a bit about computer-\n     aided design and manufacturing.\n       In a more advanced program they work on commercial \n     production contracts for about $7 an hour in between doses of \n     classroom instruction.\n       Among the students who start the machinist school, 70% stay \n     to the end. For those that do, the job placement rate is \n     100%. ``We have placed our graduates in all sorts of machine \n     shops,'' says Josaitis. ``Some had never previously hired a \n     minority or a female.''\n       Josaitis has structured tuition to reflect her philosophy: \n     a helping hand--with strings attached. Tuition for mti is \n     $14,500. Government grants pay about half that, depending on \n     income. The balance is paid through a 5% loan from Focus: \n     Hope. Repayment begins 90 days after graduation--by which \n     time most students have jobs. A further incentive to land and \n     keep a job is that many employers, like General Motors, will \n     pick up half of the student's loan payments.\n       William Motts is one of the success stories. He dropped out \n     of high school in the 11th grade and got his girlfriend \n     pregnant at 18. He pulled in $6 an hour as a maintenance \n     worker at a hotel, struggling to help support his daughter.\n       But he caught a break. He was steered to mti by his \n     father's friend who knew Father Cunningham. He entered the \n     program in 1992 and never looked back. In 1998, he got a \n     bachelor's degree in manufacturing engineering from the \n     University of Detroit, Mercy. Today Motts, 25, is an engineer \n     at General Motors earning around $45,000, and married to a \n     dental hygienist.\n       ``Focus: Hope challenged me to push my boundaries,'' Motts \n     says. ``It forced me to be disciplined. It gave me very \n     marketable skills.''\n       Focus: Hope helps students surmount practical problems. For \n     examples, it runs a day care center and before- and after-\n     school programs, so parents can attend classes without worry.\n       Josaitis also doesn't want to discard potential candidates \n     who don't have the math, reading or social skills to succeed \n     in a program for machinists. So for the past ten years an \n     educational boot camp called Fast Track has taken students--\n     average age 26--with 8th grade math and reading skills and \n     brought them up two grade levels. And two years ago, \n     realizing some students needed even more help, she started \n     First Step, to offer more remedial works.\n       More than 80% of those who enter Fast Track finish the \n     program and go on the Machinist Training Institute. Thomas \n     Murphy, a former sergeant major for American troops in Europe \n     who runs Fast Track, can take some credit for that. He is \n     bluff, tough and good-natured. The seven-week Fast Track \n     program runs all day Monday through Friday, and Saturday \n     mornings.\n       ``Saturday classes serve clear notice that we expect real \n     hard work and commitment from them in return for the \n     opportunity we provide,'' Murphy says. Clock in at 8:01 and \n     you get a demerit. Enough demerits and you get booted out.\n       Murphy was initially shocked when a candidate asked him if \n     there was a place where he could nap during breaks. Turned \n     out that he left the institute at 4 p.m., worked an eight-\n     hour shift at a job to support his family and was back at 8 \n     a.m. the next day. Murphy found him a place to nap and \n     overlooked occasional tardiness.\n       ``One of our graduates called me up the other day to \n     announce that he was missing his first day of work in \n     years,'' says Murphy. ``He was closing on a brand new home. \n     His home. The first home anyone in his family had ever \n     owned.''\n       Josaitis also understands that getting and holding a job \n     requires certain social skills. Thus trainees are taught how \n     to shake hands, make eye contact and absolutely, positively \n     get to jobs on time.\n       Every month Josaitis brings a group of students to a \n     formally laid out dining room where she teaches table \n     manners, from which fork to use to how to make small talk. \n     ``I want you to feel comfortable when you are invited to the \n     White House,'' she tells them. She also takes trainees to \n     formal affairs, such as the opening of the Michigan Opera \n     hosted by Ford's Nasser.\n       In 1993 Focus: Hope decided to offer its best and brightest \n     students a further step up the ladder. It opened the Center \n     for Advanced Technologies, which, in collaboration with local \n     colleges, offers bachelor and associate degrees in \n     manufacturing engineering and technology. The executive dean \n     is Lloyd\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n     Reuss, who took the nonpaying job after he was ousted as \n     president of General Motors in 1993.\n       CAT students get classroom instruction plus work in a for-\n     profit manufacturing company located on Focus: Hope grounds. \n     Using next-generation equipment from Cincinnati Milacron, \n     says Reuss, students produce machined parts for outfits \n     including GM, Ford and the Department of Defense. Students \n     accept a below-market $8 an hour on these contracts. In \n     return, they get free tuition.\n       The hands-on part of this apprenticeship is as important as \n     the classroom instruction. Denise Ankofski, candidate for an \n     associate degree and single mother of a 6-year-old son, was \n     milling brake shoes for 5-ton trucks on a defense contract \n     and figured she could do it better by splitting operations \n     and performing them on different machines. She was encouraged \n     to give a technical presentation and her suggestion reduced \n     cycle time on some operations by 80%.\n       When they graduate, CAT students do extremely well. Last \n     year the six CAT bachelor graduates were paid an average of \n     $47,200, compared with the $45,300 earned by Massachusetts \n     Institute of Technology mechanical engineering graduates. \n     ``Graduates are not hired for diversity reasons or charity,'' \n     says Reuss. ``They are hired because they are skilled workers \n     with an excellent ethic.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4066-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY POLLOCK, OF BEDFORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, today, as a part of the celebration of \nEarth Week, I join with my other colleagues who have come to the floor \ncalling for a renewal of this body's longstanding bipartisan commitment \nto the Nation's environment. I am doing so because, following the 29th \nEarth Day celebration tomorrow, the Nation and the 106th Congress will \nbegin planning to commemorate three decades of Earth Days this time \nnext year.\n  We need to begin now to shape and bring forward a positive \nenvironmental agenda which will earn the support of both political \nparties so that when the 30th Earth Day arrives, our actions to protect \nthe environment will not be viewed as falling short of the mark.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I wrote to the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader with suggestions of legislative areas where I \nbelieve significant opportunities actually exist for bipartisan \ncooperation. Among the areas I highlighted was the environment; \nspecifically, the protection of public lands, such as passing \ncomprehensive natural resources funding legislation which would allow \nthe States and the Federal Government to\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\nprotect our land resources, designating new wilderness areas on our \npublic lands, and reforming environmentally harmful subsidies that \ndamage our lands and also hurt the American taxpayer.\n  I also think opportunities exist to try to work together to \nreauthorize several of our major environmental protection laws, such as \nSuperfund, the Clean Water and Air Acts, and the Endangered Species \nAct. We have struggled with the reauthorization of these laws for \nseveral Congresses, and the time has come to look for ways to break the \nimpasse on these very important issues.\n  We have also struggled, frankly, with getting more Senators involved \nin environmental issues as well. Several of my colleagues have remarked \nthat with the retirement last Congress of our colleague from Arkansas, \nMr. Bumpers, we on the Democratic side of the aisle find ourselves \nhaving lost a consistent and persistent champion of the environment. \nFortunately, we still have wonderful leaders, and I have been pleased \nto support the efforts of my Democratic colleagues, such as the Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, and many others of my colleagues who have stepped forward to \ntake up these issues. But, frankly, Mr. President, none of us can do \nthis alone.\n  Not only are environmental issues by their nature complicated and \ntechnical, but they are critically important to the American people who \noverwhelmingly support environmental protection. We need Senators from \nboth parties to take up these issues and move them forward, and we are \nhaving some bipartisan successes on environmental issues where Members \nare working together.\n  For example, I will have the pleasure later this week of joining with \nmy colleague, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, in being an original \ncosponsor of legislation to designate the coastal plain of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge as a wilderness area. I have had the \nopportunity to be a cosponsor of this legislation since I joined the \nSenate in 1993.\n  In addition, this week I was delighted when the junior Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, decided to join me as a cosponsor of legislation I \nintroduced to eliminate the percentage depletion allowance tax subsidy \nfor mining on public lands subject to the 1872 mining law.\n\n  Mr. President, part of the legacy of Earth Day is a commitment to \nbipartisanship, and a review of the history reveals that fact.\n  For me, celebrations of Earth Day are always intertwined with \nthoughts of the day's founder, former Senator Gaylord Nelson from my \nhome State of Wisconsin. I am extremely proud to hold the Senate seat \nhe held with distinction from 1963 to 1981. Not only did Senator Nelson \nhelp to set aside a day for the Nation to think and learn more about \nthe environment, he acted by using the power of his office to work with \ncolleagues to protect the environment.\n  Senator Nelson was a two-term Governor. During his gubernatorial \ntenure, the environment became a priority for the State of Wisconsin \nwith the creation of the State's stewardship program, one of the \nimportant models for the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nputting Wisconsin far ahead in recreational opportunities for the \ngeneral public.\n  During his 18 years in the Senate, he saw, as he is still quick to \nremind me, great proenvironmental change under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. The Senate created the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, passed the majority of our Federal \nenvironmental statutes with significant bipartisan support, and created \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. Senator Nelson himself was the \nauthor of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which passed the Senate by a \nvote of 84-0. He was also the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands \nNational Lakeshore Act, one of northern Wisconsin's most beautiful \nareas, at which I spend a portion of my vacation time with my family \nevery year.\n  I am now the author of legislation to provide some improvements to \nApostle Islands and to review these lands for their wilderness \npotential. In his 1969 book on the environment entitled ``America's \nLast Chance,'' Senator Nelson issued a political challenge which I find \nrelevant today. He said:\n\n       The number one domestic problem facing this country is the \n     threatened destruction of our natural resources and the \n     disaster which would confront mankind should such destruction \n     occur. There is a real question as to whether the nation, \n     which has spent some two hundred years developing an \n     intricate system of local, State and Federal Government to \n     deal with the public's problems, will be bold, imaginative \n     and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.\n\n  I believe Senator Nelson meant two things by his challenge. Not only \ndid he mean that government must act immediately and decisively to \nprotect resources in crisis, but he also meant that politicians must \nmaintain that commitment over the long term. A renewal of this body's \ncommitment to work together to protect the environment, fully \nrespecting the commitment former Members of the Senate have made to us \nby placing us in the position of being vigilant stewards of Federal \nenvironmental laws, is an appropriate way on the eve of Earth Day to \ncelebrate the true nature of ecological stewardship.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to be committed to that endeavor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/21/senate-section/article/S4068-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
